## Question

How do you approach peripheral arterial disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach peripheral arterial disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PAD and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including screening and confirmation. Next, I will classify disease severity and stage the limb. After that, I need to outline universal medical therapy for all patients. Then, I will tailor management by symptom class, including asymptomatic, claudication, CLI, and acute limb ischemia. I should also consider special populations, integrate revascularization decision-making, and close with longitudinal follow-up and quality metrics, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why PAD matters clinically. PAD is atherosclerotic disease of the lower-extremity arteries and is a systemic marker of atherosclerosis with markedly elevated risks of MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death; it affects over 230 million adults worldwide and remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion in at-risk patients [^239a5bef] [^06c8c9ca].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach next. Screening with resting ABI is reasonable in asymptomatic patients at increased risk, and an ABI less than 0.90 confirms PAD; if the resting ABI is normal but suspicion remains high, exercise ABI or toe pressures can unmask disease; duplex ultrasound is first-line for anatomic mapping when revascularization is planned, while CTA or MRA are alternatives when noninvasive imaging is insufficient or contraindicated; invasive angiography is reserved for when revascularization is imminent, and I should avoid anatomic imaging in truly asymptomatic patients because it won't change management and carries risk [^96132f86] [^630f889a] [^df974bd8] [^b96ff5cc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity without a structured classification. I should stage disease by symptom class (asymptomatic, claudication, CLI with rest pain or tissue loss) and use the SVS WIfI scheme for CLI to integrate wound, ischemia, and foot infection, because WIfI predicts amputation risk and guides urgency and modality of revascularization; I also need to distinguish acute limb ischemia categories I–III to triage emergent versus urgent intervention [^0bb79a63] [^431ab9bf].

> Next, I should review universal medical therapy for all PAD patients, regardless of symptoms. High-intensity statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy (generally low-dose aspirin, with consideration of dual pathway inhibition in select high-risk patients), strict blood pressure control with ACE inhibitor or ARB as first-line when hypertensive, comprehensive diabetes management with individualized HbA1c targets, and smoking cessation with behavioral support and pharmacotherapy are foundational; supervised exercise therapy is a Class I recommendation for symptomatic patients and should be offered broadly when feasible [^d8c023fa] [^d391bee1] [^17399143] [^fbb1b4ff] [^c614b563].

> Wait, let me verify the approach to asymptomatic PAD. Even without leg symptoms, cardiovascular risk is high, so I should reinforce risk factor modification and antithrombotic therapy as indicated; I should avoid routine anatomic imaging because it does not improve outcomes, and I should consider aspirin in asymptomatic PAD with diabetes after discussing bleeding risk, aligning with ESC 2024 guidance [^df974bd8] [^618ebe83].

> For intermittent claudication, I should confirm that structured exercise therapy is first-line and often comparable or superior to intervention for functional gain; if symptoms remain lifestyle-limiting despite guideline-directed medical therapy and exercise, revascularization is reasonable, with endovascular therapy generally favored for aortoiliac disease and selected femoropopliteal lesions, while surgical bypass is preferred for long-segment disease, common femoral involvement, or when endovascular durability is limited; I need to ensure shared decision-making covers durability, restenosis risk, and patient goals [^fd720252] [^98d4add3] [^f32f58e0].

> For critical limb ischemia, I should double-check that urgent revascularization is the cornerstone to prevent amputation, with endovascular-first strategies common but open surgery favored for common femoral disease, long-segment tibial disease with good vein conduit, or prior endovascular failure; wound care must be integrated with debridement, infection control, and pressure offloading, and I should consider adjuncts such as hyperbaric oxygen or spinal cord stimulation in select nonhealing cases; I need to act quickly because delays increase amputation risk [^bd3b9116] [^0bb79a63] [^597d639a] [^592d115d] [^cbdb0daf].

> But wait, what if the presentation is acute limb ischemia? I should confirm that time-sensitive revascularization is mandatory, categorize severity (I viable, IIa marginally threatened, IIb immediately threatened, III irreversible), and proceed with catheter-directed thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy/bypass within hours, recognizing that Category IIb limbs require emergent intervention to salvage tissue [^431ab9bf] [^5d748ebb].

> I will now examine special populations where I need to adapt standard approaches. In diabetes, PAD is more aggressive and often silent, so I should maintain a lower threshold for ABI screening, intensify risk factor control, and coordinate with endocrinology; in ESRD, outcomes are worse and both open and endovascular revascularization can be considered with careful selection; in older adults, frailty and cognitive impairment complicate decisions, so I should individualize and align with goals of care; in women and underrepresented minorities, disparities in access and outcomes persist, so I must proactively address bias and barriers to equitable care [^aa0f32eb] [^99042b3d] [^876c6d87] [^617b9520].

> Hold on, I should verify how to integrate revascularization decisions with medical therapy rather than replace it. Even after successful revascularization, continuation of high-intensity statin, antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, smoking cessation, and structured exercise is essential to maintain patency and reduce cardiovascular events; I need to ensure patients understand that medical therapy is lifelong and that surveillance for restenosis and wound healing is part of standard care [^813fe2fd] [^d4f77006].

> Next, I should review longitudinal follow-up and quality metrics. PAD is a chronic disease requiring periodic clinical assessment, reinforcement of risk factor control, medication adherence checks, and functional monitoring; surveillance after intervention should track symptoms, pulses, and duplex when indicated; I should also track process and outcome quality measures such as statin and antiplatelet use, supervised exercise referral, smoking cessation support, time-to-revascularization for CLI, and amputation-free survival to close care gaps [^c2dea167] [^d4f77006] [^239a5bef].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Screen at-risk patients with ABI, confirm PAD, stage severity, initiate universal medical therapy and supervised exercise when appropriate, escalate to revascularization for persistent claudication or CLI using an anatomy-guided strategy, manage acute limb ischemia emergently, tailor care for special populations, and embed lifelong risk reduction and surveillance with shared decision-making throughout; this stepwise approach aligns with contemporary ACC/AHA, SVS, and ESC guidance and emphasizes that medical therapy remains the foundation across all stages [^d8c023fa] [^fd720252] [^d391bee1].

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is best approached as **systemic atherosclerosis with limb manifestations** [^bb0b3a4a], so management must prioritize cardiovascular risk reduction while addressing limb symptoms. Start with **ABI screening** in at-risk patients [^96132f86], confirm with duplex ultrasound [^notfound], and stage disease by symptoms and perfusion [^2f9f35d7]. For all patients, implement high-intensity statin therapy, antiplatelet therapy, strict blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and supervised exercise [^d8c023fa] [^c614b563]. Reserve revascularization for **lifestyle-limiting claudication despite medical therapy** [^98d4add3] or for **critical limb ischemia** [^bd3b9116], choosing endovascular therapy for focal disease and surgery for long-segment or multilevel disease [^f32f58e0]. Monitor long-term with periodic clinical review, ABI, and risk-factor optimization to prevent progression and adverse events [^d4f77006].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

PAD spans **asymptomatic disease to critical limb ischemia (CLI)** [^2f9f35d7]; many patients are asymptomatic or have atypical symptoms, so clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion [^91ff8421].

- **Symptoms**: Intermittent claudication, rest pain, non-healing ulcers, gangrene [^a6594050].
- **Signs**: Diminished pulses, bruits, pallor, delayed capillary refill, cool skin, hair loss, thickened nails [^notfound].
- **Screening**: ABI is the first-line test; ABI < 0.90 confirms PAD [^630f889a] [^b4d73520].
- **Confirmatory testing**: Duplex ultrasound for anatomic assessment; CTA/MRA or invasive angiography if revascularization is planned [^b96ff5cc] [^20101354].

---

## Risk factor modification and medical management

Medical therapy is the cornerstone of PAD care, aiming to **reduce cardiovascular events and improve symptoms** [^d9053055].

| **Risk factor** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Smoking | - Strongly recommend cessation <br/> - Counseling and pharmacotherapy [^52640029] |
| Hypertension | - Target < 130/80 mmHg <br/> - ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred [^d391bee1] [^7f6b746c] |
| Hyperlipidemia | - High-intensity statins (LDL-C < 70 mg/dL) [^d8c023fa] |
| Diabetes | - Individualized HbA1c targets <br/> - Metformin first-line [^17399143] |
| Antiplatelet therapy | - Aspirin 75–325 mg daily <br/> - Clopidogrel 75 mg daily if aspirin intolerant [^notfound] |
| Exercise | - Supervised exercise therapy (SET) for claudication [^c614b563] |

## Indications for revascularization

Revascularization is indicated for **lifestyle-limiting claudication despite optimal medical therapy** [^98d4add3] or for **CLI** (rest pain or tissue loss) [^bd3b9116]. The choice between endovascular and surgical revascularization depends on patient comorbidities, lesion anatomy, and expected durability [^0bb79a63].

- **Endovascular therapy**: Preferred for focal lesions, aortoiliac disease, and high surgical risk patients [^f32f58e0].
- **Surgical revascularization**: Preferred for long-segment disease, multilevel disease, or failed endovascular procedures [^0bb79a63].
- **Acute limb ischemia**: Emergency revascularization within 6–24 hours [^5d748ebb].

---

## Post-revascularization care and follow-up

Post-revascularization care emphasizes **surveillance and risk-factor control** to maintain patency and prevent recurrence [^c2dea167].

- **Antiplatelet therapy**: Continue aspirin; consider dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 1–3 months after endovascular intervention [^notfound].
- **Surveillance**: Regular clinical review, ABI measurements, and duplex ultrasound to detect restenosis [^591cfd7e].
- **Risk factor management**: Ongoing optimization of blood pressure, lipids, diabetes, and smoking cessation [^d4f77006].

---

## Special considerations

- **Diabetes**: PAD progresses more rapidly; aggressive risk factor control and early revascularization for CLI are critical [^aa0f32eb].
- **Renal disease**: Increased risk of contrast nephropathy; minimize contrast use and consider alternative imaging [^df974bd8].
- **Elderly**: Frailty and comorbidities influence revascularization choice; individualized decision-making is essential [^876c6d87].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Drug-coated balloons and stents**: Improved patency rates in femoropopliteal disease [^ece91305].
- **Stem cell therapy**: Under investigation for no-option CLI patients [^67921b44].
- **Telemedicine**: Expanding access to supervised exercise programs and follow-up care [^notfound].

---

A structured approach to PAD — screening, risk-factor modification, medical therapy, and selective revascularization — **improves outcomes and quality of life**. Lifelong surveillance and patient education are essential to prevent progression and complications [^d4f77006].

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^8243c9b6]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Preamble

Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care.

In response to reports from the Institute of Medicine, and a mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) modified its methodology. – The relationships among guidelines, data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere.

Intended Use

Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Each guideline is considered current until it is updated, revised, or superseded by published addenda, statements of clarification, focused updates, or revised full-text guidelines. To ensure that guidelines remain current, new data are reviewed biannually to determine whether recommendations should be modified. In general, full revisions are posted in 5-year cycles. –

Modernization

Processes have evolved to support the evolution of guidelines as "living documents" that can be dynamically updated. This process delineates a recommendation to address a specific clinical question, followed by concise text (ideally < 250 words) and hyperlinked to supportive evidence. This approach accommodates time constraints on busy clinicians and facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving technology.

Evidence Review

Writing committee members review the literature; weigh the quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimate expected health outcomes. In developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data. – Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited.

The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, independent Evidence Review Committees (ERCs) that include methodologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians who systematically survey, abstract, and assess the evidence to address systematic review questions posed in the PICOTS format (P = population, I = intervention, C = comparator, O = outcome, T = timing, S = setting).– Practical considerations, including time and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to evidence that is relevant to key clinical questions and lends itself to systematic review and analysis that could affect the strength of corresponding recommendations.

Guideline-Directed Management and Treatment

The term "guideline-directed management and therapy" (GDMT) refers to care defined mainly by ACC/AHA Class I recommendations. For these and all recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States.

Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence

The Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, the strength of the recommendation) encompasses the anticipated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1). – Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are sequenced by COR and then by LOE. Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. When > 1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and no comparative data are available, options are listed alphabetically.

Relationships With Industry and Other Entities

The ACC and AHA sponsor the guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time. The Task Force zealously avoids actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All writing committee members and reviewers are required to disclose current industry relationships or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced writing committee and assuring that the chair and a majority of committee members have no relevant RWI (Appendix 1). Members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. For transparency, members' comprehensive disclosure information is available online. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online.

The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators.

Individualizing Care in Patients With Associated Conditions and Comorbidities

Managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex, especially when recommendations applicable to coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting. The guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances. The recommendations should not replace clinical judgment.

Clinical Implementation

Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities. Consequently, circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.

### Surgical intervention for peripheral arterial disease [^51bea40c]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is increasing worldwide, with recent global estimates exceeding 200 million people. Advanced PAD leads to a decline in ambulatory function and diminished quality of life. In its most severe form, critical limb ischemia, rest pain, and tissue necrosis are associated with high rates of limb loss, morbidity, and mortality. Revascularization of the limb plays a central role in the management of symptomatic PAD. Concomitant with advances in the pathogenesis, genetics, and medical management of PAD during the last 20 years, there has been an ongoing evolution of revascularization options. The increasing application of endovascular techniques has resulted in dramatic changes in practice patterns and has refocused the question of which patients should be offered surgical revascularization. Nonetheless, surgical therapy remains a cornerstone of management for advanced PAD, providing versatile and durable solutions to challenging patterns of disease. Although there is little high-quality comparative effectiveness data to guide patient selection, existing evidence suggests that outcomes are dependent on definable patient factors such as distribution of disease, status of the limb, comorbid conditions, and conduit availability. As it stands, surgical revascularization remains the standard against which emerging percutaneous techniques are compared. This review summarizes the principles of surgical revascularization, patient selection, and expected outcomes, while highlighting areas in need of further research and technological advancement.

### Medical management in peripheral arterial disease: a systematic approach to medical therapy [^01d73cba]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2005 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) emphasize the importance of cardiovascular risk reduction in all patients with PAD as a result of the high likelihood of coexisting atherosclerotic disease of the peripheral, coronary, and cerebral circulations. The guidelines outline the clear and definite role for antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and antihypertensive drugs as well as adequate diabetic control. All practicing interventional radiologists should be familiar with these practical and useful guidelines, as well as the rationale for use of each of these medications.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^bb0b3a4a]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) typically refers to atherosclerotic narrowing and/or occlusion of all arterial disease other than coronary arteries and the aorta (carotid and vertebral arteries, coeliac and mesenteric arteries, renal arteries and upper and lower limb arteries) (figure 1). As a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, PAD is associated with greatly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and impairment in quality of life. Because of the frequent overlap between ischaemic heart disease and PAD, cardiologists are in a unique position to screen, diagnose and treat PAD. The body of clinical evidence in patients with PAD is not as robust as the evidence in patients with heart disease, however the treatment goals are similar for both coronary artery disease (CAD) and PAD: to prevent ischaemic outcomes with lifestyle changes and medical therapy and to weigh the risks and benefits of revascularisation (Table 1). This article reviews the basic evaluation and management of the most common types of PAD from a cardiologist's perspective.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease guideline — individualizing care and clinical implementation notes that managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex; the guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and the recommendations should not replace clinical judgment; adherence can be enhanced by shared decision making with patient engagement; circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.

### Evidence-based medical management of peripheral artery disease [^d9053055]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease is an atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Management of this condition may include lifestyle modifications, medical management, endovascular repair, or surgery. The medical approach to peripheral artery disease is multifaceted and includes cholesterol reduction, antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, peripheral vasodilators, blood pressure management, exercise therapy, and smoking cessation. Adherence to this regimen can reduce limb-related complications like critical limb ischemia and amputation, as well as systemic complications of atherosclerosis like stroke and myocardial infarction. Relative to coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease is an undertreated condition. In this article, we explore the evidence behind medical therapies for the management of peripheral artery disease.

### ACC / AHA versus ESC guidelines for diagnosis and management of peripheral Artery disease: JACC guideline comparison [^571efb3b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease is a common yet underdiagnosed cause of morbidity worldwide. Significant recent advances in management have resulted in new guideline creation for the diagnosis and management of peripheral artery disease in the United States and Europe. Here, we analyze each set of guidelines with special attention to those areas where the 2 groups disagree. Both groups emphasize the importance of risk factor reduction, including smoking cessation, lipid lowering, blood pressure management, and glucose control. The U.S. guidelines place additional attention on lifestyle factors, including regular physical activity and supervised exercise. The European guidelines offer a number of recommendations for revascularization in patients with limb-threatening ischemia. Both agree that more evidence is needed to understand which patients are at highest risk for tissue loss. A consistent charge to each committee fostering a similar approach to available data and more randomized studies would align recommendations across both organizations.

As aortic and peripheral arterial disease continue to affect millions of people worldwide, experts have made considerable efforts to advance our understanding of these diseases and develop novel treatment paradigms to improve the quality of life for these patients. In late 2024, the European Society of Cardiology published guidelines for the management of peripheral arterial and aortic diseases. This document consolidates and updates previous guidelines to reflect new evidence for physicians caring for these patients. The purpose of this review is to highlight essential recommendations that are especially relevant to the perioperative physician.

### Peripheral artery disease: evolving role of exercise, medical therapy, and endovascular options [^3e94d3c0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) continues to increase worldwide. It is important to identify patients with PAD because of the increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death and impaired quality of life because of a profound limitation in exercise performance and the potential to develop critical limb ischemia. Despite effective therapies to lower the cardiovascular risk and prevent progression to critical limb ischemia, patients with PAD continue to be under-recognized and undertreated. The management of PAD patients should include an exercise program, guideline-based medical therapy to lower the cardiovascular risk, and, when revascularization is indicated, an "endovascular first" approach. The indications and strategic choices for endovascular revascularization will vary depending on the clinical severity of the PAD and the anatomic distribution of the disease. In this review, we discuss an evidence-based approach to the management of patients with PAD.

### The next 10 years in the management of peripheral artery disease: perspectives from the 'PAD 2009' conference [^f1d26c10]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To briefly inform on the conclusions from a conference on the next 10 years in the management of peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Design Of The Conference

International participation, invited presentations and open discussion were based on the following issues: Why is PAD under-recognised? Health economic impact of PAD; funding of PAD research; changes of treatment options? Aspects on clinical trials and regulatory views; and the role of guidelines.

Results and Conclusions

A relative lack of knowledge about cardiovascular risk and optimal management of PAD patients exists not only among the public, but also in parts of the health-care system. Specialists are required to act for improved information. More specific PAD research is needed for risk management and to apply the best possible evaluation of evidence for treatment strategies. Better strategies for funding are required based on, for example, public/private initiatives. The proportion of endovascular treatments is steadily increasing, more frequently based on observational studies than on randomised controlled trials. The role of guidelines is therefore important to guide the profession in the assessment of most relevant treatment.

### Interventions for lower extremity peripheral artery disease [^2f9f35d7]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the lower extremities is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis that is increasing in global prevalence and in the associated public health costs. Ageing of the general population, combined with the pandemics of diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and tobacco use, is a major underlying factor. A broad range of care providers are involved in the management of patients with PAD, and all health-care professionals require familiarity with the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment options for this common disease. Although medical therapies are the cornerstone of secondary prevention in atherosclerotic disease, they have limited direct limb-related benefits in advanced PAD. Despite a major evolution in technologies for limb revascularization, the increasing array of treatment options has not been accompanied by adequate evidence of their comparative effectiveness, which is needed to guide treatment decisions. This Review provides a framework for examining the current status of interventions for PAD, including an overview of disease staging, treatment goals, and the key factors associated with outcomes in defined subgroups. The status of evolving approaches to PAD, such as cell-based and gene-based therapies, and persistent unmet therapeutic needs in this field are also discussed.

### Peripheral arterial disease – what do we need to know? [^b4d73520]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) results from progressive narrowing of arteries secondary to atherosclerosis and is defined as an Ankle Brachial Index of < 0.9. PAD is highly prevalent and is an increasing burden on both the economy and the patient, especially given the rapid shift in demographics in the United States. Despite its prevalence and association with cardiovascular disease, PAD is still underdiagnosed and undertreated. This may, in part, be related to lack of recognition from the physician's side or paucity of evidence from clinical trials. It has been shown that medical therapy approved for cardiovascular disease is effective in the treatment of PAD and decreases cardiovascular events. Various revascularization strategies are also available for improving symptoms and quality of life in these patients, yet they are underutilized. In an attempt to increase its recognition, PAD has been considered a coronary artery disease equivalent. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of PAD. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1. Introduction

1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review

The recommendations listed in this guideline are, whenever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evidence review, which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline, was conducted from January through September 2015. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: acute limb ischemia, angioplasty, ankle-brachial index, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, atypical leg symptoms, blood pressure lowering/hypertension, bypass graft/bypass grafting/surgical bypass, cilostazol, claudication/intermittent claudication, critical limb ischemia/severe limb ischemia, diabetes, diagnostic testing, endovascular therapy, exercise rehabilitation/exercise therapy/exercise training/supervised exercise, lower extremity/foot wound/ulcer, peripheral artery disease/peripheral arterial disease/peripheral vascular disease/lower extremity arterial disease, smoking/smoking cessation, statin, stenting, and vascular surgery. Additional relevant studies published through September 2016, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables included in the Online Data Supplement summarize the evidence utilized by the writing committee to formulate recommendations. Additionally, the writing committee reviewed documents related to lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) previously published by the ACC and AHA. References selected and published in this document are representative and not all-inclusive.

1.4. Scope of Guideline

Lower extremity PAD is a common cardiovascular disease that is estimated to affect approximately 8.5 million Americans above the age of 40 years and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and QoL impairment. It has been estimated that 202 million people worldwide have PAD. The purpose of this document is to provide a contemporary guideline for diagnosis and management of patients with lower extremity PAD. This document supersedes recommendations related to lower extremity PAD in the "ACC/AHA 2005 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease"and the "2011 ACCF/AHA Focused Update of the Guideline for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease". The scope of this guideline is limited to atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremity arteries (PAD) and includes disease of the aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and infrapopliteal arterial segments. It does not address nonatherosclerotic causes of lower extremity arterial disease, such as vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia, physiological entrapment syndromes, cystic adventitial disease, and other entities. Future guidelines will address aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta and lower extremity arteries and diseases of the renal and mesenteric arteries.

In developing the "2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease", the writing committee reviewed the evidence to support recommendations in the relevant ACC/AHA guidelines noted in Table 2 and affirms the ongoing validity of the related recommendations, thus obviating the need to repeat existing guideline recommendations in the current guideline. Table 2 also contains a list of other statements that may be of interest to the reader. Table 3 includes definitions for PAD key terms used throughout the guideline.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of iliac artery occlusive disease: 2024 update [^e476ae24]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of iliac artery occlusive disease encompasses a review of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosis and treatment as a whole. There are several consensus documents that provide a comprehensive review of the topic. Differentiating optimal medical, surgical, and/or endovascular approaches to treat aortoiliac occlusive disease requires recognition of the likely etiology most responsible for the clinical symptomatology. Prompt diagnosis of acute limb ischemia versus chronic limb threatening ischemia is imperative to selecting the correct treatment pathway for individual patients. This document will attempt to summarize the data and most recent clinical trials to support clinical decision-making in the treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Lower extremity peripheral artery disease: contemporary epidemiology, management gaps, and future directions: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^239a5bef]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects > 230 million adults worldwide and is associated with increased risk of various adverse clinical outcomes (other cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and stroke and leg outcomes such as amputation). Despite its prevalence and clinical importance, PAD has been historically underappreciated by health care professionals and patients. This underappreciation seems multifactorial (eg, limited availability of the first-line diagnostic test, the ankle-brachial index, in clinics; incorrect perceptions that a leg vascular disease is not fatal and that the diagnosis of PAD would not necessarily change clinical practice). In the past several years, a body of evidence has indicated that these perceptions are incorrect. Several studies have consistently demonstrated that many patients with PAD are not receiving evidence-based therapies. Thus, this scientific statement provides an update for health care professionals regarding contemporary epidemiology (eg, prevalence, temporal trends, risk factors, and complications) of PAD, the present status of diagnosis (physiological tests and imaging modalities), and the major gaps in the management of PAD (eg, medications, exercise therapy, and revascularization). The statement also lists key gaps in research, clinical practice, and implementation related to PAD. Orchestrated efforts among different parties (eg, health care providers, researchers, expert organizations, and health care organizations) will be needed to increase the awareness and understanding of PAD and improve the diagnostic approaches, management, and prognosis of PAD.

### Contemporary and optimal medical management of peripheral arterial disease [^fb4647bb]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with a significant increase in risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Treatment is focused on (1) lowering cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular disease event rates and (2) improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Multidisciplinary and intersociety guidelines guide optimal medical therapy. Substantial evidence supports implementation of tobacco cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy to help achieve tobacco abstinence, antiplatelet therapy, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) therapy, and antihypertensive therapy for the purpose of lowering cardiovascular event rates and improving survival.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^591cfd7e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) continues to grow in global prevalence and consumes an increasing amount of resources in the United States health care system. Overall rates of intervention for PAD have been rising steadily in recent years. Changing demographics, evolution of technologies, and an expanding database of outcomes studies are primary forces influencing clinical decision making in PAD. The management of PAD is multidisciplinary, involving primary care physicians and vascular specialists with varying expertise in diagnostic and treatment modalities. PAD represents a broad spectrum of disease from asymptomatic through severe limb ischemia. The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Practice Guidelines committee reviewed the evidence supporting clinical care in the treatment of asymptomatic PAD and intermittent claudication (IC). The committee made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. There are limited Level I data available for many of the critical questions in the field, demonstrating the urgent need for comparative effectiveness research in PAD. Emphasis is placed on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and broader use of exercise programs to improve cardiovascular health and functional performance. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a > 50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.

### Diagnosis and risk assessment of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease [^951a0dcc]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Managing patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) requires an accurate assessment of the severity of the condition and the risk factors likely to predict disease progression. The spectrum of patient presentation ranges from asymptomatic to critical limb ischemia. Because about half of patients with PAD have coronary or cerebrovascular disease, the examination of presenting patients should be directed toward the entire cardiovascular system. The main diagnostic goal is to establish whether the symptoms are predominantly caused by PAD and to what degree the presenting problem is compounded by other comorbidities, such as diabetic neuropathy, arthritis, or venous disorders. The diagnostic process includes history taking, physical examination, noninvasive diagnostic testing, differential diagnosis, laboratory studies, and the use of the various imaging modalities, which in general are reserved for those PAD cases in which the clinician has already decided to intervene.

Conclusions

PAD, characterized by atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower extremities, is highly prevalent in patients with T2DM. The management of PAD in patients with T2DM requires a multidisciplinary and individualized approach that addresses both the overarching metabolic disturbances inherent to diabetes and the specific vascular complications of PAD. While there are several societal guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PAD in patients with T2DM, it is important to acknowledge that these guidelines are primarily based on data from the general population. To better tailor recommendations and improve care for this particular population, there is a pressing need for robust, T2DM-specific PAD clinical trials, primarily focusing on novel glucose-lowering agents known for their cardiovascular benefits, including GLP-1RA and SGLT2i. The initiation of such focused research efforts is essential to inform and refine clinical practices, optimizing patient outcomes in this complex interplay of systemic metabolic dysfunction and localized vascular impairment.

### Impact of pharmacologic interventions on peripheral artery disease [^67921b44]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions are an integral component of peripheral artery disease (PAD) management, supported by high-quality clinical studies. Those affected by this potentially debilitating and life-threatening disease process often have multiple contributing conditions, such as tobacco abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. In addition to medications aimed at improving claudication symptoms, risk factor modification and appropriate use of antiplatelet agents are essential to decreasing rates of major adverse clinical events and improving vessel patency following intervention. While lower extremity PAD is increasingly recognized as a prevalent condition, affected individuals remain undertreated with optimal pharmacotherapy. Novel approaches to treatment of PAD include stem cell therapy, which may play a beneficial role in those with minimal revascularization options but disease placing them at high risk for limb amputation. Additionally, timely initiation of optimal pharmacotherapy represents a cost-effective approach to management of this chronic condition.

### Medical optimization of the peripheral artery disease patient [^f0ba4c10]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) impacts an estimated 230 million adults worldwide, including more than 9.5 million adults older than 40 years in the United States. PAD remains more underdiagnosed and undertreated than manifestations of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the body, such as coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Medical therapies benefit all patients with PAD, including those who are asymptomatic, as well as those with symptoms and advanced disease requiring intervention. Comprehensive medical management of PAD is based on tempering atherosclerotic disease processes and should include smoking cessation, exercise therapy, cholesterol reduction, antiplatelet, and/or anticoagulation therapy, as well as the application of peripheral vasodilators and blood pressure control, when indicated. For patients with intermittent claudication, supervised exercise therapy has been shown to provide similar or superior benefit compared with intervention and is recommended by major society guidelines as first-line therapy. In patients with advanced PAD requiring endovascular or surgical intervention, continued adherence to optimal medical therapy has been found to improve functional outcomes and decrease post-interventional mortality. Optimal medical management provides crucial benefits to patients with early, moderate, and advanced PAD and, once started, should be continued for life.

Lower extremity peripheral artery disease — revascularization for claudication is addressed as follows: An individualized approach to revascularization for claudication is recommended for each patient to optimize outcome, and if undertaken the strategy should be evidence based and can include endovascular revascularization, surgery, or both; patients should be selected for revascularization on the basis of severity of their symptoms, with factors including a significant disability as assessed by the patient, adequacy of response to medical and structured exercise therapy, status of comorbid conditions, and a favorable risk-benefit ratio. COR IIa; LOE A: Revascularization is a reasonable treatment option for the patient with lifestyle-limiting claudication with an inadequate response to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and a minority of patients with claudication (estimated at < 10% to 15% over 5 years or more) will progress to critical limb ischemia (CLI). Lifestyle-limiting claudication is defined by the patient rather than by any test, includes impairment of activities of daily living and/or vocational and/or recreational activities due to claudication, and there should be clear discussion with the patient about expected risks and benefits of revascularization, as well as discussion of the durability of proposed procedures.

### Current treatment of peripheral arterial disease: role of percutaneous interventional therapies [^6ac2ac8e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite advances in medical therapies to help prevent the development of atherosclerosis and improve the management of patients with established peripheral arterial disease (PAD), the prevalence of PAD and associated morbidity remains high. Over the past decade, percutaneous revascularization therapies for the treatment of patients with PAD have evolved tremendously, and a great number of patients can now be offered treatment options that are less invasive than traditional surgical options. With the surgical approach, there is significant symptomatic improvement, but the associated morbidity and mortality preclude its routine use. Although newer percutaneous treatment options are associated with lower procedural complications, the technical advances have outpaced the evaluation of these treatments in adequately designed clinical studies, and therapeutic options are available that may not have been rigorously investigated. Therefore, for physicians treating patients with PAD, an understanding of the various therapies available, along with the inherent benefits and limitations of each treatment option is imperative as a greater number of patients with PAD are being encountered.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^5e6a90b2]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

As stated in the Preamble, the ACC/AHA guideline methodology provides for commissioning an independent ERC to address systematic review questions (PI-COTS format) to inform recommendations developed by the writing committee. All other guideline recommendations (not based on the systematic review questions) were also subjected to an extensive evidence review process. For this guideline, the writing committee in conjunction with the Task Force and ERC Chair identified the following systematic review questions: 1) Is antiplatelet therapy beneficial for prevention of cardiovascular events in the patient with symptomatic or asymptomatic lower extremity PAD? 2) What is the effect of revascularization, compared with optimal medical therapy and exercise training, on functional outcome and quality of life (QoL) among patients with claudication? Each question has been the subject of recently published, systematic evidence reviews. – The quality of these evidence reviews was appraised by the ACC/AHA methodologist and a vendor contracted to support this process (Doctor Evidence [Santa Monica, CA]). Few substantive randomized or nonrandomized studies had been published after the end date of the literature searches used for the existing evidence reviews, so the ERC concluded that no additional systematic review was necessary to address either of these critical questions.

A third systematic review question was then identified: 3) Is one revascularization strategy (endovascular or surgical) associated with improved cardiovascular and limb-related outcomes in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI)? This question had also been the subject of a high-quality systematic review that synthesized evidence from observational data and an RCT; additional RCTs addressing this question are ongoing. – The writing committee and the Task Force decided to expand the survey to include more relevant randomized and observational studies. Based on evaluation of this additional evidence the ERC decided that further systematic review was not needed to inform the writing committee on this question. Hence, the ERC and writing committee concluded that available systematic reviews could be used to inform the development of recommendations addressing each of the 3 systematic review questions specified above. The members of the Task Force and writing committee thank the members of the ERC that began this process and their willingness to participate in this volunteer effort. They include Aruna Pradhan, MD, MPH (ERC Chair); Natalie Evans, MD; Peter Henke, MD; Dharam J. Kumbhani, MD, SM, FACC; and Tamar Polonsky, MD.

### Disparities in peripheral artery disease care: a review and call for action [^617b9520]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD), the pathophysiologic narrowing of arterial blood vessels of the lower leg due to atherosclerosis, is a highly prevalent disease that affects more than 6 million individuals 40 years and older in the United States, with sharp increases in prevalence with age. Morbidity and mortality rates in patients with PAD range from 30% to 70% during the 5- to 15-year period after diagnosis and PAD is associated with poor health outcomes and reduced functionality and quality of life. Despite advances in medical, endovascular, and open surgical techniques, there is striking variation in care among population subgroups defined by sex, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, with concomitant differences in preoperative medication optimization, amputation risk, and overall health outcomes. We reviewed studies from 1995 to 2021 to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current impact of disparities on the treatment and management of PAD and offer action items that require strategic partnership with primary care providers, researchers, patients, and their communities. With new technologies and collaborative approaches, optimal management across all population subgroups is possible.

### Non-coronary atherosclerotic arterial disease: where are we now? [^06975d56]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery and upper extremity artery disease are significant vascular conditions with distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The lower extremity peripheral artery is associated with worse major adverse cardiovascular events compared with coronary artery disease, but often remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Upper extremity artery disease encompasses a range of clinical presentations resulting from atherosclerosis and other obstructive lesions in arteries such as the subclavian artery and brachiocephalic trunk. While atherosclerosis is a common cause, non-atherosclerotic factors can also influence distal lesions. This review aims to synthesize existing knowledge on both conditions, encompassing risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options. Improved awareness and early intervention can mitigate complications and enhance patient outcomes for lower extremity peripheral artery and upper extremity artery disease.

### Peripheral arterial disease [^9eed5769]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an atherosclerotic-driven condition that remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. In diabetic patients, PAD begins early, progresses rapidly, and is frequently asymptomatic, making it difficult to diagnose. Strict management of the metabolic instigators and use of screening techniques for PAD in diabetes can facilitate early diagnosis and reduce progression. Exercise is an equally effective treatment option in improving walking distance. Early revascularization must be offered early in suitable patients. Surgical bypass and endovascular revascularization are complementary and the choice of intervention should be applied appropriately by a multidisciplinary vascular team on a selective, patient-specific basis.

8. Revascularization for Claudication

An individualized approach to revascularization for claudication is recommended for each patient to optimize outcome. Revascularization is but one component of care for the patient with claudication, as each patient should have a customized care plan that also includes medical therapy (Section 5), structured exercise therapy (Section 6), and care to minimize tissue loss (Section 7). If a strategy of revascularization for claudication is undertaken, the revascularization strategy should be evidence based and can include endovascular revascularization, surgery, or both.

Because of the variability of ischemic limb symptoms and impact of these symptoms on functional status and QoL, patients should be selected for revascularization on the basis of severity of their symptoms. Factors to consider include a significant disability as assessed by the patient, adequacy of response to medical and structured exercise therapy, status of comorbid conditions, and a favorable risk–benefit ratio. Patient preferences and goals of care are important considerations in the evaluation for revascularization. The revascularization strategy should have a reasonable likelihood of providing durable relief of symptoms. A general recommendation for revascularization as a treatment option for claudication is provided below followed by specific recommendations for endovascular (Section 8.1.1) and surgical (Section 8.1.2) procedures if a revascularization strategy is undertaken.

8.1. Revascularization for Claudication: Recommendation

8.1.1. Endovascular Revascularization for Claudication: Recommendations

Endovascular techniques to treat claudication include balloon dilation (angioplasty), stents, and atherectomy. These techniques continue to involve and now include covered stents, drug-eluting stents (DES), cutting balloons, and drug-coated balloons. The technique chosen for endovascular treatment is related to lesion characteristics (eg, anatomic location, lesion length, degree of calcification) and operator experience. Assessment of the appropriateness of specific endovascular techniques for specific lesions for the treatment of claudication is beyond the scope of this document.

Revascularization is performed on lesions that are deemed to be hemodynamically significant, and stenoses selected for endovascular treatment should have a reasonable likelihood of limiting perfusion to the distal limb. Stenoses of 50% to 75% diameter by angiography may not be hemodynamically significant, and resting or provoked intravascular pressure measurements may be used to determine whether lesions are significant. Multiple RCTs have compared endovascular procedures to various combinations of medical treatment with or without supervised or unsupervised exercise programs. These trials have used different endpoints and enrolled patients with anatomic disease distribution at different levels.

### The significance of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease [^b8188863]. Clinical Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The role of the cardiologist is expanding and involves the management of patients with lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive arterial disease. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease. The purpose of this review is to educate the clinician on the significance of lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive arterial disease. Pathophysiology and anatomy are briefly reviewed. The definition of PAD is based upon both anatomic and functional considerations. Risk factors for PAD include traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. There is a considerable overlap between coronary and cerebrovascular diseases and PAD. Diagnosis is made mainly by history and physical examination. Noninvasive and invasive tests help diagnosis and localize disease. Expanded therapies to improve outcomes include lifestyle changes, medical treatment, interventional cardiovascular procedures, or surgical intervention.

Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) is a phenotype of peripheral artery disease that is characterized by pain in the lower extremity muscles during activity that is relieved by rest. Medical management, risk factor control, smoking cessation, and exercise therapy have historically been the mainstays of treatment for IC, but advances in endovascular technology have led to increasing use of peripheral vascular interventions in this patient population. There are meaningful differences in published society guidelines and appropriate use criteria relevant to the management of IC, especially regarding indications for peripheral vascular interventions. The current review aims to highlight similarities and differences between major society recommendations for the management of IC, and to discuss practice trends, disparities, and evidence gaps in the use of peripheral vascular interventions for IC in the context of existing guidelines.

### Medical treatment of peripheral arterial disease: a comprehensive review [^d6c69cdf]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of atherosclerosis that affects more than 10 million people in the United States. The risk factors associated with PAD are similar to those found in patients with coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Medical therapy of PAD must include modification of cardiovascular risk factors with application of strict secondary prevention guidelines. For improvement in quality of life, a structured exercise rehabilitation program remains the most effective noninterventional treatment strategy, but it is difficult to employ from economic and patient-compliance perspectives. Newer pharmacologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy in patients with intermittent claudication. Emerging strategies for management of these patients include revascularization and maximal medical therapy for improvement of physical function as well as reduction in risk for subsequent major cardiovascular events. This article will review the clinical data supporting aggressive medical interventions for patients with PAD.

General treatment modalities

Tobacco use is one of the strongest risk factors for development, progression and recurrence of PAD after revascularisation. The benefits of smoking cessation rivals that of many pharmacological therapies. Similar to patients with CAD, patients with PAD should also receive specific instructions on lifestyle modification, such as structured exercise, dietary intervention, and weight management.

### Effects of dialysis on peripheral arterial disease [^99042b3d]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

End-stage renal disease is an independent risk factor for the development of peripheral arterial disease, with considerably worse outcomes in patients with concomitant diseases. It is important to realize the widespread, yet frequently asymptomatic, nature of peripheral arterial disease in patients with end-stage renal disease due to the presence of other comorbidities that decrease activity levels and sensation to allow for early recognition and timely medical management to try and mitigate otherwise poor outcomes. Despite their high risk, properly selected patients derive benefit from revascularization; both open and endovascular approaches provide similar outcomes in terms of overall survival, amputation-free survival, and limb salvage, with perhaps a slight preference toward open repair. This narrative review of the literature evaluates the epidemiology, pathophysiology, outcomes, and management strategies that provide the best possible outcomes for patients with peripheral arterial disease and end-stage renal disease.

### New horizons in peripheral artery disease [^876c6d87]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the manifestation of systemic atherosclerotic disease in the arteries of, and supplying, the lower limbs. Similar to other cardiovascular diseases, PAD is an age-related condition with a prevalence over 10% among people aged ≥ 65 living in high-income countries. Whilst the majority of individuals with PAD are asymptomatic, progression of the disease leads to symptoms of intermittent claudication (leg pain on walking) and ultimately pain at rest, ulceration and gangrene. PAD is a major cause of morbidity among older people and may lead to disability, limb loss and death.

In recent years, there have been a number of innovations in medical and surgical management that have changed treatment algorithms for PAD. Additionally, new evidence and updated guidelines have radically changed management pathways with the advent of rapid-access limb salvage clinics to expedite revascularisation for those with rest pain and/or tissue loss. In the context of an ageing population and increasing prevalence of type-2 diabetes mellitus, patient cohorts of those undergoing intervention have changed drastically with many more older patients with PAD living with multi-morbidity, frailty and cognitive impairment admitted to vascular surgery wards.

AHA/ACC peripheral artery disease (PAD) evidence gaps and future research directions — The writing committee identified critical research needs that include RCTs needed to determine the value of using the ABI to identify asymptomatic patients with PAD for therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk; advancement in PAD diagnostics for simplified yet highly accurate measurement of the ABI and more reliable noninvasive perfusion assessment in CLI; comparative-effectiveness studies to determine the optimal antiplatelet therapy for prevention of cardiovascular and limb-related events; development of additional medical therapies for claudication; additional research to identify the best community- or home-based exercise programs and their role before or in addition to revascularization; and development and validation of improved clinical classification systems for PAD to predict clinical outcome and optimize treatment approach. For device-based care, comparative- and cost-effectiveness studies of different endovascular technologies for claudication and CLI are needed, and studies should include patient-centered endpoints, such as functional parameters, time to wound healing, and QoL, in addition to standard patency-focused outcomes. Registry-focused priorities name the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Peripheral Vascular Intervention Registry™ (PVI Registry™), and the National Radiology Data Registry for Interventional Radiology (NRDR), and future efforts should incorporate these registries into interventional RCTs and post-marketing studies of PAD-related devices.

### Contemporary evaluation and management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease [^7c316466]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) includes atherosclerosis of the aorta and lower extremities. Affecting a large segment of the population, PAD is associated with impaired functional capacity and reduced quality of life as well as an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. The evaluation of PAD begins with the physical examination, incorporating non-invasive testing such as ankle-brachial indices to confirm the diagnosis. Therapeutic interventions are aimed at alleviating symptoms while preserving limb integrity and reducing overall cardiovascular risk. With this in mind, risk factor modification with exercise and medical therapy are the mainstays of treatment for many patients with PAD. Persistent symptoms or non-healing wounds should prompt more aggressive therapies with endovascular or surgical revascularisation. The following manuscript provides a comprehensive review on the contemporary evaluation and management of PAD.

12. Evidence Gaps and Future Research Directions

In performing the evidence review and in developing the present guidelines, the writing committee identified the following critical evidence gaps and future directions for PAD-related research:
Basic science and translational studies to better understand the vascular biology of endovascular therapies and bypass grafting and to develop new methods for preventing restenosis after revascularization.
Determination of risk factors for progression from asymptomatic PAD to symptomatic disease, including CLI.
RCTs needed to determine the value of using the ABI to identify asymptomatic patients with PAD for therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk (eg, antiplatelet agents, statins, and other therapies).
Advancement in PAD diagnostics, such as technologies for simplified yet highly accurate measurement of the ABI and tools for more reliable noninvasive perfusion assessment in CLI.
Comparative-effectiveness studies to determine the optimal antiplatelet therapy (drug or drugs and dosage) for prevention of cardiovascular and limb-related events in patients with PAD.
Development of additional medical therapies for claudication–an area of unmet medical need with a currently limited research pipeline.
Studies to investigate the role of dietary intervention, in addition to statin therapy, to improve outcome and modify the natural history of PAD.
Additional research to identify the best community-or home-based exercise programs for patients with PAD to maximize functional status and improve QoL, as well as the role of such exercise programs before or in addition to revascularization.
Development and validation of improved clinical classification systems for PAD that incorporate symptoms, anatomic factors, and patient-specific risk factors and can be used to predict clinical outcome and optimize treatment approach. An example of a recently developed classification system is the Society for Vascular Surgery limb classification system, based on wound, ischemia, and foot infection (WIfI), which has been validated in different populations and may permit more meaningful prognosis in patients with CLI. –
Comparative- and cost-effectiveness studies of the different endovascular technologies for treatment of claudication and CLI, including drug-coated balloons and DES. Studies should include patient-centered end-points, such as functional parameters, time to wound healing, and QoL, in addition to standard patency-focused outcomes. These studies could then be incorporated into value-based clinical algorithms for approach to revascularization for claudication and CLI.
Additional studies to demonstrate the impact of multisocietal registries on clinical outcomes and appropriate use. At present, these include the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI), the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Peripheral Vascular Intervention Registry™ (PVI Registry™), and the National Radiology Data Registry for Interventional Radiology (NRDR). These registries provide an opportunity to obtain "real-world" data on surgical and endovascular procedures for PAD and to improve quality by providing feedback to participating centers. Future efforts should incorporate these registries into interventional RCTs and postmarketing studies of PAD-related devices.

Imaging for anatomic assessment in critical limb ischemia (CLI) with planned revascularization: Invasive angiography is useful for patients with CLI in whom revascularization is considered. Because timely diagnosis and treatment are essential to preserve tissue viability in CLI, it is often most effective and expeditious to pursue invasive angiography with endovascular revascularization directly, without delay and potential risk of additional noninvasive imaging.

### Medical management of peripheral arterial disease [^91ff8421]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Whether symptomatic or not, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lower extremities, is a common disorder in the general population. The prevalence increases with age and under the influence of vascular risk factors. The most classic symptomatic expression of PAD is intermittent claudication. However, the majority of patients with PAD is asymptomatic or has leg symptoms other than classic intermittent claudication. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects with PAD have increased mortality rates, mainly due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular expressions of atherosclerotic disease. This review focuses on the current available medical therapies for PAD, including risk-factor modification and antiplatelet therapies, as well as strategies for symptomatic relief in both patients with intermittent claudication and patients with critical limb ischemia. In general, risk factor modification and antiplatelet therapy is essential in all patients with PAD to prevent systemic atherosclerotic complications. Furthermore, for symptomatic relief exercise therapy is the main intervention while pharmacological treatment should be only complementary. In patients with critical limb ischemia, when revascularization therapy is not possible, an attempt should be made to avoid amputation with conservative treatment using analgesics, vasodilators and/or anticoagulants. In case of an acute onset of critical limb ischemia, thrombolysis is indicated.

Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2024 ACC/AHA/AACVPR/APMA/ABC/SCAI/SVM/SVN/SVS/SIR/VESS Guideline for the Management of Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, chronic symptomatic, chronic limb-threatening ischemia, and acute limb ischemia).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from October 2020 to June 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that was published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through May 2023 during the peer review process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables where appropriate.

Structure

Recommendations from the "2016 AHA/ACC Guideline on the Management of Patients With Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with peripheral artery disease have been developed.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guideline on the management of intermittent claudication: focused update [^a43d67fc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) is the most common symptom of peripheral artery disease, which is a growing public health burden in the United States and globally. Patients with IC present with a broad spectrum of risk factors, comorbid conditions, range of disability, and treatment goals. Informed shared decision-making hinges on a comprehensive evaluation of these factors, patient education, and knowledge of the latest available evidence. In 2015, the Society for Vascular Surgery published a clinical practice guideline on the management of asymptomatic peripheral artery disease and IC. An expert writing group was commissioned to provide a focused update to this guideline on the management of IC. Based on the available evidence from published research conducted since the prior guideline, six specific key questions were formulated spanning the areas of antithrombotic management, exercise therapy, and revascularization for IC. A systematic review and evidence synthesis of each question was conducted by a dedicated methodology team. The GRADE approach was employed to describe the strength of each recommendation and level of certainty of evidence. The review identified major gaps in evidence particularly in the arena of comparative effectiveness for interventions (exercise, revascularization) across defined clinical subgroups and employing meaningful patient-centered outcomes. Twelve recommendations, among which are two best practice statements, are provided in this focused update. They address the use of dual pathway antithrombotic strategies, the role and type of exercise therapy, endovascular interventions for femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal disease, and the identification of specific risk factors that should be incorporated into shared decision-making around revascularization. A comprehensive and individualized approach to the management of patients with IC, relying first on education, risk factor control, optimal medical therapy, and exercise, is emphasized. A rubric for decision-making that includes a thorough assessment of risk, benefits, degree of impairment, and treatment durability, is considered fundamental to a patient-centered approach in IC. Significant unmet research needs in this field are also enumerated.

In the UK, around 5% of people aged 55–74 years have intermittent leg pain on walking (claudication), a characteristic feature of peripheral arterial disease. The fact that their disease is symptomatic puts such individuals at high risk of experiencing serious cardiovascular complications. Yet many of them do not receive adequate secondary prevention advice and therapy. Here, we review the management of peripheral arterial disease in primary care, concentrating on those with clinically overt disease.

4. Screening for Atherosclerotic Disease in Other Vascular Beds for the Patient with PAD

4.1. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Recommendation

4.2. Screening for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis in Other Arterial Beds (Coronary, Carotid, and Renal Arteries)

The prevalence of atherosclerosis in the coronary, carotid, and renal arteries is higher in patients with PAD than in those without pad.– However, intensive atherosclerosis risk factor modification in patients with PAD is justified regardless of the presence of disease in other arterial beds. Thus, the only justification for screening for disease in other arterial beds is if revascularization results in a reduced risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death, and this has never been shown. Currently, there is no evidence to demonstrate that screening all patients with PAD for asymptomatic atherosclerosis in other arterial beds improves clinical outcome. Intensive treatment of risk factors through GDMT is the principle method for preventing adverse cardiovascular ischemic events from asymptomatic disease in other arterial beds.

### Appropriateness of care measures: a novel approach to quality [^8b7c074b]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical judgment of a physician is one of the most important aspects of medical quality, yet it is rarely captured with quality measures in use today. We propose a novel approach using individualized physician benchmarking that measures the appropriateness of care that a physician delivers by looking at their practice pattern in a specific clinical situation. A prime application of our novel approach to appropriateness measures is the surgical management of peripheral artery disease and claudication. We discuss 4 potential consensus metrics for the treatment of claudication that explore appropriateness of care of claudication management and are meaningful, actionable, and quantifiable. Given the multitude of medical specialties involved in the care of patients with peripheral artery disease and the consequences of both preemptive and delayed care, it is in all of our interests to promote data transparency with confidential communications to outlier physicians while advocating for evidence-based management.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^f32f58e0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines — management of asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication (IC) — state that the committee reviewed evidence for these populations and made specific practice recommendations using the GRADE system, with emphasis on risk factor modification, medical therapies, and exercise programs. Screening for PAD appears of unproven benefit at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms, after a careful risk-benefit analysis, and treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with reasonable durability, and a minimum threshold of a > 50% likelihood of sustained efficacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a benchmark; anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efficacy of revascularization in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease when anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold, and caution is warranted when durability is limited (extensive calcification, small-caliber arteries, diffuse infrapopliteal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with technical factors that suggest durability in the setting of prior endovascular failures; common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous vein is the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafting. Patients who undergo invasive treatments for IC should be monitored regularly in a surveillance program to record subjective improvements, assess risk factors, optimize compliance with cardioprotective medications, and monitor hemodynamic and patency status.

Peripheral artery disease claudication — general indications for revascularization emphasize that a minority of patients with claudication progress to CLI (estimated at < 10% to 15% over 5 years or more), so the role of revascularization is improvement in claudication symptoms and functional status and QoL rather than limb salvage; revascularization is reasonable when a patient on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), including structured exercise therapy, presents with persistent lifestyle-limiting claudication, which is defined by the patient rather than by any test; and per the recommendation table, revascularization is a reasonable treatment option for the patient with lifestyle-limiting claudication with an inadequate response to GDMT (IIa A).

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) conclusions — Peripheral artery disease is an entity associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and requires a timely diagnosis. Proven therapies, such as supervised exercise therapy, should be offered to all Medicare patients with intermittent claudication. Revascularization is appropriate for patients who have intermittent claudication that is lifestyle-limiting despite non-invasive measures. Revascularization for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) should be encouraged and reimbursed according to quality of care and outcomes. Disparities in amputation, revascularization, and access to medical care should be recognized and eliminated.

### Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease [^ece91305]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel devices such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented > 150000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery disease at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive disease. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular disease.

Imaging for anatomic assessment in asymptomatic peripheral artery disease: Invasive and noninvasive angiography (i.e. CTA, MRA) should not be performed for the anatomic assessment of patients with asymptomatic PAD. Angiography, either noninvasive or invasive, should not be performed for the anatomic assessment of patients with PAD without leg symptoms because delineation of anatomy will not change treatment for this population, and this lack of benefit occurs in the setting of risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, patient discomfort, and allergic reactions. This recommendation does not address assessment of lower extremity aneurysmal disease or nonatherosclerotic causes of arterial disease, which is beyond the scope of this document.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) — contrast angiography provides detailed arterial anatomic information and is recommended for evaluation when revascularization is contemplated, and a history of contrast reaction should be documented with appropriate pretreatment administered before contrast is given.

### Lower extremity critical limb ischemia: a review of clinical features and management [^a6594050]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents symptoms related to end-stage atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease manifested by rest pain and tissue loss. It is associated with increased risk of limb amputation and cardiovascular-related mortality. The prevalence and cost of CLI are expected to increase with both the aging of the U.S. population and continued influence of smoking and diabetes. Treatments encompass measures to reduce cardiovascular risk and preserve limb viability. Despite increasing popularity of endovascular modalities, revascularization with either surgical bypass or endovascular intervention is the cornerstone of therapy. Adequate Level I data to guide decisions regarding optimal strategies to treat CLI, particularly in patients who are candidates for both open and percutaneous approaches, are currently lacking. Ongoing randomized controlled trials aim to resolve the clinical equipoise.

Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) are evidence-based criteria developed in a methodologically robust manner with the input of expert providers across a wide range of disciplines and practice settings. AUC have been successfully implemented in the diagnosis and management of a wide range of cardiovascular disease processes. AUC have demonstrated clear potential for influencing meaningful change in practice patterns with regards to high-value, high-quality care in cardiovascular pathologies. Potential for similar impact in the management of peripheral artery disease, specifically for patients presenting with intermittent claudication (IC), may be limited due to unique challenges. These challenges include multidisciplinary interventionalists, variability in existing AUC across specialties, and financial incentives influencing physician behavior. AUC serve to benefit patients by improving outcomes, and adoption of AUC is a critical step toward improving the quality of care provided to patients with IC. Societal support is necessary for effective AUC implementation.

10. Management of ALI

ALI is one of the most treatable and potentially devastating presentations of PAD. Timely recognition of arterial occlusion as the cause of an ischemic, cold, painful leg is crucial to successful treatment. The writing committee has used a standard definition of ALI in which symptom duration is < 2 weeks (Table 3). Category I refers to viable limbs that are not immediately threatened. Category II refers to threatened limbs. Category IIa limbs are marginally threatened and salvageable, if promptly treated. Category IIb are immediately threatened limbs that require immediate revascularization if salvage is to be accomplished. Category III are irreversibly damaged limbs, in which case resultant major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage is inevitable.

Therapy for critical limb ischemia (CLI) — findings that prompt consideration of surgical versus endovascular revascularization are outlined as follows: Findings that favor consideration of surgical revascularization include lesion involving common femoral artery, including origin of deep femoral artery; long segment lesion involving the below-knee popliteal and/or infrapopliteal arteries in a patient with suitable single-segment autogenous vein conduit; diffuse multilevel disease that would require endovascular revascularization at multiple anatomic levels; and small-diameter target artery proximal to site of stenosis or densely calcified lesion at location of endovascular treatment. Additional surgical consideration includes endovascular treatment likely to preclude or complicate subsequent achievement of in-line blood flow through surgical revascularization, exemplified by single-vessel runoff distal to ankle. Findings that favor consideration of endovascular revascularization include the presence of patient comorbidities that increase perioperative risk from surgical revascularization, patients with rest pain and disease at multiple levels who may undergo a staged approach as part of endovascular-first approach, and patients without suitable autologous vein for bypass grafts.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for peripheral artery disease, more specifically with respect to indications for revascularization, symptomatic, SVS 2015 guidelines recommend to perform revascularization in patients with intermittent claudication and significant functional or lifestyle-limiting disability if there is a reasonable likelihood of symptomatic improvement with treatment and when pharmacologic or exercise therapy, or both, have failed and the benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risks.
