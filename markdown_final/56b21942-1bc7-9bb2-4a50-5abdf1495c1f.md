## Question

Explain dp/dt in regurgitation and stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to explain dp/dt in the context of valvular regurgitation and stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what dp/dt actually represents physiologically and how it is measured noninvasively. Then, I should verify how regurgitation enables dp/dt estimation and why it is useful. Next, I will examine how stenosis alters dp/dt and why it is less reliable in that setting. After that, I should review disease-specific examples and thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize practical implications, limitations, and when to use or avoid dp/dt in decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the definition and measurement. dp/dt is the instantaneous rate of pressure rise over time, a surrogate for ventricular contractility, and in echocardiography we estimate it from the continuous-wave Doppler envelope of a regurgitant jet by timing the interval required for the jet velocity to rise between two known pressure-equivalent velocities, typically 1 to 2 m/s for the right ventricle and 1 to 3 m/s for the left ventricle, which correspond to fixed pressure increments using the simplified Bernoulli relation, 4v² [^6b5bb3d8] [^c504f4e7] [^a95283ce].

> Wait, let me verify the pressure increments so I don't misstate them. For tricuspid regurgitation, 1 to 2 m/s corresponds to a 12 mmHg pressure rise, and for mitral regurgitation, 1 to 3 m/s corresponds to a 32 mmHg pressure rise, so the numerator is fixed and the denominator is the measured time interval, yielding dp/dt in mmHg/s [^c504f4e7] [^a95283ce].

> I will now examine why regurgitation enables this measurement. Regurgitant jets provide a direct window into ventricular pressure during isovolumic contraction, before the valve opens, so the early systolic velocity rise tracks the rate of pressure development; this is precisely why mitral regurgitation allows estimation of left ventricular dp/dt and tricuspid regurgitation allows estimation of right ventricular dp/dt, and guidelines endorse RV dp/dt as an adjunct when RV dysfunction is suspected, albeit noting limited normative data and recommending cautious, integrated use [^6b5bb3d8] [^201caf2c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stenosis. In stenosis, the valve itself creates a pressure gradient and obstructs outflow, so the relationship between intraventricular pressure and Doppler velocity is distorted; dp/dt derived from a stenotic jet would conflate contractility with the severity of obstruction and afterload, making it unreliable as a contractility index, and experimental work shows large discrepancies between ventricular and arterial dp/dt in the presence of aortic stenosis or dynamic outflow obstruction, reinforcing that dp/dt should not be used to assess contractility across stenotic valves [^44bdfad7].

> Let me consider concrete examples to anchor this. In mitral regurgitation, a normal LV dp/dt is generally greater than about 1200 mmHg/s, while values below about 800 mmHg/s indicate markedly abnormal contractility; in chronic aortic regurgitation, preoperative dp/dt has been shown to predict postoperative LV systolic function, with dp/dt less than or equal to 700 mmHg/s identifying patients at high risk of persistent dysfunction after valve surgery, illustrating prognostic utility when the jet is available and measurable [^d67e22c4] [^759110e4].

> For the right ventricle, I should double-check the thresholds. RV dp/dt less than approximately 400 mmHg/s is considered abnormal and has been associated with worse outcomes in pulmonary hypertension cohorts, though load dependence and angle correction remain limitations; some investigators propose dP/dt divided by peak pressure to mitigate preload effects, but this is not yet standard in clinical practice [^c504f4e7] [^201caf2c] [^76919f0b].

> But wait, what if there is no regurgitation to measure. In the absence of a measurable regurgitant jet, dp/dt cannot be calculated noninvasively, and alternative contractility surrogates such as tissue Doppler s', strain, or invasive indices must be considered; moreover, even when a jet is present, dp/dt is load dependent and should be interpreted alongside blood pressure, heart rate, and other hemodynamic context, and repeated measurements are advisable to ensure reproducibility [^a95283ce] [^ca85359a].

> I should confirm practical implications and pitfalls. dp/dt is most useful when regurgitation is present and the Doppler envelope is well defined, when contractility assessment is clinically important such as in heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or preoperative planning, and when serial trending is feasible; conversely, avoid attempting dp/dt across stenotic valves, in technically poor windows, or when the jet is eccentric or incomplete, and always integrate with global echocardiographic and clinical data rather than relying on dp/dt in isolation [^6b5bb3d8] [^caca7132].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise. dp/dt is a noninvasive surrogate of ventricular contractility derived from the early systolic rise of a regurgitant jet velocity, enabled by the isovolumic pressure dynamics reflected in mitral or tricuspid regurgitation; it is informative in regurgitation but invalidated by stenosis, where the pressure–velocity relationship is governed by obstruction rather than contractility, so use dp/dt when regurgitation is present and interpret it carefully within the hemodynamic context [^6b5bb3d8] [^44bdfad7].

---

dp/dt is a **contractility index** [^7047d906] measuring the rate of ventricular pressure rise during isovolumic contraction, typically derived from regurgitant jets [^6b5bb3d8] (mitral or tricuspid) using continuous-wave Doppler [^c504f4e7]. In regurgitation, dp/dt is **reliable and load-sensitive** [^d67e22c4], with normal LV dp/dt > 1,200 mmHg/s and RV dp/dt > 400 mmHg/s; lower values indicate reduced contractility [^c504f4e7] [^201caf2c]. In stenosis, dp/dt is **less reliable** because the pressure rise is constrained by the fixed obstruction, so it underestimates true contractility and should not be used to assess ventricular function in this setting [^44bdfad7].

---

## Physiological basis of dp/dt

dp/dt reflects the **rate of pressure rise during isovolumic contraction**, when the ventricle contracts against closed valves, making it a relatively load-independent measure of contractility [^7047d906]. It is commonly measured noninvasively from regurgitant jets using continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography [^6b5bb3d8].

---

## Measurement of dp/dt

dp/dt is calculated from the time interval required for the regurgitant jet velocity to increase between two predefined velocities, corresponding to known pressure changes [^6b5bb3d8]. For example, in mitral regurgitation, the time interval between 1 m/s and 3 m/s corresponds to a pressure change of 32 mmHg (using the simplified Bernoulli equation), and dp/dt is calculated as 32 mmHg divided by the time interval in seconds [^a95283ce].

---

## dp/dt in regurgitation

In regurgitation, dp/dt is a **reliable index of ventricular contractility** [^d67e22c4] because the regurgitant jet reflects intraventricular pressure during isovolumic contraction. Normal values are typically > 1,200 mmHg/s for the left ventricle and > 400 mmHg/s for the right ventricle [^c504f4e7] [^201caf2c]. Reduced dp/dt values indicate impaired contractility and are associated with worse clinical outcomes [^759110e4].

---

## dp/dt in stenosis

In stenosis, dp/dt is **less reliable** because the pressure rise is constrained by the fixed obstruction, leading to an underestimation of true contractility [^44bdfad7]. The presence of a significant pressure gradient across the stenotic valve alters the relationship between ventricular pressure and flow, making dp/dt measurements inaccurate [^44bdfad7].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Regurgitation**: dp/dt is useful for assessing ventricular contractility, guiding therapeutic decisions, and predicting outcomes [^d67e22c4] [^759110e4].
- **Stenosis**: dp/dt should not be used to assess ventricular function due to its limited reliability in this context [^44bdfad7].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Load dependence**: Although relatively load-independent, dp/dt can be influenced by preload and afterload conditions [^fbe1d95f].
- **Technical factors**: Accurate measurement requires high-quality Doppler signals and careful patient positioning [^ca85359a].
- **Clinical context**: dp/dt should be interpreted alongside other echocardiographic and clinical parameters [^ca85359a].

---

dp/dt is a **valuable index of ventricular contractility** in regurgitation, providing insights into ventricular function and guiding clinical decisions. In stenosis, its reliability is limited, and alternative measures should be considered for accurate assessment of ventricular function.

Right ventricular dP/dt — calculation and interpretation are based on the ascending limb of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) continuous-wave Doppler signal, with RV dP/dt commonly calculated by measuring the time required for the TR jet to increase in velocity from 1 to 2 m/s, which represents a 12 mm Hg pressure rise and is computed as 12 mm Hg divided by this time; alternatively, using the time for the TR velocity to increase from 0.5 to 2 m/s uses a numerator of 15 mm Hg. Because of the lack of data in normal subjects, RV dP/dt cannot be recommended for routine clinical use, though it can be considered in subjects with suspected RV dysfunction, and RV dP/dt < approximately 400 mm Hg/s is likely abnormal.

### Echocardiography in shock management [^d67e22c4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The advanced practitioner can use a number of Doppler and TDI parameters to more accurately quantify left ventricular dysfunction. When mitral regurgitation is present, dP/dt can be calculated, a normal value being > 1200 mmHg/s and markedly abnormal values being < 800 mmHg/s. Using TDI, the myocardial systolic velocity S', measured from an average of readings from multiple segments, correlates with LVEF. In a study involving four basal segments, a S' > 7.5 correlated with an LVEF > 50% with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 88%. Using an average of six basal segments, Gulati and colleagues found an S' > 5.4 indicated an LVEF > 50% with sensitivity 88% and specificity 97%. It should be noted that S' decreases with age and does not differentiate active contraction from tethering effects.

Other techniques currently under investigation, although contributing to left ventricular contraction assessment in the stable outpatient population, have yet to prove beneficial in the critically ill. Strain rate imaging and speckle tracking using global longitudinal strain have been demonstrated to identify systolic dysfunction in patients with normal LVEF in oncology and heart failure patients. The value in critically ill patients is still uncertain.

Any assessment of left ventricular contractility needs to take the presence or absence of identifiable segmental wall motion abnormalities into account; if present, urgent revascularization should be considered to enhance prognosis.

Valvular pathology

Echocardiographic investigation extends to possible valvular lesions, both acute and preexisting, like degenerative aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, frequently found in the older population. Acute lesions such as peri‐infarction rupture of a papillary muscle resulting in severe mitral regurgitation may necessitate urgent surgical repair of the valve. Initial examination of the valves in the acute setting, allowing for initiation of treatment, requires reasonable but not necessarily expert skills. A more comprehensive valve examination can be performed later by clinicians highly skilled in valve evaluation (Fig. 2).

### Prediction of postoperative left ventricular systolic function with Doppler-derived dP / dt in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation [^759110e4]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the value of Doppler-derived dP/dt as a predictor of postoperative left ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation, we evaluated 29 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement (n = 17) or valve repair. Doppler-derived dP/dt was determined from the continuous wave Doppler signal of the aortic regurgitation jet preoperatively. Preoperative LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and Doppler-derived dP/dt were 48 ± 11% and 701 ± 204 mm Hg/s, respectively. LVEF decreased to 43 ± 12% at immediate postoperative period and improved to 54 ± 11% at late postoperative period. In multivariate analysis, only dP/dt was an independent predictor of late postoperative LVEF (r = 0.59, P = 0.006). A dP/dt ≤ 700 mm Hg/s was the best predictor of late postoperative systolic dysfunction (LVEF < 50%) with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 75%. Doppler-derived dP/dt may be useful to predict postoperative LV systolic function.

Right ventricular dP/dt — definition and measurement from tricuspid regurgitation (TR) Doppler: RV dP/dt represents the instantaneous rate of pressure rise over time and serves as a surrogate for global right ventricular contractility, and it is estimated using the ascending limb of the continuous‑wave (CW) Doppler TR envelope at a sweep speed of 200 mm/s by measuring the time interval required for the TR velocity to increase from 1 to 2 m/s.

Clinical usefulness and limitations

Arterial catheterization and arterial pressure monitoring are part of the usual care in both critically ill patients with hemodynamic instability and patients undergoing high-risk surgery. Complementary information on LV contractility, as provided by real-time monitoring of arterial dP/dt max, may add valuable information on the dynamic cardiac function assessment of these patients over time and on treatments. Moreover, the combined data derived from the analysis of the arterial pressure, such as preload dependency and cardiac output, in combination with the continuous assessment of contractility by arterial dP/dt max, could add a comprehensive evaluation of the hemodynamic status and may help to improve future resuscitation algorithms.

A few limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. First, LV and arterial dP/dt max should be interpreted with caution in patients with aortic valvular disease or the presence of LV tract obstruction. Aortic stenosis or dynamic LV tract obstruction, for example, creates a significant pressure gradient over the aortic valve, and thus a large difference between LV dP/dt max and arterial dP/dt max. Second, peripheral-to-central decoupling in arterial pressure, as described during septic shock, may alter the relationship between LV and arterial dP/dt max, so our results may differ in septic shock conditions. Third, our experimental protocol involved many different hemodynamic conditions, and these modifications were sequentially generated or could be not fully represented, as during bleeding stage, where the hemodynamic changes were partially compensated. Fourth, although we have carefully checked the arterial pressure signal quality, we used fluid-filled catheters for assessing arterial dP/dt max instead of pressure-tipped catheters, which are known to be exposed to overdamping/underdamping phenomena. Finally, our study was performed on healthy pigs submitted to anesthesia with known cardiovascular effects, so our results should be interpreted with caution when extrapolating to human cardiovascular physiology.

### Preoperative echocardiographically derived mean dP / dTic predicts early post-operative dysfunction in children undergoing mitral valve surgery [^6f2f98d9]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mean dP/dt ic is a quantitative measurement of ventricular function that can be obtained noninvasively by echocardiography. In adults with mitral regurgitation (MR), it has been shown to be a more sensitive predictor of postoperative left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). The utility of dP/dt ic in pediatric congenital heart diseases with MR has been underexplored. Patients (0 to ≤ 19 years) with MR who underwent mitral valve (MV) repair or replacement from 2015 to 2021 were included. Echocardiographically derived mean dP/dt ic, Tei index, and EF were used to assess and compare ventricular function prior to, shortly after, and late after MV surgery. Study cohort included 61 patients (age 4.5 [IQR 0.14, 18.7] years, 89% MV repair, 11% MV replacement). Median time intervals between surgery and preoperative, early postoperative, and late postoperative echocardiograms were 6 days, 6 days, and 350 days, respectively. Median EF was 62% (z-score - 0.40) preoperatively, 56% (z-score - 1.40) early postoperatively, and 61% (z-score - 0.60) late postoperatively. Median dP/dt ic was 1393 (IQR 1029, 1775) mmHg/s preoperatively, 1178 (IQR 886, 1946) mmHg/s early postoperatively, and 1270 (IQR 791, 1765) mmHg/s late postoperatively. Preoperative median dP/dt ic correlated with early and late postoperative EF. Preoperative EF was not significantly correlated with early postoperative EF, but was correlated with late postoperative EF. Mitral valve intervention in pediatric patients is associated with an initial decline but subsequent recovery of systolic function. Non-invasively derived mean dP/dt ic may offer advantages over other preoperative echocardiographic indices to predict postoperative systolic function.

### Hemodynamic assessment of aortic Regurgitation after transcatheter Aortic valve replacement: the diastolic pressure-time index [^1f72004c]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Assessment of aortic regurgitation (AR) immediately after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is essential to guide further intervention in cases of relevant AR. It was the aim of this study to identify a simple and reproducible hemodynamic parameter for the assessment of AR.

Background

Relevant AR after TAVR is present in up to 21% of cases and might be associated with adverse long-term outcomes.

Methods

Three hundred sixty-two consecutive patients who were treated with TAVR for symptomatic aortic valve stenosis were analyzed. AR was assessed by aortic root angiography according to the Sellers classification. For hemodynamic evaluation, the diastolic pressure-time (DPT) index was calculated after TAVR: the area between the aortic and left ventricular pressure-time curves was measured during diastole and divided by the duration of diastole to calculate the DPT index. The DPT index was finally adjusted for the respective systolic blood pressure: DPT indexadj = (DPT index/systolic blood pressure) × 100.

Results

Patients with angiographically nonrelevant AR (grade < 2) had higher DPT indexadj (30.7 ± 6.8) compared with those with relevant AR (grade ≥ 2) (26.2 ± 5.8) (p < 0.05). Patients with DPT indexadj ≤ 27.9 had significantly higher 1-year mortality risk in comparison with those with DPT indexadj > 27.9: 41.4% versus 13.5% (hazard ratio: 3.8; 95% confidence interval: 2.4 to 5.9; p [log rank-test] < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, DPT indexadj ≤ 27.9 was the strongest independent predictor of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 2.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.8 to 3.7; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

DPT indexadj is a simple, investigator-independent parameter that should be considered to differentiate between relevant and nonrelevant AR after TAVR.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^5dfb6ac4]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Rheumatic mitral stenosis — transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the imaging modality of choice to define anatomy and functional significance, and Doppler mean transvalvular gradients always should be reported with heart rate to avoid overestimation at high rates. Use of 3D echocardiography (either TTE or transesophageal echocardiography [TEE]) provides greater accuracy of mitral valve area measurement; estimated right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure is obtained from tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity; and concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) should be quantified along with other valve lesions. Additional assessment includes mitral pressure half-time, and if the mean gradient does not match the valve area, other methods such as the continuity equation should be considered.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^201caf2c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Right ventricular dP/dt quantifies the instantaneous rate of pressure rise over time and is used as an index of RV contractility and global systolic function; RV dP/dt < 400 mm Hg/s is abnormal. It is measured from the ascending limb of the continuous-wave Doppler tricuspid regurgitation signal at a sweep speed of 200 mm/s by timing the velocity increase from 1 to 2 m/s, which corresponds to a 12 mm Hg pressure rise from 4 to 16 mm Hg. In precapillary pulmonary hypertension, decreased RV dP/dt is a strong predictor of mortality. Recommendation: RV dP/dt measurements can be considered in patients with RV dysfunction as adjunctive evidence to support other echocardiographic measures; however, due to a lack of normative data, RV dP/dt is not recommended for routine practice.

### Recommendations on the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve stenosis: a focused update from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^2f6d98c5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Associated pathologies — aortic regurgitation (AR) in adults with aortic stenosis (AS) is frequent and typically mild to moderate; measures of AS severity generally remain valid, but high transaortic flow increases maximum velocity and mean gradient for a given valve area, and moderate AS with moderate AR signifies severe combined valve disease, with velocity and mean gradient remaining major outcome predictors.

### Methods for assessment of left ventricular systolic function in technically difficult patients with poor imaging quality [^74d6ab34]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Low credibility.

The assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function is often the most important information obtained during clinical echocardiography. Although LV systolic function may be visually estimated in many patients with or without contrast opacification, technically difficult patients may require alternative methods for evaluating LV systolic function. In this review, the authors describe several surrogate echocardiographic methods that might be helpful for the evaluation of LV systolic function in patients with poor image quality, including endocardial border delineation by contrast agents, mitral annular plane systolic excursion, mitral annular velocity derived from tissue Doppler, systolic time intervals, mitral regurgitation-derived LV dP/dt, and estimation of cardiac output by Doppler echocardiography. After a short introduction to the various issues involved, the authors propose a method for suitable measurement. In addition, indications and clinical implications, as well as limitations, of the different methods are discussed.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^059ed9c8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation — Application notes include no major challenges to guideline use in aortic stenosis except when moderate to severe MAC coexists; in severe aortic regurgitation (AR) the AR jet can contaminate mitral inflow velocity recordings requiring careful sample positioning, severe acute AR features abbreviated LV diastolic filling period, premature mitral valve closure, and diastolic MR indicating elevated LV filling pressures, and chronic severe AR often shows predominant early diastolic filling with short deceleration time of mitral E velocity.

### Usefulness of clinical assessment of the carotid pulse in the diagnosis of aortic stenosis [^25209a06]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

In a prospective controlled study, we compared the blinded assessment of the carotid pulse (independent of other clinical signs) by 1 of 3 cardiologists with applanation tonometry on the radial and carotid pulse (time to dominant peak and maximum rate of rise [-dP/dt]). We studied 23 patients with significant isolated aortic stenosis (AS) and 23 control patients. The odds ratio of finding a slowly rising pulse, representing AS, compared with a finding of a "normal"/"indeterminate" pulse was 10.4. Radial dP/dt was significantly lower in the group with AS, whereas carotid dP/dt was not significantly different between the 2 groups.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^e2abe80f]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Table 6 (continued) — adult echocardiography reporting measurements and units are specified for mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic valve (AoV) and aortic regurgitation (AR), and tricuspid valve/regurgitation (TV/TR), with each row listing the measurement name, abbreviation, unit, and the "Suggested number of decimal places". For MR, examples include MR peak pressure gradient (MR peak PG) recorded in mm Hg with 0 decimals, MR dp/dt in mm Hg/s with 0, MR vena contracta (MR VC) in cm with 1, 3D MR vena contracta area (3D MR VCA) in cm2 with 2, and MR PISA EROA in cm2 with 2. For the Aortic Valve (AoV), examples include AoV peak velocity (AoV peak vel) in m/s with 1, AoV peak gradient (AoV peak PG) in mm Hg with 0, AoV mean gradient in mm Hg with 0, AoV velocity time integral (AoV VTI) in cm with 0, and the AoV dimensionless index (either by velocity or by VTI) with unit N/A and 2 decimals. For aortic regurgitation, AR peak velocity is in m/s with 1 and AR pressure half-time (AR PHT) is in ms with 0. For the tricuspid valve, TV peak E-wave velocity (TV E) is in m/s with 2, TV E/A ratio is N/A with 1, TV peak pressure gradient (TV peak PG) is in mm Hg with 0, and TV velocity time integral (TV VTI) is in cm with 0; additional tricuspid regurgitation examples include TR peak velocity (TRmax Vel) in m/s with 1 and TR PISA EROA in cm2 with 2.

### Recommendations on the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve stenosis: a focused update from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^49373202]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) for aortic stenosis in left ventricular (LV) dysfunction uses a low-dose protocol, starting at 2.5 or 5 μg/kg/min with an incremental increase every 3–5 min to a maximum dose of 10–20 μg/kg/min. There is a risk of arrhythmia so there must be medical supervision and high doses of dobutamine should be avoided. The infusion should be stopped as soon as a positive result is obtained — ≥ 20% increase in stroke volume (SV) from baseline or an increase in aortic stenosis (AS) jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or a mean gradient ≥ 30–40 mmHg provided that valve area does not exceed 1.0 cm2 at any flow rate — or when the heart rate rises more than 10–20 bpm over baseline or exceeds 100 bpm; dobutamine should also be terminated when symptoms, blood pressure fall, or significant arrhythmias occur. An increase in effective aortic valve area (AVA) to a final value > 1.0 cm2 suggests that stenosis is not severe, while absence of contractile reserve (failure to increase SV by > 20%) is a predictor of a high surgical mortality and poor long-term outcome.

### Echocardiographic assessment of valve stenosis: EAE / ASE recommendations for clinical practice [^b6b461e8]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Mitral stenosis — associated findings and thromboembolic risk assessment emphasize transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) when appropriate. Left atrial spontaneous contrast as assessed by TEE is a better predictor of thromboembolic risk than left atrial size, and transoesophageal echocardiography has a much higher sensitivity than the transthoracic approach to diagnose left atrial thrombus, particularly when located in the left atrial appendage. Associated mitral regurgitation (MR) should be quantified with semi-quantitative and quantitative measures, paying particular attention to intermediate severity, since more than mild regurgitation is a relative contraindication for balloon mitral commissurotomy; the presence of MR does not alter mitral stenosis quantitation except for the continuity-equation valve area. In severe aortic regurgitation the T1/2 method for assessing mitral stenosis is not valid, and methods for quantitating tricuspid regurgitation are not well established and are highly sensitive to loading conditions.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^eb9274e5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 17 — impact of multivalvular disease on assessment of valvular regurgitation with Doppler echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) — details lesion-specific effects and provides CMR quantification formulas. In aortic stenosis (AS), assessment of aortic regurgitation (AR) has little impact, although hemodynamically significant AR will increase the AS gradient, and for CMR the phase-contrast plane is better in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). AS influences mitral regurgitation (MR): for constant regurgitant orifice area (ROA), regurgitant volume (RVol) increases in proportion to the square root of excess pressure; jet area is exaggerated beyond this, and ROA may increase if the left ventricle dilates. With AR coexisting with MR, left ventricular dilation may increase ROA, mixed regurgitant lesions render volumetric methods challenging because net forward flow must be sought (e.g., right ventricular outflow tract), and for CMR the formulas are MV RVol = LVSV - aortic forward flow; MR Reg fraction = MR RVol/ (LVSV - AR RVol). Mitral stenosis (MS) has little direct impact on AR, although delayed left ventricular filling might theoretically lengthen AR pressure half-time, and if the mitral valve is heavily calcified, it may shadow and decrease jet area and the appearance of the jet. For MS, the lesion is most likely to increase pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and thus worsen RVol and jet area. Mitral regurgitation coexisting with AR has little direct impact, but mixed regurgitant lesions render volumetric methods challenging, and rapid early filling may decrease AR pressure half-time. For pulmonic stenosis (PS), pulmonic regurgitation (PR) assessment has little impact although PR will exacerbate the PS gradient; for CMR the phase-contrast plane is better in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). In PS, increased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) will worsen RVol and jet area for tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and if right ventricular dysfunction occurs, ROA may increase. With PR affecting TR, increased right ventricular volume may increase ROA and worsen RVol and jet area; CMR formulas are TRVvol = RVSV - pulmonic forward flow. TR Reg fraction = TR RVol/ (RVSV - PR RVol). Tricuspid stenosis (TS) has little direct impact, although concomitant TR will exacerbate the TS gradient. TR can alter PR interpretation because rapid right ventricular filling from TR may further shorten PR pressure half-time and make the color PR jet more brief.

Aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation — diastolic dysfunction, including elevated LV filling pressures, predicts worse outcomes in moderate or severe aortic stenosis (AS), and it is therefore recommended that assessment of LV diastolic function status be carried out in all patients with AS and be included in the report. In severe aortic regurgitation (AR), the AR jet can interfere with mitral inflow recording so careful sample volume positioning is needed; severe acute AR features (abbreviated LV diastolic filling period, premature mitral valve closure, and diastolic MR) indicate elevated LV filling pressures. In chronic severe AR, early diastolic–predominant inflow with short E-wave deceleration is typical but accuracy data are limited; in AR, LA enlargement, average E/e′ > 14, LARS < 68%, and peak TR velocity > 2.8 m/s support increased LV filling pressures.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic: examination in children and all patients with congenital heart disease: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^2ab7a305]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) assessment — transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): Quantification of valve stenosis and regurgitation should be performed according to previously published echocardiographic guidelines, and for AoV/LVOT stenosis the TG LAX and DTG 5-Ch views provide excellent angles of insonation for both PW and CW Doppler evaluation of preoperative and postoperative gradients; a peak gradient > 40 mm Hg in the LVOT may be hemodynamically significant and require reintervention, though immediately post-bypass TEE may not accurately reflect residual obstruction. For aortic regurgitation, a regurgitant jet width > 4 mm by color Doppler at the valve leaflets may represent a risk for hemodynamically significant aortic regurgitation postoperatively, and additional reported risk factors for early reoperation include concomitant valve-sparing aortic root and/or ascending aortic replacement and leaflet prolapse.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^f7395b32]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Mitral regurgitation — cardiac catheterization utility is described as follows: Left ventriculography and hemodynamic measurements are useful when clinical assessment and noninvasive tests are inconclusive or discordant with regard to severity of MR, LV function, or the need for surgery; noninvasive imaging is adequate for evaluation of MR in most cases, but invasive hemodynamic evaluation may be necessary when there is a clinical discrepancy between symptom status and noninvasive testing; elevated filling pressures support a cardiac cause of dyspnea and may indicate severely abnormal pathophysiology even when the patient claims to be asymptomatic.

### Right ventricular dP / dt / P (max), not dP / dt (max), noninvasively derived from tricuspid regurgitation velocity is a useful index of right ventricular contractility [^76919f0b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although right ventricular (RV) contractility is important in determining functional capacity, few quantification methods are clinically available. RV dP/dt(max) can be assessed by Doppler echocardiography by using tricuspid regurgitation (TR) but is not routinely used because of its dependency on a Doppler incident angle and preload. Doppler-derived dP/dt/P(max) is relatively insensitive to preload and theoretically independent of the incident angle. We investigated the clinical feasibility of this index as an RV contractility index.

Methods

We computed RV dP/dt(max) and dP/dt/P(max) from the TR-derived RV pressure in 68 patients with dominant RV failure (13 in New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I, 33 in class II, 17 in class III, and 5 in class IV). Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO(2)) was measured in 20 patients during a maximal bicycle ergometer test.

Results

dP/dt(max) did not significantly correlate with NYHA class. In contrast, dP/dt/P(max) decreased monotonically with the functional class (r = -0.49, P < .0001), and correlated with peak VO(2) (r = 0.66, P < .002).

Conclusion

TR-derived dP/dt/P(max), not dP/dt(max), is a clinically useful index of RV contractility, allowing researchers to account for the functional capacity.

### Interstitial fibrosis and diastolic Dysfunction in aortic stenosis [^12e10a71]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

From a clinical standpoint, the results of this study further inform our understanding of the importance of LV diastolic dysfunction in aortic stenosis. Recent clinical research has focused on the role of diastolic properties in aortic stenosis by evaluating interstitial fibrosis. This can be quantified by CMR and may be the result of the aortic stenosis or concomitant comorbidity from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or amyloid deposition, which are particularly common in the elderly patient population. Quantifying fibrosis in aortic stenosis can also predict the likelihood of reversible systolic dysfunction and improvement in heart failure prior to valve replacement. The increases in collagen content demonstrated by pathology in the present study would be difficult to quantify with precision using current CMR imaging techniques. Thus, the proposed biomechanical assessment developed by Torres et al. may identify the progression of diastolic myocardial disease before fibrosis develops. Comparative prospective serial studies correlating echocardiographic indices of LV diastolic distensibility, CMR fibrosis, and prognosis or persistent symptoms after aortic valve replacement will be required to address this.

Clinical studies demonstrate that patients with HFpEF infrequently progress to systolic dysfunction and usually this is related to underlying coronary artery disease. In contrast, prior animal models of sustained pressure overload from aortic banding as well as models of severe hypertension usually demonstrate a progression from preserved to depressed systolic function. This transition is dependent on a number of variables including the severity and duration of pressure overload. Whereas ejection fraction did not decline within the 5-week time frame of the present study, the 5-week time point may be at the threshold of the transition to systolic dysfunction. This is suggested by a reduction in circumferential systolic strain, a marked reduction in LV contractility assessed by LV +dP/dt and an increased N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide in animals studied at the 5- versus 4-week time point. Whether this would remain stable is unclear, and it seems plausible that a longer duration of pressure overload may have resulted in the predictable transition from a phenotype-dominated diastolic dysfunction to systolic dysfunction. Understanding the longer-term progression of this model along with studies to assess subendocardial perfusion would help address whether the alterations in biomechanical properties are related to diastolic properties, subendocardial ischemia, or reflect an early predictor of systolic dysfunction.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^63869a4c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiography reporting — valvular regurgitation and stenosis severity qualifiers state that "These severity qualifiers are supported by well-established published parameters. Numerical grading (e.g., grade I–IV) may also be included when supported by guideline-established criteria… However, reporting numerical grades alone without the standard guideline recommended qualifiers is discouraged". The committee notes the historical use of multiple terms for less-than-mild regurgitation and explicitly states, "We recommend the use of 'trace' in place of all other 'less than mild' regurgitation descriptors". It further states, "'Trace' regurgitation of a structurally normal native valve or a prosthetic valve may be considered normal, whereas mild or greater aortic or mitral valve regurgitation should be classified as abnormal", and that for pulmonary valves "mild regurgitation may be regarded as a normal functional finding (physiologic)", with "A statement such as 'mild tricuspid regurgitation is present, which may be within normal limits', can be used in the report". For valve regurgitation, "reporting tools should include the options: no (none), trace, mild, moderate and severe", and for valve stenosis, "reporting tools should include the options: no (none), mild, moderate, severe", with "'Very severe' valve stenosis may be used when criteria are met according to established guidelines". The guideline clarifies that "'Critical' valve stenosis is not explicitly defined in major guidelines", though a lesion may be described as a "'critical result'" based on context, and that the classifications "'mild-to-moderate' and 'moderate-to-severe'… should be used sparingly when data is insufficient to assign a specific classification".

### Recommendations on the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve stenosis: a focused update from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^e50817ae]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in aortic stenosis (AS) should report AS velocity, mean gradient, stroke volume (SV), and valve area at each stage, with ejection fraction (EF) measured at least at baseline and peak effect. Reliable findings are: an increase in effective aortic valve area (AVA) to a final valve area > 1.0 cm2 suggests that stenosis is not severe; > 20% increase in SV from baseline suggests presence of contractile reserve; severe stenosis is suggested by an AS jet velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or a mean gradient > 30–40 mmHg provided that valve area does not exceed 1.0 cm2 at any flow rate; and absence of contractile reserve (failure to increase SV by > 20%) is a predictor of a high surgical mortality and poor long-term outcome although valve replacement may improve left ventricular function and outcome even in this subgroup.

### Continual measurement of arterial dP / dtenables minimally invasive monitoring of left ventricular contractility in patients with acute heart failure [^a95283ce]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Consecutive patients admitted between January and September 2018 to the cardiology intensive care unit due to acute heart failure requiring an arterial line for invasive blood pressure monitoring and central venous catheter were eligible for the study. Patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis, those who required mechanical circulatory support, and those with absence of mitral regurgitation enabling measurement of LV dP/dt max were excluded. All patients have to be at the time of measurement on stable doses of inotropes/vasopressors, on stable ventilation support, and with regular cardiac rhythm.

Hemodynamic measurement

Arterial blood pressure (mean), central venous pressure (mean), heart rate, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), dynamic arterial elastance, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were measured using a clinical monitoring platform (EV1000, equipped with HPI software, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) connected to the arterial and central venous lines. SVR was calculated using the formula: SVR = 80 × (MAP − CVP)/CO. The dynamic arterial elastance was defined as the ratio of pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation. All parameters were calculated in the 20-s interval that contains few respiratory cycles. An arterial catheter was inserted into the left or right radial artery, and the left or right jugular vein was used for central venous access, with the tip of catheter in the superior vena cava.

dP/dt max measurement

Arterial dP/dt max was measured from the arterial pressure curve by the EV1000 system and HPI software. The system calculates dP/dt max for each beat in a 20-s cycle, then the median value of all the dP/dt max values in the 20-s interval is displayed; values obtained at the time of LV dP/dt max were used in the analysis. LV dP/dt max was measured at the end of expiration using transthoracic echocardiography (Phillips CX50, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) from the analysis of the mitral regurgitation jet by continuous-wave Doppler; calculation was based on the time interval (T) between blood flow of 1 m/s and 3 m/s using the formula: LV dP/dt max = 32/T. Three measurements were performed at one time, and the mean values were used for analysis. The echocardiographic measurements were performed by an experienced physician who was blinded to the arterial dP/dt max values.

Adult echocardiography reporting — aortic valve covers morphology/structure and function for stenosis and regurgitation. Recommended reported findings include whether the aortic valve is structurally normal and that additionally reporting a trileaflet valve is recommended, and for structural abnormalities to describe bicuspid (describe type), unicuspid, or quadricuspid valves as well as thickening, annular or valvular calcification, perforation, masses and suspected etiology, and other valvular abnormalities. For stenosis, describe restricted leaflet motion, doming, eccentric closure, or flail, state presence or absence with grading (mild, moderate, severe) and report mechanism if possible, and include quantitative measurements such as peak velocity and gradient, mean gradient, aortic valve area and method (continuity equation, 2D or 3D planimetry), and the dimensionless index. For regurgitation, state presence or absence with grading (mild, moderate, severe), report mechanism (primary, secondary, or mixed) if possible, and include vena contracta width or area, jet percentage of LVOT diameter, pressure half-time (PHT), diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta, effective regurgitant orifice, regurgitant volume, and regurgitant fraction.

Mitral regurgitation assessment — color flow Doppler (CFD) jet size — requires caution because jet appearance depends on velocity-driven momentum flux and technical/hemodynamic factors; for example, "a 6.0 m/ s MR jet appears 44% larger than a 5.0 m/s MR jet on CFD", and "Low-velocity jets (e.g., 4 m/s) suggest high LA pressure and low LV pressure and, therefore, indicate severe MR with hemodynamic compromise", while MR "can be significantly underestimated when jets have a low driving pressure or are markedly eccentric". Accordingly, "both U.S. and European guidelines recommend that MR jet size assessed by CFD not be used alone to assess MR severity", and "it is crucial to record blood pressure, estimated LV systolic pressure in the presence of aortic stenosis or LV outflow obstruction, heart rate, and rhythm at the time of TTE and to incorporate them when grading MR severity".

Ventricular systolic and diastolic function — concepts and indices used in invasive assessment: Systolic function relates left ventricle (LV) performance to LV preload, and an example is preload-recruitable stroke work, or the linear slope of a Frank–Starling ventricular function curve. Ventricular contractility describes the inotropic state of the whole ventricle, and indices include isovolumic phase indices measured prior to aortic valve opening (dP/dtmax), ejection phase indices (systolic wall stress versus endocardial shortening), and late-systole indices such as Ees, with most of these indices of contractile function only evaluated as part of research protocols. Diastolic function is most broadly dichotomized according to measures reflecting velocity of pressure decay or relaxation during early diastole and factors relating to passive chamber stiffness during late diastole.

### Right ventricular dysfunction and short-term outcomes following left-sided valvular surgery: an echocardiographic study [^37805f52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of echocardiographic evaluation of right ventricular (RV) function in patients undergoing left‐sided valvular surgery has not been well described. The objective of this study is to determine the role of broad echocardiographic assessment of RV function in predicting short‐term outcomes after valvular surgery.

Methods and Results

Preoperative echocardiographic data, perioperative adverse outcomes, and 30‐day mortality were analyzed in patients who underwent left‐sided valvular surgery from 2006 to 2014. Echocardiographic parameters used to evaluate RV function include RV fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, systolic movement of the RV lateral wall using tissue Doppler imaging (S'), RV myocardial performance index, and RV dP/dt. Subjects with at least 3 abnormal parameters out of the 5 aforementioned indices were defined as having significant RV dysfunction. The study included 269 patients with valvular surgery (average age: 67 ± 15, 60.6% male, 148 aortic, and 121 mitral). RV dysfunction was found in 53 (19.7%) patients; 30‐day mortality occurred in 20 patients (7.5%). Compared with normal RV function, patients with RV dysfunction had higher 30‐day mortality (22.6% versus 3.8%; P = 0.01) and were at risk for developing multisystem failure/shock (13.2% versus 3.2%; P = 0.01). Multivariate analyses showed that preexisting RV dysfunction was the strongest predictor of increased 30‐day mortality (odds ratio: 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1–11.1; P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Preoperative RV dysfunction identified by comprehensive echocardiographic assessment is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes following left‐sided valvular surgery.

### Performance comparison of ventricular and arterial dP / dtfor assessing left ventricular systolic function during different experimental loading and contractile conditions [^fbe1d95f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular dP/dt max has been traditionally used as a reliable marker of myocardial performance. Under normal conditions, the maximal rate of LV pressure is usually developed during isovolumetric contraction, so theoretically LV dP/dt max should be relatively insensitive to afterload. In our study, LV dP/dt tmax was not related to afterload changes according to the lack of influence of Ea. Previous studies have demonstrated that LV dP/dt max remains independent of afterload within physiological levels of blood pressure, but it could be affected by large reductions in afterload. On the other hand, because the arterial dP/dt max occurs during the ejection phase just after the opening of the aortic valve, it is then exposed to the influence of the arterial system. Furthermore, as the arterial pressure is recorded further away from the LV, the impact of arterial factors such as reflected pressure waves is more evident. Moreover, as dP/dt max reflects the need for the pressure to grow in a given time at a constant diastolic pressure, the higher the systolic pressure to achieve, the potentially higher the dP/dt max. Therefore, the differences in the absolute magnitude observed between LV dP/dt max and peripheral dP/dt max should be interpreted under this perspective: the outflow of blood flow by definition reduces the absolute value of dP/dt max measured at any arterial site, and the central-to-peripheral dP/dt max gradient represents the tapering effect of the arterial system, buffering the intraventricular pressure into a more compliant system, while a greater radial dP/dt max may represent the impact of a lower compliance and the earlier wave reflections on the systolic part of the arterial pressure waveform. However, despite the effect of the arterial system properties on the dP/dt max, its contribution was significantly lower when compared with the prominent impact of contractility changes. Moreover, our data suggest that femoral dP/dt max may be used even in patients with vasoplegia or treated with vasoactive agents.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^c6f04d8c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Prognostic relevance of measurements of RV function — predictor modalities and variables are summarized as follows: RHC-derived predictors of outcomes include CO, right atrial pressure, PVR, and PAP. Echocardiographic predictors include pericardial effusion, right heart dimensions, estimated RV diastolic pressure, tricuspid regurgitation, TAPSE, maximum tissue velocity of isovolumic contraction, dP/dt, strain, asynchrony and regional inhomogeneity of RV contraction, myocardial performance index, RV fractional area change, right atrial size and index, and RV contractile reserve, and these data suggest that echocardiography offers prognostication via measures of RV systolic function, dimensions, and estimates of filling pressures. CMR-derived predictors include SV, end-diastolic volume, RVEF, end-systolic volume (ESV), SV/ESV, and late gadolinium enhancement; the latter, however, is not uniformly confirmed. CMR therefore offers prognostication from measures of systolic function and right heart dimensions, and a recent CMR-based study used machine learning of patterns of RV motion for outcome prediction in PH.

### Evaluation of left ventricular short-and long-axis function in severe mitral regurgitation using 2-dimensional strain echocardiography [^bac60f29]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Few data exist on the changes in left ventricular (LV) short- and long-axis function and their usefulness as markers of LV contractile function in patients with chronic, severe mitral regurgitation (MR).

Methods

We studied 59 patients who had severe MR with an ejection fraction ≥ 50% and 34 healthy controls. Speckle tracking imaging was performed to measure peak systolic radial (SR(R)), circumferential (SR(C)), and longitudinal strain rates (SR(L)). In all patients, the peak rate of LV pressure rise (peak dP/dt) was measured using a micromanometer-tipped catheter. The patients were subdivided into patients with preserved (group 1, peak dP/dt ≥ 1,300 mm Hg/s [n = 30]) and depressed (group 2 [n = 29]) contractile function.

Results

SR(L) was significantly depressed in groups 1 and 2 when compared with the control group, but there was no difference between groups 1 and 2. In contrast, SR(R) and SR(C) were depressed only in group 2, whereas there were no differences between the control group and group 1. SR(R) and SR(C) correlated well with peak dP/dt (r = 0.71, P < .001 and r = -0.63, P < .001, respectively), whereas SR(L) did not. These findings suggest that LV long-axis function becomes depressed earlier than short-axis function in the chronic remodeling process.

Conclusions

Left ventricular short-axis function is a useful marker of LV contractility in patients with chronic, severe MR. Left ventricular long-axis function becomes depressed earlier in the chronic remodeling process. Therefore, evaluation of short-axis as well as long-axis function might be important for better assessment of LV contractile function in these patients.

### American Society of Echocardiography recommendations for performance, interpretation, and application of stress echocardiography [^5bceef15]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2007). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation — exercise/stress echocardiography can quantify severity and reveal dynamic changes. Evaluation is possible with quantitative and semiquantitative color Doppler methods, and exercise echocardiography has uncovered severe mitral regurgitation during exercise in rheumatic mitral valve disease despite only mild mitral stenosis and regurgitation at rest. It is of value for identifying hemodynamically significant dynamic mitral regurgitation in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction; in some patients dynamic mitral regurgitation can account for acute pulmonary edema and predicts poor outcome. In severe mitral regurgitation with normal ejection fraction (EF) at rest, stress echocardiography can detect reduced LV contractile reserve.

### Noninvasive assessment of left ventricular isovolumic contraction and relaxation with continuous wave Doppler aortic regurgitant velocity signals: an in vivo validation study [^1dc86480]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to provide fundamental in vivo validation of a method with the use of aortic regurgitant (AR) jet signals recorded with continuous wave (CW) Doppler for assessing left ventricular (LV) isovolumic contraction and relaxation. Preliminary studies have suggested that analysis of CW Doppler AR velocity signals permits the estimation of LV positive and negative dP/dt. We studied 19 hemodynamically different states in 6 sheep with surgically induced chronic aortic regurgitation. CW AR velocity spectra and high-fidelity LV and aortic pressures were recorded simultaneously. Rates of LV pressure rise and fall (RPR and RPF) were calculated by determining the time interval between points at 1 m/s and 2.5 m/s in the deceleration and acceleration slopes of the CW Doppler AR velocity envelope (corresponding to a pressure change of 21 mm Hg). RPR and RPF calculated by CW Doppler analysis for each state were compared with the peak positive dP/dt and negative dP/dt, obtained from the corresponding high-fidelity LV pressure curve, respectively. The LV peak positive and negative dP/dt derived by catheter ranged from 817 to 2625 mm Hg/s and from 917 to 2583 mm Hg/s, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that Doppler RPR correlated well with catheter peak positive dP/dt (r = 0.93; mean differences, -413 ± 250 mm Hg/s). There was also good correlation and agreement between Doppler RPF and the catheter peak negative dP/dt (r = 0.89; mean difference, -279 ± 239 mm Hg/s). Both Doppler-determined RPR and RPF underestimated their respective LV peak dP/dt. CW Doppler AR spectra can provide a reliable noninvasive estimate of LV dP/dt and could be helpful in the serial assessment of ventricular function in patients with aortic regurgitation.

Angiographic Evaluation of Paravalvular Regurgitations

Aortography was performed in biplane views including right anterior oblique 30° and left anterior oblique 60° view after valve deployment, by injecting 20 mL of 50:50 diluted dye in 1 s. Aortographic grading of PVR (grades 0–IV) was done by an experienced angiographer (K.S.) who was blinded to all clinical, echocardiographic, and hemodynamic data according to the criteria described by Sandler et al; grade 0 (no PVR) = no regurgitating contrast into the left ventricle (LV); grade I (mild PVR) = a small amount of contrast enters the LV in diastole and is cleared with each beat; grade II AR (moderate PVR) = faint opacification of the entire LV; grade III (moderately severe PVR): opacification of the entire LV to the same degree as the ascending aorta; grade IV (severe PVR): complete, dense opacification of the LV on the first beat and more densely opacified than the ascending aorta. 18

Hemodynamic Measurements

Detailed derivation of ARI, TIARI, and DPTI have been described before. 16, 17, 19 Briefly: on achieving stable hemodynamics after deploying a transcatheter valve, LV and Ao invasive pressures were measured simultaneously. Pre‐BPD and post‐BPD Ao and LV systolic and diastolic pressures were quantified using AXIOM Sensis XP hemodynamic software (Siemens AG, Forcheim, Germany). Area between Ao and LV pressure‐time curves during diastole were measured. Area under LV pressure‐time curve during systole was also measured. Following pre‐BPD and post‐BPD, hemodynamic indices were computed offline by a blinded reviewer (R.G.) as follows (Figure 1):
ARI = [(Ao diastolic pressure−LV end diastolic pressure)/Ao systolic pressure]×100.
TIARI = [(diastolic area difference/diastolic duration)/(LV systolic area/systolic duration)]×100.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^4ba4ad13]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic regurgitation — signal density and pressure half-time criteria state that "the density of the CWD signal reflects the volume of regurgitation", where "A faint or incomplete jet indicates mild or trace regurgitation", but a dense jet "cannot differentiate between moderate and severe AR". For pressure half-time, prerequisites include that "The CW signal has to be adequate with a clear visualization of the decrease in diastolic AR velocity", and severity cutoffs are "A pressure half-time > 500 msec suggests mild AR, and < 200 msec suggests severe AR". Caveats specify that it is affected by LV compliance with "severe chronic regurgitation with well compensated ventricular function" possibly appearing "moderate", mild AR with "severe diastolic dysfunction" may have short pressure half-time, "vasodilator therapy" can reduce the gradient, and therefore "this method is less useful for monitoring AR in patients being treated medically".

### Impaired contractile reserve in severe mitral valve regurgitation with a preserved ejection fraction [^6e69c0c8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired contractile reserve in chronic MR results from load-independent, myocyte contractile abnormalities.

Aims

Investigate the mechanisms of contractile dysfunction in chronic mitral valve regurgitation (MR).

Methods

Mild MR was produced in eight dogs followed by pacing induced left ventricular (LV) dilatation over eight months. In-vivo LV dP/dt was measured at several pacing rates. Contractile function was measured in isolated LV trabeculae and myocytes at several stimulation rates and during changes in extracellular [Ca2+]. Identical studies were performed with six control dogs.

Results

Chronic MR resulted in a preserved ejection fraction with decreased dP/dt (p < 0.01). LV trabeculae demonstrated significantly lower developed force and a negative force-frequency relation with chronic MR (p < 0.05). Myocytes exhibited a negative shortening-frequency relationship in both groups with a greater decline with chronic MR (p < 0.001) paralleled by decreases in peak [Ca2+](i) transients. Increases in extracellular [Ca2+] abrogated the defects in force generation in trabeculae from animals with chronic MR.

Conclusion

Even with a preserved EF, chronic severe MR results in a significant reduction in intrinsic contractile function and reserve. Functional impairment was load-independent reflecting a predominant defect in calcium cycling rather than impaired peak force generating capacity due to myofibrillar attenuation.

### Continual measurement of arterial dP / dtenables minimally invasive monitoring of left ventricular contractility in patients with acute heart failure [^96abd25c]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Several authors reported that the arterial dP/dt max is significantly influenced by vascular filling conditions. We observed in our study that the correlation between arterial and LV dP/dt max was influenced by SVR, which reflects loading conditions; however, SV variation or dynamic arterial elastance had no effect on the relationship between arterial and LV dP/dt max. This contrast can be at least partly explained by the fact that in our study, the measurement was done in a single time point, while in the other studies, serial measurements were performed enabling evaluation of dynamic changes. In addition, we included entirely patients with acute left heart failure, where the LV preload is usually increased that may or may not be accompanied by changes in other indirect markers of vascular filling. Our study had several limitations, the first of which was possible bias caused by the small sample size. We designed only a pilot study focusing primarily on feasibility; however, a larger trial should be performed to confirm our results. We also acknowledge that arterial dP/dt max is not only a function of LV contractility but is influenced by many other factors, at least by arterial vessel wall characteristics (e.g. arterial elasticity and stiffness), which was not assessed in the present study. We did not record pulse pressure enabling to calculate arterial elastance. It can be assumed that there can be marked individual differences in arterial system properties in heart failure patients, who often present with other diseases and various degrees of peripheral atherosclerosis. Patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis were ineligible for this study; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that even mild aortic stenosis may have influenced the results. Moreover, in our study, we have performed only single measurements at one time point in each patient. Our study, therefore, was not designed to evaluate the trends in arterial dP/dt max changes. In addition, while the LV dP/dt max values were obtained at the end of expiration, the arterial dP/dt max were calculated as a median value from 20-s interval, therefore not at the same period of respiratory cycle. Finally, LV dP/dt max is only a surrogate marker of LV contractility and measurement of this parameter using echocardiography can be inaccurate.

### Effects of exercise in volume overload: insights from a model of aortic regurgitation [^9b72553f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic valve regurgitation (AR) imposes a pathologic volume overload to the left ventricle (LV), whereas aerobic exercise causes physiologic volume overloading. The impact of combining both LV volume overloads (pathologic and physiologic) is unknown. Considering the known beneficial effects of aerobic training on the cardiovascular system, we hypothesized that the positive effects would outweigh the negative ones and that exercise would improve the tolerance of the LV to AR.

Methods

Forty female adult Wistar rats were randomly divided in the following groups: 1) sham sedentary (SS), 2) sham trained (ST), 3) AR sedentary (ARS), and 4) AR trained (ART). Training consisted in treadmill running for 30 min five times per week at 20 m x s(-1) for 24 wk. In vivo follow-up was made by echocardiography and invasive intracardiac pressure measurements. Hearts were harvested for tissue analysis.

Results

Echocardiography revealed less LV dilation and hypertrophy in ART versus ARS as well as improved myocardial performance index. LV ejection fractions remained similar and within normal range in ART versus ARS. Invasive cardiac pressures yielded improved dP/dt- in ART versus ARS but similar dP/dt+. beta(1)-Adrenergic receptor mRNA expression was improved in the ART group versus ARS.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that a moderate aerobic exercise program helps minimize LV dilation and hypertrophy and improves diastolic cardiac performance in heart submitted to chronic volume overload due to severe aortic valve regurgitation in this animal model.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic pulmonic regurgitation by color Doppler — severity integration algorithm specifies that "Specific Criteria for mild PR" include "Small jet, with narrow width", "Soft or faint CW jet", "Slow deceleration time", and "Normal RV Size", whereas "Specific Criteria for Severe PR" include "Jet width/Annulus ≥ 70%", "Dense jet, PHT < 100 ms", "Early termination of PR flow", "Diastolic flow reversal in PA branches", and "Dilated RV with NL function". When a "Minority of criteria or Intermediate Values" are present, "PR Probably Moderate", and clinicians "May Perform volumetric quantitative methods, if possible, whenever significant PR is suspected". If severity remains "Indeterminate PR", the figure advises "Consider CMR for quantitation", and when "imaging is technically difficult, consider CMR or TEE".

Atrial septal defect (ASD) — right ventricular (RV) function evaluation — notes that "In general, RV function (systolic or diastolic) is not adversely affected by the presence of an ASD; however, in some settings, RV function will be impaired, such as in the presence of significant pulmonary hypertension". When RV systolic function is evaluated, available methods include "dP/dt, myocardial performance index, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, RV ejection fraction from 3D volumetric evaluation, Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) S' velocity, DTI isovolumic myocardial acceleration, and deformation evaluation with RV strain and strain rate". For RV diastolic function, methods include "transtricuspid E and A wave velocities, E/A ratio, DTI E' and A' velocities, E/E' ratio, isovolumic relaxation time, and deceleration time".

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) — continuous wave Doppler (CWD) assessments include density of the regurgitant jet and jet deceleration rate (pressure half-time); for jet density, align the insonation beam with the flow because density is proportional to the number of red blood cells reflecting the signal, and a faint or incomplete jet is compatible with mild or trace AR, though perfectly central jets may appear denser than eccentric jets of higher severity and there can be overlap between moderate and severe AR; for jet deceleration rate, imaging is usually best from apical windows and in eccentric jets may be best from the parasternal window with color Doppler, it is a specific sign of the pressure relation between the aorta and LV, and if long it excludes severe AR, while poor beam alignment can lower the measured pressure half-time and changes that modify the LV-aorta pressure gradient can shorten it and imply significant AR or high LV filling pressure.

### Perioperative assessment of myocardial deformation [^444fb515]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of left ventricular performance improves risk assessment and guides anesthetic decisions. However, the most common echocardiographic measure of myocardial function, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), has important limitations. LVEF is limited by subjective interpretation that reduces accuracy and reproducibility, and LVEF assesses global function without characterizing regional myocardial abnormalities. An alternative objective echocardiographic measure of myocardial function is thus needed. Myocardial deformation analysis, which performs quantitative assessment of global and regional myocardial function, may be useful for perioperative care of surgical patients. Myocardial deformation analysis evaluates left ventricular mechanics by quantifying strain and strain rate. Strain describes percent change in myocardial length in the longitudinal (from base to apex) and circumferential (encircling the short-axis of the ventricle) direction and change in thickness in the radial direction. Segmental strain describes regional myocardial function. Strain is a negative number when the ventricle shortens longitudinally or circumferentially and is positive with radial thickening. Reference values for normal longitudinal strain from a recent meta-analysis by using transthoracic echocardiography are (mean ± SD) -19.7% ± 0.4%, while radial and circumferential strain are 47.3% ± 1.9% and -23.3% ± 0.7%, respectively. The speed of myocardial deformation is also important and is characterized by strain rate. Longitudinal systolic strain rate in healthy subjects averages -1.10 ± 0.16 s. Assessment of myocardial deformation requires consideration of both strain (change in deformation), which correlates with LVEF, and strain rate (speed of deformation), which correlates with rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt). Myocardial deformation analysis also evaluates ventricular relaxation, twist, and untwist, providing new and noninvasive methods to assess components of myocardial systolic and diastolic function. Myocardial deformation analysis is based on either Doppler or a non-Doppler technique, called speckle-tracking echocardiography. Myocardial deformation analysis provides quantitative measures of global and regional myocardial function for use in the perioperative care of the surgical patient. For example, coronary graft occlusion after coronary artery bypass grafting is detected by an acute reduction in strain in the affected coronary artery territory. In addition, assessment of left ventricular mechanics detects underlying myocardial pathology before abnormalities become apparent on conventional echocardiography. Certainly, patients with aortic regurgitation demonstrate reduced longitudinal strain before reduction in LVEF occurs, which allows detection of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction and predicts increased risk for heart failure and impaired myocardial function after surgical repair. In this review, we describe the principles, techniques, and clinical application of myocardial deformation analysis.

When is CMR indicated? The primary indication of CMR is the evaluation of MR severity when assessment by echocardiography is felt to be unsatisfactory or when there is a discrepancy between MR severity and clinical findings. CMR may provide additional information about the mechanism of MR and myocardial viability, and CMR importantly provides quantitative evaluation of chamber size, RVol, and fraction.

### Etiology… [^3ee23f9b]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Etiology Aortic regurgitation can have many causes, including diseases that affect connective tissue, which is the substance of the aortic valve and the ascending aorta. In most of these diseases, aortic regurgitation progresses gradually, allowing time for the left ventricle to accommodate the large diastolic volume by increasing its end-diastolic size and developing eccentric hypertrophy. A few diseases can cause sudden severe aortic regurgitation. In these diseases, the clinical picture of acute aortic regurgitation results from a sudden and marked increase in diastolic filling volume, with no chance for the left ventricle or the stiff pericardium to accommodate this increase. In chronic aortic regurgitation, the regurgitant leak increases gradually so that the end-diastolic left ventricular volume becomes greater. The left ventricle responds with dilatation and hypertrophy.

With a large left ventricle, stroke volume increases enough to keep the forward effective stroke volume normal and accommodate the regurgitant volume. As the aortic regurgitation becomes severe, the increased left ventricular stroke volume delivered into the aorta results in a high systolic pressure, and the rapid runoff from the aorta back into the left ventricle results in a lower aortic diastolic pressure. Ultimately, the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure increases. The aorta becomes dilated and elongated, which explains the uncoiled aorta usually seen on the chest radiograph. In severe aortic regurgitation, the retrograde flow back into the left ventricle results in the to-and-fro bruit created by pressure with the bell of the stethoscope placed over the femoral artery. The rapid ejection of the large stroke volume leads to a sharp rise in the pulse wave, resulting in the "pistol-shot" femoral artery sound.

If the aortic regurgitation is mild, the murmur may be quite high-pitched and may fade out during diastole. If the aortic regurgitation is moderate to severe and chronic, the murmur, although still blowing, is of lower frequency and louder, and usually lasts throughout diastole. Because of the large left ventricular stroke volume, a systolic ejection murmur may also be heard. This murmur can be loud and long enough to sound like aortic stenosis.

### Echocardiographic assessment of aortic stenosis severity: Do not rely on a single parameter [^23abfa9d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

This lack of accuracy in AS severity evaluation could be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the time to peak velocity is highly dependent on heart rate. Indeed, the fastest the heart rate is, the shortest the time to peak velocity is, regardless of AS severity. In order to overcome this limitation, some researchers proposed to divide time to peak velocity by the LV ejection time in series of patients with aortic bioprosthetic valves. 11 This ratio was much better than time to peak velocity to discriminate normal prosthetic valves versus prosthetic valves with significant stenosis. This ratio of time to peak velocity/LV ejection time was, however, not evaluated for assessment of severity of native AS. Another potential factor that could impair accuracy of time to peak velocity to assess AS severity is the presence of LV systolic dysfunction. Interestingly, in the present study by Kamimura et al, 8 a decrease in LVEF was independently correlated with an increase in time to peak velocity. Indeed, if the systolic ventricular function is weaker or if the transvalvular flow rate is attenuated, it will take more time to open the aortic valve, regardless of the severity of stenosis. Hence, a patient with depressed LV function or reduced LV outflow may have relatively long time to peak velocity despite nonsevere AS. The dependence of the time to peak velocity vis‐à‐vis LV chronotropy and inotropy raises serious concerns about its usefulness in routine clinical practice. Further studies will be necessary in order to validate this parameter as well as the ratio of time to peak velocity/ejection time.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Impact of regurgitation on cardiac remodeling — acute versus chronic and measurement considerations: As blood is incompressible, the regurgitant volume (RVol) must be contained in the cardiac cavities affected, implying that some degree of cavity dilation is proportional to the severity and chronicity of regurgitation. Acute severe regurgitation is characterized by a large regurgitant orifice, but cavity dilatation is minimized, and consequently may be brief, with low RVol and little cavity dilatation. In chronic regurgitation, however, cavity dilatation should reflect the regurgitation severity and duration, and it may be specific for significant regurgitation when ventricular function is preserved but loses specificity in conditions such as cardiomyopathy or ischemic ventricular dysfunction. Measuring cavity diameters rather than volumes has inherent limitations as the diameter-volume relationship is nonlinear; current normal ranges are based on a limited number of subjects, with small body size a particular concern in females where normalizing measurements to body size may provide a more accurate assessment. Nevertheless, in a patient with regurgitation, an enlarged ventricle is consistent with significant regurgitation in the chronic setting in the absence of other modulating factors, particularly when ventricular function is normal.

### Immediate impact of successful percutaneous mitral valve commissurotomy on echocardiographic measures of right ventricular contractility [^3a4e2cc3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Functional analysis of the right ventricle cannot be reliably evaluated by conventional echocardiography, because of its complex geometry and load dependence of ejection phase indices. The Tei index, dP/dt, and myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction are parameters of right ventricular (RV) contractility unaffected by RV geometry. However, the effect of loading conditions on these parameters is controversial. The aim of this study was to examine how afterload reduction observed after percutaneous transverse mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) in patients with mitral stenosis affects these measures of RV contractility.

Methods

Fifty-eight patients (mean age, 30.0 ± 8.3 years seven men, 52 women) with isolated rheumatic mitral stenosis, eight of whom had atrial fibrillation, were studied prospectively before and 24 to 48 hours after PTMC.

Results

Immediately after PTMC, mitral valve area increased from 1.0 ± 0.2 to 1.8 ± 0.3 cm² (P = 0.0001). There was a significant decrease in systolic pulmonary artery pressure from 50.2 ± 26.9 to 33.2 ± 12.3 mm Hg (P = 0.0001), a decrease in the RV Tei index from 0.5 ± 0.2 to 0.3 ± 0.2 (P = 0.0001), and an increase in RV dP/dt from 321.0 ± 59.9 to 494.6 ± 139.5 mm Hg/sec (P = 0.0001). RV myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction and systolic velocity at the lateral tricuspid annulus assessed by Doppler tissue imaging did not change. There were weak positive correlations among the Tei index, dP/dt, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure before PTMC (respectively, r = 0.39, r = 0.28, and P = 0.02, P = 0.05) but not afterward (respectively, r = 0.17, r = 0.02, and P = 0.20, P = 0.90).

Conclusions

This study suggests that RV dP/dt and Tei index are weakly load dependent, whereas myocardial acceleration during isovolumic contraction is unaffected by acute change in RV afterload.

### Impact of valvular heart disease on activities of daily living of nonagenarians: the Leiden 85-plus study a population based study [^43093eda]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated by measuring the transmitral peak velocities (E-wave and A-wave) obtained from pulsed-wave Doppler recordings of the transmitral inflow velocity; from these velocities the E/A ratio derived as another marker of LV diastolic function.

The valvular assessment included the evaluation of the function of the mitral, aortic and tricuspid valves. Color-Doppler echocardiography was performed after optimizing gain and Nyquist limit, and standard continuous and pulsed-wave Doppler recordings were acquired. Stenotic and regurgitant valve diseases were evaluated according to semiquantitative and quantitative methods recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography. The severity of valvular stenosis was based on the valve area and the mean pressure gradient across the restrictive orifice. The mitral valve area was calculated by the pressure half-time and the aortic valve area was calculated by the continuity equation. The mean pressure gradient across the restrictive orifice was estimated by averaging the instantaneous gradients obtained from continuous wave Doppler recordings. In addition, the severity of valvular regurgitation was determined on a qualitative scale and classified as mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2) and severe (grades 3–4), according to the current ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of individuals with valvular heart disease. According to the Euro Heart Survey on Valvular Heart Disease, significant valvular disease was defined as any mitral or aortic stenosis severity, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, moderate or severe aortic regurgitation. In addition, moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation was considered as significant valvular heart disease. Finally, when tricuspid regurgitation was present, the pulmonary artery pressure was estimated using the modified Bernoulli equation.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD and categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Differences between individuals with significant valvular disease and individuals without valvular disease were compared by the 2-tailed Student t-test, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney test and χ²-test for unpaired data, when appropriate. All statistical analyses were performed with software SPSS for Windows version 12.0 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Mitral annular elasticity determines severity of regurgitation in Barlow's mitral valve disease [^f0a44d90]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Barlow's mitral valve disease with late systolic mitral regurgitation provides diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The mechanisms of the regurgitation are still unclear. We hypothesized that the onset and the severity of late systolic regurgitation are determined by annulus dynamics and the mechanical stresses imposed by the left ventricle.

Methods

Ten patients with Barlow's mitral valve disease and mitral annulus disjunction (MAD) were compared with 10 healthy controls. Resting blood pressure was measured, and transthoracic three-dimensional echocardiography was analyzed using a holographic display that allows tracking and measurements of mitral annulus surface area (ASA) throughout the cardiac cycle. A novel annulus elastance index (dASA/dP) was calculated between aortic valve opening and onset of mitral regurgitation. Severity of MAD was quantified as the disjunction index (mm × degree). Leaflet coaptation area was calculated using a finite element model.

Results

Peak systolic ASAs in controls and patients were 9.3 ± 0.6 and 21.1 ± 3.1 cm 2, respectively (P < .001). In patients, the ASA increased rapidly during left ventricular ejection, and onset of mitral regurgitation coincided closely with peak upslope of annulus area change (dASA/dt). The finite element model showed a close association between rapid annulus displacement and coaptation area deficit in Barlow's mitral valve disease. Systolic annulus elastance index (0.058 ± 0.036 cm 2 /mm Hg) correlated strongly with disjunction index (r = 0.91, P < .0001). Moreover, regurgitation volume showed a positive correlation with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.80, P < .01).

Conclusion

The present pilot study supports the hypothesis that annulus dilatation may accentuate mitral valve regurgitation in patients with Barlow's mitral valve disease. A novel annulus elastance index may predict the severity of mitral valve regurgitation in selected patients.

### Spectrum of valvular heart disease and importance of "Mild"… [^8b068311]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

With this background in mind, Matsushita and colleagues5 sought to better understand the association, if any, between mild VHD lesions and important clinical end points over a 25-year follow-up period. The prevalence of aortic sclerosis was 7. 7%, of trace or mild aortic regurgitation was
15. 1%, and of trace or mild mitral regurgitation was 43. 0%. Through almost 25 years of follow-up, 42. 3% of the participants developed at least 1 of the cardiovascular outcomes, the most frequent of which was heart failure, followed by atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Each valvular lesion was independently associated with at least 1 outcome, even after adjusting for potential confounders.

Matsushita and colleagues5 found a dose-response association for the total number of valvular lesions: patients with 2 or more valvular lesions had a higher hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality compared with those with 1 lesion. The study had several strengths, including segregation of trace or mild aortic regurgitation and trace or mild mitral regurgitation for reporting outcomes; a 25-year follow-up period; rigorous adjustment for confounding factors, including adiposity, blood pressure, and kidney function; and demonstration of a dose-response association for the total number of valvular lesions. This result means that a cofounder as low as 1. 3 on a risk ratio scale would be sufficient to fully explain the increased hazard of cardiovascular mortality in patients with aortic sclerosis.

This interpretation was true for most of the other significant outcomes reported in the study for all 3 subsets of VHD, except cardiovascular mortality in patients with mild aortic regurgitation, which had the highest E value of 1. 9 for the lower CI. Further research should seek to unravel mechanistic pathways and biomarkers that promote VHD progression from trace or mild to the moderate to severe end of the disease spectrum. Although contemporary pharmacotherapies have thus far failed to alter the natural progression of calcific degenerative aortic sclerosis, identifying patients earlier in the disease spectrum may help clinicians implement valve repair or valve replacement strategies in a more timely manner, before the onset of overt structural heart disease and cardiac damage.

Non-invasive: echocardiography and Doppler techniques

Investigation of LAP non-invasively using Doppler has been studied for over 30 years. The most recent 2016 American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (ASE/EACVI) guidelines estimate mean LAP through Doppler assessment of diastolic blood flow between the left atrium and left ventricle (mitral E to A wave ratio), tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the mitral annulus, the tricuspid regurgitant flow velocity and LA volumes as shown in Fig. 5. Importantly for the critical care physician who is interested in presence of raised LAP for treatment decisions, these guidelines began to differentiate between the two major objectives — LV diastolic dysfunction and LAP (Fig. 5).

### Recommendations for evaluation of prosthetic valves with echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography's guidelines and standards committee and the task force on prosthetic valves, developed in conjunction with the American college of cardiology cardiovascular imaging committee, cardiac imaging committee of the American Heart Association, the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography and the Canadian society of echocardiography, endorsed by the American college of cardiology foundation, American Heart Association, European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, the Japanese society of echocardiography, and Canadian society of echocardiography [^91fb4436]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of prosthetic valves — introduction — states that in patients with significant valvular stenosis or regurgitation, intervention with repair, valvuloplasty, or replacement is ultimately inevitable, and although valve repair is frequently performed, especially for mitral regurgitation (MR) and tricuspid regurgitation (TR), valve replacement remains common, particularly in adults. Symptoms may be nonspecific, making it difficult to differentiate the effects of prosthetic valve dysfunction from ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, remaining native valve pathology, or noncardiac conditions, so although physical examination can alert clinicians to the presence of significant prosthetic valve dysfunction, diagnostic methods are often needed to assess prosthesis function, and echocardiography with Doppler is the method of choice.

Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) — echocardiographic and Doppler grading criteria indicate that severe PR has a deceleration time of the PR spectral Doppler signal that is short (< 260 msec) and a pressure half-time of the PR jet < 100 msec; diastolic flow reversal in the main or branch pulmonary arteries (PAs) by pulsed wave (PW) Doppler is prominent, and pulmonic systolic flow velocity–time integral (VTI) compared to systemic flow (left ventricular outflow tract [LVOT] VTI) increases from slightly increased (mild) to intermediate (moderate) to greatly increased (severe); regurgitant fraction (RF) thresholds are < 20% for mild, 20%-40% for moderate, and > 40% for severe, noting RF values are primarily derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with limited application with echocardiography.

Pulmonary regurgitation — anatomy and general imaging considerations note that trivial to mild pulmonary regurgitation is a common finding reported to occur in almost 75% of the population and is of little hemodynamic significance, and the primary goal of imaging is to identify and assess abnormal degrees of regurgitation, its etiology, and its effect on cardiac structure and function. The pulmonary valve is a semilunar valve with three cusps located anterior and superior to the aortic valve, its cusps are thinner than those of the aortic valve, and its plane is orthogonal to that of the aortic valve, while in the normal heart the pulmonary artery arises from a muscular infundibulum and therefore lacks fibrous continuity with the tricuspid valve; because the pulmonary valve is an anterior structure, it offers challenges to imaging, particularly with TEE. Imaging should include inspection of the RVOT, pulmonary annulus, main PA, and proximal branches, recognizing that the annulus and main PA may be dilated in pulmonary hypertension and connective tissue disorders and in some congenital heart disease, the RVOT is often dilated in tetralogy of Fallot after surgical enlargement usually with a patch, and branch pulmonary artery stenosis may also contribute to more significant pulmonary regurgitation.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^641ffafb]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Adult echocardiography reporting — examples of findings that are new or significant and may warrant consultation and/or follow-up testing include the following. Left ventricle: significant reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as more than 10-point reduction for any reason and worsening in global longitudinal strain (GLS), including a relative change in GLS > 15% from baseline. Right ventricle: change from normal to abnormal right ventricular (RV) systolic function as assessed by a combination of qualitative and quantitative parameters. Atria: change in left atrial (LA) or right atrial (RA) size from normal to abnormal. Valves: changes in the severity of native or prosthetic valvular stenosis or regurgitation, especially if progression to severe. Aorta: severe dilation thresholds include aneurysm ≥ 5.5 cm and > 5.0 cm in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve, and interval enlargement such as increased from 4.0 cm to 4.5 cm. Pericardium: changes in pericardial effusion size, especially if changes are rapid, and changes in hemodynamic significance including development of cardiac tamponade physiology.

### Different determinants of improvement of early and late systolic mitral regurgitation contributed after cardiac resynchronization therapy [^8d99455a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) at different phases of the regurgitant period may respond differently to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The aims of this study were to examine the impact of CRT on the phasic changes of MR (early vs late systole) and to explore the mechanisms of such changes.

Methods

Instantaneous MR flow rate and total MR volume were evaluated in 60 patients who had more than mild functional MR before and 3 months after CRT. In addition, indices of global left ventricular (LV) remodeling, mitral deformation, and LV systolic dyssynchrony were assessed.

Results

CRT diminished MR volume (38 ± 18 vs 32 ± 20 mL) by reducing both the early (72 ± 47 vs 58 ± 48 mL/sec) and late (48 ± 42 vs 40 ± 42 mL/sec) systolic components (all p values < .01). In patients with ≥ 10% reductions in total MR volume but not in patients without this improvement, there were significant reductions in LV end-systolic volume, increases in LV +dP/dt, decreases in mitral valvular tenting, and improvements of systolic dyssynchrony at 3 months (all P values < .05). By multivariate regression, the reductions in LV end-systolic volume and tenting area were independent determinants of a reduction in total MR volume: the reductions in LV end-systolic volume and global dyssynchrony determined the reduction in early systolic MR, and the reductions in tenting area and global dyssynchrony determined reduction in late systolic MR.

Conclusions

CRT decreases MR volume by reducing both early and late systolic MR. The determinants of the phasic improvement in functional MR are different.

Aortic stenosis — initial diagnostic testing includes the following: In patients with signs or symptoms of AS or a BAV, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is indicated for accurate diagnosis, assessment of hemodynamic severity, measurement of left ventricular (LV) size and systolic function, and determination of prognosis and timing of valve intervention. In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (Stage D3), optimization of blood pressure control is recommended before measurement of AS severity by TTE, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac catheterization, or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF (Stage D2), low-dose dobutamine stress testing with echocardiographic or invasive hemodynamic measurements is reasonable to further define severity and assess contractile reserve. In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal or reduced LVEF (Stages D2 and D3), calculation of the ratio of the outflow tract to aortic velocity is reasonable to further define severity. In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal or reduced LVEF (Stages D2 and D3), measurement of aortic valve calcium score by CT imaging is reasonable to further define severity.

Hemodynamic Measurements

Hemodynamic measurements were recorded at end expiration and included right atrial pressure (RAP), systolic and end‐diastolic RV pressures, systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery (PA) pressures, mean PA pressure, PA wedge pressure (PAWP), PA oxygen saturation, and thermodilution cardiac output, averaged in triplicate. RAP and PAWP were recorded by transecting the A‐wave, per guideline recommendations. 17 Hemodynamic waveforms were recorded by the MacLAB recording system. RV pressure waveforms were digitized following a previously described protocol found to closely correlate with micromanometrically obtained data in the time domain. 18 Briefly, screen captures from appropriate RV pressure waveforms were printed, redigitized, and then imported into Engauge Digitizer, version 10.6. Digitized traced wave data were exported to Excel (Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus), and time derivative was calculated using a standard numerical differentiation algorithm. Representative beats were chosen at end expiration and were specifically identified as being without ringing or whip artifact. RV dP/dt max was calculated from digitized hemodynamic waveforms (Figure 1). All digitization and derived measurements were performed blinded to the pacing modality.

Figure 1
Representative hemodynamic waveform (A) and corresponding change in pressure over time (dP/dt) waveform (B).

BPM indicates beats per minute; and RV, right ventricle.

The primary outcome was RV dP/dt max normalized to instantaneous pressure. Secondary hemodynamic outcomes included RAP, mean PA pressure, PAWP, RAP:PAWP, RV stroke work index (RVSWI), PA pulsatility index, pulmonary effective arterial elastance (E a), and thermodilution cardiac output. E a was calculated as the systolic PA pressure divided by the stroke volume. PA pulsatility index was calculated as the pulmonary pulse pressure divided by RAP. Secondary echocardiographic outcomes included LV end‐diastolic diameter, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation were graded (0 indicates none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe) and then grouped on the basis of valvular significance (none‐mild and moderate‐severe) for comparison purposes.

### Recommendations on the echocardiographic assessment of aortic valve stenosis: a focused update from the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography [^2c784945]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 8 integrated, stepwise approach to grading aortic stenosis (AS) severity begins with assessing velocity/gradient to distinguish LOW GRADIENT AS (Vmax < 4m/s ΔPm < 40mmHg) from HIGH GRADIENT AS (Vmax ≥ 4m/s ΔPm ≥ 40mmHg). For low-gradient pathways, assess AVA and note AVA > 1.0 cm² - > moderate AS, and exclude measurement errors that may cause gradient/flow/AVA underestimation. Define flow status by stroke volume index: Low flow (SVI ≤ 35ml/m²) versus Normal flow (SVI > 35ml/m²) - > severe AS unlikely. Dobutamine stress echocardiography evaluates flow reserve (increase in SV on DSE by 20% or more) to distinguish between true severe and pseudosevere AS. In the high-gradient branch, Severe high gradient AS (normal flow / low flow) (normal EF / low EF) is recognized, and the algorithm includes Calcium Score by CT (see table 5). The diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis in clinical practice must be based on an integrated approach including transvalvular velocity/gradient, valve area, valve morphology, flow rate, LV morphology and function, blood pressure and symptoms.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic regurgitation — integrative Doppler echocardiography assessment should be a comprehensive and integrative process that uses all information from the examination; in all cases one should routinely evaluate the aortic valve and left ventricular (LV) size and function and assess jet characteristics by color flow imaging, record LV outflow and proximal descending and/or abdominal aortic velocities by pulsed Doppler, and record CWD of the AR jet but use it only if a complete signal is obtained. The writing committee proposes a scheme for evaluation and concurs that grading should be comprehensive using a combination of signs, clues, and Doppler measurements. If AR is definitely determined as mild or severe using specific signs, no further measurement is required; when only few parameters support mild or severe AR and the data permit, it is desirable for experienced echocardiographers to quantify AR, including regurgitant volume and fraction and the effective regurgitant orifice. When parameters are contradictory, one must look for technical and physiologic reasons and rely on the best-quality components, and if assessment is difficult, indeterminate, or conflicts with the clinical presentation, further testing is advised with either TEE or CMR.

Figure 2
Echocardiographic Quantitative Measures of TR Severity

Assessment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) severity includes quantitative assessment of regurgitant orifice area (EROA), regurgitant volume (RegVol) and regurgitant fraction (RegFraction). Three methods of quantitation include: proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method, planimetry of the 3-dimensional vena contracta area (3D VCA), and quantitative Doppler method. The last method is not used clinically at this time, but allows quantitation of RegFraction as RegVol/Diastolic SV, because diastolic SV should equal the total right ventricular (RV) SV. Investigators have also used 3D echocardiography to quantify total RV SV. CW = continuous wave; LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract; PW = pulsed wave; SV = stroke volume; TTE = transthoracic echocardiogram; VTI = velocity time integral.

Although limitations of individual echocardiographic methods exist, the multiparametric and hierarchical approach proposed by imaging guidelines performs well when compared with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Limitations of CMR and quantitation of RV stroke volume raise questions about the accuracy of the method. Risk stratification by CMR quantitative indexes of TR severityrequire further validation. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) angiography–based chamber volumes are similar to those derived from CMR, and CT may offer confirmatory evidence of TR severity.

Due to the dynamic nature of TR during respiration, echocardiographic measurements should ideally be made at end-expiration in spontaneously breathing patients, when alveolar pressure is near zero. The dependency on volume load as well as the responsiveness to diuretic therapy also should be considered when grading TR by any imaging modality. Accordingly, TR assessment should ideally be performed when patients are euvolemic, on stable diuretic therapy, with optimized pulmonary pressure and normal systemic blood pressure. The role of exercise testing remains an unexplored tool. An important consequence of significant TR is the reduction of forward stroke volume, which may then affect the accurate assessment of concomitant valvular diseases. Significant TR is more common with low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and is associated with poor outcomes. Low flow may also cause underestimation of the echocardiographic assessment of mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis. Following device therapy of TR, there may be an improvement of forward flow, which may change the hemodynamic quantitation of concomitant valvular disease.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Pulsed Doppler indicators of severity — Pulsed Doppler is used with measures of flow velocity for quantitative assessment, and alterations in forward and reversed flow can also serve as qualitative measures of regurgitation severity. Forward stroke volume across the affected valve is increased; in atrioventricular valves this is characterized by increased early E velocity and E/A ratio with a short E deceleration time, and in semilunar valves ejection velocity is slightly increased with severe regurgitation while the velocity time integral (VTI) is generally increased with a prolongation in ejection time. In atrioventricular lesions, pulmonary systolic venous flow reversal with mitral regurgitation (MR) or hepatic venous systolic flow reversal in tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are considered specific when present but insensitive. For aortic regurgitation (AR), reversal of flow is diastolic in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta; prominent holodiastolic aortic flow reversal is a specific sign of severe AR but insensitive, and alternative causes such as atrioventricular dissociation, pacemakers with ventriculoatrial conduction, arteriovenous fistulas, ruptured sinus of Valsalva, or patent ductus arteriosus should be excluded.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intra-procedural paravalvular regurgitation assessment — tools include color Doppler (2D/3D), pulsed-wave Doppler of aortic flow, aortic and left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressures, and aortography. Simultaneous LV and aortic pressure tracings form the basis for the aortic regurgitation (AR) index, and in the depicted case, the AR index is 28%. Indices of < 25% have been reported to have increased 1-year mortality. Three-dimensional planimetry of a paravalvular jet yields an area of 0.22 cm^2, and the circumferential extent of a larger jet is 14%. Some flow reversal, usually non-holosystolic, may be present even in the absence of aortic regurgitation; hence it is important to establish the baseline aortic flow pattern. A diastolic aortogram shows 2+ paravalvular AR.

Echocardiographic Strain and Left Atrial Volumes

Speckle-tracking strain analysis was performed at the final time point. All acquired images were adequate for strain analysis. Although pigs with AoB presented significant hypertrophy, there was no difference in longitudinal or circumferential strain between AoB and sham pigs (Figure 5). Left atrial 3D echocardiographic imaging exhibited significantly higher maximum and minimum left atrial volumes (Table 1).

Figure 5
Echocardiographic speckle-tracking strain analysis. AoB pigs exhibited thicker wall thickness at both end-diastole and end-systole (top); however, both peak circumferential and longitudinal strains were not different between the groups (P = 0.63 and P = 0.45, respectively) (bottom). AoB indicates aortic banding; bpm, beats per minute; GC, global circumferential, HR, heart rate; NS, not significant.

Pacing Study

After baseline hemodynamic measurements were acquired, a pacing study was performed to examine the impact of increased heart rate within a physiological range. A pacing rate of 120 beats per minute in the right atrium increased LV EDP in pigs with AoB, whereas LV EDP decreased in the control animals (Figure 6). On average, there was an increase of ≈50% in EDP during pacing in pigs with AoB. These results indicate a propensity for developing congestive HF in these pigs. Changes in LV maximum pressure, LV pressure rate of rise and decline, and Tau were lower in pigs with AoB but did not reach statistical difference.

Figure 6
Hemodynamic changes induced by pacing study. Pigs received right atrial pacing (120 bpm) with continuous hemodynamic monitoring. End-diastolic pressure decreased in the control group but increased in the AoB group (P < 0.001), suggesting the propensity of the latter to develop congestive heart failure. Although the parameters did not reach statistical significance, changes in dP/dt max, dP/dt min, and Tau were smaller in AoB pigs, suggesting limited functional reserve. ✱ p < 0.05. AoB indicates aortic banding; bpm, beats per minute; dP/dt max, peak left ventricular pressure rate of rise; dP/dt min, peak left ventricular pressure rate of decline; LV, left ventricular; NS, not significant.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Native valvular regurgitation — key points and imaging roles: Echocardiography with Doppler is the primary modality for evaluation, with color Doppler the primary method for detection requiring assessment of flow convergence, VC, and jet direction/area; pulsed and CW Doppler are also essential and an integrative interpretation of structure, size/function, and Doppler is crucial. A comprehensive evaluation should include identifying the mechanism and the severity of valvular regurgitation, along with adaptation of the heart to the volume overload, and clinical documentation of height, weight, body surface area, heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure. CMR is an excellent modality for evaluating valvular regurgitation and is indicated when echo images are suboptimal, when discordance exists between 2D echocardiographic features and Doppler findings, or when discordance exists between clinical assessment and echocardiographic severity; beyond quantifying severity, a comprehensive CMR study will also quantify cardiac remodeling and provide insights into mechanism and consequences. Quantitative parameters include RVol, RF, and regurgitant orifice area, and recommendations for grading severity are those of mild, moderate, and severe.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR) — noninvasive assessment and stress testing interpretation include the following points: "An ECG may reveal QRS voltage of LV hypertrophy, a left atrial abnormality pattern, and/or ST-T repolarization changes". Echocardiography "should include valve anatomy and motion; aortic root anatomy and dimensions; LV mass, size/volumes, and function (both systolic and diastolic); and the presence or absence of AR", and for AS "the continuity equation should be used in adults to calculate aortic valve area (cm2), preferably indexed to body surface area (cm2 per m2)". The document states "The peak instantaneous aortic valve gradient alone may overestimate the severity of AS" and "The mean Doppler gradient may be more reflective of the peak-to-peak gradient as measured at catheterization that is classically used for clinical decision making", while for AR "Several different methods for quantification of AR should be used, including pressure half-time, jet width, and degree of proximal descending aortic diastolic flow reversal (337)". Regarding exercise testing, "Selective use of exercise stress testing to assess blood pressure and heart rate response, rhythm disorders, and ST-T segment changes may be warranted", with the caveat that "The prognostic value of exercise-induced ST depression and T-wave inversion is age dependent, because 80% of adults with AS will have ST depression without prognostic significance", whereas "On the other hand, ST-T changes in an adolescent or young adult with exercise may be indications for intervention". It further notes "The use of stress echocardiography to assess aortic valve area and gradient, LV ejection fraction, and LV volume response may be helpful" and "The selective use of dobutamine stress echocardiographic studies has been valuable in low-gradient AS with low LV ejection fractions, a situation that is uncommon in adolescents with AS or AR but may be present in older adults with concomitant myocardial or coronary artery disease".

Pulmonary regurgitation (PR) pulsed and continuous wave Doppler (CWD) findings include qualitative and quantitative markers of severity: the CW pattern in mild PR shows a soft or faint signal with slow deceleration, whereas severe PR has a dense jet with rapid deceleration; rapid deceleration alone is not specific for severe PR. Quantitative indices reported as consistent with severe PR include a pressure half-time of < 100 msec or deceleration time of < 260 msec, and a PR index calculated as the ratio of PR duration by CWD to total diastolic time with a PR index of < 0.77 correlating well with severe PR by CMR. An additional sign is reverse flow in the pulmonary artery (PA); diastolic flow reversal in the branch pulmonary arteries had a sensitivity and specificity of 87% for severe PR compared with CMR, whereas sampling only in the main PA reduced specificity to 39%.

### High-resolution transthoracic echocardiography accurately detects pulmonary arterial pressure and decreased right ventricular contractility in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and secondary pulmonary hypertension [^6fceaa65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

As previously alluded to, although the invasively measured pulmonary arterial pressure waveform is a valuable diagnostic tool in PH, it has limited prognostic value and is not ideally suited as the gold standard for validation of RV functional parameters. RV dP/dt correlates strongly with RV ejection fraction and is therefore a representative marker of RV function. However, RV dP/dt is load dependent, and impacted by severe tricuspid regurgitation, which is a structural abnormality that cannot be excluded in the context of PH‐induced RV dilatation. Moreover, tricuspid regurgitation is difficult to assess echocardiographically in mice. Although our pressure‐volume analysis supports the proof of concept, we have not yet been able to correlate RV pressure‐volume data with simultaneous 4‐chamber echocardiography analysis, and this is an aim of a future study.

A further limitation of this study is that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was not performed, and although we performed preliminary analysis of RV pressure‐volume loops, we were unable to consistently obtain data of high enough quality for more complex analysis. Measurements of RV function and RV cardiomyocyte efficiency, derived from simultaneous acquisition of RV pressure and volume data, including end‐systolic ventricular elastance and ventricular‐arterial coupling, correlate strongly with P and its progression, and would be valuable adjuncts in the validation of novel measures of PH‐induced RV dysfunction. We have demonstrated the application of RV echocardiographic measures as they pertain to mice with group III PH; however, given the heterogeneous pathophysiology of PH, these results may not be directly translatable to alternate mouse models of PH. Caution should also be made about the correlation analysis of echocardiographic and pulmonary catheterization measurements because of the possibility of Simpson bias. This is particularly important when examining relationships across 2 distinct groups with no overlap, and with considerable homogeneity within the groups. However, as seen in Figure 5 and 7G, there is some heterogeneity within each group, and some overlap of the groups.

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the noninvasive echocardiographic measures of TAPSE, s', MPI, and FAC accurately identify both PH and RV dysfunction in mice. These robust measures for detection of RV dysfunction in murine group III PH offer the opportunity for improved therapeutic testing with serial measurements and are therefore of value in preclinical PH research.

### Augmentation index assessed by applanation tonometry is elevated in Marfan syndrome [^a9811632]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Pulse wave velocity was increased in our patient group. The lack of significance is probably explained by insufficient statistical power. Patients with MFS have increased arterial stiffness due to altered elastin fibres. Our findings are similar to those of Jeremy et al using echocardiography, and Groenink et al using MRI, who have both shown aortic PWV to be increased in MFS by approximately 2.3 m/s relative to controls. The smaller difference seen in the current study may be due to the different methodology employed in the measurement of PWV. AIx was greater in the MFS group than the control group. This difference was highly significant, compared to the difference in PWV, and suggests that AIx may be a more sensitive marker than PWV for the presence of MFS. It is, therefore, also possible that differences in impedance mismatch in peripheral vessels between the two groups, rather than simply large artery stiffness, may contribute to the elevation of AIx observed in MFS patients. Furthermore, although AIx is dependent on the nature of ventricular ejection, it appears improbable that this would account for the differences in AIx observed between the two groups: firstly, the degree of valvular regurgitation found on echocardiography was trivial, and unlikely to be haemodynamically significant; secondly, the slight excess of aortic regurgitation in the MFS group would, in contrast to the present findings, be expected to decrease AIx and increase dP/dt MAX relative to controls. It is possible that although beta-blockade was stopped in the MFS group, residual effects from these drugs might have contributed to the increase in AIx. Although it is difficult to entirely discount this possibility, the lack of significant difference in either heart rate or dP/dt MAX between the two groups does not support this argument. It seems most likely that vascular rather than cardiac differences account for the increase in AIx in MFS observed in this study. Interestingly, previous work by Segers et al failed to show a significant difference in AIx between MFS and controls – this may have been due to differences in height between the two groups, and possibly differences in methodology. Previous groups have also shown endothelial function to be impaired in peripheral vessels in MFS, but no data have been hitherto available on endothelium-independent arterial reactivity. We had expected to see a less marked response to GTN in the MFS group, due to structural arterial differences resulting in impaired endothelium-independent vaso-relaxation. Our findings suggest that there is no difference in the non-endothelium dependent vascular reactivity of MFS patients.

Basic valvular lesions — qualitative assessment and escalation to advanced PTE: Practitioners of basic PTE echocardiography need familiarity with basic valvular lesions, including knowledge of color flow Doppler assessment of valvular regurgitation for the AV, MV, TV, and PV. Although specific semiquantitative assessments do not have to be obtained, differentiation of mild from moderate versus severe degrees of insufficiency should be possible with visual inspection of regurgitant jet area within the receiving chamber and vena contracta width, and caution should be used when assessing the severity of eccentric jets. Rapid assessment of possible stenotic valvular lesions can be made by visualizing leaflet motion and using continuous-wave Doppler through the valve, and the assessment of prosthetic valve function should be performed by a physician with advanced PTE knowledge. It is the recommendation of the writing committee that a physician trained in basic PTE echocardiography use the complete basic PTE examination to qualitatively delineate valvular regurgitation and/or stenosis; however, if the valve lesion is considered severe, or if comprehensive quantification is required to ultimately determine the need for intervention, a consultation with an advanced PTE echocardiographer is necessary to confirm the severity and etiology of the valve pathology.

Aortic stenosis initial diagnostic testing — For patients with signs or symptoms of AS or a BAV, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is indicated for accurate diagnosis of the cause of AS, assessment of hemodynamic severity, measurement of LV size and systolic function, and determination of prognosis and timing of valve intervention (1 A). In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (Stage D3), optimization of blood pressure control is recommended before measurement of AS severity by TTE, TEE, cardiac catheterization, or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) (1 B-NR). In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF (Stage D2), low-dose dobutamine stress testing with echocardiographic or invasive hemodynamic measurements is reasonable to further define severity and assess contractile reserve (2a B-NR). In patients with suspected low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal or reduced LVEF (Stages D2 and D3), calculation of the ratio of the outflow tract to aortic velocity is reasonable to further define severity (2a B-NR), and measurement of aortic valve calcium score by CT imaging is reasonable to further define severity (2a B-NR).

Atrial fibrillation — algorithm for estimation of mean left atrial pressure (LAP) applies four primary parameters and branching rules. Primary parameters are: Mitral E velocity ≥ 100 cm/s; Septal E/e′ ratio ≥ 11; tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity ≥ 2.8 m/s or PASP > 35 mm Hg; and deceleration time (DT) ≤ 160 ms.

For the "2 of above" branch, adjunct findings are assessed — "LARS < 18%", "Pulm vein S/D ratio < 1", and "BMI > 30 kg/m2" — such that "2/3 or 3/3" yields "Elevated LAP", whereas "1 only or not available or not reliable" yields "Indeterminate".

Conclusion

Although arterial dP/dt max is a complex function subject to central and peripheral factors, both radial and particularly femoral dP/dt max allowed reasonably good tracking of LV contractility changes during different loading and inotropic conditions across all domains of vasomotor tone, contractility and volume status. Therefore, real-time assessment of LV contractility may be evaluated in clinical practice by monitoring peripheral arterial dP/dt max.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published December 12, 2018 Severe aortic regurgitation is associated with a large forward stroke volume, which causes an increase in systolic blood pressure. It is also associated with rapid runoff of blood from the aorta backward into the left ventricle, which results in a relative decrease in diastolic blood pressure. Collectively, these hemodynamic changes produce a wide pulse pressure, which is defined as a diastolic blood pressure that is less than 50% of the systolic blood pressure. Read the Latest NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Q: What valvular abnormalities other than aortic regurgitation may cause an isolated diastolic murmur. A: Other causes of isolated diastolic murmurs include mitral stenosis, tricuspid stenosis, and pulmonary regurgitation. A: Severe aortic regurgitation can be either acute or chronic.

Acute severe aortic regurgitation is usually due to infectious endocarditis or type A aortic dissection. Causes of chronic aortic regurgitation include abnormalities of the aortic valve, the aorta, or both. Valvular causes include bicuspid aortic-valve disease, which accounts for approximately one fourth of all cases of clinically significant aortic regurgitation. Calcific changes of the aortic valve can cause aortic regurgitation. Clinically significant aortic regurgitation can arise as a late consequence of endocarditis. Finally, aortic regurgitation can arise in rheumatic heart disease; rheumatic aortic-valve disease rarely occurs in the absence of marked rheumatic mitral-valve disease. Dilatation of the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both accounts for approximately one fourth of all cases of clinically significant aortic regurgitation.

The aortic-valve cusps are suspended from the sinotubular junction, and therefore, dilatation of either the aortic root or the ascending aorta can widen the diameter of the sinotubular junction, causing incomplete valve closure and a central jet of aortic regurgitation. Conditions that affect both the aortic valve and the aorta and can cause secondary aortic regurgitation include Takayasu's arteritis, giant-cell arteritis, Behçet's disease, and syphilis.

### Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in pure aortic regurgitation: hemodynamic and echocardiographic findings in bioprosthesis vs. native valve [^0a26a976]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to compare hemodynamic and echocardiographic findings between valve-in-valve (VIV) and native-valve (NV) patients submitted to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to pure aortic regurgitation (AR).

Background

Patients with severe AR are surgically treated with variable postinterventional left-ventricular (LV) "reverse remodeling". TAVI might be considered in selected AR patients.

Methods

Twenty-eight patients with pure severe AR caused by either degenerated bioprosthesis or NV disease were successfully treated by TAVI at our institution. LV catheterization before and after TAVI and echocardiography before, after (24-72h), and at follow-up (3–12 months) were performed.

Results

Baseline clinical, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic characteristics were comparable between the two study groups, except for a younger age, higher proto-diastolic LV pressure, and higher LV end-systolic diameter in the NV group. At catheterization, an immediate hemodynamic impact of TAVI in both groups was noticed, with a trend toward better postprocedural residual regurgitation index and significantly lower LV dP/dT values (666.0 ± 177.9 vs. 883.5 ± 259.7mmHg/s, p = 0.04) in VIV. At echocardiography, both NV and VIV patients showed favorable (early and sustained) post-TAVI echocardiographically detectable reverse remodeling. VIV patients also showed more pronounced early reduction in indexed LV end-diastolic volume (68.1 ± 27.4 vs. 86.5 ± 28.9ml/m 2 in VIV, p < 0.001 and 81.0 ± 29.0 vs. 95.2 ± 37.8ml/m 2 in NV, p = 0.043).

Conclusions

Successful TAVI induces a striking hemodynamic impact with major structural (reverse remodeling) consequences in patients with pure AR caused by both bioprosthesis degeneration or NV disease. In the immediate postrelease phase, VIV patients might exhibit a more pronounced early LV contractile and structural benefit.

### Echocardiographic measures of acute haemodynamic response after cardiac resynchronization therapy predict long-term clinical outcome [^08c970f7]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Although acute haemodynamic improvement in response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is reflective of a favourable cardiac contractile response, there is limited information regarding not only its ability to predict long-term clinical outcome but also cardiac-substrate-specific differences in the prognostic value of this measure.

Methods and Results

Fifty-three heart failure patients (69 ± 11 years) with low left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) (22 ± 6%), wide QRS (169 ± 31 ms), and indications for CRT were included. There were no significant differences in age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, medications, QRS width, or LVEF between ischaemic (n = 37) and non-ischaemic (n = 16) groups. Echocardiograms were performed within 24 h of implantation with device OFF and ON. Acute haemodynamic response was measured as LV dP/dt derived from the CW Doppler of mitral regurgitation. Percentage change in dP/dt was used to classify patients: high- (HR: DeltadP/dt > 25%) or poor-responders (PR: DeltadP/dt ≤ 25%). Clinical response to CRT was defined by a combined endpoint of hospitalizations and all-cause mortality at 12 months. HR group had a significantly better outcome compared to the PR group (P-value = 0.004) irrespective of the aetiology of the cardiomyopathy.

Conclusion

Echocardiographic assessment of the acute haemodynamic response to CRT predicts long-term clinical outcome in both ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.

### Continual measurement of arterial dP / dtenables minimally invasive monitoring of left ventricular contractility in patients with acute heart failure [^ec5fc55b]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuous, reliable evaluation of left ventricular (LV) contractile function in patients with advanced heart failure requiring intensive care remains challenging. Continual monitoring of dP/dt max from the arterial line has recently become available in hemodynamic monitoring. However, the relationship between arterial dP/dt max and LV dP/dt max remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the relationship between arterial dP/dt max and LV dP/dt max assessed using echocardiography in patients with acute heart failure.

Methods

Forty-eight patients (mean age 70.4years [65% male]) with acute heart failure requiring intensive care and hemodynamic monitoring were recruited. Hemodynamic variables, including arterial dP/dt max, were continually monitored using arterial line pressure waveform analysis. LV dP/dt max was assessed using continuous-wave Doppler analysis of mitral regurgitation flow.

Results

Values from continual arterial dP/dt max monitoring were significantly correlated with LV dP/dt max assessed using echocardiography (r = 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51–0.82]; P < 0.0001). Linear regression analysis revealed that LV dP/dt max = 1.25×(arterial dP/dt max) (P < 0.0001). Arterial dP/dt max was also significantly correlated with stroke volume (SV) (r = 0.63; P < 0.0001) and cardiac output (CO) (r = 0.42; P = 0.0289). In contrast, arterial dP/dt max was not correlated with SV variation, dynamic arterial elastance, heart rate, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), or mean arterial pressure. Markedly stronger agreement between arterial and LV dP/dt max was observed in subgroups with higher SVR (N = 28; r = 0.91; P < 0.0001), lower CO (N = 26; r = 0.81; P < 0.0001), and lower SV (N = 25; r = 0.60; P = 0.0014). A weak correlation was observed in the subjects with lower SVR (N = 20; r = 0.61; P = 0.0004); in the subgroups with higher CO (N = 22) and higher SV (N = 23), no significant correlation was found.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that in patients with acute heart failure requiring intensive care with an arterial line, continuous calculation of arterial dP/dt max may be used for monitoring LV contractility, especially in those with higher SVR, lower CO, and lower SV, such as in patients experiencing cardiogenic shock. On the other hand, there was only a weak or no significant correlation in the subgroups with higher CO, higher SV, and lower SVR.

### Recommendations for the use of echocardiography in the evaluation of rheumatic heart disease: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography [^c9726808]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Rheumatic aortic valve regurgitation — grading relies on integrated Doppler parameters with explicit severe thresholds. It has been shown that mixed aortic valve (AV) disease of moderate severity has adverse outcomes comparable to severe isolated aortic stenosis (AS) with preserved ejection fraction and worse than isolated moderate AS or aortic regurgitation (AR). Overall Doppler assessment of rheumatic AR follows prior native regurgitation principles, and an integration of multiple parameters is essential to grade AR severity, including qualitative indices (continuous-wave Doppler [CWD] jet density, flow reversal in the descending aorta, flow convergence; regurgitant pressure half-time by CWD), semi-quantitative indices (vena contracta [VC] width, regurgitant jet width/left ventricular outflow tract [LVOT] width), quantitative Doppler measurements (regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, effective regurgitant orifice area [EROA]), and supportive findings (left ventricular [LV] size and function). Severe AR is indicated by a dense CWD jet density, PHT < 200 msec, VC width > 0.6 cm, regurgitant jet width/LVOT width ≥ 65%, regurgitant volume ≥ 60 ml, regurgitant fraction ≥ 50%, and EROA ≥ 0.3 cm2, with flow reversal in the descending aorta and LV enlargement present.

### Recommendations for noninvasive evaluation of native valvular regurgitation: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^ca85359a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Valvular regurgitation grading — integrative assessment and documentation: Characterization of the severity of regurgitant lesions is among the most difficult problems in valvular heart disease, with difficulty related to the lack of a true gold standard and dependence on hemodynamic conditions at the time of evaluation. For CMR, the evaluation involves fewer parameters, is mostly quantitative, but is still influenced by technical and physiologic factors; to mitigate these effects, quantitative internal checks should be employed, and for isolated MR the difference between the LV SV and aortic total forward flow should match the difference between the LV SV and the pulmonary artery total forward flow or RV SV. Thus, an integrative, comprehensive approach is essential, and interpreters must integrate information and disregard outlying data to make a best estimate of severity. The consensus of the writing group is to classify grading into mild, moderate, and severe; "Trace" regurgitation is used when regurgitation is barely detected, is usually physiologic particularly in right heart valves and MV, and may not produce an audible murmur. Because severity may be influenced by hemodynamic conditions, it is essential to record blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm at the time of the study and note the patient's medications whenever possible.

### Usefulness of three-dimensional echocardiography in assessing right ventricular function in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension [^af2e9f60]. Hypertension Research (2009). Low credibility.

Although right ventricular (RV) function is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), there have been no clinically validated quantification methods to date. The first derivative of RV pressure (dP/dt) is a good index of contractility, but it depends on preload. dP/dt divided by end-diastolic volume (EDV), that is, dP/dt/EDV, on the other hand, is an index of contractility relatively independent of preload. However, the measurement of accurate RV EDV is difficult because of RV complex geometry. Real-time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography allows us to measure ventricular volume irrespective of its shape. To investigate the clinical feasibility and significance of 3D echocardiography in evaluating RV function in patients with PPH by measuring RV EDV and dP/dt/EDV, 13 patients with PPH (41 ± 20 years, four men) underwent echocardiography, a 6-min walk distance (mWD) test and blood sampling within 1 week of invasive hemodynamic measurements. RV dP/dt was estimated from a continuous wave Doppler-determined tricuspid regurgitant velocity. RV EDV was measured by both two-dimensional (2D) biplane Simpson method (EDV(2D)) and real-time 3D echocardiography (EDV(3D)). RV dP/dt/EDV was calculated using EDV(2D) and EDV(3D). EDV(3D) showed better correlations than EDV(2D) with the invasive and non-invasive parameters of RV function, suggesting the validity of volume measurement by 3D echocardiography. RV dP/dt/EDV(3D) correlated well with disease severity, whereas dP/dt and dP/dt/EDV(2D) did not. In patients with PPH, 3D-echocardiography-determined RV dP/dt/EDV and EDV seem to be potential markers of disease severity.

### Guidelines for the standardization of adult echocardiography reporting: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^b3c8f4f3]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

American Society of Echocardiography — tricuspid valve reporting includes morphology and functional assessment. Report whether the tricuspid valve is structurally normal; reporting number of leaflets is recommended when sufficiently well visualized. Describe structural abnormalities if present and note abnormal motion if present. For tricuspid stenosis, state presence or absence, report mechanism when possible, and provide quantitative measurements including mean gradient (with rhythm and heart rate) and, if feasible, tricuspid valve area and method (continuity equation, PHT, 2D or 3D planimetry). For tricuspid regurgitation, report presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe, massive, torrential) with mechanism (primary, secondary, or mixed), and include quantitative or semi-quantitative measures such as vena contracta width or area, effective regurgitant orifice, regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, and systolic flow reversal in hepatic veins. Also report right ventricular systolic pressure (or pulmonary artery systolic pressure) derived from peak TR gradient and estimated RAP when available, and explain if it cannot be calculated.

### Valvular heart disease: aortic regurgitation [^fd5309a3]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is characterized by diastolic reflux of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle (LV). Acute AR typically causes severe pulmonary edema and hypotension and is a surgical emergency. Chronic severe AR causes combined LV volume and pressure overload. It is accompanied by systolic hypertension and wide pulse pressure, which account for peripheral physical findings, such as bounding pulses. The afterload excess caused by systolic hypertension leads to progressive LV dilation and systolic dysfunction. The most important diagnostic test for AR is echocardiography. It provides the ability to determine the cause of AR and to assess the severity of AR and its effect on LV size, function, and hemodynamics. Many patients with chronic severe AR may remain clinically compensated for years with normal LV function and no symptoms. These patients do not require surgery but can be followed carefully for the onset of symptoms or LV dilation/dysfunction. Surgery should be considered before the LV ejection fraction falls below 55% or the LV end-systolic dimension reaches 55 mm. Symptomatic patients should undergo surgery unless there are excessive comorbidities or other contraindications. The primary role of medical therapy with vasodilators is to delay the need for surgery in asymptomatic patients with normal LV function or to treat patients in whom surgery is not an option. The goal of vasodilator therapy is to achieve a significant decrease in systolic arterial pressure. Future therapies may focus on molecular mechanisms to prevent adverse LV remodeling and fibrosis.
