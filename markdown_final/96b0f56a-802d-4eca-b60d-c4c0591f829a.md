## Question

Dequervains tendinitis recommended therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended therapy for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for first-line therapy. Next, I will examine the role of ultrasound guidance and dosing. After that, I need to check the evidence for adjuncts like splinting and NSAIDs. Then, I should review prognostic modifiers and when to escalate to surgery. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged algorithm and highlight special populations and safety considerations, making sure each assertion is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation and rule-outs. De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a stenosing overuse condition of the first dorsal compartment involving the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, typically presenting with radial styloid pain worsened by thumb and wrist motion; diagnosis is primarily clinical with tenderness over the first dorsal compartment and a positive Finkelstein test, while ultrasound can help when the diagnosis is uncertain or to define septations and tendon pathology, and radiographs are reasonable to exclude bony disease when indicated [^111o76Ta] [^114TxhHb] [^113WseYJ] [^116PvegJ].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence for first-line therapy. The 2023 JAMA Network Open systematic review and network meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 1663 patients found that corticosteroid injection combined with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks had the highest probability of improving function and ranked highly for pain relief, supporting CSI plus splinting as first-line treatment; this is echoed by a companion JAMA summary recommending CSI with thumb spica immobilization as initial care [^111vA4UB] [^116vcCsW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about splinting alone. I initially thought splinting alone might be sufficient, but I should double-check the comparative data. Pairwise meta-analyses show that adding thumb spica immobilization to CSI yields statistically significant improvements in function (about 10 points on Q-DASH) in the short and mid term, though these differences did not meet prespecified minimal clinically important differences for pain; still, the functional gains are consistent and clinically meaningful, reinforcing the combination as preferred over CSI alone in most patients [^notfound].

> I need to check the role of ultrasound guidance. The network meta-analysis ranked ultrasound-guided CSI among the top interventions for short-term pain, and prospective data suggest higher accuracy and favorable outcomes with ultrasound guidance, particularly relevant given the high prevalence of septations and subcompartments; small RCTs and position statements also support US guidance for small-joint injections, including the wrist, to improve accuracy and reduce procedural pain, so I should prefer ultrasound guidance when available, especially if prior landmark-guided injection failed or anatomy is atypical [^1119M4dp] [^1173fq4s] [^1166uQrP] [^116QVFJH].

> Let me consider dosing and technique. Common regimens include methylprednisolone 40 mg with local anesthetic, with some trials using 40 mg triamcinolone; a recent retrospective analysis suggested higher-dose triamcinolone (40 mg) outperformed lower-dose (5–10 mg) across several hand conditions, including de Quervain's, with fewer repeat injections and lower conversion to surgery, though this is lower-level evidence and should be balanced against cosmetic risks; I should confirm that the injection is intrasheath rather than intratendinous and consider ultrasound to avoid neurovascular injury [^117MWv8e] [^116PRmKi] [^116wR6t1].

> Next, I should review NSAIDs and activity modification. NSAIDs are often recommended for pain and swelling, but high-quality RCT data do not show added benefit of NSAIDs when combined with CSI, and expert consensus emphasizes activity modification and ergonomic counseling as core elements; therefore, NSAIDs can be offered for analgesia, but I should not rely on them to replace CSI-based regimens, and I must counsel on avoiding provocative thumb/wrist motions and forceful grasping during recovery [^115JYfNV] [^114exGhw] [^115eRrVN].

> I will now examine prognostic modifiers and likelihood of response. Female sex, obesity (BMI > 30), diabetes, and longer symptom duration are associated with lower success of CSI and higher likelihood of surgery; PROMIS physical function and pain interference scores at baseline also predict progression to surgery, and patients with post-traumatic de Quervain's after distal radius fracture respond less well to injections and more often require surgery; I should set expectations accordingly and consider earlier referral if risk factors are present [^116RiPQU] [^114vMrGs] [^1162rToC] [^114bMpSy].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite an appropriate first injection and splinting. I should confirm a 3–4 month reassessment window; if symptoms persist, repeating a diagnostic ultrasound and offering an ultrasound-guided CSI is reasonable, with up to three total injections before surgical referral; large database data show success rates around 72% after one injection, 66% after a second, and 60% after a third, supporting the viability of repeat injections while acknowledging diminishing returns [^115CfiNL] [^112L2bTD] [^115tup48].

> Let me reconsider the threshold for surgery. If there is no meaningful improvement after about 3–4 months of optimized conservative care, or if there is severe functional limitation or recurrent disease, surgical release of the first dorsal compartment is indicated; outcomes are generally excellent, but I should counsel on superficial radial nerve injury risk and discuss incision choice, noting that evidence is insufficient to prefer transverse versus longitudinal approaches definitively; longer preoperative symptom duration correlates with slightly worse early postoperative pain, reinforcing timely referral when conservative therapy fails [^116j8nU4] [^116gzhaQ] [^115uarfG].

> I should double-check special populations. In pregnancy and lactation, de Quervain's is often self-limited; a small RCT in pregnant or lactating women showed complete pain relief with a single corticosteroid injection in all treated patients versus none with splinting alone, though this is very low-quality evidence; if injections are used, I need to use the lowest effective dose and monitor for transient lactation suppression, and splinting remains a reasonable low-risk alternative if injection is deferred [^1153Ftky] [^113cxCpP] [^115c4FyX].

> Next, I should review safety and complications. Local soft tissue atrophy, skin hypopigmentation, and rare infection can occur after CSI; ultrasound guidance reduces inadvertent intratendinous injection and neurovascular injury; patients with diabetes should monitor glucose closely after injection; I need to document informed consent and counsel on these risks before proceeding [^111UGShW] [^116wR6t1] [^114G2S62].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with the evidence. First-line is corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment with ultrasound guidance when feasible, combined with a thumb spica splint immobilizing the wrist and thumb MCP joint (not the IP joint) for 3–4 weeks, with activity modification and avoidance of provocative tasks; reassess at 6–12 weeks, and if symptoms persist, repeat ultrasound and consider a second ultrasound-guided injection; after a total of three injections or at 3–4 months of persistent symptoms, discuss surgical release with counseling on risks and expectations [^115CfiNL] [^112L2bTD] [^116vcCsW] [^114iDqK7].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked alternatives. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy and certain combination injection strategies show promise in small studies but lack sufficient high-quality evidence to displace CSI plus splinting as standard first-line care; I can consider these selectively in refractory cases or when steroid is contraindicated, while acknowledging the uncertainty of benefit [^113qWuNN] [^1119M4dp].

> In summary, after confirming the diagnosis clinically and with imaging when needed, I recommend corticosteroid injection with thumb spica immobilization as first-line therapy, prefer ultrasound guidance for accuracy, incorporate activity modification, and escalate thoughtfully based on response, risk factors, and patient preferences, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^111vA4UB] [^116vcCsW] [^116QVFJH].

---

The recommended therapy for de Quervain's tendinitis is **corticosteroid injection with thumb spica immobilization for 3–4 weeks** as first-line treatment [^111vA4UB] [^116vcCsW], which improves pain and function more than injection alone [^111XAe3x]. Ultrasound-guided injection is preferred when available, especially with septation, as it improves accuracy and outcomes [^1166uQrP] [^1173fq4s]. If symptoms persist after 3–4 months, repeat injection or surgery may be considered [^115CfiNL]. NSAIDs and activity modification can be used adjunctively, but evidence for NSAIDs alone is limited [^115JYfNV] [^114exGhw].

---

## Conservative management

### Corticosteroid injections

- **First-line treatment**: Corticosteroid injection into the first dorsal compartment is highly effective, with success rates of 61–83% after one injection [^115E4rij] [^114yXouB].

- **Combination therapy**: Adding thumb spica immobilization for 3–4 weeks to corticosteroid injection improves short- and mid-term function compared to injection alone [^111vA4UB] [^111XAe3x].

- **Ultrasound guidance**: Ultrasound-guided injections improve accuracy, especially with anatomical variants like septation, and may enhance outcomes [^1166uQrP] [^1173fq4s].

---

### Immobilization

For immobilization, **thumb spica splinting** for 3–4 weeks reduces tendon friction and improves symptoms; combining with corticosteroid injection yields superior outcomes to splinting alone [^114iDqK7] [^111FuAU3].

---

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

For NSAIDs, **adjunctive use** can reduce pain and inflammation, but evidence for monotherapy is limited; they are best used with other interventions [^114exGhw] [^115JYfNV].

---

### Activity modification

For activity modification, **ergonomic adjustments** and avoiding repetitive thumb/wrist movements reduce tendon irritation and support recovery [^115eRrVN].

---

## Physical therapy

For physical therapy, **therapeutic exercises** focus on tendon gliding, strengthening, and range of motion to restore function and prevent recurrence [^111Es132].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for **refractory cases** that fail conservative care after 3–4 months or for recurrent disease [^115CfiNL]. Open release of the first dorsal compartment is effective, with low complication rates; endoscopic release offers a minimally invasive alternative with comparable outcomes [^111b2Tns] [^115JYfNV].

---

## Summary of recommended treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Details** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Corticosteroid injection + thumb spica immobilization | - First-line <br/> - 3–4 weeks immobilization [^111vA4UB] [^116vcCsW] |
| 2 | Activity modification + NSAIDs | Adjunctive measures [^114exGhw] [^115eRrVN] |
| 3 | Physical therapy | Tendon gliding and strengthening [^111Es132] |
| 4 | Repeat injection or surgical release | If symptoms persist after 3–4 months [^115CfiNL] |

---

Corticosteroid injection with thumb spica immobilization is the **preferred initial therapy** for de Quervain's tendinitis, with ultrasound guidance improving accuracy and outcomes. Conservative measures such as NSAIDs and activity modification are adjuncts, and surgery is reserved for refractory cases.

Importance

There is a plethora of treatment options for patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis (DQT), but there are limited data on their effectiveness and no definitive management guidelines.

Objective

To assess and compare the effectiveness associated with available treatment options for DQT to guide musculoskeletal practitioners and inform guidelines.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central, Scopus, OpenGrey.eu, and WorldCat.org were searched for published studies, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, The European Union Clinical Trials Register, and the ISRCTN registry were searched for unpublished and ongoing studies from inception to August 2022.

Study Selection

All randomized clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of any intervention for the management of DQT.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO and conducted and reported per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension Statement for Reporting of Systematic Reviews Incorporating Network Meta-analyses of Health Care Interventions (PRISMA-NMA) and PRISMA in Exercise, Rehabilitation, Sport Medicine and Sports Science (PERSIST) guidance. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations tool were used for risk of bias and certainty of evidence assessment for each outcome.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed for patient-reported pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and for function using the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (Q-DASH) scale. Mean differences (MD) with their 95% CIs were calculated for the pairwise meta-analyses.

Results

A total of 30 studies with 1663 patients (mean [SD] age, 46 [7] years; 80% female) were included, of which 19 studies were included in quantitative analyses. From the pairwise meta-analyses, based on evidence of moderate certainty, adding thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks to a corticosteroid injection (CSI) was associated with statistically but not clinically significant functional benefits in the short-term (MD, 10.5 [95% CI, 6.8–14.1] points) and mid-term (MD, 9.4 [95% CI, 7.0–11.9] points). In the network meta-analysis, interventions that included ultrasonography-guided CSI ranked at the top for pain. CSI with thumb spica immobilization had the highest probability of being the most effective intervention for short- and mid-term function.

Conclusions and Relevance

This network meta-analysis found that adding a short period of thumb spica immobilization to CSI was associated with statistically but not clinically significant short- and mid-term benefits. These findings suggest that administration of CSI followed by 3 to 4 weeks immobilization should be considered as a first-line treatment for patients with DQT.

### Conservative management of de quervain stenosing tenosynovitis: review and presentation of treatment algorithm [^115E4rij]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonsurgical management of de Quervain disease relies mainly on the use of oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug administration, splint therapy, and corticosteroid injections. Although the latter is most effective, with documented success rates of 61 to 83 percent, there exists no clear consensus pertaining to conservative treatment protocols conferring the best outcomes. This article reports on all present conservative treatment modalities in use for the management of de Quervain disease and highlights specific treatment- and patient-related factors associated with the best outcomes.

Methods

A systematic search was performed using the PubMed database using appropriate search terms; two independent reviewers evaluated retrieved articles using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

A total of 66 articles met the inclusion criteria for review, consisting of 22 articles reporting on outcomes following a single conservative treatment modality, eight articles reporting on combined treatment approaches, 13 articles directly comparing different conservative treatment regimens, and 23 case reports.

Conclusions

A multimodal approach using splint therapy and corticosteroid injections appears to be more beneficial than either used in isolation. Although there exists some evidence showing that multipoint injection techniques and multiple injections before surgical referral may provide benefit over a single point injection technique and a single injection before surgery, corticosteroid use is not benign and should thus be performed with caution. Ultrasound was proven valuable in the visualization of an intercompartmental septum, and ultrasound-guided injections were shown to both be more accurate and confer better outcomes. Several prior and concurrent medical conditions may affect conservative treatment outcome. A Level I to II evidence-based treatment protocol is recommended for the optimal nonsurgical management of de Quervain disease.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115CfiNL]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Based on our findings, we recommend that clinicians offer patients with DQT of any chronicity a conventional CSI at first contact. This should be supplemented with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks in the form of a full-time (minus grooming and simple daily range-of-movement exercises) thumb spica splint that includes the wrist and the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint but not the thumb interphalangeal joint. If the symptoms persist 3 to 4 months later, we recommend that a diagnostic ultrasonographic scan is performed, at which point a further ultrasonography-guided CSI can be administered on confirmation of the diagnosis of DQT. This should also be supplemented with a thumb spica splint for 3 to 4 weeks. If this does not result in resolution of symptoms within 3 to 4 months, then surgical release is recommended. No definitive recommendations can be provided for the type of surgery or type of incision due to inadequate evidence. All patients should be warned about complications of surgery as part of the informed consent process, especially injury to the superficial radial nerve and its consequences. At all stages of treatment, advice about lifestyle modifications should be provided to limit overuse of the affected tendons. Figure 4 illustrates our recommended management pathway.

Suggested Treatment Algorithm for de Quervain Tenosynovitis (DQT)

CSI indicates conventional corticosteroid; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; US, ultrasonography.

Limitations

Our study has some limitations. Chronicity of the condition, which could influence effectiveness of interventions, was not considered and neither was type, number, or dose of CSIs. Similarly, simultaneous consumption of NSAIDs was not controlled for, as the included studies did not provide relevant data. Additionally, not all interventions were available for participation in all networks; specifically surgical interventions could not be included in any quantitative analyses for pain and function. Furthermore, the diagnostic criteria of some studies may have been inadequate, having only included the Finkelstein test. However, we did include all eligible studies that derived from a thorough literature search and combined data appropriately in quantitative analyses that included a network meta-analysis. Additionally, we performed detailed ROB and certainty of evidence assessments for each outcome separately.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1162KzjX]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This is systematic review and network meta-analysis on the management of DQT is the largest of its kind to date, to our knowledge. We found through direct comparisons that adding thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks to a CSI was associated with benefits for pain and function in the short- and mid-term. While these differences were statistically significant, they did not reach clinical significance due to our predefined minimal clinically important differences for pain and function. Our results were based on low certainty of evidence for pain and moderate certainty of evidence for function; therefore, only function-related recommendations for clinical practice can be considered strong. In the network meta-analysis for short-term pain, interventions that included ultrasonography-guided CSI ranked at the top. Placebo injection (normal saline), and thumb spica immobilization alone (splint or cast) had the highest probability of being the least effective interventions. Data for promising treatments that ranked high in the network meta-analyses, such as neural therapy and extracorporeal shockwave therapy, originated from single studies of high overall ROB; therefore, recommendations for their use cannot be made at this point.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116uMwer]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs, we found that adding a short period of thumb spica immobilization to a CSI was associated with significant benefits and administering the CSI with ultrasonographic guidance was associated with superior results compared with conventional CSI. CSI with thumb spica immobilization had the highest probability of being the most effective treatment for function and also ranked very highly for pain relief among treatments in analyses. Therefore, we recommend the use of CSI with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks as first-line treatment for patients with DQT. Surgery should be used only when nonsurgical management fails. Further research should take into account chronicity of the condition, as this may influence effectiveness of specific interventions, and NSAIDs should both be assessed as a management option for DQT, with or without thumb spica immobilization, and controlled for in studies where other interventions are assessed. Finally, more high-quality RCTs should be conducted to investigate the potential benefits of administering CSIs with ultrasonographic guidance and comparing different surgical approaches so that conclusions can be made with higher certainty of evidence.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, more specifically with respect to postoperative care, HANDGUIDE 2014 guidelines recommend to advise patients on the following for the first 10–14 days postoperatively:

- elevate the hand above heart level to prevent swelling

- move the fingers to prevent scar adhesions

- refrain from heavy lifting or forceful activities until 2–6 weeks after surgery

- rest the hand and avoid thumb activity (splinting can be used).

### Corticosteroid injection for de quervain's tenosynovitis [^1153Ftky]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a disorder characterised by pain on the radial (thumb) side of the wrist and functional disability of the hand. It can be treated by corticosteroid injection, splinting and surgery.

Objectives

To summarise evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1956 to April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to April 2009), AMED (1985 to April 2009), DARE, Dissertation Abstracts and PEDro (physiotherapy evidence database).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

After screening abstracts of studies identified by the search we obtained full text articles of studies which fulfilled the selection criteria. We extracted data using a predefined electronic form. We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by using the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment.

Main Results

We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all pregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with methylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients in the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas none of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, one to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local complications of steroid injection were noted.

Authors' Conclusions

The efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical trial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting. However, the applicability of our findings to daily clinical practice is limited, as they are based on only one trial with a small number of included participants, the methodological quality was poor and only pregnant and lactating women participated in the study. No adverse effects were observed.

Results

A total of 37 studies, were initially found to be eligible. Of those, 7 studies, did not include 1 of our predefined outcome measures or included patients with conditions other than DQT and did not analyze data separately and were therefore excluded (Figure 1). A total of 30 studies, with 1663 patients (mean age [SD] age, 46 [7] years; 80% female) were included in further data collection. eTable 1 in Supplement 1 summarizes the patient, intervention, comparator, and outcome characteristics and the individual findings of these studies for pain and function, as well as the results of our pairwise meta-analyses where pooling of studies was possible. There was a total of 25 treatment comparisons. Study publication year ranged from 2009 to 2022. eTable 2 in Supplement 1 shows the risk of bias assessment results of the ROB assessment. Of 19 studies, that participated in quantitative analyses (pairwise or network meta-analyses), 1 study was of low ROB and 8 studies were of high overall ROB, while the remaining 10 studies were rated as having some concerns (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

Key Points

Question

What treatment modalities for de Quervain tenosynovitis are associated with better outcomes compared with other treatments?

Findings

This systematic review and network meta-analysis of 30 studies with 1663 patients found that adding thumb spica immobilization to a local corticosteroid injection was associated with significant pain-relieving and functional benefits. Administering the corticosteroid injection using ultrasonographic guidance was associated with greater pain reduction than conventional injections.

Meaning

These findings suggest that patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis should receive a local corticosteroid injection with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks as first-line treatment.

Introduction

De Quervain tenosynovitis (DQT) is a stenosing overuse condition of the synovial sheath of the first extensor compartment of the wrist affecting the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus tendons. The exact pathophysiology of DQT is unknown, but it appears to be related to thickening of the tendon sheath and the overlying extensor retinaculum, as well as thinning and degeneration of the affected tendons. Involvement of inflammation remains controversial but intrinsic degeneration due to overuse appears to be the most likely mechanism. Possible associations have been made between a separate, septated EPB subcompartment and DQT; however, increasing evidence suggests that this is probably a normal anatomical variant.DQT manifests with pain and tenderness over and proximal to the radial styloid, and while its diagnosis is predominantly clinical, imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, can be useful where there is diagnostic uncertainty.

Definitive guidelines for the management of DQT do not exist. In the published consensus statement from the European HANDGUIDE study, all experts who participated agreed that all patients with DQT should be given instructions about activity, function, and pain and these should be accompanied by 1 or more of the following interventions: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), splinting, corticosteroid injection (CSI), and surgery. The intervention should be chosen based on severity, duration of DQT, and previous treatments given. Consensus was reached on a therapeutic hierarchy, which starts with instructions plus NSAIDs and finishes with surgery.

An increasing number of treatment options for DQT is becoming available, such as hyaluronic acid injections, extracorporeal shockwave therapy, acupuncture, ultrasonographic therapy, and laser therapy, all with limited evidence on their effectiveness. Therefore, management decisions can be challenging, given the several available treatment modalities and their possible combinations. Our aim was to present the highest quality of evidence on the comparative effectiveness associated with available interventions for DQT to facilitate clinical practice decisions and contribute to future guidelines.

### De quervain's tenosynovitis: a review of the rehabilitative options [^1146Ue9G]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

de Quervain's tenosynovitis is an overuse disease that involves a thickening of the extensor retinaculum, which covers the first dorsal compartment. A case study approach was utilized in this article to demonstrate many of the available medical and occupational therapy modalities to treat this condition. A 34-year-old right hand-dominant female who works in a daycare facility presents with radial side wrist pain during lifting activity for the past 4–6 weeks. The patient was diagnosed with de Quervain's tenosynovitis and conservative care was initiated. Conservative care involved anti-inflammatory medication and corticosteroid injections as well as occupational therapy to include splinting, activity modification, modalities, manual treatment, and therapeutic exercise. Although conservative care assisted the patient with her symptoms initially, she returned with increased pain and discomfort after 2 months time. At that point, surgery was discussed and performed to release the first dorsal compartment as well as the sub-compartment. The patient was provided with a splint postoperatively and initiated occupational therapy for edema and scar management, therapeutic exercise, and desensitization. Ultimately, the patient was able to return to work pain free.

### Advancements in de quervain tenosynovitis management: a comprehensive network meta-analysis [^113qWuNN]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study presents a network meta-analysis aimed at evaluating nonsurgical treatment modalities for de Quervain tenosynovitis. The primary objective was to assess the comparative effectiveness of nonsurgical treatment options.

Methods

The systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were performed in multiple databases, and studies meeting predefined criteria were included. Data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and statistical analysis were carried out to compare treatment modalities. The analysis was categorized into short-term (within six weeks), medium-term (six weeks up to six months), and long-term (one year) follow-up.

Results

The analysis included 14 randomized controlled trials encompassing various treatment modalities for de Quervain tenosynovitis. In the short-term, extracorporeal shockwave therapy demonstrated statistically significant improvement in visual analog scale pain scores compared with placebo. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy also ranked highest in the treatment options based on its treatment effects. Corticosteroid injections (CSIs) combined with casting and laser therapy with orthosis showed favorable outcomes. Corticosteroid injection alone, platelet-rich plasma injections alone, acupuncture, and orthosis alone did not significantly differ from placebo in visual analog scale pain score. In the medium-term, extracorporeal shockwave therapy remained the top-ranking option for visual analog scale pain score, followed by CSI with casting. In the long-term (one year), CSI alone and platelet-rich plasma injections demonstrated sustained pain relief. Combining CSI with orthosis also appeared promising when compared with CSI alone.

Conclusions

Corticosteroid injection with a short duration of immobilization remains the primary and effective treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be considered a secondary option. Alternative treatment modalities, such as isolated therapeutic injection, should be approached with caution because they did not show substantial benefits over placebo.

Although oral NSAIDs have been recommended as first-line treatment for DQT, their use is not supported by the existing literature. An RCT by Ansarifound that treatment of DQT with NSAIDs, splinting, and local application of ointment had much worse outcomes in terms of treatment success at 1 and 2 weeks compared with a CSI. Another RCTcomparing CSI with or without oral NSAID found no additional benefits associated with the use of the NSAID. Finally, an RCTthat was published after we performed our literature search and was therefore not included in our study found that a CSI was more effective for pain, function, and grip strength at 6 weeks than an NSAID injection.

The findings of previously published systematic reviews of RCTs were largely limited by inadequate evidence. An early Cochrane reviewonly included 1 RCT of CSI vs thumb spica immobilization in pregnant or postpartum patients, and the superiority of the CSI could not be generalized to the wider population. Similarly, a systematic reviewon surgical outcomes for DQT was unable to make any useful conclusions for pain or function since only 3 studies were eligible for inclusion. Another systematic reviewof 2 RCTs found that CSI was more effective than splinting. A study by Cavaleri et alshowed that both thumb spica immobilization, acupuncture, and CSI were associated with improved pain and function but CSI plus orthoses interventions were the most effective, which is in agreement with our results. A systematic reviewof all study types found that surgery for DQT was effective in up to 95% of patients, and there were no differences in outcomes or complications among different types of surgery and incision. Finally, a study by Huisstede et alreported moderate evidence for the effectiveness of CSI in DQT in the very short-term, and for adding splinting to CSI in the short- and mid-term.

### Nonsurgical treatment of De quervain tenosynovitis: a prospective randomized trial [^114SPdFf]. Hand (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: De Quervain tenosynovitis is commonly seen in patients who perform repetitive wrist ulnar deviation with thumb abduction and extension. Previous studies comparing nonsurgical options have contributed to a lack of consensus about ideal management. This study's purpose was to analyze results in prospectively randomized patients treated with either corticosteroid injection (CSI) alone versus CSI with immobilization. Methods: Radial sided wrist pain, first dorsal compartment tenderness, and positive Finkelstein test were used to define De Quervain. Pain score of 4 or higher on a visual analog scale (VAS) was utilized for inclusion. Following exclusion criteria, patients underwent randomization into groups: (1) CSI alone; or (2) CSI with 3 weeks of immobilization. We followed at 3 weeks and 6 months for further evaluation, where resolution of symptoms and improvements in VAS and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scores were assessed to evaluate treatment success. Results: Nine patients with CSI alone and 11 patients with CSI and immobilization were followed. At 6 months in both groups, patients experienced significant improvement in VAS and DASH scores, while 88% of patients with CSI alone and 73% of patients with CSI and immobilization experienced complete resolution of at least 2 out of 3 of their pretreatment symptoms. Between groups, outcomes were comparable except for resolution of radial-sided wrist pain, which was superior in patients with CSI alone (100% vs 64%). Conclusions: Immobilization following injection increases costs, may hinder activities of daily living, and did not contribute to improved patient outcomes in this study. Further prospective studies are warranted.

Open Surgery With Transverse Incision vs Longitudinal Incision

Two studies, of overall high ROB were pooled for the comparison of transverse vs longitudinal incision for open surgery. Despite the large ORs for total complications (OR, 6.8 [95% CI, 0.9 to 48.1]; I² = 64%; 2 studies; very low certainty of evidence) and superficial radial nerve injury (OR, 7.7 [95% CI, 0.9, 64.0]; I² = 0%; 2 studies; very low certainty of evidence) in favor of longitudinal incisions, these did not reach statistical significance due to very wide CIs. The incidence of hypertrophic scar was similar between incision types (OR 2.0 [95% CI, 0.4–10.8]; I² = 47%; 2 studies; very low certainty of evidence).

Network Meta-Analyses

A total of 17 studies, were included in network meta-analyses, which were performed separately for short-term pain (15 studies; 14 interventions), mid-term pain (9 studies; 7 interventions), short-term function (8 studies; 7 interventions), and mid-term function (6 studies; 3 interventions). eFigures 17 through 20 in Supplement 1 show the comparative treatment class effects for short-term pain, mid-term pain, short-term function, and mid-term function. eTables 4 through 7 in Supplement 1 represent the summary of findings of the network meta-analyses, comparing all included interventions with the reference comparator (conventional CSI) for each outcome at each follow up time period.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1137voxi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on de Quervain's tenosynovitis:

- **Definition**: De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a tendon entrapment condition involving the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons, which become restricted within the first dorsal compartment.
- **Pathophysiology**: The etiology and pathogenesis of de Quervain's tenosynovitis are unknown, though repetietive movements and overuse have been proposed as contributing factors. Non-inflammatory thickening of the tendons and swelling of the tendon sheaths leads to impaired gliding of the tendins through the first dorsal compartment.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of de Quervain's tenosynovitis is estimated at 2.8 per 1,000 person-years in women and 0.6 per 1,000 person-years in men among military personnel in the US. The prevalence in the general population in the United Kingdom is estimated at 1.3% in women and 0.5% in men.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for de Quervain's tenosynovitis include overuse, repetitive movements, certain activities and occupations involving strenuous wrist use, such as hammering, as well as pregnancy and the postpartum period (lifting and holding an infant).
- **Disease course**: Most patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis present with persistent wrist pain and swelling over the first extensor dorsal compartment, which may radiate to the thumb and forearm. The pain is typically worsened by thumb or wrist movement, particularly during thumb abduction, extension, or ulnar and radial deviation, and is relieved with rest.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114mC9N9]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The overall incidence of a separate EPB subcompartment within the first extensor compartment has been reported to be as high as 80%, with up to 90% of patients experiencing DQT and 70% of asymptomatic patients having a separate EPB. This high incidence implies that this should perhaps be regarded as an expectant anatomical component of the normal wrist rather than a variant. An association between this separate subcompartment and EPB acting as a thumb interphalangeal joint extensor has also been reported. Some researchers have speculated that DQT is secondary to EPB entrapment alone, as evidence suggests that surgically releasing the septated EPB subcompartment only and administering ultrasonography-guided CSI into the EPB subcompartment only are as effective as release of the subcompartment and the first extensor compartment sheath plus CSI into both the subcompartment and the main first extensor compartment. Indeed, CSI into the EPB subcompartment alone ranked among the top interventions in our network meta-analysis for short-term pain. Finally, a more dorsal incision to the extensor retinaculum has been recommended to avoid tendon subluxation, or even a partial excision of the extensor retinaculum to prevent reannealing of the retinaculum and recurrent symptoms; however, there is currently no convincing evidence to support these recommendations.

CSI Plus Thumb Spica Immobilization vs CSI Alone

Among 4 studies, in this meta-analysis; 1 was of high overall ROB and 3 were of some concerns of ROB. Postinjection immobilization was for either 3 weeks, or 4 weeks, in a cast, a splint, or either. For both short-term and mid-term pain, the group that included immobilization was associated with statistically but not clinically significant improvements in VAS scores (short-term MD, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.4–2.1] points; I² = 86%; 3 studies; 207 participants; very low certainty of evidence; mid-term MD, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.3–2.2] points; I² = 93%; 4 studies; 289 participants; very low certainty of evidence). The benefits of adding immobilization to CSI were also evident for short-term and mid-term function based on Q-DASH scores, and this was also statistically but not clinically significant (short-term MD, 10.5 [95% CI, 6.8–14.1] points; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 207 participants; moderate certainty of evidence; mid-term MD, 9.4 [95% CI, 7.0, 11.9] points; I² = 0%; 4 studies; 289 participants; moderate certainty of evidence).

Ultrasonography-Guided CSI vs Conventional CSI

Two studies, with some concerns in their overall ROB assessments were pooled for the comparison of ultrasonography-guided vs conventional CSI. For short-term pain VAS scores, although the pooled outcome favored the ultrasonography-guided group at clinical significance, this was not statistically significant due to a very wide CI (MD, 2.1 [95% CI, −0.5 to 4.6] points; I² = 91%; 2 studies; 92 participants; very low certainty of evidence).

### Effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for treatment of de quervain's tenosynovitis [^116RiPQU]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although surgery can provide definitive treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, nonoperative treatment could be preferable if symptoms are predictably relieved. We sought to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections as treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis and to evaluate patient characteristics as predictors of treatment outcome.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted using our institutional database International Classification of Disease, version 9 (ICD-9) code list for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Treatment success was defined as relief of symptoms after 1 or 2 injections. Relief was defined as resolution or improvement to the extent that the patient did not seek further intervention. Failure was defined as a subsequent surgical release or a third injection. Logistic regression analyses were performed to look for univariate associations between patient demographics/comorbidities and risk of treatment failure.

Results

The treatment outcome of 222 limbs from 199 patients was studied. Of the 222 limbs, 73.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 66.9%-79.1%) experienced treatment success within 2 injections, and 51.8% (95% CI, 45.0%-58.6%) experienced success after 1 injection. Body mass index (BMI) > 30 and female sex were found to be significantly associated with treatment failure, with a 2.4-fold increase (95% CI, 1.02%-5.72%) in odds and 3.23 times greater (95% CI, 1.08%-9.67%) odds of failure, respectively. Although not reaching statistical significance, African American race, hypothyroidism, and carpal tunnel syndrome suggested increased odds of failure.

Conclusions

This study indicates that corticosteroid injections are a useful treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis, leading to treatment success 73.4% of the time within 2 injections. This study also suggests that female sex and BMI > 30 are associated with increased treatment failure.

### De quervain tenosynovitis of the wrist [^1144a2uQ]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

De quervain disease, or stenosing tenosynovitis of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist, is a common wrist pathology. Pain results from resisted gliding of the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis tendons in the fibro-osseus canal. de Quervain tenosynovitis of the wrist is more common in women than men. Diagnosis may be made on physical examination. Radiographs are helpful in ruling out offending bony pathology. Nonsurgical management, consisting of corticosteroid injections and supportive thumb spica splinting, is usually successful. In resistant cases, surgical release of the first dorsal compartment is done, taking care to protect the radial sensory nerve and identify all accessory compartments. Repair of the extensor retinaculum by step-cut lengthening or other techniques is rarely required.

Study Design

Case study.

Objectives

To describe the use of conventional physical therapy interventions together with Mobilization With Movement (MWM) techniques in the treatment of an individual with a complicated scenario of de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

Background

The patient was a 61-year-old woman who presented with signs and symptoms consistent with de Quervain's tenosynovitis of the right hand. Range limitations in all motions of the right wrist and first carpometacarpal joint complicated her presentation.

Methods and Measures

Physical therapy included conventional intervention with superficial heat, ice, iontophoresis, and transverse friction massage directed to the first dorsal tunnel. Conventional joint mobilization techniques addressed the motion limitations of the first carpometacarpal, radiocarpal, and midcarpal joints. In addition, MWM techniques were utilized to promote pain-free wrist and thumb mobility. The specific MWM techniques used with this patient involved active movements of the thumb and wrist superimposed on a passive radial glide of the proximal row of carpal bones.

Results

The described treatment regime, which involved conventional physical therapy interventions, along with MWM, aided in the complete resolution of this patient's impairments and functional limitations.

Conclusion

The combination of conventional physical agents, exercise, and manual therapy, and the less conventional MWM techniques, proved successful with this patient. MWM involving the correction of minutejoint malalignments, coupled with active motion of the wrist and first carpometacarpal joints, was an effective and efficient adjunct physical therapy intervention. Because subtle changes injoint alignment may contribute to painful syndromes in the tendon complexes that cross a malaligned joint, use of MWM as a treatment technique warrants continued research.

Another relevant finding was that when patients experienced symptoms for a longer period before surgical release, they had worse outcomes in terms of postoperative pain. Our results show that for each additional year a patient experienced symptoms before surgery, they scored on average 1.6 points higher on the VAS pain scale at 3-month follow-up. Clinically, this effect is small; therefore, it might be questioned whether we should operate on patients with DQ earlier instead of continuing with conservative treatment if this does not improve pain. The multidisciplinary international treatment guideline based on expert opinions written by Huisstede et al.described symptom duration as one of the main factors in choosing a treatment option for DQ. In this guideline, the authors used a cutoff value of 6 months, at which point immediate surgery is required because of substantial symptoms. However, in the literature, there are no explanations for why patients with a longer symptom duration have worse patient-reported pain scores after surgery. One explanation might be that patients with chronic DQ symptoms have more tenosynovitis and therefore need longer recovery times. Another explanation could be that the superficial radial nerve will be affected because of a longer duration of symptoms. Nerve repair requires a longer recovery time, and perhaps these patients would experience improvement after a longer follow-up period.

Short-Term Pain

For pain at 0 to 12 weeks, the most effective interventions were ultrasonography-guided CSI in EPB compartment only (where there is subcompartmentalization), ultrasonography-guided CSI injection plus delayed injection of hyaluronic acid, ultrasonography-guided CSI injection plus delayed injection of normal saline, neural therapy (local anesthetic therapy directed at the autonomic nervous system) plus thumb spica splint, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy plus thumb spica splint. Of these, ultrasonography-guided CSI in EPB compartment only (where there is subcompartmentalization) had the highest probability (22%) of being the most effective. Placebo injection (normal saline) had the highest probability of being the least effective, followed by as-decided thumb spica splint wear and full-time thumb spica splint wear. Figure 3 details the network map, the network forest plots, and the rank bar graphs for short-term pain.

From the combined direct and indirect comparisons neural therapy plus thumb spica splint, extracorporeal shockwave therapy plus thumb spica splint, and ultrasonography-guided CSI were each found to be clinically and statistically significantly superior to thumb spica splint alone. Additionally, ultrasonography-guided CSI was superior to conventional CSI, and conventional CSI with or without thumb spica, ultrasonography-guided CSI with or without delayed injection of normal saline or hyaluronic acid, neural therapy plus thumb spica splint, ultrasonography-guided CSI in EPB compartment only or in both compartments (where there is subcompartmentalization), and ultrasonography-guided CSI were each superior to placebo saline injection alone (eFigure 17 in Supplement 1).

Importance

Carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and basilar (carpometacarpal) joint arthritis of the thumb can be associated with significant disability.

Observations

Carpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by numbness and tingling in the thumb and the index, middle, and radial ring fingers and by weakness of thumb opposition when severe. It is more common in women and people who are obese, have diabetes, and work in occupations involving use of keyboards, computer mouse, heavy machinery, or vibrating manual tools. The Durkan physical examination maneuver, consisting of firm digital pressure across the carpal tunnel to reproduce symptoms, is 64% sensitive and 83% specific for carpal tunnel syndrome. People with suspected proximal compression or other compressive neuropathies should undergo electrodiagnostic testing, which is approximately more than 80% sensitive and 95% specific for carpal tunnel syndrome. Splinting or steroid injection may temporarily relieve symptoms. Patients who do not respond to conservative therapies may undergo open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release for definitive treatment. Trigger finger, which involves abnormal resistance to smooth flexion and extension ("triggering") of the affected finger, affects up to 20% of adults with diabetes and approximately 2% of the general population. Steroid injection is the first-line therapy but is less efficacious in people with insulin-dependent diabetes. People with diabetes and those with recurrent symptoms may benefit from early surgical release. de Quervain tenosynovitis, consisting of swelling of the extensor tendons at the wrist, is more common in women than in men. People with frequent mobile phone use are at increased risk. The median age of onset is 40 to 59 years. Steroid injections relieve symptoms in approximately 72% of patients, particularly when combined with immobilization. People with recurrent symptoms may be considered for surgical release of the first dorsal extensor compartment. Thumb carpometacarpal joint arthritis affects approximately 33% of postmenopausal women, according to radiographic evidence of carpometacarpal arthritis. Approximately 20% of patients require treatment for pain and disability. Nonsurgical interventions (immobilization, steroid injection, and pain medication) relieve pain but do not alter disease progression. Surgery may be appropriate for patients unresponsive to conservative treatments.

Conclusions and Relevance

Carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and thumb carpometacarpal joint arthritis can be associated with significant disability. First-line treatment for each condition consists of steroid injection, immobilization, or both. For patients who do not respond to noninvasive therapy or for progressive disease despite conservative therapy, surgical treatment is safe and effective.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on the work-related cause of de quervain tenosynovitis: a critical appraisal of its recognition as an occupational disease [^116hyCFY]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The authors systematically reviewed all of the etiopathologic factors discussed in the literature to verify the classification of de Quervain tenosynovitis on the list of occupational diseases.

Methods

The authors searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for articles discussing the cause of de Quervain tenosynovitis. The literature was classified by the level of evidence presented, the etiopathologic hypothesis discussed, the authors' conclusion about the role of the etiopathologic hypothesis, and the first author's professional background. The quality of reporting of the observational studies was evaluated by an extended Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement checklist. A meta-analysis of all controlled cohort studies was performed. The Bradford Hill criteria were used to evaluate a causal relationship between de Quervain tenosynovitis and occupational risk factors.

Results

A total of 179 references were found, and 80 articles were included. On average, only 35 percent (median, 35 percent; range, 16 to 60 percent) of all items on the extended Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist were addressed per article. The meta-analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between de Quervain tenosynovitis and (1) repetitive, (2) forceful, or (3) ergonomically stressful manual work suggested an odds ratio of 2.89 (95 percent CI, 1.4 to 5.97; p = 0.004). No evidence was found to support the Bradford Hill criteria for a causal relationship between de Quervain tenosynovitis and occupational risk factors.

Conclusion

No sufficient scientific evidence was provided to confirm a causal relationship between de Quervain tenosynovitis and occupational risk factors.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^111WKPxo]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

De Quervain disease (DQVD) was first described by Fritz De Quervain in 1895 as a stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons within the first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist. It is a common cause of wrist pain and disability involving the dominant hand among middle-aged women. Most patients respond well to non-operative management, which includes immobilization of the thumb, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, and local corticosteroid injection. Ultrasound-guided injection for DQVD helps in precisely targeting the involved tendons and reduces collateral damage to the neurovascular structures.4–6 The present case report aimed to demonstrate the potential usefulness of methotrexate in a patient with recalcitrant DQVD.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111FuAU3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Mid-Term Pain

Neural therapy plus thumb spica splint ranked at the top as having the highest probability of being the most effective intervention for pain at 13 to 52 weeks, followed by conventional CSI plus thumb spica immobilization. Thumb spica splint and thumb spica cast had the highest probabilities of being the least effective interventions. eFigures 8 through 10 in Supplement 1 show the network map, the network forest plots, and the rank bar graphs for short-term pain. Out of all combined direct and indirect comparisons, only the comparison between neural therapy plus thumb spica splint vs thumb spica splint alone was statistically and clinically significant, favoring the neural therapy (eFigure 18 in Supplement 1).

Short-Term Function

Conventional CSI plus thumb spica immobilization had the highest probability of being the most effective intervention for function at 0 to 12 weeks, followed by acupuncture. Thumb spica splint had the highest probability of being the least effective. eFigures 11 to 13 in Supplement 1 show the network map, the network forest plots, and the rank bar graphs for short-term pain.

From the combined direct and indirect comparisons, conventional CSI plus thumb spica immobilization was clinical and statistically superior to thumb spica cast and thumb spica splint with full-time wear or as-decided wear (eFigure 19 in Supplement 1).

Mid-Term Function

Of 3 included interventions, conventional CSI plus thumb spica immobilization had the highest probability of being the most effective intervention and thumb spica splint had the highest probability of being the least effective for function at 13 to 52 weeks. eFigures 14 to 16 in Supplement 1 show the network map, the network forest plots, and the rank bar graphs for short-term pain. There were no combined direct and indirect comparisons that produced both statistically and clinically significant results (eFigure 20 in Supplement 1).

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^116QVFJH]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Small joint injections — clinical recommendations state that clinicians should preferably offer US guidance when performing injections into the small joints of the wrists, hands, feet, and ankles, as it may provide benefit (eg, reduced procedural pain) over landmark-based guidance (Grade C). In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in the small joints of the wrists and hands, IACSSI may be used as an adjunct therapy to decrease pain, improve function, and reduce signs and symptoms of inflammation (Grade C). For trigger finger, clinicians should perform CSI with 20 mg triamcinolone/methylprednisolone corticosteroid equivalent rather than 5 or 10 mg (Grade C), and clinicians should offer thumb splints in conjunction with CSI for De Quervain's tenosynovitis (Grade C). For plantar fascia, clinicians can perform corticosteroid injections for rheumatic inflammatory heel pain not responsive to conservative measures (Grade C) and should avoid plantar fascia injections with corticosteroids for noninflammatory plantar heel pain.

### De quervain tenosynovitis: an evaluation of the epidemiology and utility of multiple injections using a national database [^115tup48]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We hypothesized that repeat injections are associated with a decreased rate of success and that the success rate of injections correlates with patient comorbidities.

Methods

Using a commercially available insurance database, patients diagnosed with De Quervain tenosynovitis were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision codes and stratified by therapeutic interventions, including therapy, injections, and surgery, as well as comorbidities. Injection failure was defined as a patient receiving a repeat injection or subsequent surgical management. Success was defined as no further therapies identified after an intervention.

Results

From 2007 to 2017, 33,420 patients with a primary diagnosis of De Quervain tenosynovitis were identified. Women represented 77.5% (25,908) of the total and were 2.6 times more likely to be diagnosed than men. Black patients were more likely to be diagnosed than White patients. Black and White women were found to have the highest incidence (relative risk 3.4 and 2.3, respectively, compared with White men). Age was also significantly correlated with an increased risk of diagnosis of the condition, with a peak incidence at the age of 40–59 years (relative risk, 10.6). Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and hypothyroidism were associated with an increased risk of diagnosis. Overall, 53.3% of the patients were treated with injections, 11.6% underwent surgery, and 5.2% underwent therapy. Treatment with a single injection was successful in 71.9% of the patients, with 19.7% receiving a repeat injection and 8.4% treated with surgery. The overall success rate of subsequent injections was 66.3% for the second injection and 60.5% for the third. The initial injection had a higher rate of success in diabetics than in nondiabetics; however, the difference (2%) was not clinically relevant.

Conclusions

Although the success rate for the treatment of De Quervains tenosynovitis decreases with multiple injections, repeat injections have a high rate of success and are a viable clinical option.

### De quervain's tenosynovitis in patients with lymphedema: a report of 2 cases with management approach [^111Es132]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2003). Low credibility.

De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a tendonitis of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons. It commonly occurs as a result of overuse and is often seen in patients who perform repetitive activities. The occurrence of de Quervain's tenosynovitis in lymphedema has not been reported, nor has the management of de Quervain's tenosynovitis been discussed in the literature for patients whose lymphedema results from cancer or other disorders. Musculoskeletal conditions in lymphedema patients often require special considerations because these patients are more susceptible to infections and other complications. We describe the rehabilitation management of de Quervain's tenosynovitis in 2 patients with lymphedema secondary to breast carcinoma. Both patients responded to conservative management with a good clinical outcome. We conclude that a conservative initial management approach consisting of the continued wear of a compression garment, the fabrication of a custom-made thumb spica, occupational therapy with an emphasis on tendon gliding exercises, and prescription of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is effective and safe.

### Advice to remain active with arm pain reduces disability [^113oXWB9]. Occupational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

That early physiotherapy was not better than physiotherapy after a waiting period was perhaps surprising. For the most part, early intervention is recommended amongst people with musculoskeletal conditions, not least because the longer duration of sickness absence is associated with reducing odds of ever returning to work. However, there is already rather limited evidence of the effectiveness of physiotherapy for distal arm pain, whether caused by specific or non-specific disorders. In UK clinics, physiotherapists do not usually offer corticosteroid injections, for which there is some limited evidence for a short-term benefit in conditions such as epicondylitis, de Quervain's tenosynovitis or trigger finger, so the treatment offered would include splints, manual therapies, massage or exercises. Whilst the effectiveness of these approaches is possibly limited, one benefit of early physiotherapy would be to have a trusted healthcare professional reinforce healthy beliefs, encourage movement and de-medicalize the symptoms. Physiotherapists in this trial were not trained to do this in the absence of evidence for this approach but were encouraged to assess and treat each patient according to best practice. Analysis of the actual treatment offered showed no differences between the three groups, so our findings would suggest that either physiotherapists do not emphasize these messages or that people with arm pain are no more likely to take such advice on board whether given this information early or some weeks later.

There is an established evidence base for an increased risk of epicondylitis in association with physically demanding activities of the upper limb, for example, in the meat processing industry. Consequently, the recommendation has been that the management of epicondylitis should involve resting the elbow and avoidance of provoking occupational activities. As a significant proportion of the working ARM trial participants had signs and symptoms consistent with this diagnosis, we analysed the response to advice to remain active in this sub-group. Our finding that there was no suggestion of a poorer response is encouraging, although must be treated with caution given that the statistical power may have been insufficient to show an effect. If this finding can be replicated, it suggests that de-medicalization and remaining active may be a more effective approach to reducing disability for specific, as well as non-specific, causes of upper limb pain.

### Practical management of tendon disorders in the hand [^1166EaaG]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After reviewing this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Recognize and treat common tendinopathies such as trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis. 2. Recognize and treat flexor tendon and extensor tendon injuries. 3. Define the different zones where flexor tendon and extensor tendon injuries occur and identify the surgical challenges related to each zone.

Summary

Common tendon disorders in the hand range from simple trigger fingers to more complex zone II flexor tendon injuries. The goal of treatment in all cases is to aim for optimal early strength and to create conditions favorable for early rehabilitation to decrease the risk of tendon scarring and subsequent poor range of motion. This CME article reviews the presentation, evaluation, state-of-the-art treatment, and outcomes of the treatment of trigger finger, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and flexor tendon and extensor tendon injuries. New developments in the different areas are highlighted to inform the reader of emerging techniques in the treatment of tendon disorders of the hand.

### Risk factors associated with de quervain tenosynovitis in postpartum women [^111cPSXp]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

De Quervain (DQ) tenosynovitis is a disease involving the first extensor compartment of the hand, including tendons of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus muscles. De Quervain is characterized by pain on the dorsal area of the hand and pain when performing ulnar deviation and flexion of the wrist. Initially, patients are managed nonoperatively through physical therapy, application of a brace, and steroid injections to the first compartment. When patients are unresponsive to these treatments or the disease recurs, surgical release of the first compartment is commonly performed.

Over the years, many risk factors have been proposed for DQ tenosynovitis, including female sex, black race, and age greater than 40 years old. Pregnancy is well documented to have a significant association with a diagnosis of DQ. From a mechanical standpoint, in the postpartum period, the stress placed on surrounding tendons that occurs through flexion and ulnar deviation when caring for the baby results in inflammation to the tendons and tendon sheaths, which predisposes mothers to this pathology. - The findings of several studies suggest that DQ is self-limited and resolves after cessation of lactation.

Despite the established association between DQ and pregnancy, the natural course of the disease along with its epidemiology and associated gestational risk factors are poorly described in the current body of literature. Using a database from the largest health insurance organization in the country, we devised the following study to better understand, investigate, and describe gestational risk factors associated with a diagnosis of DQ in postpartum women.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^112e5jMR]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection could be a safe and effective method in the management of recalcitrant DQVD. Further large-scale studies are needed to compare its effectiveness with corticosteroid injection or surgical intervention.

### Maintained physical activity and physiotherapy in the management of distal arm pain: a randomised controlled trial [^112z8JY7]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Among those referred to physiotherapy with distal arm pain — that is, pain in the elbow, forearm, wrist or hand — around 50% still report pain at 1 year, with a substantial minority reporting that symptoms are unremitting. Interestingly, although conventional teaching would suggest that distal arm pain is caused by specific conditions (epicondylitis, tenosynovitis, de Quervain's, carpal tunnel syndrome) or may be non-specific, there is little evidence of any difference in prognosis among these groups 1 year after physiotherapy referral.

Thus, the evidence suggests that distal arm pain is common, disabling and has mechanical and psychosocial aetiology, and there is little evidence that separating states of 'disease' with different presumed causation or risk factors results in different therapeutic outcomes. In many respects, therefore, distal arm pain is similar to mechanical low back pain, the management of which was transformed when evidence emerged that bed rest was ineffective and that patients experienced improved outcomes if they maintained activities. Today, through education and large-scale health campaigns, practice has changed and unless there are red flags, few are sent for imaging, receive specific diagnoses or are advised to rest. In contrast, with the exception of specific treatments for certain underlying pathologies (eg, decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome), rest is the most prescribed recommendation in the management of distal arm pain, with the use of analgesics or anti-inflammatories as required, and referral for physiotherapy for persistent symptoms. Guidance from the UK National Health Service (NHS) website recommends that for tendonitis and tennis elbow, it is important to rest the injured limb and stop doing the exercise or activity that caused the symptoms, and the UK Health and Safety Executive advises that 'if a task is causing or contributing to an upper limb disorder, the worker may need to stop doing that task for a time'. This guidance is based on the biomedical assumption that the tissues have been 'injured', and that the treatment of choice is therefore avoidance, even though there is no published evidence to support this assumption.

### Improved corticosteroid treatment of recalcitrant de quervain tenosynovitis with a novel 4-point injection technique [^114KH2pN]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Previously described corticosteroid injection techniques for de Quervain tenosynovitis (DQT) refer to either 1-point or 2-point injection techniques, showing superiority of the latter.

Hypothesis

The authors' novel 4-point injection technique (point 4 technique) yields more favorable results than do the older techniques.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

The authors treated 2 groups (A and B), each including 24 high-resistance training individuals (randomly allocated to each group) with persistent DQT. Group A received the point 4 technique, and group B, the 2-point injection technique. Follow-up was in 2, 4, 8, and 52 weeks after the first treatment.

Results

After 2 weeks of treatment, 7 group A patients were symptom-free, whereas the rest scored better than their group B counterparts on the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) Outcome Measure, of whom only 1 was symptom-free. Ten group A patients received repeated injections, in contrast to 19 from group B. Four weeks after the first treatment, 13 group A patients were symptom-free, in contrast to 4 from group B. In group A, 2 patients received repeated injections, in contrast to 20 in group B. Eight weeks after the first treatment, 1 group A patient received repeated injection. One group B patient relapsed, whereas 4 opted for surgical decompression and 16 received repeated injections. Fifty-two weeks after the first treatment, 21 patients in group A were symptom-free, 1 was operated on, and 2 relapsed; in group B, 12 were symptom-free, 9 were operated on, 3 relapsed, and 3 received repeated injections.

Conclusion

In high-resistance training athletes, recalcitrant DQT responds more favorably to the novel point 4 technique than to the standard 2-point injection technique.

### Ultrasound-guided injections for de quervain's tenosynovitis [^1173fq4s]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsurgical management of de Quervain's tenosynovitis often includes corticosteroid injections. If the injection does not enter the compartment, or all subcompartments, response to the injection is variable. To ensure proper location of injections we evaluated the role of ultrasound.

Questions/Purposes

We determined (1) the incidence of two or more subcompartments, (2) the incidence of anatomic variations during surgical release after failed injections, and (3) the relief of pain after ultrasound-guided injections.

Patients and Methods

A prospective series of 40 consecutive patients (42 wrists) diagnosed with de Quervain's tenosynovitis by clinical examination were referred to a radiologist for an ultrasound-guided injection. The radiologist injected the first dorsal compartment and noted any septations. Patients returned for followup where outcomes, DASH, and VAS scores were calculated. The treating surgeon was blinded to any anatomic variations. Followup was at 6 weeks and a minimum of 6 months (mean, 6 weeks, range, 3–17 months; mean, 11 months, range, 7–18 months). Four patients were lost to followup.

Results

Multiple subcompartments were noted in 22 of 42 (52%) wrists. At the 6-week followup, 36 of the 37 wrists examined in 36 patients (97%) had at least partial resolution of symptoms. Multiple subcompartments were identified in 52% of cases. At last followup, the mean DASH and VAS scores were 18.4 and 2.2, respectively. However 14% of wrists had recurrence of symptoms, all of which had subcompartments on ultrasound. No adverse effects from the injections were noted.

Conclusion

We found ultrasound-guided injections to be useful for treatment of de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Our success with ultrasound-guided injections was slightly better than that reported in the literature and without adverse reactions.

### Are patient expectations and illness perception associated with patient-reported outcomes from surgical decompression in de quervain's tenosynovitis? [^112JASsq]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Psychological factors such as depression, pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, pain anxiety, and more negative illness perceptions are associated with worse pain and function in patients at the start of treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Longitudinal studies have found symptoms of depression and pain catastrophizing at baseline were associated with worse pain after treatment. It is important to study patients opting for surgery for their condition because patients should choose surgical treatment based on their values rather than misconceptions. Psychological factors associated with worse patient-reported outcomes from surgery for de Quervain's tenosynovitis should be identified and addressed preoperatively so surgeons can correct any misunderstandings about the condition.

Question/Purpose

What preoperative psychosocial factors (depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, illness perception, and patient expectations) are associated with pain and function 3 months after surgical treatment of de Quervain's tenosynovitis after controlling for demographic characteristics?

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of 164 patients who underwent surgery for de Quervain's tenosynovitis between September 2017 and October 2018 performed by 20 hand surgeons at 18 centers. Our database included 326 patients who underwent surgery for de Quervain's tenosynovitis during the study period. Of these, 62% (201 of 326) completed all baseline questionnaires and 50% (164 of 326) also completed patient-reported outcomes at 3 months postoperatively. We found no difference between those included and those not analyzed in terms of age, sex, duration of symptoms, smoking status, and workload. The mean ± SD age of the patients was 52 ± 14 years, 86% (141 of 164) were women, and the mean duration of symptoms was 13 ± 19 months. Patients completed the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), the VAS for pain and function, the Patient Health Questionnaire for symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Credibility/Expectations Questionnaire, and the Brief Illness Perceptions questionnaire at baseline. Patients also completed the PRWE and VAS for pain and function at 3 months postoperatively. We used a hierarchical multivariable linear regression model to investigate the relative contribution of patient demographics and psychosocial factors to the pain and functional outcome at 3 months postoperatively.

Results

After adjusting for demographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, and baseline PRWE score, we found that only the patient's expectations of treatment and how long their illness would last were associated with the total PRWE score at 3 months postoperatively. More positive patient expectations of treatment were associated with better patient-reported pain and function at 3 months postoperatively (ß = -2.0; p < 0.01), while more negative patient perceptions of how long their condition would last were associated with worse patient-reported pain and function (timeline ß = 2.7; p < 0.01). The final model accounted for 31% of the variance in the patient-reported outcome at 3 months postoperatively.

Conclusion

Patient expectations and illness perceptions are associated with patient-reported pain and functional outcomes after surgical decompression for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Addressing misconceptions about de Quervain's tenosynovitis in terms of the consequences for patients and how long their symptoms will last should allow patients to make informed decisions about the treatment that best matches their values. Prospective studies are needed to investigate whether addressing patient expectations and illness perceptions, with decision aids for example, can improve patient-reported pain and function postoperatively in those patients who still choose surgery for de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

### Persistent de quervain tenosynovitis induced by somatotropin treatment [^115KPaiZ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Growth hormone deficiency is a well-known clinical entity that is usually treated with somatotropin (growth hormone). Growth hormone has some frequent side effects such as intracranial hypertension, lymphedema and diabetes mellitus.

Case Presentation

We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with a history of wrist pain and clumsiness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed de Quervain tenosynovitis. The patient had a history of using growth hormones for 12 months. We conservatively managed the patient with corticosteroid injections and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and followed the course. However, the conservative treatment methods failed, and we recommended surgery, which was rejected. She was given nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was followed up for 2 years, at the end of which her visual analog scale had decreased from 80 to 50.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of de Quervain tenosynovitis related to somatotropin treatment. Physicians should consider the possibility of musculoskeletal side effects after somatotropin treatment.

### Ultrasound-guided procedures around the wrist and hand: how to do [^116wR6t1]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasound has emerged as a low-cost, radiation-free and effective imaging technique to detect joint abnormalities and to guide percutaneous procedures. Being superficial, wrist and hand tendons and joints represent a good target to perform such procedures using ultrasound guidance. This kind of approach allows for a clear and real-time visualization of the needles during their whole path. In this setting, the knowledge of technical aspects and tips is essential to act in the most accurate way on target tissues that can be as small as a few millimetres. The aim of this review is to summarize the local treatments of inflammatory and degenerative disease described in literature (such as treatment of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, trigger finger, trapezio-metacarpal joint osteoarthritis, etc.), emphasizing precautions and tricks based on day-by-day experience that may help to improve the outcome of percutaneous ultrasound-guided procedures around the wrist and hand.

### Association of patient-reported outcomes measurement information system measures with injection and surgical treatment response in patients with De quervain tenosynovitis [^1162rToC]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Treatment of de Quervain tenosynovitis is largely empiric. Patient-Reported Outcomes Management Information System (PROMIS) scores at the time of diagnosis might provide insights into the probability of success of nonsurgical management and predict the necessity for surgical treatment. We aimed to identify which, if any, of the PROMIS metrics may be used to identify patients who will opt for surgery or be managed with injection alone.

Methods

Patients presenting to a tertiary academic medical center from 2014 to 2019, with a sole diagnosis of de Quervain tenosynovitis, were identified and separated by initial and most invasive treatment of either injection or surgery. These groups were then dichotomized using cut points of more than one SD from the mean on the PROMIS physical function and pain interference scales, and a logistic regression model was used to determine the odds ratio of surgical intervention.

Results

Patients who had low physical function or high pain interference had significantly increased odds of ultimately undergoing surgery. Age ranging from 40 to 60 years and female sex were also associated with increased odds of undergoing surgery.

Conclusions

Patients who scored lower than 40 for physical function or higher than 60 for pain interference had significantly increased odds of eventually undergoing surgical release for de Quervain tenosynovitis. PROMIS scores may identify patients who are likely to fail steroid injections as a sole nonsurgical intervention and inform an individualized discussion about surgical management of this condition.

### Helpful tips for performing musculoskeletal injections [^114G2S62]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Injections are valuable procedures for managing musculoskeletal conditions commonly encountered by family physicians. Corticosteroid injections into articular, periarticular, or soft tissue structures relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility. Injections can provide diagnostic information and are commonly used for postoperative pain control. Local anesthetics may be injected with corticosteroids to provide additional, rapid pain relief. Steroid injection is the preferred and definitive treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis and trochanteric bursitis. Steroid injections can also be helpful in controlling pain during physical rehabilitation from rotator cuff syndrome and lateral epicondylitis. Intra-articular steroid injection provides pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. There is little systematic evidence to guide medication selection for therapeutic injections. The medication used and the frequency of injection should be guided by the goal of the injection (i.e., diagnostic or therapeutic), the underlying musculoskeletal diagnosis, and clinical experience. Complications from steroid injections are rare, but physicians should understand the potential risks and counsel patients appropriately. Patients with diabetes who receive periarticular or soft tissue steroid injections should closely monitor their blood glucose for two weeks following injection.

### Testosterone replacement therapy and Associated rates of trigger finger, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and their subsequent management [^111B6i6R]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Anabolic steroid therapy has been associated with tendon injury, but there is a paucity of evidence associating physiologic testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) with tenosynovitis of the hand, specifically trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between TRT and tenosynovitis of the hand.

Methods

This was a one-to-one exact matched retrospective cohort study using a large nationwide claims database. Records were queried between 2010 and 2019 for adult patients who filled a prescription for TRT for 3 consecutive months. Rates of new onset trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis and subsequent steroid injection or surgery were identified using ICD-9, ICD-10, and Current Procedural Terminology billing codes. Single-variable chi-square analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare rates in the TRT and control cohorts while controlling for potential confounding variables. Both unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) are reported for each comparison.

Results

In the adjusted analysis, patients undergoing TRT were more than twice as likely to develop trigger finger compared to their matched controls. TRT was also associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing de Quervain tenosynovitis. Of the patients diagnosed with either trigger finger or de Quervain tenosynovitis over the 2-year period, patients with prior TRT were roughly twice as likely to undergo steroid injections or surgical release for both trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis compared to the controls.

Conclusions

TRT is associated with an increased likelihood of both trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis, and an increased likelihood of requiring surgical release for both conditions.

### Corticosteroid injections for common musculoskeletal conditions [^112Rxe87]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Family physicians considering corticosteroid injections as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for musculoskeletal diagnoses will find few high-quality studies to assist with evidence-based decision making. Most studies of corticosteroid injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis, tendinopathy, bursitis, or neuropathy include only small numbers of patients and have inconsistent long-term follow-up. Corticosteroid injections for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis result in short-term improvements in pain and range of motion. For subacromial impingement syndrome, corticosteroid injections provide short-term pain relief and improvement in function. In medial and lateral epicondylitis, corticosteroid injections offer only short-term improvement of symptoms and have a high rate of symptom recurrence. Corticosteroid injections for carpal tunnel syndrome may help patients avoid or delay surgery. Trigger finger and de Quervain tenosynovitis may be treated effectively with corticosteroid injections. Patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis may have short-term symptom relief with corticosteroid injections.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^112q9y9A]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

DQVD affects 0.5% of working men and 1.3% of working women. Pregnancy, early motherhood, and postmenopausal status predispose women to the development of DQVD. Frequently, DQVD involves the dominant hand; however, involvement of the non-dominant hand is also encountered in clinical practice. The etiology is still unclear, and the risk factors include certain anatomic variations such as multiple tendons inside the first dorsal extensor compartment, presence of a fibrous septum, and mechanical overloading. The net result is inflammation of the tendon sheath, or thickening of the tendon and retinaculum. Microtears of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons may progress to complete rupture and complicate the treatment course. The underlying causes also influence the response to conservative treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rehabilitation, and local steroid injection.–Current literature suggests that corticosteroid injection is indicated in severe cases at the first visit and has a higher rate of remission than immobilization alone.

### The internet as a source of information for De quervain's tendinitis [^114YqgMc]. Hand (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Many individuals are turning to the Internet for information about various health conditions, and in our study we evaluated the quality and readability of information on the internet about De Quervain's tendinitis.

Methods

We chose the search terms "De Quervain's Tendinitis", "De Quervain's Tenosynovitis", and "De Quervain's Syndrome", and entered them into the search engines "Google", "Bing", and "Yahoo" and compiled the search results. The websites were then evaluated and assigned a quality score, a Flesch-Kincaid (FK) reading level, and a subjective quality score. They were then grouped according to the search term used, search engine used, and the order (priority) returned by the search engines. ANOVA analysis and pairwise comparisons of quality and readability among groups, as well as correlation analysis were performed.

Results

The FK readability average was 10.3, above the recommended level. The search term De Quervain's tenosynovitis returned the highest objective quality results. There was no statistical difference found between the different search engines. The first 10 results from the searches were of higher quality than results 11–20, and there was a positive correlation between objective and subjective quality scores but no correlation between readability and objective quality.

Conclusions

We concluded that quality information about De Quervain's tendinitis is available on the internet and is most likely to be found using the search term De Quervain's tenosynovitis and in the first 10 results of an internet search. However, most information is written above the recommended 6th grade reading level.

### Corticosteroid injection with or without thumb spica cast for de quervain tenosynovitis [^114yXouB]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the corticosteroid injection (CSI) with or without thumb spica cast (TSC) for de Quervain tendinitis.

Methods

In this prospective trial, 67 eligible patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis were randomly assigned into CSI + TSC (33 cases) and CSI (34 cases) groups. All patients received 40 mg of methylprednisolone acetate with 1 cc lidocaine 2% in the first dorsal compartment at the area of maximal point tenderness. The primary outcome was the treatment success rate, and the secondary outcome was the scale and quality of the treatment method using Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand and visual analog scale scores.

Results

The groups had no differences in mean age, sex, and occupation. The visual analog scale and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores were similar in both groups before the treatment. The treatment success rate was 93% in the CSI + TSC group and 69% in the CSI group. Although both methods improved the patients' conditions significantly in terms of relieving pain and functional ability, CSI + TSC had a significantly higher treatment success rate.

Conclusions

The combined technique of corticosteroid injection and thumb spica casting was better than injection alone in the treatment of de Quervain tenosynovitis in terms of treatment success and functional outcomes.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic injection of the wrist and hand region [^113Ucf4x]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Joint injection of the wrist and hand region is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for the family physician. In this article, the injection procedures for carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's tenosynovitis, osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint, wrist ganglion cysts, and digital flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) are reviewed. Indications for carpal tunnel syndrome injection include median nerve compression resulting from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, repetitive use injury, and other traumatic injuries to the area. For the first carpometacarpal joint, injection may be used to treat pain secondary to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Pain associated with de Quervain's tenosynovitis is treated effectively by therapeutic injection. If complicated by pain or paresthesias, wrist ganglion cysts respond to aspiration and injection. Painful limitation of motion occurring in trigger fingers of patients with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis also improves with injection. The proper technique, choice and quantity of pharmaceuticals, and appropriate follow-up are essential for effective outcomes.

### Development of de quervain tenosynovitis after distal radius fracture [^114bMpSy]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We sought to determine the risk factors for the development of de Quervain tenosynovitis after distal radius fractures. Our hypothesis is that longer periods of immobilization and higher-energy fracture patterns will correlate with the development of de Quervain tenosynovitis.

Methods

This is a 10-year retrospective study of 1451 consecutive patients with distal radius fractures presenting to a large academic institution. The incidence and relative risk of de Quervain tenosynovitis within 1 year of sustaining a distal radius fracture were analyzed.

Results

In total, 41 patients developed posttraumatic de Quervain tenosynovitis at an average time of 6.5 months. In the operative cohort, the incidence was 2.2%, and that of the nonoperative group was 3.8%. Among all affected patients, 78% admitted to strenuous, overuse activities or careers. Compared with the unaffected cohort, the de Quervain tenosynovitis group was more likely to be female and black with similar age and body mass index. The traumatic cohort was less likely to respond to corticosteroid injections. A separate extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) sheath was noted in all patients requiring surgical release.

Conclusions

Patients with a nonoperative distal radius fracture were 4.2 times more likely to develop de Quervain's than the general population, and those treated operatively were 2.4 times more likely. These patients were more likely to be female, black, and engage in strenuous overuse activities or careers. They demonstrated higher-energy fracture patterns and worse response to corticosteroid injections, more frequently requiring surgical decompression. Among those requiring surgery, patients were 2.5 times more likely to have a separate EPB sheath than those with atraumatic Quervain's.

### Efficacy of low-dose versus high-dose corticosteroid injections for soft tissue pathology of the hand [^117MWv8e]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of high- versus low-triamcinolone injection doses to guide dosing for injections used in hand soft tissue pathologies. We hypothesized that there would be difference in efficacy between high-dose injections (40 mg) and low-dose injections (5–10 mg) used for trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome, and de Quervain tenosynovitis. The study compared rate of disease resolution, need for secondary injection, and conversion to surgery between low-dose and high-dose injections.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients from 2020 to 2023 included all patients who received a triamcinolone injection for trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain tenosynovitis. Patients were divided into high-dose (40 mg) and low-dose injection (5–10 mg) cohorts. The primary outcome was symptom resolution; secondary outcomes of interest were duration of symptom after the injection, rate of second injection, and rate of conversion to surgery.

Results

A total of 466 patients (649 injections) were included. Of 649 injections, 393 (61%) were given for trigger finger, 106 (17%) for carpal tunnel syndrome, and 139 (21%) for de Quervain tenosynovitis. High-dose injection had lower rates of repeat injection (18% vs 35%), lower conversion to surgery (12% vs 21%), fewer ongoing symptoms leading to return for follow-up (26% vs 46%), longer intervals between repeat injection (12.0 months vs 5.6 months), and longer estimated time to surgery (11.1 months vs 7.7 months) when compared with the low-dose group. No major complications were noted in either cohort.

Conclusions

High-dose triamcinolone injections outperformed low-dose injections across most metrics in this study including estimated time of relief, rate of repeat injection, and rate of surgery. Hand surgeons should consider the benefit of high-dose triamcinolone injections when deciding on a treatment modality for common hand conditions.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^115oaAQi]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Case description

The patient was a 38-year-old right-handed female farmer with hypothyroidism, who had been taking 100 mg-thyroxine sodium (Eltroxin) once daily since March 2013 and she denied having systematic disease like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other rheumatic diseases. In February 2014, she complained of right lateral wrist pain and was prescribed an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug under the diagnosis of De Quervain tenosynovitis. Because of incomplete pain relief after conservative treatment the patient was given corticosteroid injections by an orthopedic surgeon (three times) through palpation guidance combined with immobilization with a thumb spica cast, from May 2014, and her visual analog scale (VAS) was 1/10 after the last injection in August 2015. The patient did not receive ultrasound examination at that clinic due to inaccessibility of the machine. Her symptoms recurred in January 2016 with a VAS of 10/10. Surgical intervention was recommended to the patient, however, she refused surgery. She was referred to the Department of Physical Medicine at Tanta University Hospital. In our clinic, the physical findings revealed swelling and tenderness over the radial styloid with a positive Finkelstein's test. The first metacarpal phalangeal joint appeared normal in range of motion and was not painful during palpation. Percussion of the radial styloid did not provoke the Tinel sign. We arranged a musculoskeletal ultrasound scan on February 10, 2016, which revealed marked thickening of the extensor retinaculum and swelling of the tendons inside the first dorsal wrist extensor compartment. There was no increase in power Doppler signals. There were no fibrous septa dividing the first extensor compartment (Figure 1A–C). After obtaining written consent, we injected 0.5 mL methotrexate (6.25 mg) with 0.5 mL mepivacaine (15 mg), four times starting from February 15, 2016, with an interval of 10 days between each injection under ultrasound guidance by using the in-plane approach, to target the short axis of the tendon sheath (Figure 2A). No adverse event was reported after the injections, and the patient reported gradual reduction of pain. Her VAS declined to 8/10, 7/10, 4/10, and 1/10 after each injection, respectively. By November 2016, the patient reported being pain free (VAS 0/10), and no more injections were administered. A follow-up ultrasound scan revealed a marked reduction in the size of the thickened retinaculum (from 3 to 1.2 mm) and swollen tendons (from 5.5 to 5.1 mm) in comparison with images taken before methotrexate injections (Figure 2B and C).

### Utility of patient-reported outcomes in prognosis of corticosteroid injection treatment success for trigger finger and de quervain's stenosing tenosynovitis [^116NPfvK]. Hand (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroid injections are a first-line treatment of trigger finger and de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Little research has evaluated preinjection patient-reported outcomes as a predictive factor for treatment success following corticosteroid injection. We hypothesized that patients with less pretreatment impairment would demonstrate greater post-treatment improvement than patients whose function was more severely impaired.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) upper extremity (UE) scores in patients undergoing corticosteroid injection for trigger finger or de Quervain's tenosynovitis from 2017 to 2023. Independent variables were patient baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and baseline PROMIS UE. The primary outcome was treatment success between 30 days and 12 weeks, defined as achieving the minimal clinically important difference for PROMIS UE without undergoing surgery.

Results

In total, 240 trigger finger and 74 de Quervain's tenosynovitis patients (N = 314) were analyzed. Following injection, 63 (20.1%) patients achieved treatment success, 86 (27.4%) underwent surgical release, and 165 (52.5%) did not significantly improve function or undergo surgery. Each 1-point increase in baseline PROMIS UE was associated with 10% lower odds of treatment success (P < .001). Among nonoperative patients, each 1-point increase in baseline PROMIS UE was associated with a 0.51-point decrease in PROMIS UE score (P < .001) and diabetes was associated with a 2.74-point decrease in PROMIS UE after injection (P = 0.44).

Conclusion

Corticosteroid injection provides meaningful improvement for a subset of trigger finger and de Quervain's tenosynovitis patients. Corticosteroid injection remains a first-line treatment for trigger finger and de Quervain's tenosynovitis patients, especially for those with more severe functional impairment.

### Abuse of growth hormone increases the risk of persistent de quervain tenosynovitis [^1115Bnvp]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

de Quervain tenosynovitis usually responds well to nonsurgical treatment.

Hypothesis

Growth hormone abuse is associated with increased de Quervain tenosynovitis incidence in weight-training persons.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.

Methods

We treated 19 weight-training male patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis. Nine were abusing growth hormone (group A), and 10 were not (group B). Four group A patients elected to cease growth hormone abuse. Treatment was stratified into 3 grades: (1) splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (2) same as first grade but with the addition of cortisone injections, and (3) surgical decompression (after failure of treatment of first and second grades). Follow-up was at 3, 9, and 24 months.

Results

First follow-up: Only 33.3% of those using growth hormone in group A responded to splinting and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, compared with 90% in group B. Six patients (66.6%) in group A experienced persistent symptoms and received second-grade treatment, compared with 1 patient in group B (10%). Second follow-up: Four patients (44.4%) in group A moved from second- to third-grade treatment, 1 symptom-free patient (11.1%) relapsed and received second-grade treatment while 2 (22.2%) requested conservative treatment, declining surgery. Group B patients were 100% symptom-free. Final follow-up: Six patients (66.6%) in group A were operated on and 1 (11.1%) suffered from persistent de Quervain tenosynovitis, declining surgery. In group B, 1 patient relapsed and was started on second-grade treatment. No patients in group B had surgery.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that growth hormone abuse is associated with a more recalcitrant form of de Quervain tenosynovitis that does not respond well to nonsurgical treatment, thus leading to increased likelihood of surgical decompression.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^1172ZcCo]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound plays an important role in the detection of the anatomic variations of the first extensor compartment, including septa, tendon slips, and osseous ridges. It can reveal many pathological findings such as synovial hypertrophy, peritendinous hypervascularity, thickening of the retinaculum and tendon, and intratendinous microtears. Additionally, ultrasound-guided injection prevents intratendinous injection and reduces the risk of subsequent tear, precisely introduces the injectate to the affected region in case of an intracompartmental septum, and prevents the superficial radial nerve from the injury. In this case, ultrasound imaging clearly demonstrated thickening of the retinaculum, which might be the main factor leading to recurrence after overuse of the wrist.

Methotrexate, a disease modifying antirheumatic drug, is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A key feature of intra-articular pathology of rheumatoid arthritis is hypertrophic synovium, which is commonly seen in recalcitrant stenosing tenosynovitis. The medication also can be safely administered for knee synovitis without preexisting rheumatic conditions. Therefore, the rationale of using methotrexate to treat DQVD is based on its potential effect to antagonize hypertrophic synovium. Methotrexate has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects owing to an elevated level of adenosine, which decreases pain by suppressing the production of substance P, prostaglandins, cytokines, and collagenases. Moreover, methotrexate has antifibrotic effects through the inhibition of fibroblasts. Injection of methotrexate has been widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis and has shown promising effectiveness. Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection can be safely administered at least every 7 days up to 8 times for the treatment of synovitis. Therefore, in this case, methotrexate not only resolved the inflammation inside the first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist but also reduced hypertrophy of the retinaculum by reducing fibroblast activity. This dual effect is rarely seen with corticosteroid injection, which mainly contributes to reduction of inflammation at the injection site. However, the use of methotrexate may be associated with gastrointestinal upset, bone marrow toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. It is contraindicated in cases of hepatic and renal impairment; thus, the function of both the liver and kidney should be assessed before starting methotrexate therapy. Ultrasound guidance can prevent unwanted spreading of the methotrexate, to reduce the risk of tissue necrosis and demyelinating neuropathy of the superficial radial nerve. The main limitation of the study is its case number (n = 1) and lack of a control. The beneficial effect of methotrexate could result from hydrodissection of the tendon. Therefore, a future randomized controlled trial should be conducted to investigate the true effectiveness of intrasheath methotrexate injection for DQVD.

### A guide to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa in pregnancy and lactation [^115c4FyX]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Procedural Treatments Generally Considered Compatible with Pregnancy

The North American clinical guidelines recommend the utilization of procedures in addition to topical treatments and compatible systemic therapies for the treatment of HS in pregnant patients.

Intralesional Corticosteroids

Intralesional steroids are considered compatible with pregnancy and can be used as a flare management tool (Table 2). They are also considered safe in breastfeeding because of minimal systemic absorption expected with small doses. However, transient lactation suppression has been reported with larger doses. For example, a patient with 40 mg of triamcinolone with 2mL of 1% lidocaine injected into the wrist for de Quervain tenosynovitis experienced a 90% reduction in lactation, with gradual recovery of 50% at 1 week and a return to sufficient levels at 1-month post-injection. Another patient with 40 mg of triamcinolone injected into the left breast for mastitis experienced lactation suppression for 2 weeks on that side. As a result, the lowest doses needed to provide relief with longer intervals between injections should be used to minimize the risk of lactation suppression.

Incision and Drainage/Deroofing

Incision and drainage and local deroofings can be pursued during pregnancy and lactation with minimal maternal or fetal risk. Lidocaine is considered safe when used at standard dosages, with one study demonstrating no fetal abnormalities in 293 infants after exposure to lidocaine during the first trimester of pregnancy. Plain lidocaine is preferred over lidocaine with epinephrine, especially in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, eclampsia, and gestational diabetes. Povidone iodine should be avoided as the skin preparation agent because of its potential to cause fetal hypothyroidism. Chlorhexidine gluconate can be safely used as an antiseptic in this scenario. Whenever possible, patients should be reclined in the left lateral decubitus position, especially for prolonged procedures, to avoid compression of the inferior vena cava.

### Effectiveness of conservative, surgical, and postsurgical interventions for trigger finger, dupuytren disease, and De quervain disease: a Systematic review [^114tCKSA]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of conservative and (post)surgical interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren disease, and De Quervain disease.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Selection

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to select potential studies.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the methodologic quality.

Data Synthesis

A best-evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results. Two reviews (trigger finger and De Quervain disease) and 37 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (trigger finger: n = 8; Dupuytren disease: n = 14, and De Quervain disease: n = 15) were included. The trials reported on oral medication (Dupuytren disease), physiotherapy (De Quervain disease), injections and surgical treatment (trigger finger, Dupuytren disease, and De Quervain disease), and other conservative (De Qervain disease) and postsurgical treatment (Dupuytren disease). Moderate evidence was found for the effect of corticosteroid injection on the very short term for trigger finger, De Quervain disease, and for injections with collagenase (30d) when looking at all joints, and no evidence was found when looking at the PIP joint for Dupuytren disease. A thumb splint as additive to a corticosteroid injection seems to be effective (moderate evidence) for De Quervain disease (short term and midterm). For Dupuytren disease, use of a corticosteroid injection within a percutaneous needle aponeurotomy in the midterm and tamoxifen versus a placebo before or after a fasciectomy seems to promising (moderate evidence). We also found moderate evidence for splinting after Dupuytren surgery in the short term.

Conclusions

In recent years, more and more RCTs have been conducted to study treatment of the aforementioned hand disorders. However, more high-quality RCTs are still needed to further stimulate evidence-based practice for patients with trigger finger, Dupuytren disease, and De Quervain disease.

### Are there differences in pain reduction and functional improvement among splint alone, steroid alone, and combination for the treatment of adults with trigger finger? [^114UyoT2]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Steroid injection and splinting, which are commonly recommended nonsurgical treatments in adults with trigger finger, have been demonstrated to effectively relieve pain and improve function. However, to our knowledge, there have been no direct comparisons of pain relief and function improvement with splinting alone, steroid injection alone, or a combination of splinting and steroid injection in patients with this diagnosis.

Question/Purpose

Are there differences in pain reduction and functional improvement in adults with trigger finger treated with splinting alone, steroid injection alone, and a combination of splinting and steroid injection at 6, 12, and 52 weeks after the intervention?

Methods

Between May 2021 and December 2021, we treated 165 adult patients for trigger finger at an academic university hospital. Based on prespecified criteria, all patients we saw during that period were eligible, but 27% (45 of 165) were excluded because they had received a previous local corticosteroid injection (n = 10) or they had concomitant carpal tunnel syndrome (n = 14), first carpometacarpal joint arthritis (n = 3), osteoarthritis of the hand (n = 6), de Quervain disease (n = 3), multiple-digit trigger finger (n = 6), or pregnancy during the study period (n = 3). After screening, 120 patients were randomized to receive either splinting (n = 43), steroid injection (n = 40), or splinting plus steroid injection (n = 37). Patients were randomly assigned to the different treatments using computer-generated block randomization (block of six). Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were used in the allocation concealment process. Both the allocator and the outcome assessor were blinded. Splinting involved the patient wearing a fixed metacarpophalangeal joint orthosis in the neutral position at least 8 hours per day for 6 consecutive weeks. Steroid injection was performed using 1 mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine and 1 mL of triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/mL) injected directly into the flexor tendon sheath. No patients were lost to follow-up or had treatment failure (that is, the patient had persistent pain or triggering with the trigger finger treatment and requested additional medical management including additional splinting, steroid injection, or surgery) at 6 or 12 weeks after the intervention, and at 52 weeks, there was no difference in loss to follow-up among the treatment groups. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed with all 120 patients, and a per-protocol analysis was conducted with 86 patients after excluding patients who were lost to follow-up or had treatment failure. Primary outcomes evaluated were VAS pain reduction and improvement in Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) scores at 6, 12, and 52 weeks after the intervention. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) values were 1 and 10.9 for the VAS and MHQ, respectively.

Results

There were no clinically important differences in VAS pain scores among the three treatment groups at any timepoint, in either the intention-to-treat or the per-protocol analyses. Likewise, there were no clinically important differences in MHQ scores at any timepoint in either the intention-to-treat or the per-protocol analyses.

Conclusion

Splinting alone is recommended as the initial treatment for adults with trigger finger because there were no clinically important differences between splinting alone and steroid injection alone in terms of pain reduction and symptom or functional improvement up to 1 year. The combination of steroid injection and splinting is disadvantageous because the benefits in terms of pain reduction and symptom or functional improvement are not different from those achieved with steroid injection or splinting alone.

Level Of Evidence

### Effectiveness of interventions of specific complaints of the arm, neck, and / or shoulder: 3 musculoskeletal disorders of the hand. An update [^116ehLut]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an evidence-based overview of the effectiveness of conservative and surgical interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren's, and De Quervain's diseases.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Library, PEDro, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL were searched to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to select potential relevant studies from the title and abstracts of the references retrieved by the literature search. Relevant (Cochrane) reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted the data and performed a methodologic quality assessment.

Data Synthesis

A best-evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results of the included trials. One Cochrane review (trigger finger) and 13 RCTs (trigger finger [6], Dupuytren's [4], De Quervain's [3]) were included. The trials reported on physiotherapy (De Quervain's), steroid injections (trigger finger, De Quervain's), surgical treatment (trigger finger, De Quervain's), and a postsurgical treatment (Dupuytren's). For trigger finger, moderate evidence was found for the effectiveness of steroid injections in the short-term (1–4 wk) but not for long-term outcomes. Limited evidence was found for the effectiveness of staples compared with sutures in skin closure and for intermittent compression after surgery to treat Dupuytren's disease. For other interventions, no evidence was found.

Conclusions

Indications for effectiveness of some interventions for trigger finger, Dupuytren's, and De Quervain's diseases were found. Because only a few RCTs were identified, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions. High-quality RCTs are clearly needed in this field.

### Injections of the hand and wrist: part II. carpal tunnel syndrome, ganglion cyst, intersection syndrome, triangular fibrocartilage complex injury, and de quervain tenosynovitis [^117CtbuJ]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Family physicians are well-positioned to provide injections for patients who have wrist pain, especially when initial treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest fail. Although corticosteroid injections can offer pain relief, possible risks (e.g., infection, cartilage damage, skin depigmentation) should be discussed. Techniques and procedures for injections vary. Studies have shown significant improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome severity over 12 weeks using ultrasound-guided injections compared with landmark-guided injections. Ganglion cyst aspiration can be helpful for patients with significant symptoms, although more than 50% of ganglion cysts may recur within a year. Corticosteroid injections of ganglion cysts do not appear to produce additional benefits to aspiration. Intersection syndrome is an overuse injury; management involves rest, adjustment of activities, use of braces, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical or occupational therapy. For symptoms not improved by these methods, an ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection may be administered. Treatment options for a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury include immobilization, kinesio taping, relative rest, and analgesics; corticosteroid injection may relieve acute inflammatory pain. De Quervain tenosynovitis is treated conservatively with palpation- or ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection, splinting, occupational therapy, and activity modification.

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^112xWaGC]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

De Quervain disease (DQVD) is one of the most common causes of lateral wrist pain and can lead to significant disability. The current case involves a right-handed, middle-aged, female patient with severe lateral wrist pain due to DQVD. Her pain was not responsive to oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rehabilitation, and repeated corticosteroid injections. Because she refused surgical intervention, we performed ultrasound-guided methotrexate injections (four times). After the injections, dramatic pain relief, functional improvement, and reduction of the thickness of the retinaculum and tendons in the first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist were noted. This case report highlights the potential usefulness of ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for recalcitrant DQVD of the wrist.

### Preoperative indicators of the effectiveness of surgical release in patients with de quervain disease: a prospective cohort study [^117NEeBx]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study confirms that surgical release in patients with DQ significantly reduces patient-reported pain 3 months after surgery. Smoking, concomitant surgery, and higher VAS pain scores at intake are associated with worse patient-reported pain at 3-month follow-up. A longer duration of complaints is also an influential factor for higher reported pain. While this confirms current guidelines advising not to delay conversion to surgery for too long, the effect of duration of complaints is small, suggesting that it should not be considered the only important factor.

### Braces and splints for common musculoskeletal conditions [^112TwibL]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Braces and splints can immobilize and protect joints, reduce pain, decrease swelling, and facilitate healing of acute injuries. They are also used for injury prevention and chronic pain reduction, and to alter the function of a joint. The medial unloading (valgus) knee brace is an option for patients with medial knee osteoarthritis, but evidence of long-term benefit is limited. The patellar stabilizing brace helps maintain proper patellar alignment but has mixed results in treating patellofemoral pain syndrome. The patellar tendon strap is effective in treating pain from patellar tendinopathy. The knee immobilizing splint is used after surgery to prevent reinjury and for acute or presurgical management of quadriceps rupture, patellar tendon rupture, medial collateral ligament rupture, patellar fracture or dislocation, and other acute traumatic knee injuries. Use of a functional ankle brace is more effective than immobilization or a compression wrap in terms of functional outcomes after an acute ankle sprain and prevention of future ankle sprains. The thumb spica splint is effective for the treatment of thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis and de Quervain tenosynovitis, and may be used for patients with suspected scaphoid fractures. A wrist splint has short-term effectiveness in treating symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome but may not be more effective than other conservative therapies.

### Risk factors associated with de quervain tenosynovitis in postpartum women [^113Jxydw]. Hand (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

An overweight mother with a prolonged pregnancy and in her first pregnancy is at an increased risk of presenting with DQ disease. According to our findings, the weight applied to the carrying wrist (a heavy baby or twin babies) does not predispose mothers to this pathology. Physicians should readily consider these findings when educating and counseling patients with a diagnosis of DQ. Further well-designed studies are warranted to better understand factors that may predispose mothers to this pathology.

### Is a steroid injection in both compartments more effective than an injection in the extensor pollicis brevis subcompartment alone in patients with de quervain disease? A randomized, controlled trial [^115y6zNA]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasonography (US)-guided steroid injections can improve the accuracy of injection in patients with de Quervain disease, especially in those with an intracompartmental septum. Although the main lesion of de Quervain disease in patients with a septum is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB), no report we know of has compared injection into the EPB subcompartment with an injection into both the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and EPB subcompartments. In this randomized trial, we compared the results of US-guided steroid injections targeting both subcompartments and the EPB subcompartment alone in patients with de Quervain disease.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Do patients who receive a steroid injection in the EPB subcompartment alone have lower pain scores at 6 weeks and at 3 months after US-guided injection compared with patients who receive an injection in both subcompartments? (2) Do patients who receive a steroid injection in the EPB subcompartment alone experience fewer steroid injection-related complications than patients who receive an injection in both subcompartments?

Methods

A randomized controlled study was performed at a single center between August 2018 and March 2021. Patients with a diagnosis of de Quervain disease and with a complete intracompartmental septum between the APL and the EPB tendons were included. In total, 112 patients had a diagnosis of de Quervain disease during the study period. Definite, complete subcompartmentalization was seen in 50 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to US-guided injections targeting both subcompartments (n = 25) or the EPB subcompartment alone (n = 25). There were no between-group differences in age, gender, affected wrist, or disease duration, and all patients had US evidence of tendinosis of the EPB, with or without tendinosis of the APL. Although 33% of patients (16 of 48) showed tendinosis of the APL, no patient showed tendinosis of the APL alone. In all patients, a dorsal-to-palmar side injection of 0.5 mL of 2% lidocaine and 0.5 mL of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/mL) was administered by two experienced hand surgeons. In the both-subcompartments group, US-guided injections were performed in each of the APL and EPB subcompartments. In the EPB subcompartment group, US-guided injections were administered in the EPB subcompartment only. All patients underwent the same protocol after the procedure. Four percent (n = 2, 1 in each group) of patients were excluded after randomization because their pain level was not registered. Pre- and postinjection clinical outcome assessments were completed by orthopaedic surgery residents not involved in patient management. Patients were regularly examined at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months to evaluate the intensity of pain. We assessed pain by the VAS score, where 0 indicated no pain and 100 the most pain. At baseline, the VAS score was 67 ± 14 in the both-subcompartment group and 67 ± 16 in the EPB subcompartment group (mean difference 0.17 [95% CI -8.45 to 8.82]; p = 0.97). Complications related to the steroid injection, including numbness, tendon rupture, and skin hypopigmentation, were also recorded at final follow-up examinations. To determine statistical power, the VAS score for pain at 6 weeks after the injection was used as the primary outcome variable. The minimum clinically important difference for the VAS score was deemed to be 20 mm, and we estimated an SD of 23. A sample size calculation indicated that a sample of 21 patients per group would provide 80% power to detect an effect of this size between the groups at the p = 0.05 level using a t-test.

Results

There were no differences in the VAS scores between the both-subcompartment group and the EPB group at 6 weeks (10 ± 6 versus 10 ± 7, mean difference -0.08 [95% CI -4.08 to 3.91]; p = 0.97). The same was true at 12 weeks (12 ± 13 versus 11 ± 15, mean difference 0.38 [95% CI -7.74 to 8.49]; p = 0.09). No adverse events related to treatment (such as tendon rupture, infections, and numbness) occurred in either group. However, skin hypopigmentation occurred at the final follow-up examination in both groups. The proportion of patients experiencing skin hypopigmentation in the EPB subcompartment group was lower than in the both-subcompartment group (33% [8 of 24] versus 67% [16 of 24]; odds ratio 0.25 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.83]; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Our data suggest that a US-guided steroid injection targeting the EPB subcompartment alone is as effective in terms of pain reduction as targeting both subcompartments in patients with de Quervain disease who have complete septation. Furthermore, an injection targeting the EPB subcompartment alone can reduce the dose of steroids used, perhaps thereby decreasing complications related to steroid injections. We recommend using only single-compartment injections in this context, even among patients with an intracompartmental septum.

### Effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in diabetic patients with De quervain tenosynovitis [^114vMrGs]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We sought to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroid injections (CSIs) for de Quervain tenosynovitis in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Methods

We retrospectively identified all patients with diabetes receiving a CSI for de Quervain tenosynovitis by 16 surgeons over a 2-year period. Data collected included demographic information, medical comorbidities, number and timing of CSIs, and first dorsal compartment release. Success was defined as not undergoing an additional CSI or surgical intervention. The mixture of a corticosteroid and local anesthetic provided in each injection was at the discretion of each individual surgeon.

Results

Corticosteroid injections were given to 169 wrists in 169 patients with diabetes. Out of 169 patients, 83 (49%) had success following the initial CSI, 44 (66%) following a second CSI, and 6 (67%) following a third CSI. A statistically significant difference was identified in the success rates between the first and second CSIs. Ultimately, 36 of 169 wrists (21%) underwent a first dorsal compartment release.

Conclusions

Patients with diabetes mellitus have a decreased probability of success following a single CSI for de Quervain tenosynovitis in comparison to nondiabetic patients, as described in the literature. However, the effectiveness of each additional CSI does not appear to diminish.

### Soft tissue atrophy related to corticosteroid injection: review of the literature and implications for hand surgeons [^111UGShW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections (CIs) are frequently used by hand surgeons to treat a wide range of pathology including de Quervain tenosynovitis and lateral epicondylitis. Although generally viewed as a benign modality, and a way to potentially avoid or postpone surgical intervention, common complications from CI should be considered and discussed with patients before the procedure. One such complication is local soft tissue atrophy and hypopigmentation after injection. We discuss the incidence of soft tissue-related adverse effects from CI, the pathophysiology and influence of different steroid preparations on soft tissues, and potential treatment options once atrophy has occurred.

### Impact of septated first dorsal compartments on symptomatic de quervain disease [^113V3Uby]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The authors conducted this study to determine whether septation of the first dorsal compartment is more prevalent in de Quervain tenosynovitis, and whether this contributes to failure of corticosteroid injection therapy.

Methods

A retrospective review of 79 consecutive patients (85 wrists) with symptomatic de Quervain tenosynovitis treated with surgical release was performed. The number of corticosteroid injections performed preoperatively and the presence of first dorsal compartment septation determined intraoperatively were recorded. Correlation between the number of steroid injections and the presence of septation was evaluated. In addition, 48 matched cadaver upper extremities (96 wrists) that had not previously undergone surgery for de Quervain disease were evaluated for the presence of first dorsal compartment septation. The prevalence of septation was compared between matched wrists and against the surgically treated clinical cohort.

Results

In the clinical cohort, 61.2 percent of wrists contained a septated first dorsal compartment. There was no correlation between the presence of a septated first dorsal compartment and the number of steroid injections before surgical release. In the cadaver portion of the study, 72.9 percent of wrists contained septa. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of septated first dorsal compartments between groups.

Conclusions

In the present study, the majority of wrists contained a septated first dorsal compartment, with no difference in the prevalence of septa between surgically treated patients and a cadaver sample that had not undergone prior surgical release. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the presence of septa and the number of preoperative corticosteroid injections administered.

### Ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection to treat de quervain's disease using three different techniques: a randomized controlled trial [^1115HuGB]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the six-month outcome of three different ultrasound-guided treatments for de Quervain's disease (DQD).

Methods

We prospectively treated 75 consecutive patients (51 females, 24 males, mean age ± standard deviation = 45.3 ± 9.8 years) with DQD. Patients' features (hand dominance, intraretinaculum septum, accessory tendons) were recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS), reduced disability (quickDASH) score, and retinaculum thickness were evaluated at baseline and after one (excluding retinaculum thickness), three, and six months. Patients were randomized into three groups of 25 patients each treated under ultrasound guidance: Group A (1 mL methylprednisolone acetate; mean baseline thickness = 1.6 mm; mean baseline VAS = 6; mean baseline quickDASH = 55); Group B (1 mL methylprednisolone acetate +15-day delayed 2 mL saline 0.9%; 1.4; 6; 56); Group C (1 mL methylprednisolone acetate +15-day delayed 2 mL low molecular weight hyaluronic acid; 1.7; 6; 55).

Results

After one month results were: Group A mean VAS = 2; mean quickDASH = 23; Group B 2; 22; Group C 2; 21. After three months results were: Group A retinaculum thickness = 0.7 mm; 3; 27); Group B 0.8 mm; 1; 25; Group C 0.5 mm; 1; 23. After six months results were: Group A 1.5 mm; 3; 51; Group B 1 mm; 2; 51; Group C 0.7 mm; 1; 26 (P < 0.001 for all vs. baseline). Patients' age, sex, hand dominance, presence of subcompartment dividing septum, and supernumerary tendons had no influence on outcome (P ≥ 0.177).

Conclusion

Addition of hyaluronic acid to ultrasound-guided injections of steroids to treat DQD seems to improve the outcome and to reduce the recurrence rate.

Key Points

- Ultrasound guidance allows for safe injection procedures to treat de Quervains' disease
- Steroid injections allow prompt recovery in de Quervain's disease with short-term recurrence
- Addition of hyaluronic acid allows recurrence rate reduction compared to simple steroid injections.

### US-guided percutaneous release of the first extensor tendon compartment using a 21-gauge needle in de quervain's disease: a prospective study of 35 cases [^114D7KGm]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonography-guided percutaneous treatment of de Quervain tenosynovitis with the combination of a corticosteroid injection and release of the retinaculum of the first extensor compartment tendons with a 21-gauge needle.

Materials and Methods

The first part of our study consisted of ten procedures on cadaver wrists followed by dissection to analyse the effectiveness of the retinaculum release and detect any collateral damage. The second part was a prospective clinical study of 35 procedures. Outcomes were evaluated through a 6-month clinical follow-up and telephone interview at the end of the study. The following parameters were monitored over time: pain level on a visual analogue scale, the QuickDASH and the PRWE. Patient satisfaction questionnaires were also administered.

Results

No complications were found during the cadaver study. However, the release was confirmed as 'partial' in all wrists. In the clinical portion of this study, significant improvement was observed in 91.4% of cases (32/35) within 1 month and the results were stable until the end of the study; all of these patients avoided surgery. The release procedure failed in three patients who eventually required surgical treatment.

Conclusion

US-guided partial release and simultaneous corticosteroid injection for treatment of de Quervain's disease using a 21-gauge needle is feasible in current practice, with minimal complications.

Key Points

- Ultrasound-guided treatment of de Quervain's disease is feasible with a 21G needle.
- There was notable regression of clinical signs in 91.4% of cases.
- The procedure is very safe, no iatrogenic neurovascular or tendinous injuries occurred.
- Our procedure requires only one session and 3 days away from work.

### Employer-sponsored Medicare advantage plans and the 2018 therapy cap repeal: reduced overall spending does not constrain out-of-pocket costs [^111Ff1KE]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Policy impacting traditional Medicare beneficiaries may have unintended effects for privately insured patients. After the repeal of a longstanding $1500 outpatient therapy cap in 2018, we aimed to evaluate if this policy change was associated with differences in use of cost of postoperative therapy after common hand surgeries, including carpal tunnel release, trigger finger release, ganglion cyst excision, De Quervain tenosynovitis release, carpometacarpal arthroplasty, and distal radius fracture open reduction/internal fixation or percutaneous pinning.

Methods

The Medicare Supplement and Coordination of Benefits files from Marketscan were used. Frequency of therapy appointments, overall costs, and out-of-pocket costs were obtained. A segmented interrupted time series with Poisson and log-transformed linear regression was performed.

Results

No significant monthly change in odds of therapy use was found in the postpolicy period for patients who underwent trigger finger release, carpal tunnel release, Ganglion cyst excision, De Quervain tenosynovitis release, carpometacarpal arthroplasty, or distal radius fracture, pinning, or open reduction/internal fixation. Overall cost decreased in the postpolicy period by 2% for comprehensive plans (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.03 to -0.01, P < 0.001), by 7% for those with exclusive provider organizations (95% CI: -0.10 to -0.04, P < 0.001), by 1% for HMOs (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.002, P = 0.01), and by 3% for preferred provider organizations (95% CI: -0.03 to -0.02, P < 0.001). In the postpolicy period, no monthly change in out-of-pocket cost was observed for patients with comprehensive, exclusive provider organization, health maintenance organization, preferred provider organization, or point of service with capitation insurance plans.

Conclusions

Patients with employer-sponsored Medicare Advantage plans experienced increased out-of-pocket costs for therapy despite lower net costs. These data highlight an urgent need for policy ensuring that patients benefit when overall costs of care decrease.

### Comparison of nonsurgical treatment measures for de quervain's disease of pregnancy and lactation [^113cxCpP]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

de Quervain's disease of pregnancy and lactation is usually self-limited and responds well to nonsurgical treatment. We conducted a randomized prospective study on 19 wrists of 18 patients with de Quervain's disease who were either pregnant or breast-feeding. One group had a cortisone injection into the tendon sheath and the other group used thumb spica splints. All 9 patients with injections had complete pain relief with only one late recurrence. None of the patients with splints had complete pain relief; however, at the end of the lactation period, 8 had spontaneous resolution of symptoms and 1 received a cortisone injection. de Quervain's disease of pregnancy and lactation is self-limited and can be treated successfully with cortisone injection. Splinting does not provide satisfactory pain relief.

### A modified thumb spica splint for thumb injuries in the ED [^111HrNwY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

There are a significant number of hand and upper extremity injuries treated in US emergency departments (EDs) each year. Many of these involve the thumb and wrist. These injuries encompass the range from fractures, strains, and sprains to more specific injuries such as gamekeeper thumb and de Quervain tenosynovitis. These injuries often require diagnosis, splinting, and referral to a hand or orthopedic surgeon. The splint described in this article is presently being used for patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis, but it may have more widespread application in emergency medicine. It is a safe and simple splint that is underused in EDs for splinting thumb injuries.

### Percutaneous release of the first extensor tendon compartment in De quervain's disease by acupotomy with US-guidance: a cadaveric study [^1174k5eE]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) in the first extensor compartment of the wrist, also known as de Quervain's disease (dQD), is a common disorder. Its treatments include local steroid injection, open, and endoscopic surgery. By histopathology, de Quervain's disease is not characterized by inflammation but by thickening of the tendon sheath and most notably by the accumulation of mucopolysaccharide, an indicator of myxoid degeneration. These changes should be pathognomonic of dQD. It has been suggested that dQD is likely to be a result of intrinsic degenerative mechanisms rather than extrinsic inflammatory ones. The primary pathogenic structure in radial stenosing tenosynovitis is the bony fibrous canal on the lateral aspect of the radial styloid process. The development of stenosing tenosynovitis is closely related to the local anatomic features, and the pathogenesis of the disease is more closely related to the physical entrapment produced by its local anatomic structures, including the condition of the tendon, the presence or absence of a septum, and the presence of a bony ridge at the base of the first carpal compartment that can affect tendon gliding and produce inflammation. These anatomical structures increase the friction between tendons and between tendons and bony channels. Short-term friction or minor injuries can be recovered by local tissue interstitial lubricating fluid and self-repair, while prolonged and repeated mechanical friction will produce chronic sterile inflammatory edema and congestion between tendons and tendon sheaths, and inflammatory exudation will lead to local fibrosis, which will aggravate the stenosis symptoms.

Some studies have reported that needle tip percutaneous tenotomy can be performed effectively and safely in de Quervain's disease. Acupotomy applies a miniature surgery instrument consisting of a handle, needle body and blade (Figure 1). Acupotomy has been widely used clinically by doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and in orthopedics and pain departments in China, and the use of acupotomy for percutaneous release has become a routine procedure in dQD that can effectively avoid the creation of unsightly scars caused by open surgery. However, the traditional acupotomy operation is carried out without ultrasonography (US) guidance as a blind technique, so the operator needs to have high anatomical knowledge, and there might be some operational risks. This study evaluated the safety and accuracy of ultrasound-guided and nonultrasound acupotomy in the treatment of dQD and proposed an anatomical reference.

### Management of de quervain tenosynovitis… [^116vcCsW]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis should receive a local corticosteroid injection with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks as first-line treatment. Importance There is a plethora of treatment options for patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis, but there are limited data on their effectiveness and no definitive management guidelines. Definitive guidelines for the management of DQT do not exist. In the published consensus statement from the European HANDGUIDE study, 1 all experts who participated agreed that all patients with DQT should be given instructions about activity, function, and pain and these should be accompanied by 1 or more of the following interventions: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, splinting, corticosteroid injection, and surgery. 1 The intervention should be chosen based on severity, duration of DQT, and previous treatments given.

Consensus was reached on a therapeutic hierarchy, which starts with instructions plus NSAIDs and finishes with surgery.

1. For pain at 0 to 12 weeks, the most effective interventions were ultrasonography-guided CSI in EPB compartment only, ultrasonography-guided CSI injection plus delayed injection of hyaluronic acid, ultrasonography-guided CSI injection plus delayed injection of normal saline, neural therapy plus thumb spica splint, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy plus thumb spica splint. Based on our findings, we recommend that clinicians offer patients with DQT of any chronicity a conventional CSI at first contact.

This should be supplemented with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks in the form of a full-time thumb spica splint that includes the wrist and the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint but not the thumb interphalangeal joint. Therefore, we recommend the use of CSI with thumb spica immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks as first-line treatment for patients with DQT. Surgery should be used only when nonsurgical management fails. Further research should take into account chronicity of the condition, as this may influence effectiveness of specific interventions, and NSAIDs should both be assessed as a management option for DQT, with or without thumb spica immobilization, and controlled for in studies where other interventions are assessed.

### Treatments for de quervain tenosynovitis… [^115PwhGs]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are corticosteroid injections better than conservative treatment in patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis. Evidence-Based Answer Corticosteroid injections are no better than thumb spica orthoses for decreasing pain in patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis. When combined with orthoses, corticosteroid injections and acupuncture are equally effective for improving function and decreasing pain. 1 Participants were diagnosed clinically using a positive Finkelstein or Eichhoff test. Corticosteroid injections consisted of methylprednisolone and triamcinolone. Three studies compared injections with orthoses, and three studies compared combined injections and orthoses with orthoses or injections alone.

Treatment success was defined by a negative Finkelstein test and no pain, or a decrease in pain on a visual analog scale. After three to 26 weeks, orthoses alone had a lower rate of treatment success compared with combined injections and orthoses. At three weeks, corticosteroid injections alone had a lower rate of treatment success compared with combined injections and orthoses. Orthoses alone compared with corticosteroid injection alone had similar success rates at two to three weeks. Study limitations included lack of blinding or concealed allocation. A 2013 nonblinded randomized study analyzed the effectiveness of acupuncture vs. corticosteroid injections in patients with de Quervain tenosynovitis over seven months.

2 Participants were diagnosed by history and a positive Finkelstein test. The acupuncture group received five treatment sessions in one week using a standardized technique, and the corticosteroid injection group received a single injection of 40-mg methylprednisolone and lidocaine 2%. Both groups received thumb spica splinting after the interventions.

### Best treatment for de quervain's tenosynovitis uncertain… [^112BPtQt]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: What is the most effective treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Setting: Population-based Study Design: Systematic review. Synopsis: De Quervain's tenosynovitis is characterized by pain in the wrist joint localized to the first dorsal wrist extensor compartment at the radial styloid. The authors searched MED-LINE and Ovid databases for articles on the treatment of de Quervain's tenosynovitis. Of an initial 35 articles, only seven evaluated comparable treatments. Diagnostic criteria included pain at the radial wrist, tenderness at the first dorsal wrist extensor compartment, and a positive result on the Finkelstein test. All seven studies were of extremely poor quality — none was randomized, and none used a control group. The most frequent treatment modality for patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis was steroid injection.

Eighty-three percent of wrists that received injection alone were symptomatically cured, 61 percent of wrists that received injection and splint immobilization were cured, and 14 percent of those receiving splinting only were cured. Rest alone and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were not useful. Because information was not provided about the individual study settings, it is difficult to determine how much referral bias occurred. These studies were performed mainly in orthopedic offices; therefore, it is likely that most of these subjects were patients who had previously failed to respond to other less invasive treatments, such as splinting or NSAIDs. Thus, the actual cure rate of these other modalities in the real world may be much better. Bottom Line: Steroid injection alone may be the most effective treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. The quality of current evidence in the literature is extremely poor.

This is one of the major potential problems with systematic reviews: "garbage in = garbage out. " It is reasonable to consider other less invasive approaches such as ice, thumb spica splinting, and NSAIDs when first treating this disorder.

This article is only available in the PDF format. Download the PDF to view the article, as well as its associated figures and tables. To the Editor: The description of a case of de Quervain's disease in a 2year-old child, reported by George W. Wharton, MD, and T. H. Morgan, MD, calls for a few comments. First, we have always performed the surgical release of the stenosed tendon sheath without the use of a tourniquet and with the patient under local anesthesia, of course, in adults. Furthermore, we have preferred a small transverse incision along the skin creases rather than longitudinal exposure, the latter occasionally results in keloid formation.

When the injectable hydrocortisone preparations became available in the early 1930's, we abandoned surgery and successfully treated a large number of cases of stenosing tenosynovitis by the injection of steroid preparation into the tendon sheath, with the patient under local anesthesia.
