## Question

Question #49
Which statement is true about treatment for external genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) in a nonpregnant patient?
A - Treatment of active genital warts will help prevent infertility.
B - Once treated effectively, warts are not likely to recur.
C - Topical acyclovir (Zovirax) is the appropriate treatment.
D - Most warts will spontaneously resolve without treatment.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement is true about treatment for external genital warts caused by HPV in a nonpregnant patient, with options A through D. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history of external genital warts and whether spontaneous resolution is common. Then, I should verify the likelihood of recurrence after treatment. Next, I will review whether treating warts prevents infertility. After that, I need to check whether acyclovir is an accepted therapy for HPV warts. Finally, I will align the correct answer with guideline-based counseling and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the natural history, because that underpins option D. Multiple high-credibility sources state that if left untreated, anogenital warts may resolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number, and that spontaneous resolution within less than 1 year is common enough that observation without treatment is an acceptable option in some patients, which supports the idea that most warts can resolve without therapy over time [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA] [^112SEo86].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and timing of spontaneous resolution so I don't overstate it. A rapid evidence review notes that approximately 30% of patients experience regression within 4 months, and that while warts can recur, many successfully treated warts do not recur, which reinforces that spontaneous resolution is a meaningful pathway and not rare in the first few months after appearance [^115UtSfK] [^117JzhUR].

> Next, I should review recurrence after treatment, because option B claims warts are not likely to recur once treated effectively. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guidelines emphasize that genital warts often recur after treatment, especially within the first 3 months, and that no treatment eradicates HPV, so recurrence remains common even with effective wart removal, which contradicts the notion that effective treatment makes recurrence unlikely [^117TtGgs] [^112PpdCA] [^112SEo86].

> I will now examine whether treating warts prevents infertility, as option A suggests. Let me think about this carefully. HPV types 6 and 11 cause warts and are not the oncogenic types linked to cervical disease that can impair fertility; moreover, counseling materials explicitly state that having HPV does not make it harder to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term, although treatment of precancers or cancers could affect fertility, so treating warts themselves does not prevent infertility, which makes option A incorrect [^1134FPEy] [^112PpdCA].

> I need to check the pharmacologic appropriateness of acyclovir for HPV warts, because option C proposes topical acyclovir as treatment. Acyclovir is an antiviral for herpesviruses and has no established role in treating HPV warts; guideline-recommended therapies include patient-applied agents such as imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins, and provider-applied options such as cryotherapy, TCA/BCA, and surgical methods, so acyclovir is not an appropriate therapy for HPV warts, which makes option C incorrect [^114Jw5Le] [^116VojoN] [^117XmnCc].

> Putting this together, the statement that aligns with the best evidence and guidelines is that most warts will spontaneously resolve without treatment, which corresponds to option D. I should double-check that this is consistent with counseling language and the observed regression rates, and yes, both CDC counseling and contemporary reviews support spontaneous resolution as a real and acceptable pathway in some patients, with roughly 30% regressing within 4 months and many resolving within a year, which substantiates option D as the correct choice [^112PpdCA] [^115UtSfK] [^115rmWm1].

---

The correct answer is **D. Most warts will spontaneously resolve without treatment**. External genital warts caused by HPV often resolve spontaneously within months to a year, and observation is an acceptable option for some patients [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA]. Treatment is not required to prevent infertility, as HPV types 6/11 do not cause infertility [^1134FPEy], and recurrences are common after treatment, especially in the first 3 months [^117TtGgs]. Acyclovir is ineffective for HPV warts; recommended options include imiquimod, podofilox, sinecatechins, cryotherapy, TCA/BCA, or surgical removal [^114Jw5Le] [^116VojoN].

---

## Natural history and spontaneous resolution

- **Spontaneous resolution**: Most external genital warts resolve spontaneously within months to a year, and observation is reasonable for some patients [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA].
- **Acceptable alternative**: Forgoing treatment and waiting for spontaneous resolution is an acceptable option, particularly for small, asymptomatic lesions [^115rmWm1] [^112SEo86].
- **Recurrence**: Even after spontaneous resolution, warts can recur, but the risk diminishes over time [^115UtSfK].

---

## Treatment options and effectiveness

- **Patient-applied therapies**: Imiquimod 3.75% or 5% cream, podofilox 0.5% solution or gel, and sinecatechins 15% ointment are effective options [^114Jw5Le] [^116VojoN].
- **Provider-administered therapies**: Cryotherapy, surgical removal, and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80%–90% solution are effective alternatives [^114Jw5Le] [^116enfqD].
- **Recurrence**: Recurrence is common after treatment, especially within the first 3 months, and multiple courses may be needed [^117TtGgs] [^112PpdCA].

---

## Impact of treatment on fertility

Treatment of external genital warts **does not directly affect fertility** [^1134FPEy]. HPV types 6 and 11 (which cause warts) are not associated with infertility, whereas high-risk HPV types that cause cervical dysplasia or cancer can indirectly affect fertility through surgical interventions [^1134FPEy].

---

## Recurrence rates after treatment

Recurrence is **common after treatment**, particularly in the first 3 months [^117TtGgs]. Factors influencing recurrence include immune status, lesion size, and treatment modality [^notfound]. Persistent HPV infection underlies recurrence, and no treatment eradicates the virus [^112SEo86].

---

## Inappropriateness of acyclovir

Acyclovir is **ineffective for HPV warts** because it targets herpesviruses, not HPV [^notfound]. Recommended treatments include imiquimod, podofilox, sinecatechins, cryotherapy, TCA/BCA, or surgical removal [^114Jw5Le] [^116VojoN].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct answer is **D. Most warts will spontaneously resolve without treatment**. Observation is acceptable, and treatment should be individualized based on lesion size, number, location, patient preference, and immune status [^115rmWm1]. Treatment does not prevent infertility, recurrences are common, and acyclovir is not recommended [^1134FPEy] [^117TtGgs].

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common, and often sub-clinical and usually resolves without any treatment. Genital warts are caused by HPV 6/11 infection and are one of the commonest clinically recognised disease manifestations of genital HPV. Subjects with genital warts usually perceive them as cosmetically disfiguring, often leading to adverse psychological symptoms, and most subjects with genital warts will present requesting treatment. A wide variety of treatments are available including both provider- and patient-applied therapies. Various individual subject and disease factors mediate appropriate therapy choice. Some of the treatments that are used for genital warts can also be used for some cases of intraepithelial neoplasia caused by high-oncogenic risk HPVs occurring at vulval, anal or penile sites. Specific treatment considerations apply to genital warts in pregnancy and laryngeal papillomatosis and these are also discussed.

### Evidence-based treatment and prevention of external genital warts in female pediatric and adolescent patients [^114nLJ74]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

External anogenital warts, or condylomata acuminata, are caused by the proliferation of squamous epithelial cells secondary to human papillomavirus infection. In sexually active adults and adolescents, anogenital warts are a common sexually transmitted disease, but in children they may be a sign of sexual abuse. There are several treatment options available for anogenital warts, but no treatment has been proven to be the most efficacious, and recurrence after clinical clearance is common. Evidence-based treatment of genital warts is challenging because of the lack of controlled trials comparing treatments, especially in pediatric and adolescent populations. This paper discusses various treatment modalities such as physical destruction, cytotoxic agents, and immunomodulating therapies. Many variables influence the selection of a treatment, such as the size, quantity, and location of the warts; and the patient and provider preference, and its availability and cost. All treatments can cause local side effects, and patient tolerability must also be factored into treatment selection. Many treatments have similar clearance and recurrence rates, and none of the treatments completely eliminates the virus. With the numerous challenges surrounding the treatment of anogenital warts, the primary prevention of HPV infection through vaccination is a key component in decreasing the incidence of the disease.

### Treatment of genital warts: facts and controversies [^115BMvdb]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

There are two opposing approaches in the treatment of genital warts: (1) the traditional approach advocates complete elimination of all lesions, and (2) a second approach regards condyloma as merely a cosmetic nuisance. After a long journey through many arguments and scientific papers, we have concluded that many unknowns, uncertainties, and controversies concerning the value of treatment of genital warts in terms of clearing and curing the disease (ie, eradicating the viruses, preventing cancer, and reducing infectivity). There is no consensus at present of whether treatment of men with evidence of genital human papillomavirus infection influences the natural history of their female sex partner's cervical disease.

### External genital warts: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112gHLZq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

External genital warts (EGWs) are visible warts that occur in the perigenital and perianal regions. They are due primarily to non-oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types, usually types 6 and 11. Physical examination assisted by bright light and magnification is the recommended approach for primary diagnosis. Biopsy is indicated when EGWs are fixed to underlying structures or discolored or when standard therapies are not effective. Recurrences are common, and there is no single treatment that is superior to others. Among women with atypical squamous cells, molecular HPV testing may be useful in determining who should be referred for colposcopy. Condoms may provide some protection against HPV-related diseases and thus are recommended in new sexual relationships and when partnerships are not mutually monogamous. Because the efficacy of cesarean section in preventing vertical transmission of HPV infection from women with EGWs to their progeny has not been proved, it is not recommended.

### Genital warts and other HPV infections: established and novel therapies [^111Tkdjz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Wart therapies involve methods of targeted lesion destruction, as well as selective immunologic modification. While there are several therapeutic options, no treatment has been proven to be superior in terms of clinical clearance or recurrence. Controlled trials comparing treatments are currently lacking. Many factors are used in the selection of treatment. Variables that should be taken into account include but are not limited to the morphology of the lesions such as thickness and size, quantity, anatomic location, human papilloma virus (HPV) classification, immunocompromized or immune competent status, as well as the preferences of the patient and the provider, cost and availability. No current treatment completely eradicates the human papillomavirus virus. The availability of vaccinations against HPV infection is contributing to the decreasing incidence of this disease. This contribution highlights conventional therapies, off-label treatment strategies including combination therapies, and prophylaxis for condylomata acuminata.

### Genital and perianal warts: new treatment opportunities for human papillomavirus infection [^112UjLSe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Human papillomaviruses are among the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. Genital warts are a common phenotypic expression of human papillomaviruses, affecting 1% of the population; therefore, the obstetrician/gynecologist will invariably be required to advise and treat patients with this clinical manifestation. Issues essential in the diagnosis, counseling, and management of patients with genital warts will be examined, including epidemiology, transmission, molecular biology, and host immune response. This review will also provide the health care professional with a thorough examination of the new patient-applied treatment opportunities for anogenital condyloma, in addition to an overview of current provider-administered therapies, to assist in patient management.

### Updates on human papillomavirus and genital warts and counseling messages from the 2010 sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^111JkrgW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In April 2009, experts on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were convened to review updates on STD prevention and treatment in preparation for the revision of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STD Treatment Guidelines. At this meeting, there was a discussion of important updates on human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts, and cervical cancer screening.

Methods

Key questions were identified with assistance from an expert panel, and systematic reviews of the literature were conducted searching the English-language literature of the PubMed computerized database (US National Library of Medicine). The available evidence was reviewed, and new information was incorporated in the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines.

Results

Two HPV vaccines are now available, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and the bivalent HPV vaccine; either vaccine is recommended routinely for girls aged 11 or 12 years. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine may be given to boys and men aged 9–26 years. A new patient-applied treatment option for genital warts, sinecatechins 15% ointment, is available and recommended for treatment of external genital warts. This product is a mixture of active ingredients (catechins) from green tea. Finally, updated counseling guidelines and messages about HPV, genital warts, and cervical cancer are included.

Conclusions

This manuscript highlights updates to the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines for HPV and genital warts. Important additions to the 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines include information on prophylactic HPV vaccine recommendations, new patient-applied treatment options for genital warts, and counseling messages for patients on HPV, genital warts, cervical cancer screening, and HPV tests.

### Warts (genital) [^111g8wZE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External genital warts (EGWs) are sexually transmitted benign epidermal growths caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), on the anogenital areas of both females and males. About 50% to 60% of sexually active women aged 18 to 49 years have been exposed to HPV infection, but only 10% to 15% will have genital warts.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for external genital warts? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of external genital warts? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 55 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bi- and trichloroacetic acid; condoms; cryotherapy; electrosurgery; imiquimod; intralesional, topical, or systemic interferons; laser surgery; podophyllin; podophyllotoxin; surgical excision; and vaccines.

Introduction

External genital warts (EGWs) are sexually transmitted benign epidermal growths caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), on the anogenital areas of both females and males. About 50–60% of sexually active women aged 18–49 have been exposed to HPV infection, but only 10–15% will have genital warts.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for external genital warts? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of external genital warts? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 47 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bi- and trichloroacetic acid; condoms; cryotherapy; electrosurgery; imiquimod; intralesional, topical, or systemic interferons; laser surgery; podophyllin; podophyllotoxin; surgical excision; and vaccines.

Genital warts — counseling points include that if left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, or increase in size or number; the types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that cause cancer; women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more often than other women; time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively determined and genital warts can develop months or years after acquiring HPV; HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on even without visible signs; condoms might lower transmission if used consistently and correctly but might not fully protect against HPV; and a vaccine is available for males and females to prevent genital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV or genital warts and can prevent the majority of cases among persons not yet exposed to wart-causing HPV types.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115kkReJ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) diagnostic considerations and treatment — HPV tests are used in the context of cervical cancer screening and management, but they "should not be used for male partners of women with HPV or women aged < 25 years, for diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STI test". Application of "3%–5% acetic acid" has been used by some providers, yet "the routine use of this procedure… is not recommended because the results do not influence clinical management". Treatment is "directed at the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) or pathologic precancerous lesions", and because "Subclinical genital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously; therefore, specific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV infection", HPV-related precancer should follow existing cervical cancer guidance.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111jkMQh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) counseling — When counseling persons with anogenital HPV infection, the provider "should discuss" that infection is common and often unnoticed, that partners can share HPV and transmission source cannot be determined, that most infections clear spontaneously, that persistent infection can lead to anogenital warts, precancers, and cancers, that tobacco cessation is important, and that wart-causing HPV types differ from cancer-causing types.

### An overview of human papillomavirus infection for the dermatologist: disease, diagnosis, management, and prevention [^116RkmHd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common, usually transient, dermatologic infection transmitted by genital contact that can cause a variety of anogenital diseases, including warts (condyloma), dysplasia (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal), and squamous cell carcinoma. A number of treatment modalities are available to treat anogenital warts, both patient- and provider-applied. Treatment is efficacious, but lesions can recur. Bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are approved to prevent HPV infection. Both are indicated to prevent cervical cancer, while the quadrivalent vaccine is also approved to prevent vaginal/vulvar cancers as well as genital warts in males and females. Providers should clearly explain the natural history and potential sequelae of HPV disease, counsel patients on prevention strategies, and recommend vaccination as an effective method of prevention to their patients.

### Management of external genital warts [^113dZH5y]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Genital warts affect 1% of the sexually active U.S. population and are commonly seen in primary care. Human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 are responsible for most genital warts. Warts vary from small, flat-topped papules to large, cauliflower-like lesions on the anogenital mucosa and surrounding skin. Diagnosis is clinical, but atypical lesions should be confirmed by histology. Treatments may be applied by patients, or by a clinician in the office. Patient-applied treatments include topical imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins, whereas clinician-applied treatments include podophyllin, bichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid. Surgical treatments include excision, cryotherapy, and electrosurgery. The quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine is active against virus subtypes that cause genital warts in men and women. Additionally, male circumcision may be effective in decreasing the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, and herpes simplex virus.

### Treatment of nongenital cutaneous warts… [^116S5ZqJ]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

A single-blinded RCT of 201 patients with recalcitrant warts compared mumps, Candida, or Trichophyton skin antigens alone or plus intralesional interferon alfa with interferon alfa alone or placebo. 21 Cure rates were 60 percent in the antigen groups compared with 24 percent in the interferon-only and placebo groups. Both cases resolved without sequelae. 20 Pretesting patients before treatment should be considered because this modality works only in patients with an immune response to the antigen. Table 5 presents the suggested protocol for intralesional injection of Candida or mumps skin antigens. |Use commercial Candida or mumps skin antigen test preparations. |. Two high-quality RCTs including 45 and 67 patients, respectively, with recalcitrant cutaneous warts reported cure rates of 56 to 75 percent with phototherapy plus aminolevulinic acid versus 23 to 42 percent with placebo phototherapy after four months.

2 In these RCTs, all warts were treated with a keratolytic agent before phototherapy, and recent guidelines correlate adequate paring with improved phototherapy outcomes. Intralesional Bleomycin Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis in cells and viruses. Imiquimod Imiquimod is an established therapy for genital and perianal warts. However, no published RCT has evaluated its use for cutaneous warts. Small nonrandomized trials evaluating topical imiquimod 5% for the treatment of recalcitrant warts reported 30 to 80 percent clearance rates. 9, 30, 31 Adverse effects include redness, itching, edema, and erosion. Surgical Removal by Curettage or Cautery Other Treatments Many other treatment modalities have been investigated for cutaneous warts, some showing promising effectiveness in small trials.

35–37 Other treatments, such as cantharidin and dinitrochlorobenzene, have little evidence supporting their effectiveness. In addition, oral cimetidine, oral zinc sulfate, podophyllin, propolis ointment, retinoids, and topical garlic extract have poor or inconsistent evidence of their effectiveness and may not differ from placebo.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^113TJ7WA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections — epidemiology and disease burden: Approximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at least 40 of which infect the genital area. The majority of HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or unrecognized, and sexually active persons are usually exposed to HPV during their lifetime. Oncogenic, high-risk HPV infection (e.g. HPV types 16 and 18) causes the majority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers, whereas other HPV infection (e.g. HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection is the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable precancers and cancers. An estimated 34,800 new HPV-attributable cancers occurred every year during 2012–2016, and before HPV vaccines were introduced, approximately 355,000 new cases of anogenital warts occurred every year.

### Genital warts: rapid evidence review [^117JzhUR]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Genital warts (also referred to as anogenital warts and condyloma acuminatum) are caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 in 90% of cases. They are transmitted primarily through anogenital contact and penetrative and non-penetrative sex. Transmission can be effectively prevented with vaccination. Current evidence regarding the effects of condom use on the prevalence of genital warts is conflicting. In the United States from 2013–2016, the prevalence of genital warts among individuals ages 18 to 59 years was 1.3% in men and 3.1% in women. The diagnosis is made clinically by the appearance of single or multiple lesions that may coalesce or be the same color as surrounding skin, cauliflower-like, flat, papular, or keratotic. Biopsy is indicated in some cases, such as for atypical lesions. Treatment may be patient- or physician-administered, with choice of treatment informed by shared decision-making. Treatment options may be limited by physician skills and clinic availability. Podofilox 0.5% solution is the most effective patient-administered therapy and carbon dioxide laser therapy, surgery, and electrosurgery are the most effective for wart removal at the end of treatment. All treatment strategies are associated with some recurrence, but most successfully treated warts do not recur. Use of podofilox, imiquimod, and sinecatechins should be avoided in pregnancy.

Question 3: Which statement is true of this cutaneous lesion?
A. It is frequently caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11
B. Approximately 2% to 5% will either harbor or progress to a squamous cell carcinoma
C. It is usually associated with underlying immunosuppression
D. It is a nonneoplastic lesion that typically does not recur after excision
E. Surveillance in 6 months' time is recommended as the lesions often recur

Answers:
A. It is frequently caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11 – Incorrect. VX is often HPV negative, and this is not implicated in the aetiology of this diagnosis.
B. Approximately 2% to 5% will either harbor or progress to a squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. VX is a benign lesion that does not harbor or progress to a squamous cell carcinoma.
C. It is usually associated with underlying immunosuppression – Incorrect. It is usually not associated with underlying immunosuppression.
D. It is a nonneoplastic lesion that typically does not recur after excision – Correct. Excision of the lesion is sufficient treatment of the lesion, with recurrence being rare.
E. Surveillance in 6 months' time is recommended as the lesions often recur – Incorrect. Recurrence is rare and patient self-surveillance is sufficient.

### Genital warts: current and future management options [^113qVesL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Genital warts are a cosmetic nuisance. They are caused by low-risk human papillomavirus types, have no oncogenic potential and are not linked to cervical cancer. However, they often cause significant psychological morbidity. Treatments are aimed at eradicating the unsightly lesions and stimulating the immune system to generate clearance and prevent recurrence. Commonly used physical treatment methods include cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid, laser, and electrocautery. However, many patients respond extremely well to home therapies with either podophyllotoxin or imiquimod. Patients prefer the comfort and dignity of home treatment, and this should be the first-line of treatment for the majority of patients. A routine screen for sexually transmitted infections is appropriate in most cases. Detailed explanation and reassurance are of paramount importance in reducing the psychological distress associated with this unpleasant genital condition.

Key Messages for Persons with Human Papillomavirus Infection

When counseling persons with anogenital HPV infection, the provider should discuss the following:

Anogenital HPV infection is common. It usually infects the anogenital area but can infect other areas, including the mouth and throat. The majority of sexually active persons get HPV at some time during their lifetime, although most never know it.
Partners tend to share HPV, and it is not possible to determine which partner transmitted the original infection. Having HPV does not mean that a person or his or her partner is having sex outside the relationship.
Persons who acquire HPV usually clear the infection spontaneously, meaning that HPV becomes undetectable with no associated health problems.
If HPV infection persists, genital warts, precancers, and cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, or neck might develop.
Discussion of tobacco use, and provision of cessation counseling, is important because of its contribution to the progression of precancer and cancer.
The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
Many types of HPV are sexually transmitted through anogenital contact, mainly during vaginal and anal sex. HPV also might be transmitted during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact without penetration. In rare cases, a pregnant woman can transmit HPV to an infant during delivery.
Treatments are available for the conditions caused by HPV but not for the virus itself.
Having HPV does not make it harder for a woman to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, certain precancers or cancers that HPV can cause, and the surgical procedures needed to treat them, can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term.
No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will become undetectable and which will persist or progress to disease. However, in certain circumstances, HPV tests can determine whether a woman is at increased risk for cervical cancer. These tests are not for detecting other HPV-related problems, nor are they useful for women aged < 25 years or men of any age.

Treatment

The aim of treatment is removal of the warts and amelioration of symptoms, if present. The appearance of warts also can result in considerable psychosocial distress, and removal can relieve cosmetic concerns. For most patients, treatment results in resolution of the warts. If left untreated, anogenital warts can resolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number. Because warts might spontaneously resolve in < 1 year, an acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment and wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for anogenital warts might reduce, but probably do not eradicate, HPV infectivity. Whether reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting from treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.

Treatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, number, and anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; convenience; adverse effects; and provider experience. No definitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment is superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. Shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding treatment algorithms has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be encouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, clinicians sometimes use combination therapy (e.g. provider-administered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy between visits to the provider). However, limited data exist regarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated with combination therapy. Treatment regimens are classified as either patient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-applied modalities are preferred by certain persons because they can be administered in the privacy of their home. To ensure that patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should be provided to patients while in the clinic, and all anogenital warts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit. Follow-up visits after weeks of therapy enable providers to answer any questions about use of the medication, address any side effects experienced, and facilitate assessment of the response to treatment.

### Human papillomavirus: a review [^111ZNUQB]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus infection remains a great source of morbidity and mortality. Progress in understanding the structure of HPV and its pathogenesis has led to a wide variety of possible new treatment modalities to combat HPV-related disease. Most HPV infections (whether high risk or low risk) resolve without any medical intervention. Persistent or progressive disease, however, remains difficult to treat. Although currently available therapies have proved efficacious and tolerable in the treatment of nongenital and genital warts, no single therapy is uniformly effective in eradicating persistent HPV infection. Cytodestructive methods, such as cryotherapy, remain the primary treatment modality for nongenital warts. Immune response modifiers, such as imiquimod, currently show the greatest promise in treating HPV-induced anogenital lesions, both with respect to complete response and in preventing recurrence. Human papillomavirus infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world, and cervical cancer still causes significant morbidity and mortality. Pap smear tests have greatly reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in developed countries. Additional research will focus on primary and secondary prevention strategies. Vaccines against high-risk HPV types are promising modalities currently under investigation to prevent HPV infections and possibly to treat them.

Human Papillomavirus Infections

Approximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at least 40 of which infect the genital area. The majority of HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or unrecognized. Sexually active persons are usually exposed to HPV during their lifetime. Oncogenic, high-risk HPV infection (e.g. HPV types 16 and 18) causes the majority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers, whereas other HPV infection (e.g. HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection is the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable precancers and cancers. A substantial proportion of cancers and anogenital warts are attributable to HPV in the United States. An estimated 34,800 new HPV-attributable cancers occurred every year during 2012–2016. Before HPV vaccines were introduced, approximately 355,000 new cases of anogenital warts occurred every year.

Prevention

HPV Vaccines

Three HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States: Ceravrix, a 2-valent vaccine (2vHPV) that targets HPV types 16 and 18; Gardasil, a 4-valent vaccine (4vHPV) that targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18; and Gardasil 9, a 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV) that targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Types 16 and 18 account for 66% of all cervical cancers, whereas the five additional types targeted by the 9-valent vaccine account for 15%. Types 6 and 11 cause > 90% of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in the United States.

This review presents the epidemiology, pathophysiology, prevention, and management of sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) and its associated diseases. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. Prevalence varies regionally. Low-risk strains cause anogenital warts, which can be managed with patient- or provider-applied therapies. High-risk strains cause lower anogenital cancers. Primary and secondary prevention strategies include vaccination and screening for precancerous lesions, respectively. Management of abnormal screening results vary by test result, anatomic site, and individual cancer risk. Approaches include close rescreening, high-resolution visualization with biopsy, and-when biopsy-proven precancer is identified-removal or destruction of the lesion.

Diagnostic Considerations

HPV tests are available for detecting oncogenic types of HPV infection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening and management or follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology or histology (see Cervical Cancer). These tests should not be used for male partners of women with HPV or women aged < 25 years, for diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STI test.

Application of 3%–5% acetic acid, which might cause affected areas to turn white, has been used by certain providers to detect genital mucosa infected with HPV. The routine use of this procedure to detect mucosal changes attributed to HPV infection is not recommended because the results do not influence clinical management.

Treatment

Treatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g. genital warts) or pathologic precancerous lesions caused by HPV. Subclinical genital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously; therefore, specific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV infection. Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical cancer screening; HPV-related precancer should be managed on the basis of existing guidance (see Cervical Cancer).

For patients with large or extensive warts, surgical therapy, including CO 2 laser, might be most beneficial; such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral warts, particularly for those persons whose warts have not responded to other treatments. TCA or BCA treatment can be repeated weekly if necessary. Alternative Regimens for External Genital Warts. Fewer data are available regarding the efficacy of alternative regimens for treating anogenital warts, which include podophyllin resin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, and topical cidofovir. Shared clinical decision-making between the patient and provider regarding benefits and risks of these regimens should be provided. Management of cervical warts should include consultation with a specialist. For women who have exophytic cervical warts, a biopsy evaluation to exclude HSIL should be performed before treatment is initiated.

Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen OR Surgical removal OR Trichloracetic acid or Bichloroacetic acid 80%–90% solution Management of intra-anal warts should include consultation with a colorectal specialist.
- Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does not cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often recur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.
- Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons with genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. HPV might remain present and can still be transmitted to partners even after the warts are gone.

### Nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccination as alternative treatment for genital warts [^11322cVF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Genital warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted disease and have a negative impact on quality of life. Of the more than 200 different types of HPV, low-risk types 6 and 11 are mainly responsible for the development of condyloma acuminata. Despite a large arsenal of local therapies such as numerous topical agents, CO 2 laser ablation, and surgical removal, genital warts tend to be recalcitrant. HPV vaccination is mainly used as a preventive strategy to prevent genital warts, cervical cancer, and other anogenital cancers. However, in a few cases, HPV vaccination has been shown to be a good treatment alternative for patients with recalcitrant skin warts. Here we report five cases of recalcitrant genital warts that responded well to treatment with the nonavalent HPV vaccine. HPV vaccines could be beneficial as a noninvasive treatment alternative for recalcitrant genital warts.

External genital warts — alternative regimens and podophyllin resin use include limited-evidence options and specific safety constraints: Fewer data are available for alternative regimens (podophyllin resin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, topical cidofovir), shared clinical decision-making should address benefits and risks, and alternative regimens might have more side effects. Podophyllin resin is no longer a recommended regimen due to safer options and reports of severe systemic toxicity when applied to large friable areas and not washed off within 4 hours; however, podophyllin resin 10%–25% in compound tincture of benzoin might be considered if strict recommendations are followed, applied to each wart and allowed to air dry, with treatment repeated weekly if necessary. To reduce complications, limit application to < 0.5 mL or an area of < 10 cm2 per session, avoid open lesions, wounds, or friable tissue, and thoroughly wash off 1–4 hours after application; preparations vary in composition, shelf life and stability are unknown, and the safety of podophyllin during pregnancy has not been established.

### Human papillomavirus and genital warts: a review of the evidence for the 2015 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^111TQ9ov]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To provide updates for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines on human papillomavirus (HPV) and anogenital warts (AGWs), a review of the literature was conducted in key topic areas: (1) epidemiology and burden of disease; (2) transmission and natural history; (3) diagnosis and management of AGWs; (4) occupational exposure of healthcare workers; (5) anal cancer screening among men who have sex with men (MSM); and (6) HPV vaccine recommendations. Most sexually active persons will have detectable HPV at least once in their lifetime; 14 million persons are infected annually, and 79 million persons have prevalent infection. HPV is transmitted frequently between partners; more frequent transmission has been reported from females to males than from males to females. A new formulation of imiquimod (3.75% cream) is recommended for AGW treatment. Appropriate infection control, including performing laser or electrocautery in ventilated rooms using standard precautions, is recommended to prevent possible transmission to healthcare workers who treat anogenital warts, oral warts, and anogenital intraepithelial neoplasias (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS or HIV-negative MSM. An annual digital anorectal examination may be useful for early detection of anal cancer in these populations. HPV vaccine is recommended routinely for 11- or 12-year-olds, as well as for young men through age 21 years and young women through age 26 years who have not previously been vaccinated. HPV vaccine is also recommended for MSM, people living with HIV/AIDS, and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years.

Introduction

Common cutaneous warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) strains 1, 2, and 4, can be challenging to treat. Immunosuppressed patients are especially vulnerable to this infection, and the warts may cause physical and psychologic distress. There are currently 3 commercially available vaccines in the United States that target HPV strains commonly associated with the development of anogenital warts, cervical dysplasia, and cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers. We report a case of an immunosuppressed adult with eruptive cutaneous warts who responded well to treatment with the nonavalent HPV vaccine (targeted against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58).

### Management of genital warts [^113qZsWC]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Genital warts caused by human papillomavirus infection are encountered commonly in primary care. Evidence guiding treatment selection is limited, but treatment guidelines recently have changed. Biopsy, viral typing, acetowhite staining, and other diagnostic measures are not routinely required. The goal of treatment is clearance of visible warts; some evidence exists that treatment reduces infectivity, but there is no evidence that treatment reduces the incidence of cervical and genital cancer. The choice of therapy is based on the number, size, site, and morphology of lesions, as well as patient preferences, cost, convenience, adverse effects, and clinician experience. Patient-applied therapy such as imiquimod cream or podofilox is increasingly recommended. Podofilox, imiquimod, surgical excision, and cryotherapy are the most convenient and effective options. Fluorouracil and interferon are no longer recommended for routine use. The cost per successful treatment course is approximately dollars 200 to dollars 300 for podofilox, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, surgical excision, laser treatment, and the loop electrosurgical excision procedure.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^1179AxED]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

We prepared 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison for which data were available for the following outcomes that were assessed as critical or important according to GRADE guidelines (Guyatt 2011d):

for females: high‐grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer; high‐grade vulval and vaginal disease;
for males: invasive anal or penile cancer, external genital lesions;
for all populations: anogenital warts, overall local/injection site adverse events, overall systemic events and general symptoms, serious adverse events, deaths;
for comparisons of dose schedules (i.e. number of doses and longer or shorter interval between doses): immunological outcomes.

We assessed the certainty of evidence in the review through discussion between review authors using the GRADE approach using GRADEpro online software (GRADEpro GDT). We assessed only the primary outcomes reported in the 'Summary of findings' tables and appendices using GRADE. We considered the following factors for downgrading: limitations in the study design (risk of bias); inconsistency of results (heterogeneity); indirectness of evidence (applicability); imprecision (few events and wide confidence intervals); and publication bias (Guyatt 2011a). When evidence was downgraded, we detailed the reasons in footnotes of the 'Summary of findings' tables and summarised these in the Quality of the evidence section. Depending on whether evidence was downgraded or not, we rated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as follows:

high‐certainty evidence indicates that we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect (evidence was not downgraded);
moderate‐certainty evidence indicates that we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different (evidence was downgraded one step for any of the factors described above);
low‐certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect (evidence was downgraded two steps for any of the factors described above);
very low‐certainty evidence indicates that we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect (evidence was downgraded three steps for any of the factors described above).

### Genital human papillomavirus infection [^111LW4HJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, epidemiology and natural history studies have led to improved understanding of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and to promising prevention strategies. HPV infection is the cause of anogenital warts and cervical cancer, as well as a proportion of other anogenital and head and neck cancers. Data from clinical trials have resulted in recommendations that support the use of an HPV test in the context of cervical cancer screening and management. Prophylactic HPV vaccine trials have demonstrated high efficacy, and an HPV vaccine that prevents cervical cancer precursors, cervical cancer, and anogenital warts caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was licensed for use in girls and women aged 9–26 years by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2006. In this article, we review genital HPV for the clinician, with a primary focus on the prevalence of HPV infection in the United States.

More than 15 years ago, a relationship between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer was recognized. Since then, important strides in understanding the virus have been made, particularly in the following areas: modes of transmission and risk factors associated with transmission; the oncogenic potential of specific viral types and the mechanism by which they cause cancer; and the spectrum of infection, ranging from asymptomatic carrier states to overt warts, preneoplastic lesions, and invasive cancer. Sophisticated new tests for the detection of HPV that hold great promise for improved screening for cervical cancer precursors and invasive cancer and for the triage of abnormal cervical cytology also have been developed. Understanding the immunology of HPV has allowed the development of new and more effective treatment modalities for HPV infection and the preliminary development of primary prevention modalities, including HPV vaccines.

Special Considerations

Pregnancy

Podofilox, podophyllin, and sinecatechins should not be used during pregnancy. Imiquimod appears to pose low risk but should be avoided until more data are available. Anogenital warts can proliferate and become friable during pregnancy. Although removal of warts during pregnancy can be considered, resolution might be incomplete or poor until pregnancy is complete. Rarely, HPV types 6 and 11 can cause respiratory papillomatosis among infants and children, although the route of transmission (i.e. transplacental, perinatal, or postnatal) is not completely understood. Whether cesarean delivery prevents respiratory papillomatosis among infants and children also is unclear; therefore, cesarean delivery should not be performed solely to prevent transmission of HPV infection to the newborn. Cesarean delivery is indicated for women with anogenital warts if the pelvic outlet is obstructed or if vaginal delivery would result in excessive bleeding. Pregnant women with anogenital warts should be counseled about the low risk for warts on the larynx of their infants or children (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).

HIV and Other Causes of Immunosuppression

Persons with HIV infection or who are otherwise immunosuppressed are more likely to develop anogenital warts than those who do not have HIV. Moreover, such persons can have larger or more numerous lesions, might not respond to therapy as well as those who are immunocompetent, and might have more frequent recurrences after treatment (,–). Despite these factors, data do not support altered approaches to treatment for persons with HIV infection. Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or resembling anogenital warts might occur more frequently among immunosuppressed persons, therefore requiring biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis for suspicious cases.

High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions

Biopsy of an atypical wart might reveal HSIL or cancer of the anogenital tract. In this instance, referral to a specialist for treatment is recommended.

Cancers and Precancers Associated with Human Papillomavirus

Persistent infection with high-risk (oncogenic) types of HPV has a causal role in approximately all cervical cancers and in certain vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers. However, cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated cancer for which routine screening is recommended.

Diagnostic Considerations

Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated if lesions are atypical (e.g. pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might also be indicated in the following circumstances, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised (including those with HIV infection): the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or the disease worsens during therapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart diagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not guide genital wart management. Some anogenital lesions can resemble anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), but do not respond to anogenital wart treatment. Condyloma lata, a manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by serologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid from the lesions (see Syphilis, Diagnostic Considerations).

### Nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccination as a treatment for warts in an immunosuppressed adult [^1117hsMe]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Routine vaccination against HPV has been available in most industrialized countries since 2006. First available as bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, the nonavalent vaccine has been available since 2015. It is targeted against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 and for those older than 15 years, the recommended dosing schedule is at zero, 2, and 6 months. It has been shown to produce a robust immune response with seroconversion rates approaching 100%. Studies on HPV vaccine administration in immunosuppressed populations are sparse, but a multicenter trial did show adequate immunogenic response to quadrivalent vaccine administration in immunosuppressed children regardless of age or cause of immunosuppression.

Recalcitrant common warts, especially in the immunosuppressed population, can prove to be difficult to treat. Although many therapeutic options for warts exist, there is no definitive cure. Several case reports have described the successful use of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in treating recalcitrant warts. Within the body of literature surrounding HPV vaccines, there is some indication for a cross-protection effect against HPV strains other than those targeted by the individual vaccine administered. Although the HPV strains that cause common warts may be less genetically related to those implicated in cervical, vulvar, and anal cancer, the possibility of cross-over effects with vaccines has been postulated previously. Interestingly, one case series reported success in treating children less than 14 years old with the quadrivalent vaccine, but less improvement was noted in teenagers (3 of 6 patients cleared) and in adults (1 of 4 patients cleared), perhaps indicating a more robust response to the vaccine in children.

### Impact of human papillomavirus (HPV)-6 / 11 / 16 / 18 vaccine on all HPV-associated genital diseases in young women [^114fZ9Gc]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of the prophylactic vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV6/11/16/18) on all HPV-associated genital disease was investigated in a population that approximates sexually naive women in that they were "negative to 14 HPV types" and in a mixed population of HPV-exposed and -unexposed women (intention-to-treat group).

Methods

This analysis studied 17 622 women aged 15–26 years who were enrolled in one of two randomized, placebo-controlled, efficacy trials for the HPV6/11/16/18 vaccine (first patient on December 28, 2001, and studies completed July 31, 2007). Vaccine or placebo was given at day 1, month 2, and month 6. All women underwent cervicovaginal sampling and Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at day 1 and every 6–12 months thereafter. Outcomes were any cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; any external anogenital and vaginal lesions; Pap test abnormalities; and procedures such as colposcopy and definitive therapy. Absolute rates are expressed as women with endpoint per 100 person-years at risk.

Results

The average follow-up was 3.6 years (maximum of 4.9 years). In the population that was negative to 14 HPV types, vaccination was up to 100% effective in reducing the risk of HPV16/18-related high-grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal lesions and of HPV6/11-related genital warts. In the intention-to-treat group, vaccination also statistically significantly reduced the risk of any high-grade cervical lesions (19.0% reduction; rate vaccine = 1.43, rate placebo = 1.76, difference = 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13 to 0.54), vulvar and vaginal lesions (50.7% reduction; rate vaccine = 0.10, rate placebo = 0.20, difference = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.16), genital warts (62.0% reduction; rate vaccine = 0.44, rate placebo = 1.17, difference = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.87), Pap abnormalities (11.3% reduction; rate vaccine = 10.36, rate placebo = 11.68, difference = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.74 to 1.90), and cervical definitive therapy (23.0% reduction; rate vaccine = 1.97, rate placebo = 2.56, difference = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.83), irrespective of causal HPV type.

Conclusions

High-coverage HPV vaccination programs among adolescents and young women may result in a rapid reduction of genital warts, cervical cytological abnormalities, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In the longer term, substantial reductions in the rates of cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers may follow.

Special considerations during pregnancy — therapeutic choices and obstetric management in HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV): Pregnant women living with HIV infection who have genital warts or anogenital HPV-related neoplasia are best managed by an interdisciplinary team of specialists, and pregnancy may be associated with an increased frequency and rate of growth of genital warts. Podofilox should not be used during pregnancy (BIII), and at present, the evidence is insufficient to recommend imiquimod use during pregnancy (CIII). Other topical treatments (such as BCA and TCA) and ablative therapies (laser, cryotherapy, and excision) can be used during pregnancy (AIII). Transmission of genital HPV6 and 11 from vaginal secretions at delivery is the presumed mechanism of early-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in children; this condition is rare but is more common among children of women who have genital warts at delivery, and cesarean delivery is not known to prevent this condition. No change in obstetrical management is indicated for women with genital warts unless extensive condylomata are present that might impede vaginal delivery or cause extensive bleeding (AIII).

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are newsworthy in this new millennium. Numerous articles have appeared in the lay press ranging in style and quality from informative essays to sensationalized exposes. Women, sensitized by confusing information, are asking obstetricians hard questions about HPV transmission and prevention, partner notification, the need for HPV testing, and methods of treatment. These questions are difficult because none of the answers are clear cut. This article provides the practicing gynecologist and obstetrician a concise and accurate summary of clinically important issues surrounding HPV. Current knowledge about HPV virology, epidemiology, testing, and the prospects for vaccination and other prevention measures is summarized.

Counseling

When counseling persons with anogenital warts, the provider should discuss the following:

If left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, or increase in size or number. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
Women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more often than other women.
Time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively determined. Genital warts can develop months or years after acquiring HPV.
HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to another person, even without visible signs of warts. Sex partners tend to share HPV, even though signs of HPV (e.g. warts) might occur in only one or neither partner.
Although genital warts are common and benign, certain persons might experience considerable psychosocial impact after receiving this diagnosis.
Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does not cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often recur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.
Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons with genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. HPV might remain present and can still be transmitted to partners even after the warts are gone.
Condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital warts if used consistently and correctly; however, HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a condom and might not fully protect against HPV.
A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent genital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV or genital warts. This vaccine can prevent the majority of cases of genital warts among persons who have not yet been exposed to wart-causing types of HPV.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons should inform current partners about having genital warts because the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed on to partners. Partners should be counseled that they might already have HPV despite no visible signs of warts; therefore, HPV testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is not recommended. Partners might benefit from a physical examination to detect genital warts and tests for other STIs. No recommendations can be made regarding informing future sex partners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration of viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown.

External genital warts — cryotherapy and surgical therapies are characterized by provider administration and procedural considerations: Cryotherapy is a provider-administered therapy that destroys warts by thermal-induced cytolysis; health care providers should be trained to avoid complications or low efficacy, and pain with liquid nitrogen followed by necrosis and sometimes blistering is common, with local anesthesia possibly facilitating therapy when lesions are extensive. Surgical therapy can eliminate the majority of warts at a single visit although recurrence can occur, requires substantial clinical training and equipment, and can involve electrocautery (with careful depth control), tangential excision, CO2 laser, or curettage; suturing is neither required nor indicated in most cases, and treatment of anogenital and oral warts should be performed in a ventilated room using local exhaust ventilation.

### The human papillomavirus vaccine as a treatment for human papillomavirus-related dysplastic and neoplastic conditions: a literature review [^115ZHTcP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are associated with common dermatologic and nondermatologic diseases. Although HPV vaccines are well established as preventive measures for genital warts and cervical neoplasia, their use as therapeutic agents deserves greater attention.

Objective

To evaluate the use of HPV vaccine(s) as a treatment modality for cutaneous and/or mucosal disease.

Methods

A primary literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was conducted in January 2019 by using the PubMed and Cochrane databases.

Results

A total of 63 articles with 4439 patients were included. The majority of patients with cutaneous warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and squamous and basal cell carcinomas were successfully treated with HPV vaccination. Preliminary data on patients with pre-existing anogenital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, anal intraepithelial neoplasia, and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is promising.

Limitations

This review was limited by the lack of controls, patients' previous HPV vaccination status, and publication bias.

Conclusion

The commercially available three-dose, quadrivalent HPV vaccine is a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of cutaneous warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and squamous and basal cell carcinomas. Noncommercially available HPV vaccines demonstrate therapeutic response for treating anogenital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, anal intraepithelial neoplasia, and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. The vaccine's efficacy as an adjunct therapy for HPV-associated cutaneous and/or mucosal disease warrants further exploration.

Recommended regimens for external anogenital warts (penis, groin, scrotum, vulva, perineum, external anus, or perianus) state that the aim of treatment is removal of the warts and symptom relief; because warts might spontaneously resolve in < 1 year, an acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment and wait for spontaneous resolution; selection should be guided by wart size, number, anatomic site, patient preference, cost, convenience, adverse effects, and provider experience, and no definitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment is superior to another; patient-applied options include imiquimod 3.75% or 5% cream, podofilox 0.5% solution or gel, and sinecatechins 15% ointment; provider-administered options include cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe, surgical removal by tangential scissor excision, tangential shave excision, curettage, laser, or electrosurgery, and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80%–90% solution; persons with external anal warts might benefit from inspection of the anal canal, and these agents might weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms.

### Management of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based approach [^116qzHxT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are benign epidermal proliferations caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment aims to cure the patient's physical and psychological discomfort, and to prevent the spread of infection by contact with other body areas or with other individuals. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases the safety and efficacy of these treatment options has not been assessed in randomized controlled trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. This article provides indications for the management of patients with cutaneous warts through an evidence-based approach, considering a first-, second-, and third-line therapy for each clinical form. The first line includes medical treatments useful to cure single, or few, and/or small common warts of short duration (< 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, a third-line of therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options that are in clinical use but are not necessarily approved by the US FDA, and their use may be further limited by adverse effects.

Introduction

Extraordinary developments have occurred since molecular and epidemiological tools have proven that oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause virtually all cervical cancers, as well as a proportion of other anogenital cancers (vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile) and some oropharyngeal cancers (particularly tonsillar). In addition, low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 are the causative agents of the majority of genital warts, a benign but very common sexually transmitted disease, estimated to occur in up to 10% of the populationand with an estimated annual burden of new cases worldwide of 30 million.

With the development of viral-like particles and the relatively short translation to phase 3 clinical vaccine trials showing that prophylactic HPV vaccines targeting the two most common causes of cervix cancer, HPV 16 and 18, are safe, immunogenic and efficacious, we now observe the outcome of these vaccines implemented as public health tools in those countries that can afford such programmes. Where coverage has been high to the appropriate target population, reduction in disease has already been seen for those HPV-related diseases with the shortest incubation periods. For example, in Australia the quadrivalent HPV (6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine was started in April 2007 in a comprehensive, national, government-funded, school-based, ongoing programme for girls 12 years of age, with a catch-up program to 26 years of age until December 2009. In this real-life situation, a statistically significant reduction has already been reported in genital warts of almost 60% in young women of vaccine-eligible age. These findings are most likely related to the catch-up component of the programme, rather than the school-based programme. However, with time and continued good vaccine coverage, one would expect a change in sexual health clinics, where treatment of genital warts currently makes up a large component of the work. Genital warts not only carry a huge financial burden, but also cause substantial psychosocial burden and, in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection, can be recalcitrant to standard treatment and difficult to manage.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112s46Dm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Genital warts treatment — Multiple treatments for HPV-associated skin and external genital lesions exist, but no one treatment is ideal for all patients or all lesions (CIII). Treatment can induce wart-free periods, but the underlying viral infection can persist, resulting in recurrence, and treatment modalities for external genital warts are the same for HIV-infected and -uninfected populations. Individuals who are immunosuppressed because of HIV may have larger or more numerous warts and may not respond as well; topical treatments may be ineffective in patients with larger or extensive lesions. Self-applied therapies include podofilox (0.5%) solution or gel, imiquimod (5%) cream, and sinecatechin ointment; provider-applied agents include trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid (TCA; BCA) (80%–90% aqueous solution). Other treatments include intralesional interferon-alfa (IFN-α) or 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]/epinephrine gel implant, and cidofovir topical gel (1%); cidofovir gel (1%) has been evaluated in a limited number of adults for anogenital HPV infection (CIII).

Prevention

Three HPV vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers caused by HPV. The 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV vaccines protect against the majority of cervical cancer cases, although the 4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines also protect against the majority of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in the United States. HPV vaccines are safe and effective and are recommended routinely for adolescents aged 11–12 years. Catch-up vaccination is also recommended for older adolescents and young adults through age 26 years. Shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding HPV vaccination for certain adults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated per guidance.
Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the chances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and developing HPV-related diseases (e.g. genital warts or cervical cancer). However, because HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom, condoms might not fully protect against HPV.
Limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk for HPV. However, even persons with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV.
Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection.

### Topical medication as an initial therapeutic option for protruding and non-protruding condylomata acuminata of the distal urethra [^113ajYig]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Genital warts (also known as condylomata acuminata) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) represent one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. Although they are usually found in the outer genital region, a small proportion of men can present with (often unrecognised) intraurethral warts, generally limited to the distal urethra and urethral meatus. This poses a treatment challenge not adequately addressed by the current guidelines. Here, we present two cases of low-risk HPV-positive patients with protruding and non-protruding condylomata acuminata of the distal urethra, which were treated successfully by using two different topical regimens (ie, a combination of policresulen and imiquimod for one patient and 5-fluorouracil monotherapy for the other). Although this type of management results in lower rates of tissue destruction and complications and may be given preference as an initial therapeutic option, additional prospective comparative clinical studies are needed to elucidate its potential in similar cases.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1145Eq4P]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination include the following:

Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.
A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available ator by calling CDC INFO 800-232-4636). For uninsured persons aged < 19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe. Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine. Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine. HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors.

Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

### Role of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on HPV infection and recurrence of HPV related disease after local surgical treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11527dL2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The findings of our meta-analysis suggest that adjuvant HPV vaccination at the time of local excision for CIN might lead to a reduction in the risk of recurrence of high grade preinvasive disease (CIN2+). The effect estimate was even more pronounced for CIN2+ related to HPV16 or HPV18. Publication bias might be present, however, affecting the overall quality of evidence, indicating that the evidence is inconclusive. Evidence was lacking on the benefit of HPV vaccination for recurrence of vulvar, vaginal, or anal intraepithelial lesions, genital warts, or for incident or persistent HPV infections, although the data were scarce with small numbers of studies and participants. Analysis of the post hoc studies from randomised controlled trial data with historic vaccination at randomisation before the development of the disease reported inconsistent results. The effect size on secondary outcomes in the main analysis of our study showed possible beneficial effects, although the evidence was inconclusive because the number of included studies was small.

Four meta-analyses have attempted to combine the evidence so far. Although our findings on the summary estimate were in agreement with recent meta-analyses examining similar questions, our analysis raised concerns about the quality of the data and we concluded that the evidence is inconclusive. Some of the previous meta-analyses published in 2020 and 2021 only included a fraction of the published literature, failed to include grey literature and unpublished data, had exclusion criteria that affected the final number of studies with potentially relevant data, and the presence of publication bias was not assessed and was not associated with the overall quality of the data. These studies did not include extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses to determine the effect of risk of bias, type of vaccine, heterogeneity between studies, and attrition rate on the primary outcome, and the tools used to assess the quality of studies and risk of bias were not optimal.

Introduction/Background

External genital warts (EGW) or condyloma acuminatum are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV); types 6 and 11 being responsible for the majority of EGW cases. External genital warts are spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, impacting both men and women. Despite EGW being a common sexually transmitted infection, affecting approximately 1% of sexually active adults in the USA at any given time, HPV itself is not a nationally notifiable health condition.

Human papilloma virus can remain latent in the skin, with EGW appearing or spreading at any time. The incubation period from infection to appearance of clinical EGW ranges from 3 to 32 weeks. The four morphologic types of EGW are cauliflower shaped, flat, smooth papular, and keratotic. External genital warts range in size from 1 mm to several inches in diameter and may appear in groups or individually. Once present, EGW may increase in number and/or size, but may also spontaneously regress; approximately 30% of patients experience regression within 4 months after appearance. Even when EGW spontaneously regress, the majority of EGW may recur within 3 months of infection.

External genital warts typically occur on the epidermis in the anogenital area, including the vulva, penis, groin, suprapubic skin, perineum, perianal, or mucosal surfaces. Patients may be asymptomatic, or may experience pruritus, burning, and pain. In addition to physical symptoms, EGW can be associated with negative sexual feelings, causing significant psychological and emotional effects.

While EGW can resolve spontaneously, treatment is recommended for patients experiencing symptoms such as itching, burning, or pain. Treatment should also be considered when there are concerns about spread or transmission. The goal of treatment is to eliminate visible EGW, as it is not possible to eliminate the underlying HPV infection. Treatment of EGW can be challenging with slow or no improvement and high recurrence rates.

The following constitutes key background information on anogenital warts:

- **Definition**: Anogenital warts, also known as condylomata acuminata, are an STI caused by certain strains of the HPV, primarily HPV genotypes 6 and 11.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of anogenital warts involves the transmission of HPV through sexual contact, leading to the infection of squamous epithelial cells in the anogenital region. The virus causes these cells to proliferate excessively, resulting in the formation of warts.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of anogenital warts is estimated at 160–289 per 100,000 person-years worldwide.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for anogenital warts include engaging in sexual activity, especially with multiple partners, and having unprotected intercourse. Additional risk factors include immunosuppression and concurrent infection with other STDs. Transmission of HPV, although less frequent, can also occur through non-sexual routes.
- **Disease course**: Anogenital warts present as fleshy growths on the skin or mucous membranes of the anogenital area, often in the perianal region, and can be painless or tender. They can vary in size and shape, ranging from flat to raised, small to large, and singular to multiple. Anogenital warts are usually asymptomatic, but some can cause itching, discomfort, tenderness, or bleeding.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of anogenital warts is generally good as they are usually benign. However, they can recur after treatment, and certain high-risk HPV strains can lead to malignancies, such as SCC.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113PPWd6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing recurrence and managing treatment failure — Monitoring after therapy for cervical disease should follow the ASCCP guidelines, no recommendations exist for preventing recurrence of external genital warts, and patients should be monitored with cytologic screening and, when indicated, colposcopic examination for recurrent lesions (AI). Treatment failure is defined as persistence or recurrence of lesions after appropriate therapy; for persistent or recurrent genital warts, re-treatment with any of the previously described modalities should be considered, preferably using an alternative to the one that previously failed (AIII). Genital warts often require more than one course, recalcitrant warts should be managed by experienced clinicians and referred for excisional therapy, recurrence of CIN may require additional treatments such as LEEP or laser, excisional therapy is recommended for recurrent lesions, and recurrent cytologic and histologic abnormalities after therapy for CIN should be managed according to the ASCCP guidelines.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Genital warts — treatment options in HIV: Multiple treatments for HPV-associated skin and external genital lesions exist, but no one treatment is ideal for all patients or all lesions (CIII). Guidelines for the treatment of warts found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010, should be followed. Self-applied therapies include podofilox (0.5%) solution or gel, imiquimod (5%) cream, and sinecatechin ointment, while provider-applied agents include trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid (TCA; BCA) (80%–90% aqueous solution). Other treatments include intralesional interferon-alfa (IFN-α) or 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]/epinephrine gel implant, and cidofovir topical gel (1%); cidofovir gel (1%) is a topical preparation that has been evaluated in a limited number of adults for treatment of anogenital HPV infection (CIII).

Recommended Regimens for External Anogenital Warts (i.e. Penis, Groin, Scrotum, Vulva, Perineum, External Anus, or Perianus)*
Patient-applied: Imiquimod 3.75% or 5% cream †
or
Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel
or
Sinecatechins 15% ointment †
Provider-administered: Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe
or
Surgical removal by tangential scissor excision, tangential shave excision, curettage, laser, or electrosurgery
or
Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80%–90% solution
* Persons with external anal or perianal warts might also have intra-anal warts. Thus, persons with external anal warts might benefit from an inspection of the anal canal by digital examination, standard anoscopy, or high-resolution anoscopy.
† Might weaken condoms and vaginal diaphragms.

Imiquimod is a patient-applied, topically active immune enhancer that stimulates production of interferon and other cytokines. Imiquimod 5% cream should be applied once at bedtime, 3 times/week for < 16 weeks. Similarly, imiquimod 3.75% cream should be applied once at bedtime every night for < 8 weeks. With either formulation, the treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6–10 hours after the application. Local inflammatory reactions, including redness, irritation, induration, ulceration or erosion, and vesicles might occur with using imiquimod, and hypopigmentation has also been described. Limited case reports demonstrate an association between treatment with imiquimod cream and worsened inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases (e.g. psoriasis, vitiligo, or lichenoid dermatoses). Data from studies of human participants are limited regarding use of imiquimod during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate that this therapy poses low risk.
