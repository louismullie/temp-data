## Question

Colesevelam for acute pancreatitis triglycerides

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colesevelam has any role in the management of hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP), whether it is contraindicated, and what evidence-based alternatives should be used instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the therapeutic targets and natural trajectory of triglycerides in HTG-AP. Then, I should verify colesevelam's pharmacology on triglycerides and its FDA labeling, including contraindications. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for acute and long-term management of HTG-AP, and check whether bile acid sequestrants are endorsed. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation, including safer alternatives and monitoring, while double-checking any scenarios where colesevelam might be considered later but could still be unsafe [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^111m2uqk] [^111xYw48] [^116VBxuw].

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic goal and the expected kinetics of triglyceride decline in HTG-AP. The acute objective is rapid reduction of triglycerides below 500 mg/dL to mitigate ongoing pancreatic injury and prevent recurrence, which many patients achieve with conservative measures such as withholding oral intake, intravenous fluids, and analgesia because triglycerides often fall quickly with a half-life near 30 hours and an approximate 70% decline within 48 hours under conservative care [^111M98mA] [^114iYFPt]. I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds that anchor clinical decisions; HTG-AP is typically suspected when triglycerides exceed 1,000 mg/dL per guideline frameworks, and pancreatitis risk rises progressively with triglycerides above 500 mg/dL, aligning the therapeutic target with pathophysiologic risk reduction [^111xYw48] [^116VBxuw] [^112BaquM].

> Now, I need to evaluate colesevelam's effects on triglycerides. At first glance, because colesevelam lowers LDL-C and is used in diabetes, I wondered if it might also lower triglycerides and thus help in HTG-AP; wait, let me verify the directionality of effect on triglycerides, because an increase would be harmful here [^115o9zo2]. Hold on, I should verify the FDA adverse effect data: multiple labeling sources consistently show colesevelam increases triglycerides, with median increases of about 5% in primary hyperlipidemia and larger increases in type 2 diabetes monotherapy and combinations, up to roughly 22% when used with insulin, and "increased serum triglycerides" is a very common adverse reaction, which would directly counter the therapeutic goal in HTG-AP [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^115yVWPE]. Mechanistically, as a bile acid sequestrant, colesevelam can increase VLDL production and leave triglycerides unchanged or increased, which in an HTG-AP context risks worsening chylomicronemia and free fatty acid toxicity in the pancreas [^115o9zo2] [^112BaquM].

> I should confirm the regulatory status regarding HTG and pancreatitis. Wait, let me double-check the FDA labeling for explicit contraindications and monitoring guidance. Colesevelam is contraindicated in patients with triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dL and in those with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, and prescribers are instructed to obtain triglycerides before initiation and periodically thereafter, with immediate discontinuation if triglycerides exceed 500 mg/dL or if symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur, underscoring a recognized risk signal of pancreatitis from drug-induced triglyceride increases [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY]. Patients are additionally warned that colesevelam may increase triglycerides and lead to pancreatitis, reinforcing that use in HTG-AP is unsafe by labeling standards that encompass both the acute episode and patients with a prior history of HTG-induced pancreatitis [^112fy4rB] [^111m2uqk].

> Next, I should review whether any guidelines endorse bile acid sequestrants in the acute or preventive management of HTG-AP. Let me consider the Endocrine Society and gastroenterology guidelines; I need to ensure I am not missing a niche indication. The Endocrine Society recommends fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids for pharmacologic triglyceride lowering, with fibrates specifically first-line in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and does not recommend bile acid sequestrants for HTG or HTG-AP management, while recent guidance also discourages routine insulin infusion in non-diabetics and avoids plasmapheresis as first-line in HTG-AP, pointing instead to conservative care and selective use of adjuncts [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi] [^116oHKwx] [^1135mzbs]. I should confirm the gastroenterology guidelines; ACG 2024 and WSES 2019 focus on diagnosis at triglycerides above 1,000 mg/dL and supportive care, with no role for bile acid sequestrants in acute management or prevention of recurrence [^111xYw48] [^116VBxuw].

> I will now examine evidence for effective alternatives in the acute phase. Hold on, I should verify that supportive care alone often suffices and clarify where insulin or apheresis fit. Conservative management with nothing by mouth and aggressive IV fluids typically lowers triglycerides to below 500 mg/dL within about 48 hours due to their natural clearance, and while insulin infusions can be considered in the context of concomitant hyperglycemia to accelerate lipoprotein lipase activity, guidelines advise against routine insulin infusion in non-diabetic patients and note that prospective outcome benefits for insulin or plasmapheresis remain unproven, reserving plasmapheresis for selected severe cases or deterioration rather than first-line therapy [^111M98mA] [^114iYFPt] [^116oHKwx] [^1135mzbs]. Let me double-check comparative data; meta-analytic assessments suggest no clear superiority of plasmapheresis over insulin-based approaches in lowering triglycerides or safety outcomes, further supporting a conservative-first strategy tailored to clinical severity and glycemic status [^113T4DiD].

> Next, I should review long-term prevention to minimize recurrence risk. I need to ensure the regimen targets sustained triglyceride control below 500 mg/dL and addresses secondary contributors. Fibrates and prescription omega-3 fatty acids are evidence-based options to reduce triglycerides, with icosapent ethyl indicated for severe hypertriglyceridemia, though its effect on pancreatitis risk is undetermined; comprehensive management also requires dietary fat restriction, alcohol abstinence, weight reduction, and tight control of diabetes and other secondary factors to prevent relapse [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi] [^1164quHs] [^111M98mA]. Hold on, I should double-check monitoring implications; recurrence correlates strongly with failure to maintain triglycerides below 500 mg/dL, so periodic lipid monitoring and addressing adherence and lifestyle are crucial to reduce long-term pancreatitis recurrence risk [^112kJz7X].

> But wait, what if triglycerides later normalize — could colesevelam be used then for LDL-lowering or glycemic benefit in diabetes. I need to ensure the labeling stance in such a scenario. The FDA contraindication includes both triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dL and a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, so even after triglyceride normalization, a prior episode of HTG-AP remains a labeled contraindication, and the drug's propensity to raise triglycerides remains clinically relevant in a population prone to surges, arguing against its use for lipid or glycemic indications in this context [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY]. Given the availability of alternative LDL-lowering and glucose-lowering therapies without this risk, colesevelam should be avoided in patients with a history of HTG-AP to prevent iatrogenic exacerbation of hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis risk [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY].

> Synthesizing the contraindication rationale, I should confirm that colesevelam directly conflicts with the therapeutic objective and regulatory guidance. It worsens the core pathology by increasing triglycerides, including by double-digit percentages in common clinical combinations, it is explicitly contraindicated by FDA labeling for triglycerides above 500 mg/dL and in patients with a prior history of HTG-induced pancreatitis, no guideline supports its use in HTG-AP, and mechanistically it could potentiate chylomicronemia and free fatty acid–mediated pancreatic injury, collectively establishing a risk without offsetting benefit in this setting [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^111m2uqk] [^112BaquM].

> Final clinical recommendation: Colesevelam is contraindicated in hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis and should not be used in the acute setting or in patients with a prior history of HTG-AP. Management should focus on withholding oral intake, aggressive intravenous hydration, and analgesia, with consideration of insulin infusion for patients with concomitant hyperglycemia, reserving plasmapheresis for selected severe cases rather than first line, and implementing long-term prevention with fibrates or prescription omega-3 fatty acids alongside intensive lifestyle modification and secondary cause control, with serial monitoring to maintain triglycerides below 500 mg/dL and reduce recurrence risk [^11543kXU] [^112VueQY] [^111M98mA] [^1135mzbs] [^116oHKwx] [^113T4DiD] [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi] [^1164quHs].

Colesevelam is contraindicated in acute pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia because it can increase triglycerides [^112VueQY] and worsen pancreatitis risk [^11543kXU]. It should not be used when TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or in patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [^11543kXU]. For acute management, use insulin infusion [^111M98mA], plasmapheresis [^114qEuhx], or fibrates/omega-3s [^112D2rbM] to rapidly lower TG and reduce pancreatitis risk.

---

## Pharmacological properties of colesevelam

Colesevelam is a nonabsorbed polymer that binds bile acids [^115o9zo2] in the gut, increasing their excretion and depleting the bile acid pool. This upregulates cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, which increases bile acid synthesis from cholesterol and, in turn, hepatic LDL receptor expression and LDL clearance, thereby lowering LDL cholesterol [^115o9zo2]. However, colesevelam may increase triglycerides or leave them unchanged [^115o9zo2].

---

## Clinical evidence of colesevelam's effect on triglyceride levels

Clinical trials show colesevelam can increase triglycerides [^112VueQY]. In primary hyperlipidemia, median TG increased by 5% versus placebo [^112VueQY] [^11543kXU], with larger increases in type 2 diabetes — 9.7% with monotherapy, 11% with pioglitazone, 18% with sulfonylureas, and 22% with insulin — compared with placebo [^116oMGej] [^112VueQY]. These increases are clinically significant, especially in patients at risk for pancreatitis [^112BaquM].

---

## Risks associated with colesevelam in hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis

Colesevelam is contraindicated in patients with TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [^11543kXU] because it can raise TG and precipitate or worsen pancreatitis [^112fy4rB]. Patients with TG > 300 mg/dL may experience greater TG increases [^11543kXU] and require close monitoring [^112VueQY].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus do not recommend colesevelam for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis, as it can increase TG and worsen pancreatitis risk [^112VueQY] [^11543kXU]; instead, they recommend [^111M98mA]:

- **Insulin infusion**: Rapidly lowers TG by enhancing lipoprotein lipase activity [^111M98mA].
- **Plasmapheresis**: Rapidly reduces TG in severe cases [^114qEuhx] [^1135mzbs].
- **Fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids**: First-line for long-term TG control and pancreatitis prevention [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety concerns

Colesevelam use in hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and severity due to TG elevation [^112VueQY]. It is contraindicated in patients with TG > 500 mg/dL [^112VueQY] or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [^11543kXU].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Insulin infusion | Enhances lipoprotein lipase activity, rapidly lowering TG | Effective in acute management [^111M98mA] |
| Plasmapheresis | Rapidly removes TG-rich lipoproteins from plasma | Effective in severe cases [^1135mzbs] [^114qEuhx] |
| Fibrates | Reduces hepatic TG synthesis and increases TG clearance | Effective for long-term control [^112D2rbM] [^117F1Bvi] |
| Omega-3 fatty acids | Reduces hepatic TG synthesis | Effective for long-term control [^112D2rbM] [^1164quHs] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Colesevelam is not appropriate for hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis because it can increase TG and worsen pancreatitis risk [^112VueQY]. It is contraindicated in patients with TG > 500 mg/dL [^11543kXU] or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. Use insulin infusion [^111M98mA], plasmapheresis [^114qEuhx], fibrates [^117F1Bvi], or omega-3 fatty acids [^112D2rbM] to rapidly lower TG and reduce pancreatitis risk.

### Medical management of hypertriglyceridemia in pancreatitis [^111M98mA]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) should be considered in all cases of acute pancreatitis, and triglyceride levels measured early so that appropriate early and long-term treatment can be initiated.

- **Recent findings**: In most cases of HTG-AP, conservative management (nothing by mouth, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and analgesia) is sufficient to achieve triglyceride levels less than 500 mg/dl. Intravenous insulin and plasmapheresis are sometimes used, although prospective studies showing clinical benefits are lacking. Pharmacological management of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) should start early and target triglyceride levels of less than 500 mg/dl to reduce the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. In addition to currently used fenofibrate and omega-3 fatty acids, several novel agents are being studied for long-term treatment of HTG. These emerging therapies focus mainly on modifying the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) through inhibition of apolipoprotein CIII and angiopoietin-like protein 3. Dietary modifications and avoidance of secondary factors that worsen triglyceride levels should also be pursued. In some cases of HTG-AP, genetic testing may help personalize management and improve outcomes.

Patients with HTG-AP require acute and long-term management of HTG, with the goal of reducing and maintaining triglyceride levels to less than 500 mg/dl.

### Therapeutic plasmapheresis for hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis: Case series and review of the literature [^114qEuhx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is the third leading cause of acute pancreatitis (AP) in the United States. The standard of care includes the management of HTG using pharmacological therapy. More recently, plasmapheresis has been proposed as a therapeutic tool for decreasing triglyceride (TG) levels, especially in critically ill patients. Few studies are available to ascertain the overall benefits of plasmapheresis over traditional management.

- **Objective**: To analyze the outcomes of patients treated with plasmapheresis for severe HTG-associated pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of three patients with severe HTG-associated (TGs greater than 1000 mg/dl; 11.29 mmol/l) AP at the Methodist University Hospital. All the patients underwent plasmapheresis as part of their treatment.

- **Results**: The average TG level before plasmapheresis was 3532 mg/dl (range: 2524–4562 mg/dl; 39.9 mmol/l; range: 28.5–51.6 mmol/l). All patients made a full recovery, with a significant improvement in TG levels after plasmapheresis. The mean number of sessions was 1.3 (range 1–2), and the mean TG level after plasmapheresis was 1051 mg/dl (range: 509–1771 mg/dl; 11.9 mmol/l; range: 5.8–20 mmol/l). After the first session, the average reduction of TG level was 2481 mg/dl (range 753–3750 mg/dl; 28 mmol/l; range: 8.5–42.4 mmol/l) or approximately 70%. None of the patients developed complications related to plasmapheresis.

- **Conclusions**: Plasmapheresis can be an effective and rapid treatment option in patients with severe HTG and complications. However, further research is warranted.

### Welchol [^11543kXU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis**: Welchol, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations, which potentially leads to acute pancreatitis. In trials involving patients with primary hyperlipidemia, Welchol showed effects on serum TG with a median increase of 5% compared to placebo. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels were observed when Welchol was used as monotherapy (median increase of 9.7% compared to placebo) and in combination with other medications such as pioglitazone (median increase of 11% compared to placebo), sulfonylureas (median increase of 18% compared to placebo), and insulin (median increase of 22% compared to placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- Obtain lipid parameters, including TG levels, before starting Welchol and periodically thereafter. Welchol is contraindicated in patients with TG levels greater than 500 mg/dL or those with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [see Contraindications (4)]. Patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL could experience more significant increases in serum TG levels while using Welchol and may require additional monitoring. Patients should be instructed to discontinue Welchol and seek prompt medical care if symptoms of acute pancreatitis, such as severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting, occur. Discontinue Welchol if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Gastrointestinal obstruction**: Postmarketing cases of bowel obstruction have occurred with Welchol [see Ad]

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^112VueQY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis**: Colesevelam hydrochloride, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis. In trials of patients with primary hyperlipidemia, colesevelam hydrochloride had effects on serum TG, with a median increase of 5% compared to placebo.

	- In trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels occurred when colesevelam hydrochloride was used as monotherapy (median increase of 9.7% compared to placebo), and in combination with pioglitazone (median increase of 11% compared to placebo), sulfonylureas (median increase of 18% compared to placebo), and insulin (median increase of 22% compared to placebo) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

	- Obtain lipid parameters, including TG levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride and periodically thereafter. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with TG levels greater than 500 mg/dL or in patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [see Contraindications (4)]. Patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL could have greater increases in serum TG levels with colesevelam hydrochloride and may require additional TG monitoring. Instruct patients to discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur (e.g. severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting). Discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride if TG levels…

### Severe hypertriglyceridemia-related pancreatitis: Characteristics and predictors of recurrence [^112kJz7X]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) as a cause for acute pancreatitis is often delayed, and there is limited data on the characteristics and predictors of recurrence in this population.

- **Methods**: A regional database of severe HTG, defined as a level of 1000 mg/dL or greater, was analyzed to identify subjects with acute pancreatitis. Factors associated with recurrence of pancreatitis during long-term follow-up were investigated.

- **Results**: Severe HTG-associated pancreatitis was evident in 171 patients, of whom 75% were diabetic. Recurrence of pancreatitis was observed in 16% of the patients. This recurrence was associated with younger age, alcohol abuse, and an increase in triglyceride levels. In multivariable analysis, a peak triglyceride level greater than 3000 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–6.64; P = 0.011) and the most recent triglyceride level greater than 500 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 3.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.60–8.66; P = 0.002) remained independently associated with recurrence. These lipid measures, as well as alcohol abuse, were additionally correlated with a stepwise increase in the number of pancreatitis episodes.

- **Conclusions**: Severe HTG-related pancreatitis was closely associated with diabetes. Extreme HTG and a failure to achieve lower triglyceride levels were independent long-term predictors of recurrence. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification and successful treatment of severe HTG and its underlying disorders to reduce the burden of recurrent pancreatitis.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114CWiLv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, email discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels, that mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, and that severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The Task Force recommends that the treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

### Triglyceride-lowering therapies in hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis in China: A multicentre prospective cohort study [^111AZiTg]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory process of the pancreas caused by various aetiologies, among which gallstones and alcohol abuse are the leading causes globally. Hypertriglyceridemia was reported as another common cause, accounting for 5.9% of cases in North America, according to a recent international cohort study. Notably, hypertriglyceridemia is often under-recognized as an aetiology in patients with acute pancreatitis when other etiological risk factors are present. In China, recent studies showed that hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) accounted for 14.3% to 23.9% of AP cases. Rapidly changing lifestyles and genetic variants might explain this phenomenon.

Previous studies demonstrated that, compared with other causes, patients with HTG-AP are more likely to experience severe disease courses and have an incidence of organ failure as high as more than 40%. However, in a recent study using data from an international registry, the results indicated that HTG-AP patients had similar outcomes compared to other aetiologies, with 42% of the HTG-AP patients experiencing moderately severe/severe AP. The severity of organ failure seems to depend partly on the intensity of the inflammatory response and partly on the injury caused by toxic fatty acids, a lipase-mediated decomposition product of triglycerides. Efforts have been made to reduce triglyceride levels to prevent or improve organ failure.

The optimal therapeutic target for plasma triglyceride level is unclear, although previous studies have suggested lowering plasma triglyceride levels for better outcomes.

### Colesevelam lowers glucose and lipid levels in type 2 diabetes: The clinical evidence [^116oMGej]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Mean changes in safety laboratory parameters and vital signs were similar in the treatment groups of each trial. Overall, colesevelam was found to be weight neutral when added to existing antidiabetes treatment, which is another important consideration for patients with T2DM.

Colesevelam can increase triglyceride levels in patients with T2DM. Caution is therefore recommended in patients with triglyceride levels > 300 mg/dl (> 3.4 mmol/l), and colesevelam is contraindicated in patients with triglyceride levels > 500 mg/dl (> 5.7 mmol/l) and in patients with a history of hypertriglyceridaemia-induced pancreatitis. Colesevelam has a high capacity for bile acid binding with a low potential for interfering with the absorption of other agents. However, patients taking levothyroxine, oral contraceptives, or glyburide should take these agents at least 4 hours before colesevelam to avoid any potential for impaired absorption. Use of colesevelam may also decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including A, D, and E.

The results of these trials are similar to those seen following the addition of thiazolidinediones to metformin or sulfonylurea therapy. Factors that may have influenced the efficacy of colesevelam in these trials (when compared with other agents) include the low mean baseline HbA1c and the fact that there was no 'washout' in the colesevelam studies. Currently, there are no data to show whether use of colesevelam reduces mortality or morbidity in patients with T2DM. Colesevelam is not approved for use in patients with type 1 diabetes and has not been studied in combination.

### Issues in hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: An update [^1111mKa6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a well-established but often underestimated cause of acute pancreatitis. The clinical presentation of HTG-induced pancreatitis (also known as HTG pancreatitis) is similar to pancreatitis caused by other factors. This condition is typically observed in conjunction with one or more secondary factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, alcoholism, certain medications, or pregnancy, in patients with a common genetic abnormality in lipoprotein metabolism, such as familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial HTG. Less commonly, it occurs in patients with rare genetic abnormalities, like familial chylomicronemia syndrome, with or without an additional secondary factor.

The risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with serum triglyceride levels greater than 1000 mg/dL and over 2000 mg/dL is approximately 5% and between 10% to 20%, respectively. It remains unclear whether HTG pancreatitis is more severe compared to other causes of pancreatitis. The clinical management of HTG pancreatitis aligns with that of other pancreatitis causes. In diabetic patients with HTG, insulin infusion can quickly reduce triglyceride levels. The use of apheresis remains experimental, and more rigorously designed studies are needed to determine its role in managing HTG pancreatitis. Adopting a diet, making lifestyle changes, and controlling secondary factors are critical to the treatment strategy. Medications serve as useful adjuncts in the long-term management of triglyceride levels. Achieving control of triglyceride levels to 500 mg/dL or lower can effectively prevent recurrences of pancreatitis.

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^115o9zo2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Colesevelam hydrochloride, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in colesevelam hydrochloride, is a non-absorbed, lipid-lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, impeding their reabsorption. As the bile acid pool becomes depleted, the hepatic enzyme cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase is upregulated, increasing the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells, resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, HMG-CoA reductase, and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors. These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL-C from the blood, leading to decreased serum LDL-C levels. Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged.

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**: The mechanism by which colesevelam hydrochloride improves glycemic control is unknown.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: A maximum therapeutic response to the lipid-lowering effects of colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long-term therapy. In the diabetes clinical studies, a therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride, as reflected by a reduction in HbA1c, was initially noted following 4–6 weeks of treatment and reached maximal or near-maximal effect after 12–18 weeks of treatment.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^116VBxuw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, specifically concerning the evaluation of the underlying cause, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining serum triglyceride and calcium levels in patients with acute pancreatitis who do not have gallstones or a significant history of alcohol use. It is important to recognize that serum triglyceride levels greater than 11.3 mmol/L (1,000 mg/dL) indicate it as the etiology.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pancreatitis, particularly in evaluating the underlying cause, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining serum triglycerides in patients without gallstones or a significant history of alcohol use. Hypertriglyceridemia should be suspected as the cause of pancreatitis if triglyceride levels are greater than 1,000 mg/dL.

### Effect of serum triglycerides on clinical outcomes in acute pancreatitis: Findings from a regional integrated health care system [^1128frL1]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of serum triglycerides on the development of multiple or persistent organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients hospitalized for acute pancreatitis between 2006 and 2013. Triglyceride levels measured before and within 72 hours of admission were compared. In addition, the effect of triglyceride levels on the development of multiple or persistent organ failure during hospitalization for acute pancreatitis was assessed.

- **Results**: Among 2519 patients, 267 patients (10.6%) developed organ failure, of which 75 patients developed multiple system organ failure, and 82 patients developed persistent organ failure. Triglyceride levels in patients who developed organ failure were initially much higher than in patients who did not develop organ failure, but by 72 hours into admission, approached levels of patients who did not develop organ failure. Approximately 8% of patients had triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg/dL, the majority of whom had similarly high levels before admission.

- **Conclusions**: Increased triglyceride levels were associated with the development of multiple or persistent organ failure among patients hospitalized with acute pancreatitis. Patients with high triglyceride levels at the time of admission were likely to have high triglyceride levels before admission.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^116abAyP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Despite the long-recognized relationship between lipids and inflammation, unraveling the pathogenesis underlying triglyceride variability and subclinical inflammation requires further investigation. Recent studies have reported an association between visit-to-visit lipid variability, including triglyceride variability, and NLR in patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes. Triglyceride variability could be attributed to fluctuations in dietary carbohydrates and fats, as well as incomplete or intermittent compliance with lifestyle measures or lipid-lowering therapy. There is growing evidence that directly links meal consumption with oxidative stress and inflammation. An acute increase in postprandial triglycerides has been shown to trigger an inflammatory response via triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants and their lysis products, resulting in the stimulation of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and oxidative stress. This leads to increased cardiometabolic risks in the long term.

High triglyceride variability may be a marker of individuals repeatedly experiencing triglyceride surges through excessive dietary fat intake or alcohol consumption, leading to acute pancreatitis via increased transportation of chylomicrons into pancreatic tissue, liberation of toxic free fatty acids, and ultimately inflammation and autodigestion in the pancreas. It may also be an epiphenomenon of other metabolic factors, such as diabetes and obesity, which may predispose individuals to develop acute pancreatitis if poorly controlled.

### Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis with plasma diafiltration: A pilot study [^116hqeqa]. Pancreas (2020). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) is a critical illness associated with a high mortality rate and potentially fatal complications, whereas triglyceride (TG)-lowering therapy is crucial in early HTG-AP. Plasmapheresis and other extracorporeal filtration techniques were widely used for the timely and fast reduction of TG levels. However, these are not ideal procedures due to potential transfusion-related complications or complex operations.

Plasma diafiltration (PDF), which uses a high cutoff hemofilter and diluted plasma as replacement fluid, can significantly decrease middle- and high-molecule-weight mediator levels with low substitution flow, achieving approximately the same effect as that of conventional plasmapheresis. However, no previous reports exist on the treatment of HTG-AP with PDF. Therefore, we designed a retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDF application in combination with routine treatments in five HTG-AP patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QpzEP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe disease that poses significant challenges to physicians, especially gastroenterologists and surgeons. It has an incidence of 4.6–100 per 100,000 persons in Europe. In the United States, the hospitalization rate for AP increased from 65.4 to 81.9 per 100,000 persons between 2001 and 2014. AP is a major health concern as it ranks as the fifth-leading cause of in-hospital fatalities and contributes significantly to hospitalization expenses. Hypertriglyceridemia ranks third among all known causes of AP, following excessive alcohol consumption and gallstone disease. Patients with elevated chylomicron levels often seek emergency care due to symptoms consistent with AP, including persistent abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Those with triglyceride concentrations exceeding 500–1000 mg/dL are at a significant risk of developing AP, while individuals with hyperchylomicronemia syndrome exhibit triglyceride levels exceeding 2000 mg/dL.

Currently, the initial conservative approach for managing AP involves pain control with opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. Insulin therapy has traditionally been the cornerstone of inpatient care and has been extensively studied. However, over the past few decades, plasmapheresis has emerged as an increasingly common therapeutic option for hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.

In AP patients with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin therapy, with or without heparin, and plasmapheresis have been proposed and employed as potential treatment strategies in selected cases.

### The association of hypertriglyceridemia with cardiovascular events and pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1174Mt4F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and documented an association between fasting hypertriglyceridemia and the risk of several cardiovascular adverse events and with pancreatitis.

- **Limitations, strengths, and comparison with other reports**: The main limitation of association studies is the observational nature of the existing evidence; therefore, confounders (particularly, baseline risk of patients for developing cardiovascular disease and the effect of other lipid subfractions abnormalities) threaten the validity of results. In meta-analyses of observational studies, the ability to adjust for confounding is limited by the level of adjustment conducted in the original studies. We attempted to evaluate confounding by conducting subgroup analysis; however, this analysis was underpowered. Other limitations pertain to heterogeneity of the meta-analytic estimates, publication bias (which remains likely in the context of observational studies that do not require prospective registration), and reporting bias (which is also likely considering that several studies met the eligibility criteria for this review but did not report the outcomes of interest). It was unclear in most studies if enrolled patients did not have some of the outcomes pre-existent at baseline, and it was also unclear if patients were treated with drugs that can affect TG level (both of these elements lower the confidence in the observed associations). We only found one controlled study that evaluated the association with acute pancreatitis.

### Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: Perspectives from China [^111ZMJC5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

HTG-AP exhibits a high recurrence rate, with up to 64.8% of patients experiencing relapse within one year, driven by persistently elevated triglyceride levels at discharge and during follow-up. Multivariable analysis identifies poor triglyceride control, a high comorbidity index (e.g. diabetes and hypertension), and inadequate follow-up care as independent risk factors, emphasizing the need for sustained lipid-lowering therapy and lifestyle modifications.

Recurrent pancreatitis also heightens the risk of postacute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PAPDM), with affected patients showing a significantly elevated incidence due to repeated pancreatic injury. Yang et al. reported that triglyceride levels exceeding 3.1 mmol/L one month post-discharge predict recurrence with an odds ratio of 10.3, surpassing US recurrence rates of 32% where alcohol-related factors often dominate. China's emphasis on metabolic management — integrating lipid-lowering agents like statins or fibrates with glycemic control via insulin or oral hypoglycemics — offers a distinct long-term approach, potentially more suited to its HTG-AP population than Western alcohol-centric models that prioritize abstinence and counseling.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^116rTgVc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The exact mechanism for how triglyceride variability contributes to the development of acute pancreatitis remains to be elucidated. In this study, subgroup analyses showed a more prominent association between triglyceride variability and the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with a higher NLR. Restricted cubic splines demonstrated that the HR for acute pancreatitis was linearly associated with both triglyceride variability and NLR on a continuous scale. We hypothesize that the risk of acute pancreatitis associated with increased triglyceride variability may be partly mediated by subclinical inflammation.

- **NLR significance**: NLR is the ratio between neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood. It reflects the balance of inflammation, as indicated by the neutrophil count, and adaptive immunity, as indicated by the lymphocyte count, in the immune system. NLR has been extensively evaluated for its prognostic value in a variety of clinical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and malignancies. Evidence has also shown that NLR is better than other inflammatory markers in predicting the severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis.

Our findings are complementary to the results of a large cohort study, in which mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (177–443 mg/dL or 2–5 mmol/L) was shown to be associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis, with a more pronounced association being observed in patients with higher C-reactive protein levels and leukocyte counts.

### Conservative management in hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis [^114iYFPt]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride > 10 mmol L⁻¹) is implicated in approximately 9% of acute pancreatitis cases. Certain guidelines list severe hypertriglyceridemia as an indication for plasmapheresis.

- **Objective**: We assembled the natural trajectory of triglyceride levels in patients with acute pancreatitis due to severe hypertriglyceridemia who were managed conservatively without plasmapheresis to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on 22 hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis episodes considered to be caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients were managed supportively, with cessation of oral intake (NPO) and intravenous hydration. Insulin infusion was used in 12 patients to manage concomitant hyperglycemia.

- **Results**: Triglyceride levels for the group were evaluated using a mixed-effects model. The average triglyceride level fell from 45.4 mmol L⁻¹ on presentation to 13.3 mmol L⁻¹ within 48 hours, corresponding to a mean 69.8% decrease. Regression analysis showed a triglyceride half-life of 30.6 hours. Findings were similar for NPO-only and insulin infusion subgroups.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis can be conservatively managed safely and effectively without plasmapheresis.

### Issues in hyperlipidemic pancreatitis [^113Zae37]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a rare cause of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis secondary to HTG typically presents as an episode of acute pancreatitis (AP) or recurrent acute pancreatitis (reAP) and rarely as chronic pancreatitis. A serum triglyceride (TG) level of more than 1,000 to 2,000 mg/dL in patients with type I, IV, or V hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson's classification) is an identifiable risk factor.

The typical clinical profile of hyperlipidemic pancreatitis (HLP) involves a patient with a preexisting lipid abnormality and a secondary factor (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes, alcohol use, or a medication) that can induce HTG. Less commonly, a patient with isolated hyperlipidemia (type V or I) without a precipitating factor presents with pancreatitis. Interestingly, serum pancreatic enzymes may be normal or only minimally elevated, even in the presence of severe pancreatitis diagnosed by imaging studies. The clinical course in HLP is not different from that of pancreatitis of other causes.

Routine management of AP caused by hyperlipidemia should be similar to that of other causes. A thorough family history of lipid abnormalities should be obtained, and an attempt to identify secondary causes should be made. Reduction of TG levels to well below 1,000 mg/dL effectively prevents further episodes of pancreatitis.

The mainstay of treatment includes dietary restriction of fat and lipid-lowering medications (mainly fibric acid derivatives). Experiences with plasmapheresis, lipid pheresis, and extracorporeal lipid elimination are limited.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^116Fza8T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, due to the observational nature of the study design, we cannot establish the causal relationship between triglyceride variability and the risk of acute pancreatitis. Triglyceride variability may merely be a predictor rather than a causal factor until it is assessed as a target for intervention. Although patients with prior pancreatitis were excluded, bias from reverse causality could not be completely eliminated. The study results were adjusted for multiple covariates, but residual or unmeasured confounding may have affected the results. Factors that may influence visit-to-visit triglyceride variability or have an impact on the risk of acute pancreatitis, such as dietary habits and the amount and duration of alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking, could not be captured in the CGRD.

Second, patients with hypertriglyceridemia-related acute pancreatitis are usually diagnosed in their 40s and often do not have annual triglyceride tests before the events. Our study design had inherent selection bias because the patients were older (mean age 62.4 years) and diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. Although efforts were made to ensure that the outcomes were more related to triglycerides than other causes, ascertainment bias may result from the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis using the unspecified ICD-9 code.

Third, the CGRD did not contain comprehensive data for severity stratification. We could not find a statistically significant association between triglyceride variability and mortality, a proxy for severe acute pancreatitis.

### Not every patient needs a triglyceride check, but all can get pancreatitis: A systematic review and clinical characterization of isotretinoin-associated pancreatitis [^115zWe2M]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Monitoring of triglycerides for patients on isotretinoin is primarily practiced to avoid hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to clinically describe the published cases of hypertriglyceride-associated pancreatitis. A comprehensive search strategy using MEDLINE, Embase, and grey literature was conducted (from 1960 to January 2016) to identify all case reports of isotretinoin-associated pancreatitis and all relevant studies of isotretinoin and triglycerides for any indication (≥ 20 patients). Terms related to isotretinoin, triglycerides, and pancreatitis were searched with all available synonyms. Any studies that used isotretinoin and mentioned triglycerides or pancreatitis were searched in full text, where available, for cases of pancreatitis. Studies from all countries and published in any language were included, but Korean and Turkish studies could not be analyzed. Two authors independently reviewed the publications to determine eligibility and for data extraction. In total, 125 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were searched for cases of pancreatitis. Eleven papers with 25 cases of pancreatitis associated with isotretinoin were identified; four of these cases were likely due to hypertriglyceridemia. Three patients had elevated baseline triglycerides but no monitoring. Pancreatitis occurred 6 and 7 weeks, and 6 months after initiation of therapy. For the fourth patient who was treated for glioblastoma and died, no detailed clinical information was available. Idiosyncratic pancreatitis associated with isotretinoin is the most frequent occurrence.

### Marked effects of novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α modulator, pemafibrate in severe hypertriglyceridemia: Preliminary report [^115z53sh]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). High credibility.

The treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia for the prevention of acute pancreatitis is a significant challenge in patients with triglyceride (TG) levels exceeding 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L). Episodes of relapsing acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis, as well as both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency in the future. However, no study at the time of writing has verified the efficacy of pemafibrate in these patients. The PROMINENT trial, currently ongoing worldwide, aims to evaluate the efficacy of pemafibrate in preventing cardiovascular events in high-risk diabetic patients, although the trial excludes patients with TGs greater than 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). The present report of three patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is the first-ever evidence that pemafibrate can dramatically reduce very high serum TG levels exceeding 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L).

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Vk3ZU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is another complication that was investigated in this study and compared between the two treatment groups. From the study analysis, patients from the plasma exchange therapy group had a higher chance of developing acute renal failure compared to patients managed by insulin ± heparin therapy. However, the difference was statistically insignificant and contradictory between the two studies. Therefore, a conclusive comparison cannot yet be established.

Taking into consideration cost-effectiveness, convenience of administration, and resource stewardship, insulin ± heparin therapy may be more favorable in the actual clinical context. Easier affordability with insulin ± heparin may further improve treatment rates for self-paying patients, leading to better follow-up rates. In addition, insulin ± heparin therapy involves a simpler setup than plasmapheresis, which requires costly equipment and greater operating and maintenance costs. Clinical decisions may also be influenced by the healthcare setting and the availability of resources until more clear research on the superiority of a specific therapy is established. Given the limited availability of plasmapheresis in rural areas, insulin ± heparin therapy will invariably be favored over plasmapheresis for the treatment of such patients. To gain a deeper understanding of this illness, more randomized trials are required to establish concrete evidence.

There were numerous findings in this review that pointed in opposite directions. The analytical results did not show any significant difference in favor of either therapy.

Icosapent ethyl capsules are an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^113QbBDt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Triglyceride variability and the risks of reoccurrence of acute pancreatitis and death following acute pancreatitis are detailed in Supplementary Table 2 (see Supplementary Digital Content 1). In the unadjusted model, high triglyceride variability index (VIM) was associated with an increased risk of reoccurrence of acute pancreatitis (P trend < 0.001). However, no significant association was observed between triglyceride VIM and the risk of death after acute pancreatitis, likely due to the low incidence of death in this cohort. Risk estimates were not adjusted for covariates because both outcomes were rare.

- **Subgroup analyses**: The results of subgroup analysis are illustrated in a forest plot (Figure 3). In general, triglyceride variability was positively associated with the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis across subgroups stratified by mean triglycerides, diabetes, obesity, use of statins or other lipid-lowering drugs, and WBC count. However, a significant interaction existed between NLR tertiles and the association between triglyceride variability and the risk of first acute pancreatitis. The impact of high triglyceride variability on first acute pancreatitis was more pronounced in patients in the middle and upper tertiles of NLR than in those in the lower tertile of NLR (P for interaction = 0.022). Restricted cubic splines were used to visualize the relationships between triglyceride variability (Figure 4a) or NLR (Figure 4b) and the risk of first acute pancreatitis.

### Lipid-modifying therapies and risk of pancreatitis: A meta-analysis [^115kWmqk]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Statin therapy has been associated with pancreatitis in observational studies. Although lipid guidelines recommend fibrate therapy to reduce pancreatitis risk in persons with hypertriglyceridemia, fibrates may lead to the development of gallstones, a risk factor for pancreatitis.

- **Objective**: To investigate associations between statin or fibrate therapy and incident pancreatitis in large randomized trials.

- **Data sources**: Relevant trials were identified in literature searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from January 1, 1994, for statin trials and January 1, 1972, for fibrate trials, through June 9, 2012. Published pancreatitis data were tabulated where available from six trials. Unpublished data were obtained from investigators for 22 trials.

- **Study selection**: We included randomized controlled cardiovascular endpoint trials investigating effects of statin therapy or fibrate therapy. Studies with more than 1000 participants followed up for more than 1 year were included.

- **Data extraction**: Trial-specific data described numbers of participants developing pancreatitis and change in triglyceride levels at 1 year. Trial-specific risk ratios (RRs) were calculated and combined using a random-effects model meta-analysis. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic.

Results from 16 placebo- and standard care-controlled statin trials with 113,800 participants were analyzed. Conducted over a weighted mean follow-up of 4.1 (SD, 1.5) years, 309 participants developed pancreatitis (134 assigned to statin, 175 assigned to control) with an RR of 0.77 [95% CI, 0.62–0.97; p = 0.03; I² = 0%].

### Diabetes dyslipidemia [^111BrDGM]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Most hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes is mild to moderate, and statins remain the drug of first choice even in patients with mixed dyslipidemias. However, in patients with genetic susceptibility, severe hypertriglyceridemia may develop, presenting an attendant risk of pancreatitis. When triglycerides are above 11 mmol/L, a fibrate should be considered first to reduce triglycerides and the risk of pancreatitis.

Purified omega-3 fatty acids can lower triglycerides as effectively as fibrates, though they have little impact on HDL or LDL cholesterol. Omacor® (Abbott Healthcare, Abbott Park, IL, USA) contains 90% omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (mostly eicosapentaenoate or docosahexaenoate) and, in combination with a statin, can decrease triglycerides by a further 30%, most likely by inhibiting hepatic triglyceride synthesis. Despite evidence that omega-3 fatty acids stabilize atheromatous plaques and reports of beneficial hypotensive and antithrombotic effects, a recent trial of omega-3 fatty acids in patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes disappointingly found no effect on CHD risk.

Another future therapeutic option may be the dual PPAR-α/γ agonist saroglitazar, which was approved in India in 2013 and has been shown to significantly reduce plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and fasting glucose levels.

### Effect of colesevelam on liver fat quantified by magnetic resonance in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a randomized controlled trial [^115Ckbkp]. Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by features of steatosis, hepatocellular injury, and parenchymal inflammation, with or without perisinusoidal fibrosis, on liver histology in individuals who consume little or no alcohol. A subset of patients with NASH may progress to develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for NASH.

Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant (BAS), interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and causes increased conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids. Colesevelam increases plasma glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels, which activates pancreatic β-cells to release insulin. One possible mechanism by which colesevelam causes increased GLP-1 is by moving the site of fat absorption to the ileum, where fat absorption by L cells causes GLP-1 release. This might explain the mechanism of action of colesevelam that may be responsible for improving glucose homeostasis. Furthermore, randomized controlled clinical trials have shown the efficacy of colesevelam in lowering plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels and improving glycemic control. Both increased plasma LDL cholesterol and insulin resistance are associated with NASH. Therefore, it is plausible that improvement in LDL cholesterol and glycemic control by colesevelam might improve NASH. We hypothesized that colesevelam would reduce hepatic fat content in patients with NASH by increased utilization of hepatic cholesterol.

### Acute pancreatitis: The role of imaging in diagnosis and management [^115vBRuV]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is one of the more commonly encountered aetiologies in the emergency setting, and its incidence is rising. Presentations range from a mild, self-limiting condition that usually responds to conservative management to one with significant morbidity and mortality in its most severe forms. While clinical criteria are necessary to make the initial diagnosis, contrast-enhanced CT is the mainstay of imaging and has a vital role in assessing the extent and evolution of the disease and its associated complications. The purpose of this article is to summarize the natural course of acute severe pancreatitis, clarify confusing nomenclature, demonstrate the morphological stages in conjunction with radiological scoring systems, and illustrate the complications. We review and illustrate the increasing and significant role interventional radiology has in the management of these patients, which is often life-saving and surgery-sparing.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113mRDtK]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Approach to the patient with hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis: HTG is an uncommon but important cause of pancreatitis, thought to underlie up to 10% to 14% of pancreatitis cases. Cohort studies suggest that HTG-associated pancreatitis may have greater morbidity and mortality compared with pancreatitis from other causes.

HTG-associated pancreatitis should generally be managed supportively and conservatively by withholding oral intake and administering IV fluids. The use of insulin infusions, heparin, or plasmapheresis has been proposed as modes of treatment designed to more rapidly lower triglycerides. However, there is a lack of definitive evidence to support any of these approaches as superior to conservative management. Although the degree of triglyceride elevation is correlated with pancreatitis severity, no evidence suggests that the course of pancreatitis will be altered if triglyceride levels are lowered more rapidly once an episode is triggered.

Furthermore, triglyceride levels will rapidly fall following cessation of oral intake, with a half-life of approximately 30 hours. Uncontrolled studies have failed to show benefit for plasmapheresis in terms of morbidity, mortality, or pancreatitis severity. Similarly, evidence of benefit in terms of outcomes for insulin infusions to treat HTG levels, in those without concurrent hyperglycemia, is lacking; this treatment would increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

For most patients, we recommend a conservative approach that consists of withholding oral intake, providing supportive IV fluids, and ensuring appropriate pain management.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151WHhz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of methodological quality was performed on the studies that satisfied the requirements for inclusion. The quality of every study was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment instrument. The EPHPP has been recommended for the assessment of the quality of public health interventions, particularly those that use experimental designs. Compared to the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias, the EPHPP has greater inter-rater reliability.

- **Assessment criteria**: Selection bias, confounders, study design, participant blinding, data collection methods, and withdrawals and dropouts were the six assessment criteria of a study's methodological quality. These were scored as either weak, moderate, or strong, to reach an overall quality rating, also graded as strong, moderate, or weak.

We assigned an overall score of "weak" when there were two or more "weak" ratings, "moderate" for a single "weak" rating, and "strong" when no "weak" ratings were present. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses typically involve publications that are already available on the internet and contain de-identified patient data. Consequently, Institutional Review Board approval has been waived in accordance with international publication standards.

### Severe hypertriglyceridemia in a subject with disturbed lifestyle and poor glycemic control without recurrence of acute pancreatitis: A case report [^112Hv5EQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Taken together, we should bear in mind that a disturbed lifestyle and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) lead to very severe hypertriglyceridemia. Total care for T2DM and hypertriglyceridemia is very important for the improvement of very severe hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, this case report suggests that very severe hypertriglyceridemia alone does not necessarily trigger acute pancreatitis. Although, needless to say, it is crucial to check pancreatitis markers in such situations.

### Severe hypertriglyceridemia in a subject with disturbed lifestyle and poor glycemic control without recurrence of acute pancreatitis: a case report [^111TuSRS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is often observed as a result of lipid abnormality and is frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic disorders. Various conditions cause the aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia. However, severe hypertriglyceridemia is usually induced by the addition of secondary clinical conditions such as uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity with insulin resistance.

- **Case presentation**: A 40-year-old man with a 4-year history of dyslipidemia and T2DM visited after interrupting therapy for about 1.5 years. His past history included acute pancreatitis. His lifestyle was markedly disturbed, and he had many risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia. Surprisingly, his serum triglyceride level was as high as 16,900 mg/dL. The aggravation and remission of his hypertriglyceridemia were closely associated with alterations in RLP-cholesterol levels in dyslipidemia and glycoalbumin and ketone body levels in T2DM.

- **Conclusion**: We report very severe hypertriglyceridemia, seemingly caused by a markedly disturbed lifestyle and poorly controlled T2DM. Comprehensive therapy with diet and drugs for each disease is crucial for the improvement of very severe hypertriglyceridemia. This case report suggests that very severe hypertriglyceridemia alone does not necessarily result in acute pancreatitis. However, it is essential to monitor pancreatitis markers in such situations.

Patients should be informed that colesevelam hydrochloride tablets may increase their serum triglycerides, potentially leading to hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis. It is crucial for patients to discontinue the tablets and seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur, such as severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In relation to gastrointestinal issues, patients should be made aware that colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can cause bowel obstruction. They should promptly stop taking the tablets and seek medical attention if they experience severe abdominal pain or severe constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Drug and vitamin interactions**: Patients should be advised that colesevelam hydrochloride tablets may interact with other drugs, potentially decreasing the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients are instructed to take oral vitamins at least 4 hours before colesevelam hydrochloride tablets. They should also inform their physician about all prescribed medications and over-the-counter drugs and vitamins they are taking [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Patients should also be informed that colesevelam hydrochloride tablets may increase serum triglycerides. The long-term effect of hypertriglyceridemia on the risk of coronary artery disease remains uncertain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113T4DiD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

All the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy of insulin ± heparin versus plasma exchange in the reduction of triglyceride levels among patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). From the analysis, there was no statistical difference between insulin ± heparin and plasma exchange in reducing triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of safety between the two treatment options, indicating non-inferiority in terms of safety profile as well as the reduction in triglyceride levels. More studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.

- **What is already known**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a significant medical challenge with a rising incidence and substantial healthcare costs. Hypertriglyceridemia is a leading cause of AP, but optimal treatment strategies remain debatable. Insulin ± heparin therapy and plasmapheresis have been proposed as potential treatments, but limited literature exists on their comparative effectiveness and safety.

- **What the new findings are**: This systematic review and meta-analysis found insulin ± heparin therapy and plasmapheresis in AP to be equally effective in reducing triglyceride levels in AP patients. Considering cost-effectiveness, convenience, and resource availability, insulin ± heparin therapy may be preferred in clinical practice, especially in resource-limited settings for AP.

### Body mass index, triglycerides, and risk of acute pancreatitis: A population-based study of 118 000 individuals [^1113KBYg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis is rising worldwide, and currently, no curative treatment exists. Clarification of preventable risk factors is important for reducing morbidity and mortality from acute pancreatitis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the risk of acute pancreatitis associated with body mass index (BMI) is partly mediated through elevated triglycerides.

We included 118,085 individuals from two prospective cohort studies: the Copenhagen City Heart Study and the Copenhagen General Population Study, with BMI measured at baseline. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was assessed from the national Danish registries as hospitalization or death due to acute pancreatitis.

Higher BMI was associated with higher risk of acute pancreatitis: multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1–1.8) for BMI of 25–29.9, 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6–2.9) for BMI of 30–34.9, and 2.8 (95% CI, 1.8–4.3) for BMI > 35, compared with individuals with a BMI of 18.5–24.9. Triglycerides mediated 29% (95% CI, 12%-46%; P = 0.001) of the association between BMI and risk of acute pancreatitis in the age- and sex-adjusted model and 22% (95% CI, 6%-39%; P = 0.008) in the multivariable-adjusted model.

Higher BMI is associated with a higher risk of acute pancreatitis in individuals from the general population, partly mediated through higher triglycerides. This indicates potential for preventing acute pancreatitis by reducing BMI and triglycerides in individuals with high values.

### Hypertriglyceridemia-associated drug-induced acute pancreatitis [^111h3fqk]. Pancreas (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of our study was to investigate the cases of drug-induced acute pancreatitis (DIAP) with hypertriglyceridemia as the mechanism of injury.

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search (1963–2018) of the English language literature was performed, looking for all human case reports of adults (> 18 years old) with hypertriglyceridemia as the mechanism of DIAP. The latest search date was February 28, 2018. Drugs were classified into probability groups based on a classification used by Badalov et al. (Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2007;5:648–661).

- **Results**: The search revealed a total of 76 cases in 59 published reports. A total of 25 medications were found to be implicated in DIAP secondary to hypertriglyceridemia mechanism. Most cases of acute pancreatitis were mild or moderately severe with favorable outcomes. In 3 cases involving tamoxifen, pagaspargase, and quetiapine, patient death was the outcome. Plasmapheresis was used in only 9 cases to decrease triglyceride levels.

- **Conclusions**: Hypertriglyceridemia-associated DIAP is a rare phenomenon. The systematic review provides a summary of drugs that have been implicated in this phenomenon, which allows physicians to be aware of this adverse effect when these drugs are used.

### Severe hypertriglyceridemia in a subject with disturbed lifestyle and poor glycemic control without recurrence of acute pancreatitis: A case report [^1176oUV4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is often observed as a result of lipid abnormality and is frequently associated with other lipid and metabolic disorders. Aggravation of hypertriglyceridemia is caused by various conditions; however, severe hypertriglyceridemia is usually induced by the addition of some secondary clinical conditions such as uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity with insulin resistance.

- **Case presentation**: A 40-year-old man with a 4-year history of dyslipidemia and T2DM visited after his interruption of therapy for about 1.5 years. His past history included acute pancreatitis. His lifestyle was markedly disturbed, and he had numerous risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia. Surprisingly, his serum triglyceride level was as high as 16,900 mg/dL. The aggravation and remission of his hypertriglyceridemia were closely associated with the alteration of RLP-cholesterol levels in dyslipidemia and glycoalbumin and ketone body levels in T2DM.

- **Conclusion**: We report very severe hypertriglyceridemia, which seemed to be caused by a markedly disturbed lifestyle and poorly controlled T2DM. Total therapy with diet and drugs for each disease is very important for the improvement of very severe hypertriglyceridemia. This case report suggests that very severe hypertriglyceridemia alone does not necessarily lead to acute pancreatitis, although it is crucial to check pancreatitis markers in such situations.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: Common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders.

Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity.

Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is important to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years).

Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglycerides.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^112BaquM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as serum triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L), is a common clinical problem, with a prevalence of 25%–30% in the adult population in developed countries. It is associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular disease and acute pancreatitis. The pathogenetic link between hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is thought to be triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, which are converted to remnant particles and contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaques.

However, the mechanism behind hypertriglyceridemia-related acute pancreatitis is less clear. A widely accepted theory involves the hydrolysis of triglycerides by pancreatic lipase and excessive formation of toxic free fatty acids, resulting in acinar cell and pancreatic capillary injury. Another hypothesis is chylomicronemia-induced hyperviscosity in pancreatic capillaries, leading to subsequent ischemia, tissue necrosis, and inflammation in the pancreas.

The risk of acute pancreatitis has been shown to increase progressively with serum triglycerides > 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L). Cohort studies have estimated that only 5% of patients with serum triglycerides > 1,000 and 10%–20% of patients with serum triglycerides > 2,000 mg/dL develop acute pancreatitis, suggesting that the risk of developing pancreatitis is not uniform in relation to hypertriglyceridemia. The severity and complication rates of hypertriglyceridemia-related acute pancreatitis are generally higher than for other types of acute pancreatitis.

### Management of hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis in the acute setting and review of literature [^111DK2KE]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially life-threatening complication of severe hypertriglyceridaemia, which is the third most common cause of AP after gallstone disease and alcohol excess. Standard therapy involves the use of lipid-lowering agents, low-molecular-weight heparin, and insulin infusion. In some cases, when standard medical therapies fail, non-pharmacological methods based on the removal of triglycerides with therapeutic plasma exchange can provide positive results in the acute phase. There are currently no guidelines covering management in the acute phase; however, these approaches should be considered in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old man with recurrent AP due to hypertriglyceridaemia and review the literature.

### Myalept [^116awEnv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

When discontinuing MYALEPT therapy in patients with risk factors for pancreatitis, such as a history of pancreatitis or severe hypertriglyceridemia, tapering of the dose over a one-week period is recommended. During tapering, it is important to monitor triglyceride levels and consider initiating or adjusting the dose of lipid-lowering medications as needed. Signs and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis should prompt an appropriate clinical evaluation.

### Hypertriglyceridaemia-induced pancreatitis [^114bB8XB]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridaemia is the third most common cause of acute pancreatitis but is relatively rare and therefore requires a high level of clinical suspicion to be diagnosed. We discuss the case of a 46-year-old man who initially presented to the accident and emergency department with suspected first presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and a normal amylase but who did not respond to DKA treatment. Further history revealed significant cardiovascular risk factors, examination showed evidence of hyperlipidaemia, and investigations revealed acute pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridaemia. We discuss the causes of hypertriglyceridaemia, the difficulty in differentiating primary versus secondary hypertriglyceridaemia, possible pathogenesis, and evidence-based treatments.

### Colesevelam hydrochloride [^111m2uqk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**:

	**Tablets**: Take 6 tablets once daily or 3 tablets twice daily with a meal and liquid.

- **Testing prior to initiation of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets**: Obtain lipid parameters, including triglyceride (TG) levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride tablets. Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with TG levels > 500 mg/dL [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Recommended dosage in primary hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus**: The recommended dosage of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets for adults and for boys and postmenarchal girls aged 10 to 17 years with primary hyperlipidemia is 3.75 grams daily. The recommended dosage of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus is 3.75 grams daily. Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets should be taken as follows:

	**Tablets**: Take 6 tablets once daily or 3 tablets twice daily. Due to tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension is recommended for use in the pediatric population.

- **Important dosing information for primary hyperlipidemia**: Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can be dosed at the same time as a statin, or colesevelam hydrochloride tablets and the statin can be dosed apart. Monitor lipid levels within 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of colesevelam hydrochloride tablets.

- **Administration instructions**:

	**Tablets**: Take colesevelam hydrochloride tablets with a meal and liquid. For patients with difficulty swallowing tablets, use colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension.

### Elevated serum triglyceride levels in acute pancreatitis: A parameter to be measured and considered early [^115UakSf]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: A prospective single-cohort observational study of adult patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP) in a third-level referral center was designed to evaluate the role of elevated levels of triglycerides (TG) in AP patients.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients aged 18 years or older with AP were included according to the definitions of Atlanta 2012. The diagnosis of AP requires two out of the following three features: (1) typical abdominal pain, (2) serum amylase or lipase more than three times the normal values, and (3) contrast computed tomography (CT) with radiological findings suggestive of pancreatitis. When CT was not performed, pancreatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and abdominal ultrasound (US) with signs of pancreatitis were admitted. Patients underwent the measurement of TG levels in the first 24 hours of admission.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients with AP whose etiology was hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) syndrome, patients with another major disease coexisting with AP (such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding that required an invasive endoscopic, radiological, or surgical procedure or that involved duodenal perforation or perforation of the bile duct), patients with another pathology not related to AP (such as periampullary neoplasia or neoplasia of the proximal or middle third of the biliary tract, or serious infectious pathology), transferred patients, and patients who arrived at the emergency department more than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms were excluded.

These inclusion and exclusion criteria reduce the bias of including patients with prolonged disease and avoid alterations in TG values that can occur after 4 hours.

### Prevention and management of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis during pregnancy: A systematic review [^115dVw4G]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Severe gestational hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis, with a maternal mortality rate of approximately 20%. The recent National Lipid Association part 2 expert panel recommendations provide guidance on monitoring pregnant women at high risk for hyperlipidemia.

We suggest that high-risk women have triglyceride levels checked once every trimester. Fasting triglycerides greater than 250 mg/dL should prompt monthly triglyceride levels, screening for gestational diabetes, and implementing a strict low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, and exercise.

Fasting triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dL, despite strict dietary and lifestyle modifications, should prompt treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and continuation of a fat-restricted diet. In pregnant women with clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg/dL despite maximal lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapy, these interventions become critically important.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^115ffuJi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

To avoid confounding and to better delineate the association between triglyceride variability and acute pancreatitis, patients with concomitant gallstones or alcoholism — two major causes of acute pancreatitis — were excluded from this study. To minimize the possible effects of reverse causality, that is, acute pancreatitis leading to high triglyceride variability, we also excluded those with a history of pancreatitis or incident acute pancreatitis in the run-in period. We found that visit-to-visit triglyceride VIM was independently associated with the first attack of acute pancreatitis, even after adjusting for multiple comorbidities, the use of medications including lipid-lowering therapy, and a wide range of laboratory data, including baseline triglycerides on the index date and mean triglycerides during the run-in period.

There is currently no consensus on a gold-standard approach to measure visit-to-visit variability in cardiovascular risk factors. VIM is a commonly used measurement of variability in cardiovascular risk factors that has no correlation with the mean levels over visits. Other measurements, such as average real variability and SD, are partially dependent on the overall level of a variable and the change in its mean levels over time. It would be difficult to distinguish variability of a variable from systemic changes in its level over time, and this issue may not be resolved by adjusting for the mean level of the variable over visits. In this study, the association between triglyceride VIM and the risk of the first attack of acute pancreatitis remained robust after adjusting for these factors.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^114Eaj2U]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In this retrospective multi-institutional study of 98,819 patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, visit-to-visit triglyceride variability was independently associated with the risk of the first attack of acute pancreatitis. Our study adds new significance regarding triglyceride management and primary prevention of acute pancreatitis — namely, not only casual triglyceride concentration but also visit-to-visit triglyceride variability impacts the occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also found that the association between triglyceride variability and the risk of acute pancreatitis was more prominent among patients with a higher NLR, suggesting that subclinical inflammation may be involved in the mechanistic link between triglyceride variability and acute pancreatitis.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that visit-to-visit triglyceride variability, independent of the absolute values, is a predictive factor for acute pancreatitis. Triglyceride variability may serve as an additional component in the recently proposed holistic prevention of pancreatitis (HPP) framework, which comprehensively integrates primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce the burden of pancreatitis and its sequelae. The HPP framework includes education of the general population and individuals with prior pancreatitis attacks, effective in-hospital management of acute pancreatitis, and screening for high-risk patients. Furthermore, the use of electronic health records has been recognized to facilitate risk assessment and subsequent interventions.

### High triglyceride variability increases the risk of first attack of acute pancreatitis [^1133hLRt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In this retrospective multi-institutional cohort study, high triglyceride variability was associated with an increased risk of the first attack of acute pancreatitis, independent of baseline and mean triglyceride levels. The association between triglyceride variability and acute pancreatitis may be partly mediated by subclinical inflammation.

### Role of therapeutic plasma exchange in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia: an experience [^116gsMgw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes mellitus, is highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a rare but well-known cause of acute pancreatitis. In treatment, pancreatic rest, lifestyle changes, and lipid-lowering medications are essential, but the response is slow. Recently, the role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been emphasized for fast and effective management, in addition to insulin and heparin infusion. TPE for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis resulted in drastic improvements in clinical and laboratory findings and patient outcomes, as suggested in our cases. However, this procedure is limited due to its high cost and availability only in specialized hospitals.

### Triglyceride-lowering therapies in hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis in China: a multicentre prospective cohort study [^111b9soB]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, triglyceride-lowering therapies vary greatly among centers in the management of hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP). More rapid triglyceride decline was not associated with improving the incidence and duration of organ failure in HTG-AP patients, but may be associated with more intensive care unit requirements. In light of our results, pursuing rapid triglyceride (TG) decline with aggressive TG-lowering therapies may be ineffective and bear unnecessary risks, though a confirmatory trial is needed before formal recommendations can be made.
