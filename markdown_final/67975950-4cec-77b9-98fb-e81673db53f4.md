## Question

If one has new mul; tifocal ground glass opacities on a CYT lung looking for nodules, what type of CT should be ordered in f/u? high resolution?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what type of CT should be ordered for follow-up of new multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) detected on a chest CT, and whether high-resolution CT (HRCT) is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether these GGOs are likely subsolid nodules versus an interstitial process. Then, I should verify guideline-based follow-up intervals and CT protocols for subsolid nodules. Next, I will consider when HRCT is actually indicated, including interstitial lung disease or infection. After that, I should review radiation considerations and whether low-dose CT suffices. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. New multifocal GGOs can represent subsolid pulmonary nodules (pure GGOs or part-solid nodules), which are often early adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions, or they can reflect an interstitial process, infection, hemorrhage, or other non-neoplastic entities, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these scenarios before choosing the protocol [^1112ZE9d] [^1117Nox9].

> Next, I should review guideline-based management for subsolid nodules. The NCCN recommends that for multiple subsolid nodules, if they are less than 6 mm, repeat CT in 3–6 months is reasonable, and if they are 6 mm or larger, repeat CT at 3–6 months with subsequent management based on the most suspicious nodule. Importantly, they do not mandate HRCT for routine follow-up of subsolid nodules, and low-dose non-contrast CT is generally preferred unless contrast is needed for better diagnostic resolution, which is uncommon for subsolid nodules [^116sSzWb] [^114ByznR].

> Wait, let me verify the role of HRCT here. HRCT is optimized for thin slices and interstitial detail, and it is not the standard for routine surveillance of subsolid nodules; instead, it is reserved for specific indications such as suspected interstitial lung disease, certain infections, or when detailed parenchymal characterization is required, so ordering HRCT for routine GGO follow-up would be inappropriate unless one of those indications is present [^116unkz5] [^1117Nox9].

> I will now examine radiation and protocol considerations. Low-dose, non-contrast chest CT is the preferred modality for nodule surveillance because it balances diagnostic yield with dose minimization; HRCT typically uses higher dose and thinner slices, which are unnecessary for routine GGO surveillance and would increase cumulative exposure without added benefit in this context [^116sSzWb] [^116unkz5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought HRCT might be better to "better characterize" GGOs, but that would be misleading for surveillance; HRCT does improve spatial resolution, yet for subsolid nodule follow-up, standard low-dose CT already provides adequate measurement fidelity for growth assessment and solid-component evaluation, and HRCT should be reserved for alternate diagnoses or problem-solving, not routine surveillance [^116unkz5] [^114ByznR].

> Let me consider the interstitial lung disease angle. If the GGOs are accompanied by reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing, or are otherwise suspicious for interstitial lung abnormalities or fibrosis, then HRCT is appropriate to define pattern and extent; in that scenario, follow-up intervals of 2–3 years are suggested after baseline, with earlier follow-up if progression is suspected, which is a different clinical pathway than subsolid nodule surveillance [^1117Nox9] [^1124qUUo].

> Next, I should review practical follow-up cadence. For new multifocal subsolid nodules, a 3–6 month low-dose CT is reasonable to confirm persistence and assess evolution; if stable, extending intervals to every 6–12 months and then annually is acceptable, with escalation if a solid component emerges or grows, aligning with NCCN and contemporary surveillance cohorts that show slow growth and excellent outcomes with active surveillance in carefully selected patients [^114ByznR] [^1131yTKy] [^116zJxym].

> I need to ensure documentation and measurement consistency. Reports should specify nodule count, sizes, solid components, and use standardized windows and measurements; thin-slice reconstructions can be generated from volumetric data without switching to a separate HRCT protocol, and consistent technique across studies improves comparability and reduces variability in growth assessment [^116unkz5] [^114YRWj7].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is: for follow-up of new multifocal GGOs that are presumed subsolid nodules, order a low-dose, non-contrast chest CT with thin-slice acquisition and multiplanar reconstructions. Reserve HRCT only if there is suspicion for interstitial lung disease, infection, or another parenchymal process that requires high-resolution characterization, and avoid routine HRCT for surveillance because it adds radiation without improving management decisions in this setting [^114ByznR] [^116sSzWb] [^116unkz5].

---

For new multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) on a chest CT, **low-dose, non-contrast CT** is the appropriate follow-up study [^116sSzWb] to assess stability or progression, with **thin slices (≤ 1 mm)** and **standard lung windows** for optimal visualization [^116unkz5]. High-resolution CT (HRCT) is not routinely indicated for GGO follow-up because it increases radiation without added clinical benefit; reserve HRCT for suspected interstitial lung disease or when detailed parenchymal characterization is needed [^116unkz5] [^1117Nox9]. Follow intervals depend on nodule size and risk: typically 3–6 months for new GGOs, then extend if stable [^114ByznR].

---

## Recommended CT protocol for follow-up

### General principles

- **Low-dose CT**: Preferred for follow-up to minimize radiation exposure [^116sSzWb] [^114gX4JJ].
- **Non-contrast**: Contrast is not routinely needed for GGO evaluation unless there is a specific indication (e.g. suspected infection, inflammation, or vascular anomaly) [^116sSzWb].
- **Thin slices**: ≤ 1 mm collimation with overlapping reconstructions to optimize spatial resolution and nodule assessment [^116unkz5].
- **Standard lung windows**: Window width 1,500–2,000 HU, level -500 to -700 HU to best visualize GGOs and their margins [^116unkz5].

---

### Specific technical parameters

| **Parameter** | **Recommended setting** |
|-|-|
| Tube voltage | 100–120 kVp (adjust to patient size) |
| Tube current | As low as diagnostically acceptable (typically 20–50 mAs) |
| Slice thickness | ≤ 1 mm |
| Reconstruction interval | 0.5–0.7 mm (overlapping) |
| Field of view | Adjusted to patient size |
| Breath-hold | Full inspiration to maximize lung inflation and nodule visibility |

---

## Role of high-resolution CT (HRCT)

HRCT is **not routinely indicated** for GGO follow-up because it increases radiation exposure without providing additional clinically relevant information. HRCT is reserved for specific scenarios, such as:

- **Suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD)**: When GGOs are associated with reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing [^1117Nox9].
- **Detailed parenchymal characterization**: When precise assessment of interlobular septa, bronchioles, or vascular structures is required [^116unkz5].
- **Preoperative planning**: In select cases where detailed anatomical mapping is necessary.

---

## Clinical guidelines for follow-up intervals

Follow-up intervals depend on **nodule size, risk factors, and clinical context**:

| **Nodule size** | **Recommended follow-up interval** |
|-|-|
| < 6 mm | CT at 6–12 months; if stable, extend to every 2 years for 5 years [^114ByznR] |
| 6–10 mm | CT at 3–6 months; if stable, annual CT for 5 years [^114ByznR] |
| > 10 mm or suspicious features | CT at 3 months; consider PET-CT or biopsy if progression or solid component develops [^114ByznR] [^114E9FwN] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting low-dose CT follow-up

Recent studies and guidelines emphasize the **safety and efficacy** of low-dose CT for GGO surveillance:

- **Low radiation exposure**: Significantly reduces cumulative radiation compared to standard-dose CT [^116sSzWb].
- **Adequate diagnostic quality**: Thin-slice low-dose CT provides sufficient spatial resolution for accurate nodule assessment and growth evaluation [^116unkz5].
- **Clinical outcomes**: Active surveillance with low-dose CT has been shown to be safe, with low progression rates and excellent long-term outcomes in patients with multifocal GGOs [^1131yTKy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial follow-up**: Low-dose, non-contrast CT with thin slices (≤ 1 mm) and standard lung windows [^116sSzWb] [^116unkz5].
- **Routine follow-up**: Continue with low-dose CT at intervals based on nodule size and risk factors [^114ByznR].
- **Reserve HRCT**: For suspected interstitial lung disease or when detailed parenchymal characterization is required [^1117Nox9].

---

Low-dose, non-contrast CT with thin slices is the **preferred modality** for follow-up of new multifocal GGOs, balancing diagnostic accuracy with radiation safety. HRCT is reserved for specific indications, and follow-up intervals should be individualized based on nodule characteristics and patient risk factors.

### Active surveillance of multifocal ground-glass opacities: results of a prospective multicenter trial (ECTOP1021) [^1131yTKy]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study aimed to evaluate the safety of active surveillance and establish an individualized management approach for multifocal ground-glass opacities (GGOs).

Methods

This prospective multicenter trial (ECTOP1021, NCT06097910) enrolled patients with ≥ 3 GGOs (tumor diameter ≤ 2 cm, consolidation-to-tumor ratio [CTR] ≤ 0.25). The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival; secondary endpoints included lesion progression. The surgical curative time window was defined as tumor diameter ≤ 2.0 cm and CTR ≤ 0.25, a safe radiologic profile during which patients could achieve definite cure after resection.

Results

A total of 406 patients were recruited from five centers. The cohort consisted predominantly of females (75.6%) and never smokers (87.2%), with a median age of 53 years. In total, 1,496 lesions were under surveillance, with a median of three GGOs per patient. The median diameter of the dominant lesion was 0.8 cm. At a median follow-up of 35.4 months, the 5-year overall survival was 100%. Progression occurred in 8.1% of patients, while 1.5% developed new lesions. The median increase in tumor diameter was 0.3 cm. Eight patients underwent surgery after enrollment, all pathologic stage IA1; four had invasive adenocarcinoma and four had minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. Patients were categorized into three groups based on estimated lung function loss if complete resection, with tailored strategies accordingly.

Conclusions

Active surveillance within the surgical curative time window appears to be safe and feasible for patients with multifocal GGOs in the short term. It offers an alternative to immediate surgery and rationalized individualized, scenario-based management strategies.

NCCN non-small cell lung cancer incidental subsolid nodule(s) on chest CT follow-up is organized by nodule type and size: Solitary pure ground-glass nodules < 6 mm have no routine follow-up, while for solitary pure ground-glass nodules ≥ 6 mm, CT at 6–12 mo to confirm no growth or development of a solid component, then CT every 2 y until 5 y. Solitary part-solid nodules < 6 mm have no routine follow-up, and for solitary part-solid nodules ≥ 6 mm, CT at 3–6 mo to confirm no growth or change in solid component, then annual CT for 5 y; if solid component ≥ 6 mm, consider FDG-PET/CTi or biopsyj. For multiple subsolid nodules < 6 mm, CT at 3–6 mo and, if stable, consider CT at 2 and 4 y; for multiple subsolid nodules ≥ 6 mm, CT at 3–6 mo with subsequent management based on most suspicious nodule(s). All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Subsolid pulmonary nodules — definitions, pathology, and prognosis: Subsolid nodules include nonsolid nodules also known as ground-glass opacities or ground-glass nodules and part-solid nodules that contain both ground-glass and solid components. Nonsolid nodules are mainly adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma; patients have 5-year disease-free survival of 100% if these nonsolid nodules are completely resected. Data suggest that many nonsolid nodules discovered incidentally on CT imaging will resolve and many of those that persist may not progress to clinically significant cancer, whereas solid and part-solid nodules are more likely to be invasive, faster-growing cancers with increased suspicion and follow-up.

### Initial patient characteristics of thoracic surgical oncology group 102: a multicenter prospective registry of active surveillance in patients with multiple ground-glass opacities [^116zJxym]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Presentation with multiple ground-glass opacities (GGOs) is an increasingly common occurrence, and the optimal management of these lesions is unclear. Active surveillance has been increasingly adopted as a management strategy for other low-grade malignancies. We hypothesized that active surveillance could be a feasible and safe option for patients with multiple GGOs.

Methods

Patients with ≥ 2 GGOs (ground-glass predominant, < 50% solid, ≤ 3 cm) were enrolled in a multi-institutional registry and prospectively followed up on active surveillance with computed tomography scans every 6 to 12 months. Each GGO was catalogued and measured individually at each follow-up visit.

Results

Target accrual was met, with 337 patients from 23 institutions. The mean age was 70 years (interquartile range, 65–77 years), and 74% were women. Most were former (70%) or current (9%) smokers, with a mean exposure of 30 pack-years (interquartile range [IQR], 15–44 pack-years). One half of the patients (51%) had a previous lung cancer, and the majority (86%) were already under surveillance at the time of study entry. The median number of GGOs per patient was 3 (IQR, 2–5), with a total of 1467 GGOs under surveillance. The median GGO size was 0.9 cm (IQR, 0.7–1.3 cm). Most GGOs were 0.5 to 1 cm in size.

Conclusions

Active surveillance, rather than immediate intervention, was an acceptable option to patients, and accrual to this registry trial was feasible. Safety end points and long-term outcomes will be assessed in the planned 5-year follow-up in accordance with the protocol.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^1124qUUo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up Assessment

11 We suggest that patients with ILAs undergo a follow-up chest CT scan 2–3 years after the baseline chest CT scan. Remarks: Earlier follow-up (12 mo) may be appropriate in some clinical contexts. The frequency of subsequent follow-up chest CT scans depends on multiple factors, including evidence of progression of the ILA on the initial follow-up chest CT scan. Vote: Approved by 34 of 36 (94%).

There is increasing interest in identifying early stages of ILD and pulmonary fibrosis, with the hope that these efforts will result in improved outcomes for patients with ILD. The term "ILA" was originally coined to describe chest CT imaging abnormalities suggestive of an underlying ILD in a person without a clinical diagnosis. In a position paper from the Fleischner Society, ILAs were defined as incidentally identified nondependent abnormalities, including ground-glass or reticular abnormalities, lung distortion, traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing, and nonemphysematous cysts involving ≥ 5% of a lung zone. The primary objective of this document is to present an updated evidence-based review of the literature on ILA, to update its definition, and to provide expert opinion-based recommendations for its evaluation. A secondary objective is to propose criteria for distinguishing ILAs from more advanced abnormalities that are considered to represent ILD.

### Diameter thresholds for pure ground-glass pulmonary nodules at low-dose CT screening: Chinese experience [^114EYMGq]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, elevating the diameter threshold for positive results from 5 mm to 8 mm can significantly enhance specificity and PPV for lung cancer detection, while only modestly diminishing sensitivity. Furthermore, this adjustment has the potential to substantially reduce the necessity for unnecessary follow-up LDCT scans, with only a marginal escalation in the likelihood of delayed lung cancer diagnoses. By refining these criteria, the study endeavours to enhance the accuracy of clinical guidelines for early detection of pGGNs in the Chinese demographic, potentially alleviating the burden on healthcare resources.

Findings In this diagnostic study that analyzed 620 patients from 4 Chinese institutions, the diagnostic accuracy for pathologic invasive adenocarcinoma was 83.

0%; diagnostic sensitivity was
82. 4%, and diagnostic specificity was 83. 3%. Meaning These results suggest that radiologic analysis showed good performance in identifying pathologic tumor invasion for ground-glass opacity–featured lung adenocarcinoma. Importance It is currently unclear whether high-resolution computed tomography can preoperatively identify pathologic tumor invasion for ground-glass opacity lung adenocarcinoma. Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic value of high-resolution computed tomography for identifying pathologic tumor invasion for ground-glass opacity featured lung tumors. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective, multicenter diagnostic study enrolled patients with suspicious malignant ground-glass opacity nodules less than or equal to 30 mm from November 2019 to July 2021.

Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography was performed, and pathologic tumor invasion was estimated before surgery. Among 620 patients with 622 nodules, 287 pure ground-glass opacity nodules and 335 part-solid nodules were analyzed. Conclusions and relevance In this diagnostic study, radiologic analysis showed good performance in identifying pathologic tumor invasion for ground-glass opacity–featured lung adenocarcinoma, especially for tumors less than or equal to 10 mm and greater than 20 mm; these results suggest that a solid component size of 6 mm could be clinically applied to distinguish pathologic tumor invasion. Pulmonary ground-glass opacity nodules are detected increasingly with the application of high-resolution computed tomography.

1, 2 Persistent GGO nodules often indicate preinvasive or invasive lung adenocarcinomas, which need close follow-up or surgical resection. 3 In 2011. To answer this question, we performed this prospective, multicenter diagnostic study to evaluate the diagnostic yield of HRCT in identifying pathologic tumor invasion for patients with GGO-featured lung cancer. The eligibility criteria were as follows: suspicious malignant GGO nodules on HRCT scan; clinical stage IA; simultaneously no more than 3 nodules; follow-up period at least 3 months; and age ranging from 15 to 85 years. The exclusion criteria included: pathological nonadenocarcinoma; pathological benign diseases; and patients who did not receive a surgical procedure. The primary end point of this study was the diagnostic yield of pathologic tumor invasion evaluated by HRCT.

### Evaluation of the safety of short-term follow-up CT for the management of consolidation in lung cancer screening [^112nxcHL]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In late 2022, the UK National Screening Committee recommended targeted lung cancer screening (LCS) of high-risk ever-smokers aged 55–74. In the targeted lung health check (TLHC) programme, nodules detected on low-dose CT (LDCT) are managed using a protocol based on British Thoracic Society (BTS) nodule management guidelines. LDCT occasionally demonstrates consolidation, which may be inflammatory or malignant in aetiology, and appearances on CT may be indeterminate. Current UK screening guidelines suggest multi-disciplinary team (MDT) referral for consolidations suspicious for malignancy but do not make specific ongoing management recommendations. PET-CT imaging in this context is rarely discriminatory; both malignant and infectious consolidation demonstrate Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity. Consequently, utilisation of PET-CT may result in sampling of benign disease. Short-term CT imaging may demonstrate resolution of consolidation, avoiding unnecessary PET-CT and invasive procedures. This retrospective study analyses the safety of short-term LDCT follow-up of consolidation in an LCS programme.

### Incidental radiologic evidence of interstitial lung disease and time to pulmonary evaluation [^111nn8Vf]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to this retrospective cohort study. First, the radiologic search terms are not specific to ILD, and since the scans were not reviewed by the authors, some non-ILD scans might have been included. For example, ground glass opacities can be due to several different etiologies (including pulmonary edema and infection), and this represented the largest proportion of scans with radiologic findings of ILD, and findings of ground glass opacities should be interpreted with caution in the setting of suspected ILD. For instance, in one retrospective cohort that identified the etiology behind ground glass opacities in 204 patients, 49% of those patients were confirmed to have ILD as the underlying etiology, which was the second most common etiology behind pulmonary edema. Additional information about the reason for ordering a CT scan, such as indication, specialty of the ordering provider, or CT-protocol, could lend additional insight into how likely the specified abnormalities are to represent ILD, however these data were not captured. Secondly, there are other appropriate ways to further investigate possible radiologic findings of ILD that we might not have picked up in our review, such as scan review for accuracy and extent of changes, history and physical examination by a primary care provider, dedicated CT scan of the chest to look for ILD, or referral to services outside of the health care system. Third, as this retrospective cohort study was necessarily constrained to a timeframe decided upon by the authors, we cannot say that any given patient did not have radiologic findings of ILD present on prior CT scans outside of the study timeframe. Along the same lines, we cannot say if any of the included or excluded CT scans in the study timeframe were ordered as follow up scans to abnormalities identified on the index CT (e.g. a dedicated CT chest could have been ordered to better characterize radiographic findings of ILD identified on CT abdomen/pelvis). Finally, we recognize that lowering the threshold to refer incidental ILD findings to pulmonary clinic or pulmonary function testing will surely overwhelm these services (over 8000 patients per year in our cohort derived from 41000 patients over 5 years), and needless to say, not all radiologic abnormalities are clinically meaningful, and some may represent transient, nonspecific, or non-progressive findings. For which reason, further research is needed to develop triage systems for such incidental findings to aid radiologists and CT scan ordering providers in referring patients at higher risk for ILD progression and investigate outcomes for patients with delay in referral to pulmonology after incidental ILD findings. Factoring in electronic consultations with pulmonologists for incidental findings is another potential tool to be investigated in aiding such triage algorithms. One promising avenue is the use of quantitative imaging algorithms. For example, a recent study using lung cancer screening low-dose CT data demonstrated that quantitative measures of interstitial abnormalities (via CALIPER and deep-learning algorithms) were independently associated with all-cause mortality and lung cancer–specific mortality. These findings suggest that quantitative imaging may be able to differentiate high-risk from low-risk individuals, thereby identifying those most likely to benefit from early pulmonary evaluation while reducing unnecessary strain on ILD services.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^114E9FwN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

FDG-PET/CT for pulmonary nodules — performance and interpretation are defined: FDG-PET/CT performed skull base to mid-thigh, and a positive FDG-PET/CT result is defined as a standardized uptake value (SUV) in the lung nodule greater than the baseline mediastinal blood pool. A false-positive FDG-PET/CT scan finding can be caused by infection or inflammation, and a false-negative FDG-PET/CT scan can be caused by a small nodule, low cellular density (nonsolid nodule or ground-glass opacity [GGO]), or low tumor avidity for FDG; if a false-negative due to low tumor avidity and/or low cellularity is suspected, follow-up CT or biopsy are reasonable options.

### Interventions to improve adherence to clinical guidelines for the management and follow-up of pulmonary nodules: a systematic review [^112Yy8M7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Most early-stage lung cancers are radiographically identified as a pulmonary nodule (PNs). PNs are well or poorly circumscribed small, rounded lung abnormalities that may be single or multiple. Many PNs are identified incidentally when CT scans are performed of the chest or thorax during routine medical care, and other PNs are identified in screening programs (eg, for lung cancer). In some settings, incidental findings may be a source of more identified early lung cancers than screening programs.PNs can denote premalignant or early-stage lung cancer; therefore, effective management can reduce mortality. Up to 35% of the general population can have PNs when they undergo CT scanning, and 50% of patients with nodules have more than one.

According to clinical guidelines, patients with nodules should be followed up systematically depending on the number of nodules, their morphology, and medical history. Although most nodules are benign, 3% to 5% turn out to be lung cancer. Therefore, in line with clinical guidelines (eg, from the British Thoracic Society and the Fleischner Society,), management involves performing follow-up scans to determine the rate of growth of these nodules. The initial follow-up scan helps determine if further surveillance is required based on growth rate of the nodule. Following up incidentally identified PNs is also important for maximizing early identification of lung cancer, as these populations can be substantially demographically different from lung cancer screening populations. For example, one US prospective observational study following up 22,886 patients, comparing a lung cancer screening program with a lung nodule follow-up program, found that only 54% of total patients with lung cancer would have been eligible for lung cancer screening.

### Distinct clinical characteristics and prognosis of ground-glass opacity-type lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^117DqT4q]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract e20505 Background: Lung ground-glass opacity, a hazy increased opacity on computed tomography with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, has been shown to be associated with early-stage lung cancer. With the increasing prevalence of ground-glass opacity-type lung cancer, more researches have focused on the diagnosis and treatment of this early stage lung cancer; however, the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of this disease has not yet been fully elucidated. Aim: To analyze and review the clinicopathological characteristics for GGO-LC and to identify the optimal treatment strategies in this select population. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature were carried out. The study was registered.

Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published from database inception to June 30, 2020, which reported on clinicopathological characteristics, management and survival outcomes in patients with GGO-LC. Studies were identified by searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and by hand searching of previous publications. We extracted the general information to perform the meta-analysis, mainly focusing on age, gender, and smoking status. We also extracted treatment and prognosis information to assess the effect of treatment strategies on overall survival. Robustness of pooled estimates from random-effects models was considered with sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses. All statistical analyses were performed with Stata 16.
0. **Results**: Data on 9444 patients in 27 observational studies were included.

GGO-type lung cancer was typically characterized as non-invasively or minimally invasively low-grade adenocarcinomas. Therapeutic intervention for these early stage lung cancers was an important opportunity for decreasing overall mortality of lung cancer. The final pooled analysis showed that the average age at diagnosis, female proportion and non-smoking proportion of patients with GGO-LC was 57. 7,
0. 591, and 0. 631, respectively. The pooled overall survival rate was 96. 2%. The results showed that the majority of GGO-LC patients had good survival outcomes, presenting a significant proportion of young, female and non-or light smokers.

Conclusions: From our analysis, it demonstrates that the patients with GGO-LC may be relatively young females and non-or light smoking history, and had better prognosis. However, there are some limitations in the present study, and more evidence is necessary to wait for more results from RCT to draw a valid conclusion.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^116sSzWb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Incidental lung nodules — diagnostic evaluation: Lung cancer screening is recommended for early diagnosis in asymptomatic patients at high risk for cancer, and risk assessment is used to determine which individuals are at high risk for lung cancer and thus are candidates for screening with low-dose CT. The diagnostic algorithms for incidental solid and subsolid lung nodules detected on chest CT use cutoff thresholds of 6 mm for a positive scan result based on the Fleischner criteria, and low-dose CT is a preferred recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines unless contrast enhancement is needed for better diagnostic resolution. Subsolid nodules include: nonsolid nodules also known as ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or ground-glass nodules (GGNs) and part-solid nodules, and nonsolid nodules are mainly adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA); patients have 5-year disease-free survival of 100% if these nonsolid nodules are completely resected. Solid and part-solid nodules are more likely to be invasive, faster-growing cancers, and data suggest that many nonsolid nodules discovered incidentally on CT imaging will resolve and many of those that persist may not progress to clinically significant cancer. All findings and factors for a patient need to be carefully evaluated in a multidisciplinary diagnostic team before establishing a diagnosis of lung cancer and before starting treatment, and the NCCN Guidelines recommend biopsy or surgical excision for highly suspicious nodules seen on low-dose CT scans or further surveillance for nodules with a low suspicion of cancer. The revised cutoff values for suspicious nodules recommended by the American College of Radiology and incorporated into the Lung-RADS system have been reported to decrease the false-positive rate from low-dose CT.

Diagnostic evaluation — incidental lung nodules: Lung cancer screening is recommended for early diagnosis in asymptomatic patients at high risk for cancer, and risk assessment is used to determine which individuals are candidates for screening with low-dose CT. The NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening have been revised to harmonize with the Lung-RADS system with the goal of decreasing the false-positive low-dose CT screening results reported in the NLST. For incidental solid and subsolid nodules detected on chest CT, diagnostic algorithms use cutoff thresholds of 6 mm for a positive scan result based on the Fleischner criteria. The Fleischner Society Guidelines do not specify whether a CT with contrast is necessary for follow-up or whether a low-dose CT is sufficient, and low-dose CT is a preferred recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines unless contrast enhancement is needed for better diagnostic resolution.

### Incidence rate and malignancy risk in new nodules in a lung cancer screening programme [^114kgnTF]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is limited evidence for the malignancy risk posed by new nodules appearing at annual screening rounds or at short-term interval nodule follow-up (NFU) CTs in lung cancer screening programmes. We investigated incidence rate and malignancy risk in new nodules appearing at NFU and at first annual CT in a screening cohort and investigated nodule and participant characteristics which predicted malignancy.

Methods

11,566 participants underwent baseline CT screening between April 2019 and April 2020. CTs were read in conjunction with computer-aided detection software with semi-automated volumetry. Nodule management was based on British Thoracic Society guidelines, with the addition of a lower threshold for new solid nodules appearing at incident rounds; those ≥ 30 and < 200 mm³ underwent a further 3-month interval scan, and new nodules ≥ 200 mm³ were referred directly for definitive investigation.

Results

New nodules were identified in 8.4% of participants at NFU-CT and 11.1% at Y1. 0.63% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.016–3.433) of new nodules at NFU-CT and 2.98% (95% CI 1.83–4.57) at annual CT proved malignant. Malignancy risk in new nodules at Y1 was 1.67% in nodules < 30 mm³, 2.2% in nodules 30–200 mm³ and 11.0% in nodules > 200 mm³. No nodules with typical perifissural or subsolid morphology were malignant. There was no significant difference in age, smoking status, smoking history or predicted cancer risk between participants with new nodules which proved malignant and those which were benign.

Conclusion

Our findings validate the need for lower volume thresholds for further surveillance or definitive investigation in new solid nodules at annual scans. Malignancy risk in new nodules with subsolid or typical perifissural morphology and in new nodules appearing in a shorter time frame of NFU CTs is low.

Key Points

Question What is the incidence and malignancy risk of new nodules appearing at annual and nodule follow-up interval CTs in lung cancer screening? Findings New nodules were seen in 11.1% and 8.4% of participants at annual low-dose CT and 3-month interval CT, respectively. Malignancy risk at annual CT increased with nodule size. Clinical relevance In a lung cancer screening programme, new nodules at annual and nodule follow-up CTs occur in around 1 in 10 participants. Lower size thresholds for further surveillance or definitive investigation should be considered compared to nodules at baseline CT.

### Real-world use and outcomes of lung-RADS v1.1 category 4B versus lung-RADS v2022 category 0 for suspected infectious or inflammatory findings on lung cancer screening CT [^117Cbosj]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Lung-RADS version 2022 (v2022) updated the reporting of suspected infectious/inflammatory findings warranting short-term follow-up, replacing the option in version 1.1 (v1.1) to classify such findings as Lung-RADS 4B with an option to classify such findings as Lung-RADS 0. Objective: To compare real-world use and outcomes of Lung-RADS v1.1 category 4B and Lung-RADS v2022 category 0 for suspected infectious/inflammatory findings on lung cancer screening (LCS) examinations Methods: This retrospective study included 14,478 patients (mean age 63.2 ± 7.0 years; 7801 male, 6677 female) who underwent LCS CT from January 2019 to December 2023, interpreted using either v1.1 or v2022. Radiology reports were reviewed to identify examinations reported as Lung-RADS 4B using v1.1 or Lung-RADS 0 using v2022 due to suspected infectious/inflammatory findings and to characterize primary findings. Cases were classified as benign or malignant based on EMR data and follow-up imaging. Examinations classified as Lung-RADS 4B and Lung-RADS 0 were compared. Results: The frequency of Lung-RADS 4B classification due to suspected infectious/inflammatory findings using v1.1 was 0.4% (55/14,478) versus Lung-RADS 0 classification due to suspected infectious/inflammatory findings using v2022 was 0.8% (88/11,348) (p < .001). Primary findings for Lung-RADS 4B examinations were most commonly solid nodule (65%) or part-solid nodule (24%), and for Lung-RADS 0 examinations were most commonly ground-glass nodule/opacity (43%), solid nodule (24%), or tree-in-bud nodules (13%) (p < .001). Of Lung-RADS 4B examinations, 76% were benign, 22% were malignant, and 2% had insufficient follow-up; of Lung-RADS 0 examinations, 98% were benign, none were malignant, and 2% had insufficient follow-up (p < .001). No examination with a primary finding of ground-glass nodule/opacity or tree-in-bud nodules was malignant. Conclusions: For suspected infectious/inflammatory findings, Lung-RADS 0 for v2022 was used more frequently than Lung-RADS 4B for v1.1. However, no Lung-RADS 0 examination was malignant. Lung-RADS 0 designations were commonly for findings (ground-glass or tree-in-bud nodules) for which v2022 indicates short-term follow-up may not be warranted. Clinical Impact: Adherence to Lung-RADS guidance regarding types of suspected infectious/inflammatory findings warranting Lung-RADS 0 classification is important for avoiding potentially unnecessary follow-up recommendations.

### Aggressiveness-guided nodule management for lung cancer screening in Europe-justification for follow-up intervals and definition of growth [^112ZTeJ1]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) nodule management recommendation for lung cancer screening with low-dose CT builds on existing nodule management guidelines but puts a stronger focus on lesion aggressiveness and measurement error. Key objectives included finding a compromise between the overall number of follow-up examinations, avoiding a major stage shift, and reducing the risk for overtreatment. Nodule management categories at baseline are chosen depending on the size of a solid nodule or the solid component of a subsolid or cystic nodule, with suspicious morphology upgrading risk to the next higher category. Higher risk categories mandate shorter follow-up times or diagnostic workup. Volume is the preferred size measure, with diameter measurements as a fallback if segmentation for volumetry is inaccurate at visual control. Nodule aggressiveness at follow-up is estimated from growth rate, calculated as volume doubling time (VDT), or yearly diameter change. Calculation of growth rate, however, is strongly affected by measurement variability, with large error margins for short follow-up and slower growing lesions. Growth thresholds were therefore set so that rapidly growing lesions can be identified while still small, while unnecessary workups for benign or slow-growing lesions could be kept low. New lesions that are retrospectively visible on earlier scans are managed according to their growth rate. New nodules not visible on earlier scans are followed after 3 months if they have a volume of ≥ 30mm³. KEY POINTS: Question This work strives to reduce follow-up examinations while preventing major stage shift and overtreatment. It provides nodule management based on estimated nodule aggressiveness. Findings Calculation of the growth rate of pulmonary nodules is strongly affected by measurement variability, with large error margins for short follow-up and slower growing lesions. Clinical relevance Growth thresholds that trigger management are adjusted to the follow-up time so that rapidly growing lesions can be identified while still being small while unnecessary workups for benign or slow-growing lesions can be reduced.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pulmonary nodules, more specifically with respect to bronchoscopic biopsy, AABIP 2025 guidelines recommend to do not routinely offer invasive mediastinal staging for patients with pure ground-glass nodules and a radiographically normal mediastinum on CT and PET.
Retrospective analyses demonstrate that pure ground-glass nodules carry an extremely low risk of mediastinal lymph node metastasis, making routine invasive staging of limited diagnostic benefit relative to procedural risks.

AABIP guidelines — implementation for GGN risk stratification — emphasize accurate radiologic assessment using high-resolution thin-section CT to measure total diameter and the solid component to determine the consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR); invasive staging can likely be omitted for pure ground-glass nodules or those with a small solid component (CTR ≤ 0.5), whereas if CTR is > 0.5 or CT/PET suggests nodal disease, standard mediastinal staging (CP-EBUS, mediastinoscopy) should be performed, with standardized multidisciplinary measurement practices encouraged.

### Longitudinal MRI in comparison to low-dose CT for follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules in patients with COPD-a nationwide multicenter trial [^112wcRuA]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Longitudinal MRI for the evaluation of nodule growth

Of the 240 nodules detected by LDCT1 in consensus by the two readers, 224 (93.3%) nodules persisted on LDCT2, and 16 (6.7%) nodules disappeared. Eight patients showed 14 newly developed nodules, amounting to a total of 238 nodules present on LDCT2 (Table 2). Nineteen nodules progressed in size from LDCT1 to LDCT2, 181 were stable, and 24 regressed in size (Fig. 2). Inter-reader agreement for growth categories using LDCT was perfect (κ = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96–1.0). The measurements of the long- and short-axis diameter of persisting nodules revealed similar mean differences of −0.1 ± 1.3 mm (p = 0.27) and 0.0 ± 1.1 mm (p = 0.15) from LDCT1 to LDCT2 for reader 1, and −0.1 ± 1.3 mm (p = 0.30) and −0.0 ± 1.1 mm (p = 0.24) for reader 2, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the readers (p = 0.74–0.90) (Fig. 3).

Prioritized research questions

Of the initial nine questions in SI and II, voting results indicated that the following questions were the highest priority (Table 2):
SII, Q2: What radiologist factors may contribute to variability in IF reporting (interpretation of Lung-RADS instructions for applying the S modifier, knowledge about IFs, opinions/attitudes/beliefs about expectations for reporting IFs, etc.)?
SII, Q3: What are the facilitators and barriers to using the S modifier in reporting (Lung-RADS category 1 and 2 vs. category 3 and 4 nodule findings, radiologist training, type of radiology practice)?
SII, Q4: What are potential educational opportunities and practical tools for improving radiologists' use of the S modifier?
SII Q6: What are the barriers to developing a more robust version of the ACR quick guide that incorporates the relevant ACR IF white papers, which radiologists could use for reporting and ordering clinicians to manage SIFs?
SII, Q8: Should radiologists be making nonimaging follow-up recommendations for SIFs?
SII, Q9: What is the potential role of artificial intelligence or computer-aided detection in identifying, quantifying, and reporting IFs?

Section III: Management of IFs: Stakeholder Perspectives

As noted above, the ACR Lung-RADS lexicon has been widely adopted and is intended to standardize clinical reporting and management of LDCT findings from LCS. However, the use of the S modifier has yet to be standardized across systems because of a lack of agreement on what is clinically significant or potentially clinically significant. This variation is driven by 1) what an individual radiologist may determine and identify as clinically significant or insignificant, 2) what the end-using clinician decides is clinically significant or insignificant, and also potentially 3) what the patient's response is to reading about IFs in the LDCT report.

### Approach to the evaluation and management of interstitial lung abnormalities: an official American Thoracic Society clinical statement [^1117Nox9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing interest in identifying early stages of interstitial lung disease (ILD) to improve patient outcomes. This document reviews updated evidence on interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), provides suggestions for screening, evaluation, and management, proposes criteria for distinguishing ILA from ILD, and identifies research priorities.

Methods

A committee of clinical and methodology experts met by video conference to define ILA and ILD by consensus and voted on eleven pre-specified questions after reviewing synthesized evidence from a systematic literature search. Agreement of 70% or more was required to approve each suggestion.

Results

ILA is defined as non-dependent bilateral parenchymal CT abnormalities, including ground-glass or reticulations, lung distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and/or honeycombing involving at least 5% of a lung zone. The updated definition removes prior exclusion of high-risk populations. ILD is distinguished from ILA by symptoms (dyspnea/cough) attributable to an interstitial process, abnormal or declining lung function, fibrotic (honeycombing and/or reticulation with traction bronchiectasis involving at least 5% of total lung volume) or progressive imaging abnormalities, and/or specific fibrotic ILD patterns on imaging or pathology. Suggestions include ILA/ILD assessment on imaging acquired for lung cancer screening, screening adults with connective tissue disease and first-degree relatives of patients with familial pulmonary fibrosis, assessing baseline symptoms and pulmonary function among those with ILA, and monitoring ILA with chest CT every 2–3 years.

Conclusion

This document presents a comprehensive literature review of ILA with updates to the Fleischner Society ILA definition, establishes a working ILD definition, and provides evidence-based suggestions for ILA evaluation and management.

### CT acquisition protocols for lung cancer screening-current landscape and the urgent need for consistency [^1122z88s]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Here's why

In the European Union, a conservative estimate suggests that approximately 20% of adults aged 50–74 may be eligible for LCS as current or former smokers. Even with a low participation rate of 5%, this could result in over 1.4 million procedures annually (halve that for biennial screening). Given this scale, even minor improvements in the application of CT acquisition protocols, which are often already considered 'low-dose', could lead to substantial reductions in radiation exposure and energy consumption.

A widespread survey exploring institutional and technical factors of CT acquisition protocols for CT LCS has not yet been conducted, and this information gap needs to be filled. We are planning on implementing this survey to understand the current state of play and the survey itself may be valuable for sustainability in several ways.

The recently published results from the randomized NELSON LCS trial have demonstrated a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality. This trial utilized quantitative CT imaging, enabling high sensitivity and specificity for early lung cancer detection. By employing non-invasive CT-generated measurements of nodule growth, the trial reduced the need for invasive diagnostic procedures to assess malignancy, thereby improving the safety of the screening process for participants.

NELSON was the first cancer screening trial to successfully implement safe, efficient, and effective clinical management using advanced computational image analysis. As computational analysis of CT images is expected to be a core aspect of CT screening moving forward, standardization of image acquisition and analysis will be critical quality measures as the screening process matures.

Findings Not Considered an ILA

Interstitial lung abnormality (ILA) subtypes. (A and B) Nonsubpleural ILA. Axial (A) and coronal (B) images show patchy ground-glass and peribronchovascular opacities predominantly in the upper lung zones with minimal reticular opacities. (C and D) Subpleural nonfibrotic ILA. Axial (C) and coronal (D) computed tomography images show bilateral subpleural reticulations without traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing. (E and F) Fibrotic ILA. Axial (E) and coronal (F) images show bilateral subpleural reticulations with traction bronchiolectasis.

The Fleischner Society definition of ILA required findings to be incidental and excluded high-risk populations. These features have been removed from the updated definition for multiple reasons. First, a definition of ILA that is independent of pretest probability is more practical for clinical use, particularly because radiologists frequently lack the necessary patient details to confirm whether these nonimaging criteria are met. Second, ILAs can still be present in high-risk populations, and incorporating these groups within the definition of ILAs allows the committee to provide guidance for evaluation and management of these patients. Finally, in the absence of compelling data to suggest otherwise, it is simpler to create a relatively broad definition of ILA with consistent evaluation and management algorithms that can be applied to most clinical scenarios.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^116UP787]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer post-treatment surveillance — imaging and follow-up are described as follows: Data from randomized phase 3 trials are not available to clarify surveillance recommendations; therefore, the most appropriate schedules are controversial. The NCCN Guidelines recommend a chest CT scan with (or without) contrast and an H&P for the initial surveillance schedules (2–5 years after definitive treatment) followed by annual low-dose non–contrast–enhanced CT and an H&P. Patients treated with chemotherapy (with or without) RT who have residual abnormalities may require more frequent imaging. FDG PET/CT or brain MRI is not routinely recommended for routine surveillance in patients without symptoms, and PET may be useful for assessing CT scans that appear to show malignant neoplasms but may be radiation fibrosis, atelectasis, or other benign conditions. Areas previously treated with RT may remain FDG avid for up to 2 years; therefore, histologic confirmation of suspicious areas with apparent "recurrent" disease is needed. For recurrences, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends assessing patients using PET/CT and brain MRI with contrast; if brain MRI is not possible, then CT with contrast of the head is recommended. Information about smoking cessation (eg, advice, counseling, therapy) should be provided for patients undergoing surveillance to improve their quality of life.

### Longitudinal MRI in comparison to low-dose CT for follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules in patients with COPD-a nationwide multicenter trial [^1128Hb6E]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study employing longitudinal multicenter MRI in direct comparison to LDCT at two timepoints approximately 3 years apart to assess growth and changes in morphology of incidental pulmonary nodules in heavy smokers. We hereby demonstrate that morpho-functional MRI has moderate sensitivity for the detection of newly developed nodules > 3 mm, and excellent agreement with LDCT for the detection of nodule growth of > 2 mm. Further, agreement of longitudinal MRI with LDCT on Lung-RADS categories guiding nodule management, was excellent in a per-patient approach, and both modalities were equally accurate in detecting histologically proven lung cancer.

Sensitivity of MR2 for the detection of incidental pulmonary nodules was only moderate but slightly improved in comparison to our analysis of the first round of imaging. Please note, that a relatively large number of small nodules between 4 mm and 5 mm were included (Fig. S2). The results align with previous studies by Meier-Schroers et al, which used a similar protocol without ultra-short echo time imaging, and showed poor to moderate sensitivity of MRI sequences to small nodules. MRI's sensitivity and specificity for detecting spiculation and cavitation/necrosis were consistent with our previous findings, and longitudinal MRI was consistent with LDCT in assessing morphological changes, which is also crucial for Lung-RADS categorization and outcome prediction of nodules. Furthermore, this study indicates that enhanced T1-weighted imaging sequences offer superior detection and morphological assessment capabilities for nodules compared to non-enhanced T1WI and T2WI sequences. This indicated the possibility of employing this sole sequence in a nodule setting to effectively limit the time required for MRI-based lung screening and would allow for a high throughput.

Stage I–III (primary treatment included RT) or stage III or stage IV (oligometastatic with all sites treated with definitive intent): H&P and chest CT ± contrast every 3–6 mo for 3 y, then H&P and chest CT ± contrast every 6 mo for 2 y, then H&P and a low-dose non–contrast-enhanced chest CT annually; residual or new radiographic abnormalities may require more frequent imaging. Smoking cessation advice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy are included. FDG-PET/CT is not routinely indicated and FDG-PET/CT is currently not warranted in the routine surveillance and follow-up of patients with NSCLC; if FDG-PET/CT is used as a problem-solving tool in patients after RT, histopathologic confirmation of recurrent disease is needed because areas previously treated with RT can remain FDG avid for up to 2 years. Brain MRI as clinically indicated based on risk assessment and Cancer Survivorship Care (NSCL-G) are noted. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Prognosis of surgically resected clinical stage 1A non-small cell lung cancers manifesting as a subsolid nodule on computed tomography including pure ground glass nodules [^111D1sPf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for review

Population: adults (aged greater than 16 years) with primary clinical stage 1A NSCLC manifesting as a subsolid nodule on CT who have undergone surgical resection including wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or pneumonectomy.

Intervention: this will be a review of prognosis following surgical resection and not a review of comparative studies

Comparator: none

Outcome: the primary outcomes will be recurrence‐free survival, proportion of participants who develop disease recurrence, and the proportion of participants who die from disease recurrence.

Timing: any disease recurrence during the follow‐up period (at five years or more) with no upper limit for follow‐up period.

Setting: all settings, including hospital outpatients and community.

Types of studies

We will include published, peer‐reviewed, prospective, or retrospective longitudinal studies (such as observational cohorts, registry studies, electronic health records studies, or relevant comparative epidemiology studies). We will include case series with at least 50 included participants. We will also include single arm clinical trials or randomised controlled trials, including feasibility or pilot studies.

We will exclude case reports, cross‐sectional studies, and case control studies as these studies will not provide relevant data regarding prognosis. We will exclude research papers not based on original data such as expert opinions, narrative reviews, or letters to the editor.

### Longitudinal MRI in comparison to low-dose CT for follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules in patients with COPD-a nationwide multicenter trial [^113wzKBG]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This multicenter trial was conducted to evaluate MRI for the longitudinal management of incidental pulmonary nodules in heavy smokers.

Materials and methods

239 participants (63.9 ± 8.4 years, 43–82 years) at risk of or with COPD GOLDI-IV from 16 centers prospectively underwent two rounds of same-day low-dose computed tomography (LDCT1&2) and MRI1&2 at an interval of three years in the nationwide COSYCONET trial. All exams were independently assessed for incidental pulmonary nodules in a standardized fashion by two blinded readers, incl. axis measurements and Lung-RADS categorization, with consensual LDCT results serving as the standard of reference. A change in diameter ≥ 2 mm was rated as progress. 11 patients underwent surgery for suspicious nodules after the first round.

Results

Two hundred twenty-four of two hundred forty nodules (93.3%) persisted from LDCT1 to LDCT2, with a sensitivity of MRI2 of 82.8% and 81.5% for readers 1 and 2, respectively. Agreement in Lung-RADS categories between LDCT2 and MRI2 was substantial in per-nodule (κ = 0.62–0.70) and excellent in a per-patient (κ = 0.86–0.88) approach for both readers, respectively. Concordance between LDCT2 and MRI2 for growth was excellent to almost perfect (κ = 0.88–1.0). The accuracy of LDCT1 and MRI1 for lung cancer was 87.5%. Lung-RADS ≥ 3 category on MRI1 had higher accuracy for predicting progress (23.1% and 21.4%, respectively) than LDCT1 (15.8%).

Conclusion

Compared to LDCT, MRI shows similar capabilities for the longitudinal evaluation of incidental nodules in heavy smokers. Decision-making for nodule management guided by Lung-RADS seems feasible based on longitudinal MRI.

Key Points

Question Can MRI serve as an alternative to low-dose CT (LDCT) for the longitudinal management of pulmonary nodules in heavy smokers, addressing concerns over radiation exposure?

Findings MRI demonstrated substantial agreement with LDCT in detecting nodule growth, accurately categorizing Lung-RADS, and comparable accuracy in identifying malignancy over a three-year follow-up.

Clinical relevance Longitudinal MRI demonstrates high consistency with LDCT in assessing the growth of incidental pulmonary nodules and categorizing per-patient Lung-RADS, offering a reliable, radiation-free alternative for monitoring and early malignancy detection in high-risk populations.

Dealing with missing data

We will include studies with data on our primary outcomes and overall survival even if data are not complete for all individuals in the study. We will attempt to contact study authors to clarify details regarding missing data. Where required, we will estimate or calculate outcome measures from any data reported, such as Kaplan‐Meier curves using indirect measures.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We will assess statistical heterogeneity between included studies in each meta‐analysis by inspecting forest plots and quantifying heterogeneity statistically using the I 2 statistic, Tau 2 statistic, and the prediction intervals.

We will assess clinical heterogeneity of included studies based on study design, duration of follow‐up, participant population, types of subsolid nodules included in study, and variations in extent of surgery. We will assess methodological heterogeneity by comparing the risk of bias in studies based on study participation, participant attrition, outcome measurement, and statistical analysis and reporting.

Assessment of reporting deficiencies

For each meta‐analysis, we will examine publication bias (where there are at least 10 studies) by visually inspecting the asymmetry of funnel plots.

Ground-glass and subsolid pulmonary nodules — lymph node (LN) metastasis rates by nodule type and consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) are reported across multiple cohorts: in pathologic T1 adenocarcinoma ≤ 3 cm with mediastinal-window computed tomography (CT) solid component thresholds, metastasis was 0% when solid ≤ 5 mm. In stage I lung adenocarcinoma categorized as pure-GGO, GGO-predominant (CTR ≤ 0.5), and solid-predominant (CTR > 0.5), rates were 0% / 3.8% / 6.9%. For cT1N0M0 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 3 cm, GGO-predominant versus solid-predominant nodules had 0.8% vs. 10.9%. In surgically resected pure-GGO nodules, the LN metastasis rate was 0%. In GGO-dominant (> 3 cm total size) lesions stratified by CTR ≤ 0.25 (Type A), 0.25–0.5 (Type B), and > 0.5 (Type C), LN metastasis occurred in 0% (Types A & B); 32% in Type C. In stage IA peripheral adenocarcinoma presenting as GGO across pure-GGO, GGO-predominant, solid-dominant, and pure-solid categories, rates were 0% / 0% / 7.5% / 14.9%. In NSCLC ≤ 3 cm comparing CTR ≤ 0.5 vs. > 0.5, pooled data and a two-center cohort showed 0–1% vs 30.4%, and 0% vs 6.6%. In stage I adenocarcinoma across part-solid, pure-GGO, and pure-solid nodules, rates were 2.2% / 0% / 27%. In invasive NSCLC up to 5 cm, CTR ≤ 0.5 vs. > 0.5 had 0% vs. 24.1%.

### A woman with a lung mass | NEJM resident 360… [^111FPiqu]. resident360.nejm.org (2020). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published August 12, 2020 Covid-19 pneumonia has a variety of appearances on chest radiography. One common appearance is bilateral hazy opacities, with or without consolidation, that predominantly involve the lower lung. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: What is a common appearance of Covid-19 pneumonia on chest radiography. A: Covid-19 pneumonia has a variety of appearances on chest radiography. One common appearance is bilateral hazy opacities, with or without consolidation, that predominantly involve the lower lung. Q: On CT of the lungs, what is a "ground-glass opacity". A: Ground-glass opacity is defined as hazy opacity of the lung with preservation of bronchovascular margins. It occurs when displacement of air from the alveolar spaces increases the attenuation of the lung.

A: Commonly reported CT findings of Covid-19 pneumonia include bilateral pulmonary opacities distributed in the peripheral lower lung. In typical cases, bilateral ground-glass opacities, sometimes with areas of consolidation, are present, and they can have an appearance suggestive of organizing pneumonia. The opacities can be multifocal, are often rounded, and can have the reversed halo sign. The ground-glass opacities may be peripheral and rounded but unilateral rather than bilateral, or the opacities may be peripheral but located in the upper or middle lung rather than the lower lung. In rare cases, a single ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation may be the only finding. These appearances can be confusing and mistaken for other disease processes.

Findings that are atypical of Covid-19 include lobar or segmental consolidation or posterior confluent consolidation, which is more commonly seen in bacterial infection or aspiration pneumonitis; discrete small pulmonary nodules, which are sometimes seen in viral, fungal, or mycobacterial infection; and cavitation, which is suggestive of necrotizing bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal infection. In addition, interstitial thickening and pleural effusions are atypical of Covid-19 and are suggestive of pulmonary edema. A: Guidelines from the American College of Radiology advised radiologists to avoid the use of CT for screening and as a first-line test for diagnosis; to use CT sparingly in hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications; and to use discretion in performing CT to inform decisions regarding whether to test, admit, or treat patients with suspected infection.

The Society of Thoracic Radiology and the American Society of Emergency Radiology issued a joint position statement that advised against routine CT screening for the diagnosis of Covid-19 and proposed restricting the use of CT to patients who have tested positive for the disease and in whom complicating features such as abscess formation are suspected. The European Society of Radiology, the European Society of Thoracic Imaging, and the Fleischner Society all issued guidelines, as well. The Fleischner Society was more accepting of imaging; although the society conceded that imaging was not routinely indicated as a screening test for Covid-19 in asymptomatic patients, it endorsed the use of imaging in patients with moderate-to-severe features of Covid-19 regardless of nucleic acid test results, and it also supported the use of imaging in patients with worsening respiratory status.

Morpho-functional chest MRI

All subjects underwent 1.5-T or 3.0-T MRI encompassing major vendors (Siemens Healthineers; General Electric; Philips) using a standardized chest MRI protocol identical to the first imaging round and repeatedly validated by phantom measurements as described previously. Between the two imaging sessions, none of the centers exchanged MRI scanner hardware. In brief, morpho-functional MRI included nonenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, and T2-weighted sequences in different breath holds and orientations. The full morpho-functional MRI protocol involved i.v. contrast injection of Gadobutrol (Bayer Vital GmbH, 0.05 mmol/kg) at a rate of 5 mL/s followed by a saline flush (30 mL NaCl) as previously described for perfusion imaging, which was not further assessed for the purpose of the present study, but allowed for a post-contrast T1 GRE acquisition (Supplemental Table S1). The acquisition time for the whole morpho-functional protocol approximated 30 min. Specifically, the three sequences studied separately for the present study encompassed measurement times of 16 s, 17–19 s, and 16–35 s for transversal 3D nonenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, as well as T2-weighted sequence acquisitions in the inspiratory state, respectively (Supplemental Table S1). The slice thickness of the transversal 3D nonenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, and T2-weighted sequences was 4 mm, 4 mm, and 8 mm, respectively.

Chest low-dose computed tomography

All subjects underwent standardized non-enhanced LDCT encompassing major vendors (Siemens Healthineers; General Electric; Philips) identical to the protocol of the first imaging round, and validated by repeated phantom measurements as previously described. Between the two imaging sessions, none of the centers exchanged CT scanner hardware. CT images were reconstructed at 0.625–1.0 mm contiguous slice thickness using smooth and edge-enhancing algorithms (B70f/LUNG/L and B30f/SOFT/B, referring to generic names of Siemens/General Electric/Philips, respectively). The maximum effective dose of paired inspiratory and expiratory LDCT was kept under 3.5 mSv.

CT images analysis

Standard lung windows (window width/window level: 1600–2000 HU/600–700 HU) and mediastinal windows (350–380/1015 HU) were used for observation. Multiplanar reconstructions (sagittal, coronal, and axial) and maximum intensity projections (MIP) were used to display morphological features and relationships with adjacent structures. To reflect the true size of the nodule, the mean diameter was determined by calculating the average of the maximum diameter and its perpendicular minor diameter on lung-window CT images in any plane. Initially, to diagnose the clear border, three types of pulmonary-nodule borders — blurry, clear, and sharp — are shown in Fig. 2. Two chest imaging experts achieved a consensus in recording the CT features of the lesions based on the thin-slice CT image sequence.

### Neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage and adherence to guidelines for the evaluation of patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules [^111dhpBp]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of incidental pulmonary nodules is guided by recommendations set forth by the Fleischner Society. Although most pulmonary nodules are benign, timely and evidence-based follow-up can reduce morbidity and mortality. There are known socioeconomic disparities for engagement with recommended cancer screenings; however, it is unclear whether disparities exist for follow-up of incidentally detected pulmonary lesions.

Research Question

Do patients residing in more socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods have reduced likelihood of adherence to guideline-recommended follow-up of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules?

Study Design and Methods

We assembled a retrospective cohort of 32,965 patients within a large, regional integrated health care system with a defined membership who had a pulmonary nodule ≤ 30 mm identified on diagnostic CT scan between 2012 and 2016. Patients with prior history of malignancy were excluded. Participants were subsequently divided into quartiles using the Neighborhood Deprivation Index as a metric for socioeconomic status. Adherence was ascertained using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-coded or Current Prodecural Terminology-coded imaging or biopsy to determine if follow-up was performed within an interval specified by 2005 Fleischner Society guidelines (with a ± 33% margin of error) based on each patient's nodule characteristics. Negative binomial regression was performed to determine the association between neighborhood-level deprivation and adherence to guideline-concordant care, with and without adjustment for plausible confounders.

Results

Only 49.6% of patients had follow-up imaging or other diagnostic procedure performed within the guideline-recommended time frame. There was a 3% reduction in adherence to follow-up for patients residing in the most socioeconomically deprived neighborhood quartile (relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94–1.0) compared with the least deprived quartile. Smoking status was also associated with worse adherence (previous tobacco use vs does not smoke: RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.65–0.69; active tobacco use vs does not smoke: RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70–0.76). Multimorbidity, and congestive heart failure in particular, was associated with decreased adherence to guideline-recommended care (Charlson Comorbidity Index 3 vs 0: RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89–0.97; history of congestive heart failure: RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90–0.97).

Interpretation

In the context of poor adherence overall, patients residing in the most socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods were shown to be less likely to receive care in concordance with Fleischner Society recommendations for management of incidental pulmonary nodules.

### Lung ultrasound outperforms symptom-based screening to detect interstitial lung disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis [^115J5cts]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

HRCT scan scoring

Non-contrast HRCT or photon counting CT scans (depending on clinical availability) were acquired within 3 months of the ultrasonographic evaluation per clinical protocol at University Hospitals Leuven. Two qualitative CT scores were performed: a clinical–radiological score and a radiological score. The clinical–radiological score (figure 1), performed by an expert pulmonologist (WW), was designed to mimic the advantages of a multidisciplinary team discussion. WW was blinded to the ultrasound findings, but amalgamated medical record data, the in-house radiological assessment, PFTs and the CT images into a 4-point score: 0 (normal), 1 (non-specific abnormalities), 2 (subclinical interstitial lung changes (ILC)) and 3 (advanced ILD). All patients receiving a score of 2 remained in follow-up. Patients assigned a score of 3 were referred for further workup at the outpatient pulmonology department.

Figure 1
Clinical–radiological score. Reticular lines are visible at both costophrenic angles resulting in a classification of non-specific abnormality and a score of 1 (top right). More widespread ground glass abnormalities and reticular lines are visible at both lung bases suggesting subclinical interstitial changes and a score of 2 (bottom left). Extensive ground glass infiltration is visible in the lower zones, with traction bronchiectasis and honeycomb cysts visible in the subpleural regions of the lower lobes (bottom right).

As a focused image-based evaluation, a previously described radiological score(no ILD, non-fibrotic ILC (NFILC), fibrotic ILC (FILC) and advanced ILC (AILC)) was performed by an external specialist chest radiologist (JJ). JJ was blinded to all clinical characteristics, PFTs and ultrasound findings. NFILC represented ground-glass opacities (GGO) or reticulation without any traction bronchiolectasis. FILC represented the combination of traction bronchiolectasis with reticulations or GGOs in a maximum of two lobes. AILC represented the combination of bronchiolectasis with reticulations or GGO in more than two lobes. For all ILCs, a qualitative assessment was added to the score: mild, moderate or severe. The mild score constituted the presence of trivial disease alone and therefore only moderate or severe ILC categories were included in the analysis.

### Prognosis of surgically resected clinical stage 1A non-small cell lung cancers manifesting as a subsolid nodule on computed tomography including pure ground glass nodules [^114UUZBK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Health outcomes

The purpose of our review is to better understand the natural history of NSCLC presenting as a subsolid nodule postresection. For indolent cancers, the challenge is to document prognosis as best as possible without the potential distortions of competing causes of death. In addition to overall survival, the literature often reports recurrence (or relapse)‐free survival. This is defined as the number of days from date of surgery to cancer relapse or death from any cause. In studies with prolonged follow‐up, or where competing causes of death are high relative to cancer relapse, recurrence‐free survival may not fully reflect the rate of recurrence. However, measures of disease‐specific survival, where deaths due to other causes are censored, may be biased in Kaplan‐Meier analysis with a tendency to overestimate the cumulative incidence of an event in the presence of competing risks. Therefore, it is important to also understand the locoregional, distant, and overall recurrence rates. It is likely that studies will report recurrences during the period of follow‐up, without details on the time of recurrence and with probable variations in duration of follow‐up, making it difficult to perform meta‐analysis. However, where possible, we will synthesise data on recurrence rates and, if there are sufficient data, the cumulative incidence of recurrence in addition to recurrence‐free survival. We will also synthesise data on overall survival, disease‐free survival, postoperative mortality, and the proportion of people with clinical stage 1A disease who had metastases detected in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on pathological analysis of surgical resection specimens.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors (RM and AB) will independently assess risk of bias in included studies. When there is discordance between risk of bias judgements, the review authors will reach consensus by discussion. If necessary, a third author will resolve disagreements where a consensus cannot be reached.

There is currently no tool to assess the biases of overall prognosis reviews. Therefore, we designed a tool by including items from the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool and the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) (see Supplementary material 3). We have decided to assess the bias across four domains that are relevant to reviews of overall prognosis: study participation; study attrition; outcome measurement; and statistical analysis and reporting.

For the statistical analysis and reporting domain, we have excluded the questions around model development that do not relate to this review. For each domain, we will extract relevant methodological data and rate the adequacy of reporting for prespecified items for each domain as yes, partly yes, no, and unclear. Based on these items, we will then rate the potential risk of bias for each of the four domains as high risk of bias, moderate risk of bias, or low risk of bias.

We will rate studies with a low risk of bias in all four domains as having an overall low risk bias. We will assess studies with a high risk of bias in any of the four domains as having an overall high risk of bias. We will conduct a sensitivity analysis that will limit the pooled analysis for primary outcomes to studies with an overall low risk of bias.

Measures of association or predictive performance measures to be extracted

We will extract survival statistics from a single‐arm study at five years or more using a non‐parametric approach for survival probability — Kaplan–Meier estimate with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), calculated using Stata's mvmeta command. We will assess the proportion of people who develop recurrence at two years or more by extracting the number of those with events or risk ratios or odds ratios and their 95% CIs. We will extract the unadjusted and adjusted measure of association for each study, when they are available.

The core set of adjustment factors are tumour staging, age, sex, smoking status, and extent of surgery. If any studies provide adjusted estimates but do not adjust for the core set of adjustment factors, we will include the data in the overall meta‐analysis but will exclude the studies in a sensitivity analysis.

### Phase III study of mediastinal lymph node dissection for ground glass opacity-dominant lung adenocarcinoma [^115WZB6V]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Trial Design and Patients

The study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase III noninferiority RCT designed to support the noninferiority of no mediastinal LND for disease-free survival versus systematic mediastinal LND, the standard of care, in patients with GGO-dominant invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ECTOP-1009; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). Eligible patients were adults age 18–75 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1 and clinical stage T1N0M0 GGO-dominant invasive lung adenocarcinoma, defined by consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) ≤ 0.5 and maximum tumor diameter (including solid and GGO components) ≤ 3 cm, on the basis of thin-section (1-mm) computed tomography (TSCT) images. Nodules should be solitary and resectable.

CTR was calculated as the ratio of the maximum size of the solid component to the maximum tumor diameter in the axial plane. All patients underwent CT scan in the supine position during deep inspiration breath-hold. Routine TSCT was performed from the lung apex to the adrenal glands before surgery. Scan parameters were consistent with our previous trialand listed as follows: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current, 250 mA; field of view, 400 mm; reconstruction slice thickness, 1 mm; slice interval, 1 mm; collimation width, 0.5 mm; pixel spacing, 0.74 mm; and image matrix, 512 × 512. GGO was defined as a hazy area of increased attenuation that did not obscure the underlying bronchial or vascular structures on TSCT images. At least one experienced thoracic surgeon and one experienced chest radiologist evaluated the CT images on lung window settings (window width, 1,600 Hounsfield units [HU]; window level, –600 HU; and width and interval, 1.0 and 1.0 mm, respectively). In cases of disagreement, a consensus was reached after discussion. Histologic confirmation of invasive lung adenocarcinoma was required through intraoperative frozen-section examinations. Pathologic diagnosis was performed according to the 2015 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus, and Heart. Lung adenocarcinomas were classified as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or invasive adenocarcinoma.

### ACR-SPR-STR practice parameter for the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs [^116unkz5]. SPR/ACR/STR (2025). High credibility.

ACR–SPR–STR high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the lungs — optimal HRCT protocol emphasizes indication-specific preparation, image quality at low dose, and cautious use of reconstruction. Optimization of the CT examination requires the supervising physician to develop an appropriate HRCT protocol based on careful review of relevant patient history and clinical indications as well as all previously available imaging studies that are relevant. Protocols should be prepared according to the specific medical indication, and techniques that provide image quality consistent with the diagnostic needs of the examination at acceptably low radiation dose levels to the patient should be selected. Tube potential and tube current appropriate to patient size are specified, and using similar technical parameters for each study facilitates direct comparison between studies and is of value if quantitative CT measurements are employed. Techniques available to minimize radiation exposure (eg, tube current modulation) should be used, imaging using lower radiation settings is subject to image noise, which can be offset with iterative reconstruction techniques, and special caution should be taken when using iterative techniques because high degrees of iterative reconstruction weighting may obscure subtle interstitial pulmonary findings and lead to an inaccurate characterization of the patient's underlying lung disease. When volumetric HRCT data are acquired, utilization of MPR capabilities is encouraged to facilitate assessment of disease distribution and morphology.

COVID-19

Identification of a new pathogen and first imaging findings

On December 31st, 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness was reported to the WHO from China. A week later, a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent, and its genome was sequenced by January 12th. Radiological findings were briefly described to enable or facilitate triage. Diagnosis was largely based on RT-PCR in the earliest days of the emerging pandemic when the number of suspected cases allowed comprehensive testing. By the end of January, the outbreak expanded into a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11th, it was declared a pandemic with more than 118,000 cases in 113 countries. WHO clinical management guidelines from January 12, 2020, gave a brief initial description of imaging findings.

Role of imaging in the diagnosis, therapy guidance, and prognosis

PCR tests were the primary diagnostic tool in mid-January, while CT scans showed higher sensitivity based on an analysis from early February. Thoracic CTs formed the cornerstone of diagnosis in China due to insufficient test availability, and they were used for triage in northern Italy while waiting for PCR results. Excessive case numbers and a lack of testing and CT capacities made it necessary to switch to x-ray in Brazil. The International Society of Radiology reported significant differences between national guidelines, and by early April, the Fleischner Society was the first to provide resource-adapted guidance for radiology. WHO guidance was published in June 11, 2020. Neither the initial WHO guidelines for clinical management nor their first situation report provided early advice on radiology in therapy, prognosis or follow-up. However, by the end of February, the probability of developing severe symptoms was shown to be associated with the extent of CT findings on admission, and a multicenter study showed links between abnormalities on admission and fatal outcome. In April, a statement by the Fleischner Society as well as the ESR recommended restricting repeated radiographs to ICU patients with persisting poor or deteriorating status. The WHO recommended against the use of chest imaging for discharge decisions, while Chinese hospitals relied on it, and guidelines did not provide consistent advice.

Time to First Acute ILD Exacerbation

Acute ILD exacerbation was defined as unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days, new diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and/or new HRCT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and exclusion of alternative causes. Acute ILD exacerbations were not adjudicated.

The risk of first acute ILD exacerbation did not show a statistically significant difference between the OFEV group compared to placebo (52 week treatment period: HR 0.72, (95% CI: 0.38, 1.37); whole trial: HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.07)).

Survival

Survival was evaluated for OFEV compared to placebo in Study 5 to support the primary endpoint (FVC). All-cause mortality was assessed over the study duration and available follow-up period, irrespective of cause of death and whether patients continued treatment. All-cause mortality did not show a statistically significant difference (52 week treatment period: HR 0.94 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.86); whole trial: HR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.21)).

### Non-small cell lung cancer in ever-smokers vs never-smokers [^114jpee6]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging and pathology findings

Patients in S and NS groups more commonly had no underlying parenchymal lung disease (65%) at initial staging CT or PET/CT (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). Nodule/mass morphology on CT was solid (91.6%), subsolid (7.7%), and nonsolid or ground glass (0.7%). Solid nodules/masses were most commonly adenocarcinoma followed by squamous subtype (66% and 35%, respectively). Subsolid and ground glass nodules/masses were exclusively adenocarcinoma. The smallest tumor was 11 mm and the largest was 143 mm (greatest dimension). Mean tumor size in NS was 77 mm vs 76 mm in S (p = 0.81). Only 4.5% of tumors contained calcifications, predominantly those with adenocarcinoma followed by the squamous subtype. Nodules/masses with suspicious morphology were as follows: 27% spiculated margins or partially spiculated margin, 30% lobulated margin, 9% cystic/cavitary, 3% part solid nodules, and 3% partially lobulated margin. Spiculated nodules/masses were predominantly adenocarcinoma (66.6%), followed by the squamous subtype (28%). Partially spiculated nodules/masses were more commonly associated with the adenocarcinoma subtype (74%). The majority of lobulated and partially lobulated nodules/masses were adenocarcinoma (59%). Nodules/masses with cystic/cavitary components were predominantly squamous subtype (51.8%) (Table 2, Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Missing data due to unavailable outside chest CT imaging for three NS patients.

### Atypical pulmonary cysts in lung cancer screening: prevalence, outcomes, and clinical implications [^114FJHfr]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to examine the prevalence and clinical outcomes of atypical pulmonary cysts (APCs) in lung cancer screening (LCS) and evaluate the impact of APC introduction on Lung-RADS v2022 categorization.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed 2968 low-dose baseline chest CT scans from LCS participants between June 2017 and April 2023. Two thoracic radiologists assessed the presence and type of APCs and evaluated interval changes. We also investigated how the introduction of APC changed Lung-RADS categories. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient.

Results

Of the 2968 participants (2900 men, 68 women; median age: 61 years [IQR: 57–65]), 18 (0.6%) had APCs. The interobserver agreement for APC presence was fair (κ = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.07–0.44). Among the 16 APC cases with follow-up CTs (median follow-up: 22 months), lung cancer was confirmed in three cases (18.8%). Among the remaining 13 APCs, 4 (30.8%) showed growth, 7 (53.8%) showed no change and 2 (15.4%) exhibited decreased wall thickness. Histological confirmation was not obtained for these 13 cases, indicating a minimum cancer rate of 18.8%. The introduction of APC led to a positive result change in 0.4% of participants (12/2968), with two lung cancer cases among them.

Conclusion

APCs were infrequent in LCS, with a 0.6% prevalence, but had a high cancer rate (18.8%). Although the introduction of APC led to a 0.4% increase in positive screenings, this is considered acceptable as it included two lung cancer cases, highlighting the importance of recognizing APCs for early lung cancer detection.

Key Points

Question What is the prevalence and clinical significance of APCs detected during LCS, and how do they impact diagnostic outcomes? Findings APCs were detected in 0.6% of participants, with a high cancer rate of at least 18.8%, and increased screening positive results by 0.4%. Clinical relevance APCs during LCS, although uncommon, are crucial because of their high risk of lung cancer. This enhances early detection of lung cancer and improves patient management strategies.

### Visual emphysema as a category modifier in lung-RADS using a secondary analysis of national lung screening trial [^114iormf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Lung CT Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) does not consider emphysema, a lung cancer risk factor detectable on CT, when assessing nodule risk. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of incorporating emphysema into Lung-RADS on lung cancer diagnosis.

Methods

In this secondary analysis of the National Lung Screening Trial data, CT arm participants with noncalcified nodules were assigned to Lung-RADS categories, and their emphysema severity was visually dichotomized. Lung cancer rates within each Lung-RADS category were compared based on emphysema severity. A modified Lung-RADS, reclassifying nodules with significant emphysema into a higher category, was evaluated against standard Lung-RADS.

Results

A study of 9,444 participants (782 [8.3%] with lung cancer) revealed difference in lung cancer rates across Lung-RADS categories based on visual emphysema severity: category 2 (2.6% versus 4.9%; P = 0.007), 3 (4.9% versus 9.0%; P < .001), 4A (9.2% versus 15.5%; P = 0.01), 4B (16.1% versus 24.1%; P = 0.12), and 4X (25.3% versus 33.2%; P = 0.008) without or with significant emphysema. Compared with standard Lung-RADS, modified Lung-RADS demonstrated a comparable area under the curve (0.73 versus 0.74, P = 0.009), increased sensitivity (61.3% versus 67.6%, P < .001), decreased specificity (77.2% versus 71.4%, P < .001), and improved goodness of fit (P = 0.008) for predicting lung cancer.

Discussion

Lung cancer rates differ by emphysema severity within Lung-RADS categories. Using the visual emphysema severity as a category modifier in Lung-RADS increased sensitivity while achieving comparable area under the curve for lung cancer.

### Radiomic' stress test': exploration of a deep learning radiomic model in a high-risk prospective lung nodule cohort [^112YiQfq]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

In this study, we used a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation design to externally validate the Mayo Clinic model and LCP Score developed by Optellum (Optellum, Oxford, UK). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013).

Patient selection

For this study, we used the same cohort used to evaluate lung cancer prediction models in our previously published study, which consecutively enrolled patients with pulmonary nodules referred to the interventional pulmonology service for navigational bronchoscopy between 7 November 2017 and 29 April 2019 at a tertiary medical centre. This cohort included adult patients with nodules less than 30 mm in largest diameter based on clinical radiology reports. All CT scans used for radiomic analysis were non-contrast, axial chest CT series with a slice thickness less than 3 mm and slice spacing less than 2.5 mm. Imaging was performed using standard clinical protocols at a tertiary academic centre. These acquisition parameters were consistent with requirements for the LCP software analysis. Patients for whom an LCP score could not be calculated due to CT scan parameter incongruence with the LCP platform were excluded. All patients lost to follow-up prior to final diagnosis or end of 2-year surveillance period were excluded from the study. Malignant diagnosis was based on expert lung pathologist review of histopathological specimens. Benign diagnosis was based on specific benign histopathological and/or microbiological findings concordant with nodule characteristics or absence of growth after 2 years of follow-up of any nodule with non-specific pathologic findings.

Methods

Dataset introduction

This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the requirement for written informed consent was waived. From November 2015 to August 2021, chest thin-section (≤ 1.25 mm) CT scans with reports including the terms "ground-glass opacity (GGO)", "Ground-glass nodule" (GGN), "part-solid nodule", "solid nodule (SN)", or "subsolid nodule" were retrospectively reviewed. Finally, in total, 393 patients (145 men, 248 women, 62.40 ± 10.53 years) with 394 lesions were considered. From July 2021 to March 2024, 63 patients with 63 lesions were included in the external cohort. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients received chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment or drug treatment; (2) nodules without pathological confirmation; and (3) nodules without TLS evaluation, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
The flowchart of study patients. GGO, ground-glass opacity; GGN, ground-glass nodule

Preoperative chest CT was performed using the Discovery CT750 HD, Discovery CT, LightSpeed VCT (General Electric Medical Systems), uCT760, uCT510 (United Imaging Medical Systems), IQon Spectral CT (Philips Medical Systems), etc. In the external set, the CT machine was Somatom Force CT (Siemens Medical Systems). The reconstruction slice thicknesses were 1.0 mm or 1.25 mm, and the intervals were 0.8 mm using a standard reconstruction algorithm. Unenhanced CT images of the latest CT examination before surgery were used. When contrast medium injection was required, only the pre-contrast image set was used. The mean interval between the latest CT examination and surgery was approximately 2 weeks.

Histopathological indicators

For each case in this cohort, slides were assessed by two independent and experienced pathologists. The existence of intra-tumoral TLSs was evaluated morphologically on hematoxylin-eosin stained slides, which were scanned into whole slide images by using the ScanScope CS2 (Leica). According to a previous study, TLSs were classified into three groups, including aggregates of lymphocytes and lymphoid follicles with or without germinal center formation. For this cohort, we classified tumors without any TLSs as the TLS-L (TLS-low) group, and tumors with at least ten TLSs as the TLS-H (TLS-high) group according to the upper quartile of TLS numbers.

Annual Rate of Decline in FVC

A statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of decline of FVC (in mL) was demonstrated in patients receiving OFEV compared to patients receiving placebo based on the random coefficient regression model, adjusted for gender, height, and age. The treatment effect on FVC was consistent in all 3 studies. See Table 3 for individual study results.

Figure 1 displays the change from baseline over time in both treatment groups for Study 2. When the mean observed FVC change from baseline was plotted over time, the curves diverged at all timepoints through Week 52. Similar plots were seen for Study 1 and Study 3.

Figure 2 presents the cumulative distribution for all cut-offs for the change from baseline in FVC percent predicted at Week 52 for Study 2. For all categorical declines in lung function, the proportion of patients declining was lower on OFEV than on placebo. Study 3 showed similar results.

Time to First Acute IPF Exacerbation

Acute IPF exacerbation was defined as unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days, new diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and/or new high-resolution CT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and exclusion of alternative causes. Acute IPF exacerbation was adjudicated in Study 2 and Study 3. In Study 1 (investigator-reported) and Study 3 (adjudicated), the risk of first acute IPF exacerbation over 52 weeks was significantly reduced in patients receiving OFEV compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.56), respectively. In Study 2 (adjudicated), there was no difference between the treatment groups (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20, 1.54).

Survival

Survival was evaluated for OFEV compared to placebo in Study 2 and Study 3 as an exploratory analysis to support the primary endpoint (FVC). All-cause mortality was assessed over the study duration and available follow-up period, irrespective of cause of death and whether patients continued treatment. All-cause mortality did not show a statistically significant difference (See Figure 3).

14.2 Chronic Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases with a Progressive Phenotype

The clinical efficacy of OFEV has been studied in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 5 [NCT02999178]). A total of 663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OFEV 150 mg twice daily or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks. Randomization was stratified based on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) fibrotic pattern as assessed by central readers: 412 patients with UIP-like HRCT pattern and 251 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns were randomized. There were 2 co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: all patients (the overall population) and patients with HRCT with UIP-like HRCT fibrotic pattern.

The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks. Other endpoints included time to first acute ILD exacerbation and time to death.

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic fibrosing ILD were selected if they had relevant fibrosis (greater than 10% fibrotic features) on HRCT and presented with clinical signs of progression (defined as FVC decline ≥ 10%, FVC decline ≥ 5% and < 10% with worsening symptoms or imaging, or worsening symptoms and worsening imaging all in the 24 months prior to screening). Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 45% of predicted and a DLCO 30% to less than 80% of predicted. Patients were required to have progressed despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice by investigators for the patient's relevant ILD.

### Predictive value of bedside lung ultrasound, quantitative chest CT, and frailty assessment for short-term outcomes in elderly patients with severe pneumonia: a pilot study [^112hHJ9Y]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Quantitative chest CT

Chest CT was performed within 48 h of admission provided the patient's hemodynamic status permitted safe transport to the radiology suite. All scans were acquired on a 320-detector-row scanner (Aquilion ONE, Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan) using a low-dose protocol (collimation 1 mm; tube current 80–120 mA with automated dose modulation). Non-contrast, low-dose CT constituted the default protocol; contrast-enhanced CT angiography was reserved for specific clinical indications — namely suspected pulmonary embolism, complicated pleural effusion, or mediastinal infection — at the discretion of the attending physician.

A radiographer uploaded the images to dedicated post-processing software equipped with Advanced Clear-IQ Engine (Canon Medical Systems). Using fully automated or semi-automated segmentation, the software quantified: (i) the percentage of lung volume occupied by consolidation and (ii) the number of lobes involved. Incidental thoracic findings (e.g. emphysematous changes, pulmonary nodules) were recorded prospectively. All quantitative outputs were exported to the study database for subsequent analysis.

Frailty assessment

Frailty was evaluated with the CFS, which grades functional status from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). A trained geriatric nurse practitioner or physician completed each assessment within 24–48 h of admission, drawing on the pre-morbid history, physical examination, and baseline functional capacity. For analytic purposes, CFS scores were grouped as mild frailty (4–5), moderate frailty (6), and severe frailty (7–8); patients with end-of-life status (CFS 9) were excluded per protocol.

Feasibility end‑points

We prospectively captured three metrics to assess feasibility: (i) recruitment efficiency, calculated as the proportion of screened patients who were successfully enrolled; (ii) data completeness for the three key assessments — LUS, chest CT, and CFS; and (iii) safety, defined as any study-related adverse event (e.g. oxygen desaturation during LUS or hemodynamic instability during CT transport). A screening log recorded all reasons for non-enrolment and documented logistical barriers encountered during study procedures.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) radiation therapy — simulation, planning, and delivery: Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT treatment position. Intravenous contrast CT scans, with or without oral contrast, are recommended for better target delineation whenever possible, especially in patients with central tumors or nodal involvement. FDG PET/CT can significantly improve target delineation accuracy, especially when there is atelectasis or contraindications to intravenous CT contrast. Ideally, target delineation should be based on PET/CT that is obtained no more than 4 weeks before treatment because of the potential for rapid progression of NSCLC. Respiratory motion should be managed.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ESBRIET was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or ESBRIET 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.

Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease. Eligible patients were to have %FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline. In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.

A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624) in these three trials. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years). Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%). Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Baseline mean %FVC and %DLCOwere 72% and 46%, respectively. Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.

### Incidental finding of pulmonary nodule on CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) in view of current surveillance recommendations: is any lung cancer screening protocol applicable? [^116LoMEE]. ASCO (2010). Low credibility.

Abstract 1597 Background: Incidental finding of pulmonary nodules on CT is frequent and application of cancer screening derived follow up algorithms could produce multiple repeated scans with low yield, high cumulative cost and radiation burden. Rationale of current standard recommendations was tested with respect to the size and number of nodules, age, prior cancer history in population of adults over age of 20 subjected to CTPA for chest pain. Methods: The frequency of incidental finding of pulmonary nodule was reviewed in 1434 CTPA done at BU over 1 year with benefit of 3 year f/u. Clinicians adherence to radiologist's recommendation of f/u at 3, 6, and 12 months depending on cancer risk and dominant nodule size, and diagnostic yield of f/u studies were reviewed. Results: 43 patients with history of cancer were followed on specific protocols. In pts with no cancer history, the incidence of CTPA with incidental pulmonary nodules was 17. 6%.

No f/u was recommended in 80 pts due to review of prior imaging or characteristics of nodules, 10 pts were directed straight to PETCT or biopsy with 100% compliance; cancer detected in 9 pts. 3 month f/u was recommended in 60 pts. with 66. 6% compliance, progression in 6 pts. 6 month f/u was recommended in 24 pts with 50% compliance, progression in 3 pts only 1 had malignancy. 12 month f/u was recommended in 14 pts with 42. 8% compliance, none progressed. Generic f/u without specified interval was recommended in 59 pts, accomplished in 35. 6% with progression detected in 0%. Conclusions: High frequency of incidental findings of lung nodules in pts with no history of cancer requires concrete and standardized f/u recommendations to avoid cumulative imaging with low efficacy.

Imaging characteristics prompting immediate PETCT/biopsy or short f/u were associated with significantly higher compliance and diagnostic yield compared to generic recommendations or 12 month f/u.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Pirfenidone [^112MjEbF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of pirfenidone was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or pirfenidone 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.

Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease. Eligible patients were to have %FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline. In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.

A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive pirfenidone 2403 mg/day (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624) in these three trials. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years). Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%). Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Baseline mean %FVC and %DLCOwere 72% and 46%, respectively. Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^113gFbPt]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — principles of imaging for distant metastases and post-treatment assessment: For patients with locoregionally advanced cancer (eg, T3–T4 primary or ≥ N1 nodal staging), FDG-PET/CT is preferred to evaluate for distant disease and thoracic metastases. However, FDG-PET/CT cannot rule out brain metastasis, and for cancers where this is a concern, such as mucosal melanoma or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas or adenocarcinomas, contrast-enhanced brain MRI should be additionally obtained. If FDG-PET/CT is not performed, CT of the chest should be performed to assess for presence of pulmonary metastases as well as mediastinal lymph node involvement. Non-contrast CT of the chest can be sufficient to screen for lung parenchymal metastases but is not adequate for assessment of mediastinal adenopathy, and this is an appropriate lung cancer screening intervention for patients with a history of smoking. Following primary definitive treatment (surgery, RT, or systemic therapy/RT) the role of annual CT screening for lung metastasis is controversial, but for patients with a substantial smoking history or who are at high risk for lung cancers, annual chest CT can be considered; historically, annual chest x-ray has been obtained but this is a much less sensitive test than CT. If clinical concern for metastatic disease is confined to a specific anatomical area, the assessment of distant disease can be performed with direct CT or MRI examination; for example, pulmonary metastasis can be followed and assessed by non-contrast chest CT, or spinal metastasis can be followed and assessed by contrast-enhanced spine MRI, and the frequency of such imaging tests depends on the planned treatment regimen and type of cancer. FDG-PET/CT may complement or replace other imaging modalities when staging recurrent disease before any therapy for relapsed/refractory disease in order to explore distant disease or second primaries that may significantly impact choice of therapy. PET/CT is preferred over PET scan alone (ie, without supersimposed CT scan). PET/CT provides more accurate anatomical localization of abnormalities. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) [^115b45vA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

### Lung microvasculopathy in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: high-resolution findings with photon-counting detector CT in 29 patients [^113D5eG3]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

CT features analyzed in each pair

In the absence of preliminary investigation, we extrapolated the list of CT features potentially detectable in obstructed and non-obstructed areas from pathophysiological descriptions as detailed in Table B (Supplementary Material). In the subpleural lung of each pair (i.e. 2–3 cm from the lung surface) analyzed on transverse CT sections: (a) we visually assessed the diameter of pulmonary arterioles (rated as thin or dilated) and venules (rated as thin, dilated or unremarkable), and the presence of septal lines (i.e. boundaries of secondary pulmonary lobules) when depictable; there was no cutoff number to define the diameter of arterioles and venules; their morphological appearance was assessed by comparison with reference images of the subpleural lung in patients with normal lung parenchyma; distal vessels were recognized as arterial or venous structures by sliding the CT sections above and below to identify their connection with recognizable arterial or venous divisions; they could also be recognized based on the location at the center/periphery of secondary pulmonary lobules when septal borders were depictable; (b) searched for the presence of CT features suggestive of microvasculopathy, comprising: (i) areas of focal abnormalities, categorized as ill-defined micronodules (i.e. small-sized, rounded [< 3 mm in diameter] areas of hyperattenuation, with blurred margins); lobular ground-glass opacities (GGO) (i.e. well-defined, rounded /triangular areas of GGO, identifying secondary pulmonary lobules filled by GGO on a transverse CT section); and haziness (i.e. when areas of hyperattenuation did not fulfilled the morphology of the two previous categories); (ii) vascular tree-in-bud (i.e. dilated and irregular pulmonary arterioles); and (iii) neovascularity (i.e. dilated, serpiginous peripheral pulmonary vessels). Systemic-to-pulmonary anastomoses were analyzed as follows: (a) dilated peripheral systemic arteries, including intercostal arteries, internal mammary arteries and inferior phrenic arteries, were recognized in presence of small, serpiginous, vascular channels coursing in chest wall soft tissues in proximity to pleural surfaces; (b) the presence of systemic-to-pulmonary anastomoses was recognized when dilated peripheral systemic arteries were seen as "beading" along the visceral pleural margin and entering the lung to join intrapulmonary vessels, in the lung periphery.

### Abemaciclib (Verzenio) [^112Lw7tF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or Pneumonitis

Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with VERZENIO and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In VERZENIO-treated patients in early breast cancer (monarchE, N = 2791), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In VERZENIO-treated patients in advanced or metastatic breast cancer (N = 900) (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of VERZENIO-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations.

Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Grade ≥ 3 ALT (2% to 6%) and AST (2% to 3%) were reported in patients receiving VERZENIO.

Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade < 3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade < 3 ranged from 11 to 15 days.

Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatic transaminase elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Defining CT subtypes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: real world daily practice does not meet guidelines [^116Gsxmk]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the quality and inter-rater reliability of CT-definable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subtype reporting in CT chest reports in a real-world setting, and assess concordance with Fleischner Society guidelines.

Methods

We undertook a retrospective review of 100 randomly selected CT chest scans containing the terms 'emphysema' or 'COPD'. Existing reports were evaluated for the description of emphysema phenotype, severity, and location, as well as the presence of associated findings, benchmarked against the Fleischner Society guidelines for CT reporting. The scans were then read independently by two consultant thoracic radiologists and two radiology specialty residents, blinded to the original reports and each other's assessments. Inter-rater variability was assessed using Light's Kappa for categorical variables and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for ordinal variables.

Results

Emphysema phenotype was described in 51% of the pre-existing reports, with centrilobular emphysema being the most frequently reported subtype. Only 26% of reports included all three key descriptors of phenotype, severity and location. Inter-rater agreement was fair for emphysema phenotype (κ = 0.371) and moderate for the grading of paraseptal emphysema (ICC = 0.733), but was more variable for associated features such as large airways disease (κ = 0.0646) and bronchiectasis (κ = 0.0996).

Conclusion

This study shows variability in the quality of CT reporting for COPD in a real-world setting, with frequent omissions of key descriptors and marked inter-rater variability. These findings highlight the need for standardisation in CT reporting, particularly in the context of increasing reliance on imaging for COPD diagnosis and management.

### Unmasking the harlequin syndrome: a clinical transformation [^117RQeQd]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case

A 43-year-old woman presented to our clinic with flushing and sweating on the left side of the face (Fig 1, A) that was triggered by physical and emotional stress over the last 5 years. Her medical history was unremarkable apart from a 20-pack-year smoking history with no known underlying diseases or regular medication use. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. Notably, both direct and indirect light reflexes were normal, and the pupils were isocoric. To exclude secondary causes, carotid and vertebral artery Doppler ultrasonography, thoracic high-resolution computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain, neck, and spine were performed. The thoracic high-resolution computed tomography showed nodular opacities with a ground-glass pattern, leading to a preliminary diagnosis of respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease. As a result, a lung wedge resection biopsy was performed, which supported the preliminary diagnosis. Thoracic high-resolution computed tomography also revealed nodules in the adrenal glands, measuring 2 cm on the left and 1 cm on the right, with a density of less than 10 Hounsfield unit, and it was reported with a preliminary diagnosis of adenoma. For further investigation, internal medicine requested pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and 24-hour urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine, aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and plasma renin activity, all of which were within normal limits. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography was also performed, showing the lesions with low metabolic activity and no other pathology detected. Therefore, the adrenal nodules were evaluated as nonfunctioning adenomas, and annual follow-up was recommended. All other imaging tests showed no pathology, and routine laboratory studies were normal as well. Therefore, a diagnosis of idiopathic Harlequin syndrome was made. The patient was reassured about the benign nature of the condition. However, due to her significant discomfort and social embarrassment, she expressed a desire for treatment. Treatment options were discussed with the patient, and contralateral thoracic sympathectomy was recommended due to the significant impact on her daily activities, and her preference for a permanent solution. The thoracic surgery department was consulted, and video-assisted thoracoscopic sympathectomy was successfully performed. Following surgery, the patient experienced immediate resolution of the symptoms, which has been sustained at the 4-month follow-up, with no evidence of compensatory hyperhidrosis (Fig 1, B).
