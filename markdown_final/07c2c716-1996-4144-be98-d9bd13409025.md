## Question

Which antiarrhythmic agent is preferred in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and ventricular tachycardia (VT)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antiarrhythmic drug is preferred for ventricular tachycardia (VT) in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall treatment hierarchy in HOCM with sustained VT, especially the role of ICDs versus drugs. Then, I should evaluate guideline-backed choices for chronic VT suppression. Next, I will compare specific agents (amiodarone, sotalol, disopyramide, procainamide) for efficacy and safety in HOCM. After that, I need to address acute VT termination versus chronic prevention. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring caveats and alternatives such as catheter ablation, making sure each step aligns with high-credibility guidance and data.

> Let me first confirm the treatment hierarchy so I don't jump to conclusions about "preferred agents" without context: in HCM/HOCM with sustained VT or cardiac arrest, ICD therapy is the cornerstone for secondary prevention, and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) are adjuncts to reduce recurrent VT or ICD shocks or when an ICD is not feasible, which I should verify against both U.S. and European guidelines [^111DAcwc] [^114kKgsB] [^112hC61m] [^116Fpbtc].

> Next, I should review when antiarrhythmics are actually indicated in this setting; I need to ensure I'm not overstating their role, since guidelines frame AADs for recurrent symptomatic VA or to reduce ICD therapies and, when an ICD cannot be implanted or is declined, they suggest amiodarone as the agent to consider in HCM patients with sustained VT/VF, which I should double-check [^111DAcwc] [^116Fpbtc].

> Now, I will examine specific agents for chronic VT suppression; my initial take is that amiodarone is preferred based on broader efficacy in structural heart disease and explicit HCM guidance, but wait, let me verify the comparative data: network meta-analysis shows amiodarone reduces VT recurrence and ICD shocks and is superior to sotalol for recurrence, and guidelines explicitly name amiodarone in HCM when ICD is not feasible, while the U.S. label covers life-threatening recurrent VT/VF, all of which supports amiodarone's primacy in this context [^111nyDCT] [^114i4UBo] [^114BZsLB] [^1148gwhd].

> I should consider sotalol as a potential alternative if amiodarone is contraindicated or not tolerated, but I need to check its relative effectiveness; the same meta-analysis suggests higher VT recurrences and more ICD shocks with sotalol compared with amiodarone, and guidelines list sotalol as an option in structural disease though not specifically preferred in HCM VT, so I'll keep it as second-line, being mindful of torsades risk and careful QT monitoring [^111nyDCT] [^112Sxnqw] [^115dG9eE].

> Hold on, I initially thought disopyramide might be helpful for VT because it's used in HOCM, but wait, let me verify its actual role; disopyramide is leveraged for its negative inotropy to reduce LVOT gradients and improve symptoms, not as a preferred agent for ventricular arrhythmia suppression, and it carries anticholinergic side effects with relatively high discontinuation rates, so it should not be chosen for VT control in HOCM unless there is some other compelling non-VT indication, which I should explicitly state [^113xDUH5].

> For acute termination, I started to default to "IV amiodarone first", but hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check guideline nuances for stable monomorphic VT; ESC 2022 actually recommends IV procainamide for hemodynamically tolerated sustained monomorphic VT in structural heart disease, with IV amiodarone also reasonable when diagnosis is not established, and small comparative studies suggest procainamide may outperform lidocaine and sometimes amiodarone for acute termination, so I need to correct my initial reflex and individualize based on hemodynamics and availability [^113nXzXR] [^1115ojJn] [^1156c25q] [^117QNhyh].

> Let me think about HOCM-specific hemodynamics so I don't inadvertently worsen obstruction; beta-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line for obstructive symptoms, and medications that reduce preload/afterload like nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors should be avoided if possible in patients with resting or provocable LVOTO, while for VT suppression specifically, stand-alone beta-blockade is often insufficient and guidelines support adding amiodarone when clinically indicated [^114CvxZJ] [^112N9mVq] [^114BZsLB].

> I should also review nonpharmacologic escalation if VT persists despite AADs or if AADs are contraindicated; the ESC 2022 VA/SCD guideline advises considering catheter ablation in selected HCM patients with recurrent sustained monomorphic VT or recurrent ICD shocks when drugs are ineffective or not tolerated, and contemporary HCM VT ablation series show encouraging acute success and medium-term VT freedom, though multiple procedures may be needed in some substrates, so I must include ablation as an important pathway alongside ICD optimization and AADs [^111enbHK] [^1167YVWr].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: for HOCM patients with VT, the preferred antiarrhythmic agent for chronic suppression is amiodarone, used adjunctively to ICD when possible or as primary pharmacologic therapy when an ICD is not feasible, given guideline endorsement, superior efficacy versus sotalol, and a favorable hemodynamic profile in obstructive physiology, while closely monitoring for thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary toxicity and drug interactions and considering sotalol only when amiodarone is unsuitable, with ablation reserved for recurrent VT or shocks despite optimized therapy [^114i4UBo] [^114BZsLB] [^111nyDCT] [^111enbHK] [^1148gwhd].

---

Amiodarone is the **preferred antiarrhythmic for HOCM with VT** because it is the most effective agent for suppressing ventricular arrhythmias in structural heart disease [^111nyDCT] and is recommended by major guidelines when an ICD is not feasible [^114i4UBo] or as adjunct therapy to reduce ICD shocks [^114BZsLB]. Sotalol is a **reasonable alternative** if amiodarone is not tolerated or contraindicated, but is less effective [^111nyDCT] [^115dG9eE]. Disopyramide is used for symptom control in obstructive HCM but is not effective for VT suppression [^113xDUH5]. ICD implantation is the cornerstone for secondary prevention [^114kKgsB] [^113subq9], and catheter ablation is considered for recurrent VT despite medical therapy [^111enbHK].

## Pharmacological management of VT in HOCM

### Amiodarone

- **Mechanism of action**: Class III antiarrhythmic that prolongs repolarization and refractory period, suppressing ventricular arrhythmias.

- **Efficacy**: Highly effective in suppressing VT in structural heart disease, including HOCM [^111nyDCT].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Recommended by ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines for HCM patients with sustained VT or VF when ICD is not feasible or preferred [^114i4UBo]. Also recommended by ESC 2014 guidelines for symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias or recurrent ICD shocks despite optimal treatment and device reprogramming [^114BZsLB] [^111DAcwc].

- **Limitations**: Long-term use associated with pulmonary, hepatic, thyroid, and ocular toxicity; requires regular monitoring [^1148gwhd].

---

### Sotalol

- **Mechanism of action**: Class III antiarrhythmic with beta-blocking properties, prolonging repolarization and refractory period.

- **Efficacy**: Moderately effective in suppressing VT, but less effective than amiodarone [^111nyDCT].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Considered as an alternative to amiodarone, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate amiodarone [^115dG9eE].

- **Limitations**: Risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; requires careful monitoring of QT interval and renal function.

---

### Disopyramide

- **Mechanism of action**: Class IA antiarrhythmic with negative inotropic effects, reducing LVOT gradient and symptoms in obstructive HCM [^113xDUH5].

- **Efficacy**: Effective for symptom control in obstructive HCM but not specifically effective for VT suppression [^1121vsyK].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Recommended for symptom control in obstructive HCM, particularly in patients with significant LVOT obstruction [^114mYMvY].

- **Limitations**: Anticholinergic side effects, QT prolongation, and proarrhythmic potential [^115s8wsZ] [^111M7hFX].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

### Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)

An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is **indicated for secondary prevention** in patients with sustained VT or VF [^114kKgsB] and for **primary prevention** in high-risk patients [^116xX1aW]. It is **highly effective at preventing sudden cardiac death** in HOCM [^112Hodrz]. Limitations include device-related complications, inappropriate shocks, and psychological effects.

---

### Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is **considered for patients with recurrent, symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT** or for those experiencing ICD shocks despite antiarrhythmic therapy [^111enbHK] [^111nyDCT]. Acute success rates are 70–85%, with approximately 50–70% achieving long-term freedom from VT recurrence [^1167YVWr]. As an invasive procedure, it carries risks such as vascular injury, cardiac perforation, and arrhythmia recurrence.

## Comparative summary of antiarrhythmic drugs

| **Drug** | **Efficacy for VT** | **Guideline recommendation** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amiodarone | High | Strongly recommended | Long-term toxicity |
| Sotalol | Moderate | Alternative option | QT prolongation |
| Disopyramide | Low (for VT) | Symptom control in obstructive HCM | Anticholinergic side effects |

---

## Clinical considerations

Selection of antiarrhythmic therapy should consider **patient-specific factors** — age, comorbidities, renal function, and medication tolerance [^114i4UBo]. **Regular monitoring** of the QT interval, renal function, and potential drug interactions is essential [^111DAcwc]. Beta-blockers are often combined with antiarrhythmic drugs to enhance efficacy and reduce arrhythmia burden [^111ubqPb].

---

Amiodarone is the **preferred antiarrhythmic drug for managing VT in HOCM patients** [^114i4UBo], with sotalol as an alternative [^115dG9eE]. Disopyramide is used for symptom control in obstructive HCM but is not effective for VT suppression [^113xDUH5] [^1121vsyK]. ICD implantation and catheter ablation are important non-pharmacological options for recurrent VT [^113subq9] [^111enbHK].

### Cardiac myosin inhibitors as a novel treatment option for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Addressing the core of the matter [^111M7hFX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The initial approach to treatment of symptomatic patients with oHCM includes beta-blockers (BB), non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), and disopyramide. BB and CCB act as weak negative inotropes and are often insufficient to control symptoms. In addition, these agents are commonly associated with side effects and chronotropic incompetence.

Disopyramide is employed as a second-line therapy, is safe and often effective in expert hands, but its use is limited by anticholinergic side effects and efficacy may diminish with time, so that SRTs ultimately become necessary. Disopyramide also suffers from supply shortages and lack of confidence by physicians, many of whom are reluctant to use class I anti-arrhythmic agents in structural heart disease. Notably, none of these time-honored medications have undergone rigorous evaluation with large multicenter randomized clinical trials.

- **Recent findings**: A recent crossover trial showed that BB decrease LVOT gradients and improve symptoms but without improving peak oxygen consumption (pVO₂).

Importantly, SRTs are effective in palliating symptoms and possibly improving longevity in oHCM patients, but do not address the core mechanisms of disease at the functional and energetic level. Thus, the natural evolution of the cardiomyopathic process is not affected. In a survey-based study of 753 patients (with a median age at survey of 64 years) undergoing myectomy, 26% reported new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) during follow-up, increasing to 37% among those followed over 10 years. As AF is an important marker of disease progression…

### Mid-ventricular obstruction is associated with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^111gL5Lh]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiac disease with a prevalence of approximately 0.2%–0.5% in the general population. The majority of HCM patients have a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) at rest or with provocation. HCM patients with mid-ventricular obstruction (MVO), which is impedance to flow at the middle of the left ventricle, represent a less common subtype of HCM. However, MVO is associated with ventricular arrhythmia and a worse prognosis. Most studies concerning the relationship between HCM with MVO and ventricular arrhythmia were limited to case reports or small series. Moreover, no studies have specifically focused on the relationship between HCM with MVO and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), a strong predictor of sudden cardiac death in patients with HCM. This study hypothesizes that the severity of MVO affects the incidence of NSVT in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

Two review authors will independently use the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, considering factors such as risk of bias, consistency, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. In the case of differing GRADE assessments, any disagreements will be resolved through discussion, and, if necessary, consultation with a third review author for adjudication. The findings of the review will be presented in a summary of findings table.

The following critical and important outcomes will be included in the summary of findings table:

- **Change in exercise capacity**: Measured by pVO₂ on cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
- **Need for septal reduction therapy**.
- **All‐cause mortality**.
- **Change in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient**.
- **Change in HCM symptoms**.
- **Hospitalisations due to heart failure**.
- **Malignant ventricular arrhythmias**.

The time frames will be the maximum follow‐up time reported for each outcome. If there are no results available for an outcome at 24 weeks or later, it will not be included in the summary of findings table.

The review will follow the GRADE checklist and use the definitions provided by the GRADE Working Group. Any judgements and justifications about the certainty of evidence will be documented in the footnotes of the summary of findings table for each outcome.

The GRADE approach categorises the certainty of evidence into four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low.

- **High certainty**: Very confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect.
- **Moderate certainty**: Belief that the estimated effect is likely to be close to the true effect, but there is a possibility that it could be substantially different.

### Mavacamten: A first-in-class myosin inhibitor for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113xDUH5]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

First-line treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) includes oral beta-blockers and/or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Both drug classes slow heart rate, and their modest negative inotropic actions may provide some reduction of intracardiac obstruction. Disopyramide, an antiarrhythmic, may be added because of its additional negative inotropic action, but its anticholinergic side effects are frequent limitations. While these three drug classes have been the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for decades, their use is largely supported by observational studies, none of which address the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease.

Septal reduction therapy (SRT), either septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation, is recommended for patients with symptomatic oHCM who are refractory to medical treatment. Septal reduction therapy substantially improves symptoms and quality of life, but may not be appropriate for patients with serious comorbidities or frailty, and others who may prefer not to undergo an invasive procedure. To be effective and safe, these procedures require substantial operator experience, which is limited to a few centers of excellence and is not accessible to the majority of patients worldwide. Therefore, medical management of oHCM remains a major unmet need.

### Safety of outpatient initiation of disopyramide for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients [^115s8wsZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Follow-up: No patients were lost to short-term follow-up. The median long-term follow-up was 447 days (IQR, 201–779). Fifteen patients (9%) who were lost to long-term follow-up had a median follow-up period of 263 days (IQR, 147–491) before loss of contact.

During short-term follow-up, a single patient experienced syncope 2 months after disopyramide initiation. However, the circumstances of this event were typical of a vasovagal episode. A second patient had seizures 10 weeks after starting disopyramide; however, he had suffered similar episodes prior to this drug's prescription, and the event was not thought to be associated with disopyramide. During long-term follow-up (255 patient-years), 2 patients (1%) suffered syncopal episodes of uncertain cause 7 and 39 months after disopyramide was started. The first patient had a baseline QTc interval of 445 ms. On 400 and 600 mg of disopyramide, his QTc intervals were 475 and 455 ms, respectively. The second patient had a baseline QTc of 410 ms. He then developed stress-induced cardiomyopathy with deep inverted T waves and a QTc of 600 ms. His disopyramide was stopped, and he went on to have a successful myectomy. No patients suffered cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death, and no appropriate ICD therapies were delivered.

Disopyramide was discontinued by 74 patients (44%) during follow-up. Reasons for discontinuation included side effects in 18 patients (11% of those started on disopyramide) and lack of clinical improvement in 56 patients (33%).

Septal reduction interventions were performed in 55 patients, with 8 undergoing alcohol septal ablations and 47 having myectomies. Thus, of…

### Substrate ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy for symptomatic ventricular tachycardia [^111ubqPb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) reduce ICD shocks, but the most effective approach remains uncertain.

- **Objectives**: This trial compares the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation vs AAD as first-line therapy in ICD patients with symptomatic ventricular tachycardias (VTs).

- **Methods**: The SURVIVE-VT (Substrate Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Symptomatic Ventricular Tachycardia) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial including patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and appropriate ICD shock. Patients were randomized 1:1 to complete endocardial substrate-based catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic therapy (amiodarone plus beta-blockers, amiodarone alone, or sotalol ± beta-blockers). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, appropriate ICD shock, unplanned hospitalization for worsening heart failure, or severe treatment-related complications.

- **Results**: In this trial, 144 patients (median age, 70 years; 96% male) were randomized to catheter ablation (71 patients) or AAD (73 patients). After 24 months, the primary outcome occurred in 28.2% of patients in the ablation group and 46.6% of those in the AAD group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.30–0.90; P = 0.021). This difference was driven by a significant reduction in severe treatment-related complications (9.9% vs 28.8%, HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13–0.71; P = 0.006). Eight patients were hospitalized for heart failure in the ablation group and 13 in the AAD group (HR: 0.56; 95%).

### Antidysrhythmic drug therapy for the termination of stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: A systematic review [^1156c25q]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of the literature to compare the efficacy of different drug therapies for the termination of stable, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).

- **Methods**: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane for trials from 1965 through July 2013 using a search strategy derived from the following clinical question in PICO format:
	- **Patients**: Adults (≥ 18 years) with stable monomorphic VT.
	- **Intervention**: Intravenous antidysrhythmic drug.
	- **Comparator**: Intravenous lidocaine or amiodarone.
	- **Outcome**: Termination of VT. For all drug comparisons, we calculated relative risks (RR; 95% CI) and number needed to treat (NNT, 95% CI) between drugs. We also evaluated the methodological quality of the studies.

- **Results**: Our search yielded 219 articles through PubMed and 390 articles through EMBASE. Three prospective studies (n = 93 patients) and two retrospective studies (n = 173 patients) met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. From the prospective studies, the RR of VT termination was: procainamide versus lidocaine, 3.7 (1.3–10.5); ajmaline versus lidocaine, 5.3 (1.4–20.5); and sotalol versus lidocaine, 3.9 (1.3–11.5). From the retrospective studies: procainamide versus lidocaine, RR = 2.2 (1.2–4.0); and procainamide versus amiodarone, RR = 4.3 (0.8–23.6). All five reviewed studies had quality issues, including potential bias in randomization and concealment.

- **Conclusions**: Based on limited evidence from small, heterogeneous human studies, procainamide, ajmaline, and sotalol were all superior to lidocaine for the treatment of stable, monomorphic VT; amiodarone was not.

This executive summary of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy clinical practice guideline provides recommendations and algorithms for clinicians to diagnose and manage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adult and pediatric patients, as well as supporting documentation to encourage their use.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports, and other relevant databases.

- **Structure**: Many recommendations from the earlier hypertrophic cardiomyopathy guidelines have been updated with new evidence or a better understanding of earlier evidence. This summary operationalizes the recommendations from the full guideline and presents a combination of diagnostic work-up, genetic and family screening, risk stratification approaches, lifestyle modifications, surgical and catheter interventions, and medications that constitute components of guideline-directed medical therapy. For both guideline-directed medical therapy and other recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader is advised to follow dosing, contraindications, and drug-drug interactions based on product insert materials.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114R7f6x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Kaplan‐Meier 10‐year event‐free survival analysis was conducted for atrial fibrillation, sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, heart failure, all‐cause death, and composite cardiovascular events stratified by nonobstructive, labile, and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) groups.

We performed additional analysis of the labile HCM group, which demonstrated the best event‐free survival. Of the 261 patients with labile HCM, 103 (39%) had NYHA class II to III symptoms, and 158 (61%) were asymptomatic (NYHA class I). There were 14 composite events in symptomatic patients, including 5 cases of new‐onset atrial fibrillation (AF), 8 cases of new‐onset or worsening heart failure (HF), and 1 death. On the other hand, asymptomatic patients had 8 composite events, with 1 case of new‐onset AF, 4 cases of new‐onset ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF), 1 case of new‐onset or worsening HF, and 2 deaths. Symptomatic patients had significantly higher risks of HF (P = 0.006) and composite endpoints (P = 0.028). Examining only the 391 asymptomatic patients in our study, labile HCM still carried a better prognosis than the other two groups (nonobstructive versus labile versus obstructive, 15% versus 5% versus 26%; P < 0.001).

For composite cardiovascular outcomes, patients with labile HCM had the best, and patients with obstructive HCM had the worst, event‐free survival at the end of follow‐up. Both obstructive and nonobstructive HCM were independent predictors of cardiovascular events compared with the labile group.

The emergence of two distinctly different methods for risk stratifying patients for primary prevention ICD implants, as advocated by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology versus the European Society of Cardiology, ultimately presents the managing cardiologist with the dilemma of which strategy to consider for each individual HCM patient. These decisions inevitably involve a choice regarding the treatment "seesaw" both physician and patient prefer or accept: one that is more likely to protect a greater number of patients from sudden death risk at the cost of a small degree of overtreatment, or alternatively, an approach that may miss some high-risk patients but is associated with less device overtreatment. Within this framework, it is appropriate to assess the two different methods available for identifying high-risk HCM patients for primary prevention ICDs.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically in managing obstructive symptoms, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are recommended. The ESC 2023 guidelines suggest considering the restoration of sinus rhythm or ensuring appropriate rate control before invasive management of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in patients with new-onset or poorly controlled atrial fibrillation (AF).

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of amiodarone or sotalol. This is advised for patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ICD who experience spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias or appropriate shocks despite optimal device programming and treatment with a β-blocker.

### Evolving indications for permanent pacemakers [^1152zePw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

New indications for permanent cardiac pacing have been developed in recent years, with numerous studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes in a variety of disorders. Because hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, neurocardiogenic syncope, and atrial fibrillation are common conditions, every clinician should be aware of evolving alternative therapies for them. Observational studies in patients with refractory, symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and significant left ventricular outflow gradient at rest suggest that cardiac pacing may result in symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement.

However, clinical trials have not shown conclusive evidence regarding the long-term benefit from pacing in these patients, and it is unclear whether pacing will be a preferred treatment option. Preliminary data suggest that pacing is a viable adjunctive therapeutic approach for improving symptoms in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Mortality benefit has yet to be established, but it is hoped that ongoing randomized clinical trials will provide definitive information on that issue.

Patients with refractory neurocardiogenic syncope or those who are intolerant of medical treatment may benefit from pacing therapies, especially those that use rate-drop sensor algorithms. Biatrial pacing has emerged as a technique that resynchronizes atrial electrical activity and has been shown to prevent atrial fibrillation. Multisite atrial pacing for the prevention of atrial fibrillation is considered investigational but seems promising.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically in relation to indications for ICD implantation, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend ICD implantation for patients with HCM who have survived a sudden cardiac arrest due to VT or VF, or who have spontaneous sustained VT causing syncope or hemodynamic compromise, provided the expected meaningful survival is greater than one year.

### Use of antiarrhythmic medications in Medicare Part D patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and ventricular tachycardia [^11758pi7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is common in cardiomyopathy patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. This analysis evaluated antiarrhythmic medication use and change in use over time in patients with VT and structural heart disease. Query of Medicare claims identified patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and VT, excluding those with atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia.

Two cohorts were created of patients enrolled in Medicare Part D for the 12 months before 2007 and 2012. Patients were identified through a search for antiarrhythmic medication fills with a supply covering January 1 of the cohort year. Adjusted logistic regression modeling evaluated the association between patient characteristics and antiarrhythmic medication use.

The 2007 (n = 2,334) and 2012 (n = 3,892) Medicare Part D cohorts had similar demographics: median age 76 years, 64%-67% male, and 87%-89% white. Of the 2007 cohort, 1,380 (59%) patients were on a beta blocker, and 484 (20.7%) were on an antiarrhythmic medication (70% amiodarone and 20% sotalol). Between 2007 and 2012, there was a statistically significant higher use of any antiarrhythmic medication (p = 0.014), beta blockers (p < 0.0001), mexiletine (p = 0.005), and ranolazine (p < 0.0001), while amiodarone use remained unchanged (p = 0.53).

After multivariable adjustment, male gender and renal disease were associated with higher antiarrhythmic medication use. In conclusion, although antiarrhythmic medication and beta blocker use in patients with VT increased over time, less than one in four patients were on a specific antiarrhythmic medication.

### Differing strategies for sudden death prevention in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113bnx9v]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

Finally, although it is difficult to envision directly combining the AHA/ACC and ESC strategies to derive recommendations for ICDs in the same patient, some cardiologists (and 2020 AHA/ACC HCM guidelines) regard quantifying future risk with 5-year SD event rate estimates taken from the risk score as useful in ICD decision making (figure 2).

However, notably, there can be substantial variability in how individual patients perceive SD risk and the impact of this information on treatment decisions to prevent SD. For this reason, objectifying risk stratification by assigning strict ICD recommendations to binary risk estimates — high (ICD should be considered) versus low risk (ICD should not be considered) — can be challenging for effectively implementing ICD decision making in a nuanced disease such as HCM. Also, many HCM patients find it difficult to personally relate to mortality rates in real-life terms, particularly considering that the difference in annual risk conveyed by the highest and lowest ESC risk score categories is only about 1% per year.

In conclusion, ICDs have interrupted the course of HCM in many patients over the past 20 years, terminating potentially lethal ventricular–tachyarrhythmias and irrevocably altering the clinical landscape. The ICD is arguably the most important therapeutic innovation in this complex and often inherited heart disease. The selection of high-risk HCM patients for ICD implants has evolved greatly with the maturation of the AHA/ACC major risk maker strategy and the introduction of a novel statistical risk model from ESC.

While these strategies differ, they represent significant advancements in managing this challenging condition.

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in managing PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend considering catheter ablation for patients who require arrhythmia suppression due to symptoms or declining ventricular function. This approach is suggested when frequent premature ventricular complexes (generally > 15% of beats and predominantly of one morphology) are suspected to be the cause, and if antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not preferred by the patient.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2023 guidelines address therapeutic procedures for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, particularly concerning permanent pacing. They recommend considering the placement of a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator instead of a single-lead device. This approach aims to reduce the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient or facilitate medical treatment with β-blockers and/or verapamil. This recommendation applies to patients with resting or provocable left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) ≥ 50 mmHg, sinus rhythm, and drug-refractory symptoms, where there is an indication for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

### Clinical outcomes of radiofrequency catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1167YVWr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

This systematic review of six studies (three from the United States and three from Japan) incorporated a total of 68 drug‐refractory HCM patients who underwent VT radiofrequency catheter ablation (mean age 57.6 ± 13.3 years, mean LVEF 45.8 ± 15.4%, 85% men, maximum septal wall thickness 17.40 ± 4.6 mm, 32.3% with an apical aneurysm, and 79.4% had open‐irrigated catheter ablation). Sixty‐one (89.7%) patients were on at least one antiarrhythmic drug, including amiodarone (69%), lidocaine (20%), mexiletine (17.5%), sotalol (17.5%), procainamide (5%), and disopyramide (2%). Combined epicardial‐endocardial ablation was performed in 41.2% of patients, while 50% and 9% underwent endocardial‐only and epicardial‐only ablation, respectively. Acute procedural success was achieved in 84.5% of patients (95% CI: 70.6%–95.2%), with 27.9% of patients having reVT requiring multiple ablations (median 1, IQR 1–3).

During the follow‐up period (18.3 ± 11.7 months), the pooled incidence of freedom from reVT after the index procedure was 70.2% (95% CI: 51.9%–86.2%), while after the last ablation it was 82.8% (95% CI: 57.0%–99.2%). In subgroup analysis, the pooled incidence of acute procedure success (96.45%; 95% CI: 87.9%–100%; I² = 0% vs. 85%; 95% CI: 68.5%–97.1%; I² = 0%; p interaction = 0.02) and freedom from reVT after last ablation (96.45%; 95% CI: 87.9%–100%; I² = 0% vs. 79.7%; 95% CI: 51.3%–98.9%; I² = 10%; p interaction = 0.03) was significantly higher in HCM patients with AA compared to dilated‐phase HCM patients, respectively. Furthermore, ablation for VT in HCM patients showed promising results in improving clinical outcomes.

### Differing strategies for sudden death prevention in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^117A52gz]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

Over the last several decades, the efficacy of the risk marker strategy for sudden death prevention in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been extensively reported in both adults and children. Selected for primary and secondary implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy, these subjects were largely part of retrospective clinical investigations conducted predominantly in the United States, Canada, and Europe. These studies consistently demonstrated that in high-risk HCM patients identified through the AHA/ACC risk marker strategy, primary prevention ICDs reliably terminated ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) at an average age of 45 years, with about one-third of patients experiencing multiple device therapies. However, prior registry studies have largely been confined to select high-risk patient populations with ICDs, exhibiting limited sensitivity and specificity in predicting future sudden death events.

A number of contemporary studies have assessed the overall efficacy of the major risk factor strategy. The largest of these efforts is a 17-year consecutive prospective patient analysis. This study demonstrated, with a sensitivity of 95%, the reliable selection of patients who experienced appropriate device therapy from prophylactically implanted ICDs, thereby aborting potential sudden death events and interrupting the natural history of the disease. Patients selected for ICDs and who received appropriate device therapy outnumbered by 50-fold those patients not selected for ICDs but who experienced sudden death events. Furthermore, 40% of the small number of patients who died suddenly had been advised of their high-risk status but declined a prophylactic ICD.

### Antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation in the management of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111nyDCT]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2019). High credibility.

In patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), shocks are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation (CA) in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) in patients with an ICD.

- **Methods**: An electronic database search for randomized controlled trials that evaluated antiarrhythmic drugs and CA in patients with ICD was conducted. The primary outcome was VT recurrence. Secondary outcomes were ICD shocks and any deaths. Bayesian and frequentist network meta-analyses were performed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs)/CIs.

- **Results**: Twenty-two randomized controlled trials were identified (3828 total patients; age 64.3 ± 11.4; 79% males). The use of amiodarone was associated with a significantly reduced rate of VT recurrence compared with control (HR = 0.34 [95% CrI = 0.15–0.74]; absolute risk difference = -0.23 [95% CrI = -0.23 to -0.09]; number needed to treat = 4). Sotalol was associated with increased risk of VT recurrence compared with amiodarone (HR = 2.88 [95% CrI = 1.35–6.46]). Compared with control, amiodarone (HR = 0.33 [95% CrI = 0.15–0.76]; absolute risk difference = -0.17 [95% CrI = -0.32 to -0.06]; number needed to treat = 6) and CA (HR = 0.52 [95% CrI = 0.30–0.89]; absolute risk difference = -0.12 [95% CrI = -0.24 to -0.03]; number needed to treat = 8) were associated with significantly reduced ICD shocks. Compared with amiodarone, sotalol was associated with significantly increased ICD shocks (HR = 2.70 [95% CrI = 1.35–6.46]).

### Ventricular arrhythmias in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Prevalence, distribution, predictors, and outcome [^111pfhfA]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) carries an increased risk of sudden cardiac death, with ventricular fibrillation (VF) thought to be the common culprit arrhythmia.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence and predictors of sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VTAs) in HCM patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed all patients with HCM and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) from a prospectively derived registry in two tertiary medical centers. Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, ICD interrogation, and genetic data were collected and compared. The comparison was first made between patients with and without VTAs, and then between patients with only VF and those with ventricular tachycardia (VT) with or without VF.

- **Results**: Of the 1328 HCM patients, 207 (145 [70%] male; mean age 33 ± 16 years) were implanted with ICDs. Over a mean follow-up of 10 ± 6 years, 37 patients with ICDs (18%) developed sustained VTAs. These VTAs were associated with a family history of sudden cardiac death and a personal history of VTAs (P = 0.036 and P = 0.001, respectively). Sustained monomorphic VT was the most common arrhythmia (n = 26, 70%) and was linked to decreased left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and increased LV end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters. Antitachycardia pacing (ATP) successfully terminated 258 (79%) of the 326 VT events. Mortality rates were comparable between patients with and without VTAs (4 [11%] vs 29 [17%]; p = 0.42) and between those with and without ICDs (24 [16%] vs 85 [20%]; p = 0.367).

- **Conclusion**: VT, rather than VF, is the most common arrhythmia associated with HCM.

### Ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and defibrillators: Triggers, treatment, and implications [^113SQJU7]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Triggers and ICD interventions of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) offer insight into mechanisms and treatment.

- **Methods and results**: Intracardiac ICD electrograms from 71 HCM patients in the HCM I and II studies were analyzed by three individuals. Rhythms were defined as VF (polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia), VT (monomorphic ventricular tachycardia), and ventricular flutter (VFL; VT ≥ 240 bpm). Physical activity and rhythm preceding the arrhythmia were ascertained. Of 149 arrhythmias, VF was present in 74, VT in 57, and VFL in 18. In those whose activity was known, moderate or intense physical activity was associated with over 50% of the tachycardias (57 of 111). Rhythms preceding ventricular arrhythmias were often sinus tachycardia (49 of 149; 33%) or rapid atrial fibrillation (7 of 149; 5%). VF and VFL were more likely preceded by supraventricular rhythms > 100 bpm (30 of 68 with VF; 44%; 12 of 16 with VFL; 75% vs. 14 of 50 with VT; 28%; P = 0.001). Antitachycardia pacing (ATP) was successful in 39 of 53 (74%). Multiple shocks were more often required to terminate VFL (10 of 18; 56%) compared to VF (10 of 72; 14%) and VT (2 of 25; 8%; P < 0.0001). Of arrhythmias requiring more than one shock to terminate, 16 of 22 were preceded by sinus tachycardia and/or moderate or extreme physical activity.

- **Conclusions**: Rapid supraventricular rhythms, and at least moderate activity, frequently precede VT and VF, and when they occur in these situations often require multiple ICD shocks to restore sinus rhythm. ATP is successful in many cases.

Indications of ICD and status of defibrillator deployment at registration

In 85 patients with prior sustained VT/VF at registration, 74 (87%) received defibrillator implantation as secondary prevention [see table 1]. Table 2 and figure 2 show indications of ICD for primary prevention according to the guidelines (2018 JCS/JHFS, 2023 ESC, 2024 AHA/ACC guidelines) in 1400 patients with HCM without prior sustained VT/VF at registration. Among the three HCM guidelines, different distributions of the number of classified patients were observed. In the group classified by the 2023 ESC, the percentage of class IIa was 4%. In contrast, the percentages of class IIa in the 2018 JCS/JHFS and 2024 AHA/ACC guidelines were 22% and 28%, respectively.

- **Table 2**: Indications of ICD for primary prevention according to the guidelines in 1400 patients with HCM without VT/VF and the status of defibrillator implantation at registration.

The status of defibrillator implantation at registration in each class is also shown in table 2 and figure 2. In 51 patients in class IIa judged by the 2023 ESC guidelines, 20 (39%) had defibrillator deployment. The percentages of patients with defibrillator implantation in class IIa according to the 2018 JCS/JHFS and 2024 AHA/ACC guidelines were [values appear potentially incomplete].

### Dofetilide for the treatment of premature ventricular complexes and ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease [^116HWWEn]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Efficacy of dofetilide for VT**: In patients treated with dofetilide for VT, long-term freedom from VT requiring ICD shocks was approximately 50%. In comparison, prior trials of sotalol and amiodarone have reported VT-free survival rates of over 70%, suggesting dofetilide is inferior to these agents. However, unlike the present study, the patients in these prior studies had not failed catheter ablation.

- **Efficacy of dofetilide and sotalol**: One randomized crossover trial has directly compared dofetilide and sotalol. In this study, these agents demonstrated similar efficacy in suppression of VT (35%). Importantly, the efficacy of dofetilide and sotalol was not concordant in the majority of randomized patients. The patients in the included study differ from the present study in that all patients had ischemic heart disease, often with ventricular aneurysms (35%).

- **Efficacy of dofetilide for PVCs**: The efficacy of dofetilide in the treatment of PVCs in this study was lower than in a prior randomized trial, in which intravenous dofetilide was associated with a greater than 80% reduction in PVCs in 50% of patients compared to placebo. Importantly, this study employed a higher dosage of intravenous dofetilide (7.5 µg/kg) and assessed short-term efficacy. Additionally, the patients in the study had failed treatment with catheter ablation and other antiarrhythmic therapies and may be more treatment-resistant. As prior investigations demonstrate a higher efficacy of PVC suppression with class I and other class III agents, dofetilide may have utility only in the narrow population of patients who cannot tolerate these medications.

### Nexterone [^112qdajH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint was the rate of VT/VF episodes per hour. For both studies, the median rate was 0.02 episodes per hour in patients receiving the high dose and 0.07 episodes per hour in patients receiving the low dose, or approximately 0.5 versus 1.7 episodes per day (p = 0.07, 2-sided, in both studies). In one study, the time to the first episode of VT/VF was significantly prolonged — approximately 10 hours in patients receiving the low dose and 14 hours in patients receiving the high dose. In both studies, significantly fewer supplemental infusions were given to patients in the high-dose group. At the end of double-blind therapy or after 48 hours, all patients were given open access to whatever treatment, including intravenous amiodarone, was deemed necessary. Mortality was not affected in these studies.

### Evaluation and management of ventricular tachycardia in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [^114prLMk]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is an important cause of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Recommendations for the treatment of VT in patients with structural heart disease mainly rely on data derived from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Unlike post-infarction ischemic cardiomyopathy, DCM comprises multiple different etiologies with variable disease progression and prognosis, often requiring an individualized approach to risk stratification and treatment. Prevention of VT recurrence in DCM is challenging, especially when antiarrhythmic drugs are ineffective or contraindicated.

The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is capable of terminating but not preventing VT. Catheter ablation is the standard for substrate-based treatment in DCM. However, available data from recent studies on VT ablation in DCM are inconsistent, and the morphological and functional features of the arrhythmogenic substrates are poorly defined. Advanced substrate-based research is required to increase the understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms and improve ablation outcomes in this heterogeneous patient population.

### Efficacy and tolerability of quinidine as salvage therapy for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease [^114BsLjD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). High credibility.

Quinidine is an effective therapy for a subset of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) syndromes; however, the efficacy of quinidine in scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MMVT) is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: Between 2009 and 2020 at a single VT referral center, a total of 23 patients with MMVT and structural heart disease (age 66.7 ± 10.9, 20 males, 15 with ischemic cardiomyopathy, mean LVEF 22.2 ± 12.3%, 9 with left ventricular assist device [LVAD]) were treated with quinidine (14 quinidine gluconate; 996 ± 321mg, 8 quinidine sulfate; 1062 ± 588mg). Quinidine was used in combination with other antiarrhythmics (AAD) in 19 patients, with 13 also on amiodarone. All patients had previously failed more than one AAD (amiodarone 100%, mexiletine 73%, sotalol 32%, other 32%) and eight had prior ablations with a median of 1.5. Quinidine was initiated in cases of VT storm despite AADs (6 patients), inability to tolerate other AADs (4 patients), or recurrent VT (12 patients). Ventricular arrhythmias recurred despite quinidine in 13 (59%) patients at a median of 26 (4–240) days after quinidine initiation. In patients with recurrent MMVT, the VT cycle length increased from 359 to 434ms (p = .02). Six (27.3%) patients remained on quinidine at 1 year, with recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in all. Adverse effects included gastrointestinal side effects (6 patients), QT prolongation (2 patients), rash (1 patient), thrombocytopenia (1 patient), and neurologic side effects (1 patient). One patient discontinued due to cost.

- **Conclusion**: Quinidine therapy has limited tolerability and long-term efficacy when used in the management of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease.

### Safety, side effects and relative efficacy of medications for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1123U1Bi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, often poorly tolerated, and difficult to treat. Limited data exists regarding the safety and efficacy of drug therapy for AF rhythm control in HC patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with HC followed for more than six months, treated with amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, or disopyramide for rhythm control of non-postoperative AF. The duration on each medication, reasons for discontinuation, and incidences of adverse events were recorded. Confounding factors, including maximum ventricular septal thickness, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and gender, were assessed.

Ninety-eight patients had 130 drug treatments (defined as a continuous time on one drug). Twenty-three patients were treated with more than one medication. The probability of remaining on a single antiarrhythmic drug at one year was 62%, and at three years was 42%. Maximum ventricular septal thickness (hazard ratio 1.05, p = 0.03) and the presence of resting outflow gradient (hazard ratio 2.50, p = 0.002) were associated with discontinuation of therapy.

Patients treated with amiodarone or sotalol had no serious safety events, suggesting that these medications may be reasonably safe. Amiodarone was least likely to be discontinued for inefficacy (8.5%) but likely to be discontinued for side effects (19%). The probability of remaining on sotalol was 74% at one year and 50% at three years, and it was only discontinued for side effects in 2% of cases. A small number of patients were treated with disopyramide and dofetilide.

In conclusion, our data suggest that amiodarone and sotalol are…

### Dofetilide reduces the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapies [^1144g75D]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and ventricular arrhythmias leading to ICD therapies often experience poor clinical outcomes and a reduced quality of life. To control these arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic agents and catheter ablation are typically required. Notably, dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic drug approved exclusively for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, its role in managing ventricular arrhythmias in patients with an ICD remains unexplored.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of dofetilide in a consecutive group of patients with an ICD and recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or ventricular fibrillation (VF) after other antiarrhythmic drugs have failed to suppress these arrhythmias.

- **Methods**: We assessed 30 patients (average age 59 ± 11 years; 5 women) with symptomatic VT or VF, all of whom had ICDs for the secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Despite ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy, these patients experienced an average of 1.8 ± 4.5 episodes of VT/VF per month. Of note, 21 patients (70%) received appropriate ICD therapies before initiating dofetilide, while the remaining 9 (30%) exhibited VTs below the programmed detection rate of the ICD. Coronary artery disease was present in 23 patients (77%), and the mean ejection fraction was 30 ± 14%, with 26 out of 30 patients (87%) suffering from congestive heart failure. All participants had failed to respond to 2 ± 1 prior antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone (n = 19) and sotalol (n = 10).

- **Results**: Within the first month of treatment, 25 patients (83%) achieved complete suppression of VT/VF. Of the 21 patients who initially required ICD therapies, 16 (76%) experienced no therapies during the first month of dofetilide treatment.

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115xtZNw]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

HCM is a long-recognized disorder that can result in severe symptoms and life-altering complications such as heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The advent of cardiac myosin inhibitors (CMIs) as targeted therapy for treating left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) represents an exciting step forward. Prospective, randomized trials have shown mavacamten to be effective and safe in relieving symptoms, potentially deferring septal reduction therapy (SRT) in a subset of oHCM patients, which has led to its FDA approval. Phase 3 trials on aficamten have completed enrollment; promising data may lead to the approval of a second CMI in oHCM patients. Several long-term clinical trials are underway and are expected to shed further light on the effect of CMIs in non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (nHCM). Furthermore, HCM is a heterogeneous disease in many ways, from its diverse disease-causing mutations, clinical presentation, outcomes, and management. Therefore, one can foresee the importance of a multidisciplinary HCM team approach that brings different specialties together to provide patients with the best evidence-based practices and tailored individual treatment plans.

### A road less traveled: Successful alcohol septal ablation via an aberrant septal coronary artery in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^1135tYG8]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Low credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment and are either poor surgical candidates or prefer a less invasive approach. Evaluation of patient-specific pre-procedural anatomy is critical as the selection of the correct coronary artery is key to successful ASA. The proximal first septal branches are the ideal target for ASA since they provide arterial supply to the basal septum associated with left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. While these arteries originate from the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 90% of patients, unusual septal perforator anatomy, including anomalous or atypical origin, is encountered in patients with HOCM.

We present a patient with HOCM who underwent successful ASA through an aberrant septal perforator originating from the ramus intermedius. This case highlights the complex coronary variability that necessitates a thorough assessment before ASA. The presence of non-LAD originating coronary vessels does not preclude ASA candidacy but does warrant further scrutiny to ensure procedural safety and success.

### Impact of race and ethnicity on use and outcomes of septal reduction therapies for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111mXTtU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM) limits functional capacity due to symptoms like dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope, which can result in sudden cardiac death. While medical therapy improves functional capacity and provides symptomatic relief for some patients, septal reduction therapy (SRT) is necessary for many patients whose symptoms do not respond to conservative management or who experience limiting medication side effects. SRT, designed to relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, can be achieved through surgical septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation.

- **Septal myectomy**: This approach is preferred in many comprehensive HCM centers but is not performed at all institutions. Limited experience has been associated with increased operative risk.

- **Alcohol septal ablation**: This technique offers early outcomes comparable with surgical myectomy. Despite the potential need for reintervention and less favorable late outflow tract gradient relief, septal ablation may be preferred for patients at high surgical risk.

However, it is unclear whether access to SRT and its benefits is equitable across all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Previous studies from single centers suggest that Black patients with HCM may be underdiagnosed and underreferred for septal myectomy. Women with HCM also tend to present later for SRT, with more severe symptoms and poorer survival rates compared to men. Additionally, marginalized races often belong to low-income groups, which, along with other soci…

### A systematic review of present and future pharmaco-structural therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113RvGxq]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

While medical therapies are ubiquitous, they are limited by a lack of solid evidence, are often inadequate, poorly tolerated, and do not alter the natural disease course. As such, there has long been a need for effective, evidence‐based, and targeted disease‐modifying therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In this review, we redefine HCM as a treatable condition, evaluate strategies for therapeutic intervention, and discuss novel myosin inhibitors.

### Myectomy and mitral repair through the left atrium in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: the preferred approach for contemporary surgical candidates [^1131SHg6]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, due to diffuse hypertrophy extending to or below the papillary muscles, are poor candidates for alcohol septal ablation and suboptimal candidates for transaortic septal myectomy. In addition, the outflow obstruction is often aggravated by an abnormal mitral valve and subvalvular apparatus.

We performed transatrial myectomy in 12 patients with diffuse hypertrophy, who were highly symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy. All had at least moderate mitral regurgitation and systolic anterior motion. The anterior mitral leaflet (AML) was detached from commissure to commissure, allowing an easy myectomy through this AML toward the base of the anterior papillary muscle, with mobility fully restored. The abnormal chordae from the septum to the anterior papillary muscle and AML were divided. The continuity of this AML was restored with augmentation using an autologous pericardial patch. The height of the posterior mitral leaflet was reduced, and the repair was completed using an oversized annuloplasty ring.

The peak intraventricular gradients decreased significantly from 98.8 ± 6.29 to 19.2 ± 13.4 mm Hg (P < .001), and the systolic anterior motion and mitral regurgitation disappeared. One patient died of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. All other patients left the hospital in New York Heart Association class I or II.

We believe that this technique is preferable for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and diffuse hypertrophy extending to the midportion of the left.

### Treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy symptoms and gradient resistant to first-line therapy with β-blockade or verapamil [^116LCA7B]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

There is controversy about preferred methods to relieve obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients who remain symptomatic after β-blockade or verapamil.

- **Methods and results**: Of 737 patients prospectively registered at our institution, 299 (41%) required further therapy for obstruction due to limiting symptoms, with a rest gradient of 61 ± 45 mmHg and a provoked gradient of 115 ± 49 mmHg, followed up for 4.8 years. Disopyramide was added in 221 (74%) patients, and pharmacological control of symptoms was achieved in 141 (64%) patients. Overall, 138 (46%) patients had surgical relief of obstruction (91% myectomy) and 6 (2%) underwent alcohol septal ablation. At follow-up, resting gradients in the 299 patients decreased from 61 ± 44 to 10 ± 25 mmHg (P < 0.0001); New York Heart Association class decreased from 2.7 ± 0.7 to 1.8 ± 0.5 (P < 0.0001).

Kaplan-Meier survival at 10 years in the 299 advanced-care patients was 88% and did not differ from nonobstructed patients (P = 0.28). Only 1 patient experienced sudden death, reflecting a low annual rate of 0.06% per year. Kaplan-Meier survival at 10 years in the advanced-care patients did not differ from that expected in a matched cohort of the US population (P = 0.90).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with obstruction and symptoms resistant to initial pharmacological therapy with β-blockade or verapamil may experience meaningful symptom relief and low mortality through stepped management. This includes adding disopyramide in appropriately selected patients and, when necessary, performing surgical myectomy.
