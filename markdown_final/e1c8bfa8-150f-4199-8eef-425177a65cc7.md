## Question

Do sleep patches work

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "sleep patches" work. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sleep patches" actually means in clinical contexts versus consumer products. Then, I should verify which transdermal therapies have credible evidence for sleep outcomes. Next, I will examine guideline positions and regulatory approvals to gauge where the evidence is strong versus conditional. After that, I need to check limitations, including formulation effects, study quality, and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer with clear takeaways and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "sleep patches" is ambiguous and could refer to prescription transdermal medications, investigational transdermal melatonin, consumer wearable "patches" that monitor sleep, or even topical analgesic patches that incidentally improve sleep by reducing pain. I need to ensure I'm addressing the right category before drawing conclusions [^114SjLc6] [^116ERn12].

> I will now examine the strongest evidence base, which centers on rotigotine (Neupro), a dopamine agonist transdermal patch approved for Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome. In PD, the RECOVER randomized, double-blind trial showed significant improvement in nocturnal sleep disturbances measured by PDSS-2, with sustained benefit in open-label extensions, and FDA labeling confirms efficacy for RLS with validated scales like IRLS and CGI-I, indicating clinically meaningful improvements in sleep-related RLS symptoms [^113FXYoN] [^112bEe1p] [^116cxLUy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about RLS broadly. I should confirm guideline positioning because recommendations matter for practice, and the 2025 AASM guideline issues a conditional suggestion against standard use of transdermal rotigotine for RLS due to augmentation risk, while acknowledging that some patients may prioritize short-term symptom relief and accept trade-offs, so the answer is "it works for symptoms but is not a first-line default" in RLS care pathways [^116z1vjf].

> Next, I should review other transdermal therapies with sleep-relevant outcomes. Transdermal rivastigmine has conditional AASM support for secondary REM sleep behavior disorder in PD based on one RCT showing reduced episode frequency, and transdermal estrogen/progestogen regimens improve menopausal sleep disturbances in meta-analyses, with transdermal 17β-estradiol appearing particularly helpful, though therapy must be individualized to risk profiles and contraindications [^1126x95u] [^117FySjx] [^115kdBBs].

> Let me consider melatonin patches specifically. Transdermal melatonin can sustain plasma levels and improve sleep maintenance in circadian misalignment settings, but the clinical evidence is limited and heterogeneous across formulations, so while the pharmacokinetic rationale is plausible, I should be cautious about overgeneralizing efficacy claims until larger, well-controlled trials are available [^113QjvcD] [^114uqSDN].

> But wait, what if the question is about consumer "sleep patches" sold online? I need to check whether any such products have validated clinical data, and I find no robust trials of consumer transdermal sleep patches in the provided sources, so for OTC "sleep patches" the evidence is essentially absent and quality cannot be assured, which means claims of benefit should be treated as unproven marketing rather than evidence-based therapy [^notfound].

> I should double-check safety and practical considerations because they influence real-world use. Rotigotine can cause skin reactions and neuropsychiatric adverse effects, rivastigmine transdermal can cause GI symptoms, bradycardia, and daytime sleepiness, and nicotine patches used for smoking cessation can disturb sleep and are sometimes removed at night, so patient-specific risk–benefit assessment and monitoring are essential when using transdermal agents for sleep-related indications [^111RFwZM] [^116sm4oV] [^112tTZkX] [^113vpWNu].

> Let me synthesize: for prescription transdermal therapies, yes — rotigotine improves nocturnal symptoms in PD and is FDA-approved for RLS, rivastigmine has conditional support for RBD in PD, and transdermal menopausal hormone therapy improves sleep in appropriate candidates. For investigational or off-label transdermal melatonin, signals for sleep maintenance are promising but evidence remains limited. For consumer "sleep patches", there is no credible evidence here to support efficacy, so they should not be recommended clinically based on the available sources [^113FXYoN] [^116cxLUy] [^1126x95u] [^117FySjx] [^113QjvcD] [^114uqSDN].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaway is clear: if someone is considering a "sleep patch", I should confirm whether they mean a prescription transdermal medication for an approved indication like PD-related nocturnal symptoms, RLS, RBD, or menopausal insomnia, in which case benefits are plausible with appropriate selection and monitoring. If they mean an unregulated consumer patch, I should counsel that evidence is lacking and standard, first-line approaches like CBT-I for chronic insomnia or guideline-supported pharmacotherapies should be prioritized in shared decision-making [^116Yj38n] [^116z1vjf] [^1126x95u] [^117FySjx].

---

Sleep patches can help some people sleep better, but **evidence is limited and mixed**. Transdermal melatonin patches may improve sleep maintenance [^113QjvcD] and reduce awakenings, especially in shift workers or those with circadian disruption, but **high-quality clinical trials are sparse** [^114RtwdR]. Rotigotine patches improve nocturnal symptoms in Parkinson's disease [^113FXYoN] and restless legs syndrome [^116cxLUy], but are not indicated for general insomnia. Consumer sleep patches with herbal ingredients often lack rigorous evidence and may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. For chronic insomnia, **CBT-I remains first-line** [^116Yj38n]; use patches cautiously and consult a clinician, especially if you have skin sensitivities or take other medications.

---

## Types of sleep patches and their mechanisms

Sleep patches fall into **three main categories**:

- **Melatonin patches**: Deliver melatonin transdermally to support circadian regulation and sleep onset [^114uqSDN].

- **Herbal patches**: Contain valerian, chamomile, lavender, or passionflower, aiming to promote relaxation and sleep.

- **Prescription patches**: Rotigotine (dopamine agonist) for Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (RLS) [^116cxLUy], indirectly improving sleep by reducing nocturnal symptoms [^113FXYoN].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting sleep patches

### Melatonin patches

Limited but promising evidence suggests transdermal melatonin can **improve sleep maintenance** [^113QjvcD] and reduce awakenings, particularly in shift workers or those with circadian disruption. However, **high-quality clinical trials are sparse**, and optimal formulations, dosing, and patient selection remain unclear [^114uqSDN].

---

### Herbal patches

There is **minimal clinical evidence** supporting herbal sleep patches. Most claims are anecdotal or based on traditional use rather than rigorous trials. Potential **side effects** include skin irritation or allergic reactions due to botanical ingredients.

---

### Prescription patches (rotigotine)

Rotigotine patches have **moderate-quality evidence** for improving nocturnal symptoms in Parkinson's disease [^113FXYoN] and RLS [^116z1vjf], leading to better sleep quality. However, they are not indicated for primary insomnia [^notfound] and may cause side effects such as skin reactions, nausea, and dizziness [^111RFwZM].

---

## Comparison with other sleep interventions

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** | **Side effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Melatonin patches | Low | Moderate (sleep maintenance) | Skin irritation |
| Herbal patches | Very low | Unknown | Skin irritation, allergies |
| Rotigotine patches | Moderate | High (PD/RLS-related sleep issues) | Skin reactions, nausea, dizziness |
| CBT-I | High | High | Minimal |
| Benzodiazepines | Moderate | Moderate | Dependence, sedation |
| Zolpidem | Moderate | Moderate | Dependence, sedation |

---

CBT-I remains the **gold standard** [^notfound] for chronic insomnia, with strong evidence and minimal side effects. Pharmacologic options like benzodiazepines and zolpidem are effective but carry risks of dependence and sedation [^113uJJGH].

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

- **Skin irritation**: Common with melatonin and herbal patches, especially with prolonged use.

- **Allergic reactions**: Herbal ingredients may cause localized or systemic allergies.

- **Systemic side effects**: Rotigotine can cause nausea, dizziness, and daytime sleepiness [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Rotigotine interacts with antidepressants and antipsychotics, requiring careful monitoring [^115U3H51].

---

## Regulatory status and quality control

Melatonin and herbal patches are often marketed as dietary supplements with **limited regulatory oversight**, leading to variability in quality and potency. Prescription patches like rotigotine are **FDA-approved** for specific indications (PD, RLS) but not for general insomnia [^116cxLUy].

---

## Consumer satisfaction and anecdotal evidence

Anecdotal reports suggest many users experience **improved sleep quality** with melatonin and herbal patches, but placebo effects and individual variability are common. Rigorous, large-scale trials are needed to validate these experiences.

---

## Expert opinions and clinical guidelines

Experts generally agree that while sleep patches may offer benefits for select individuals, **evidence remains limited** [^114uqSDN]. Clinical guidelines continue to recommend CBT-I as first-line therapy for chronic insomnia, with pharmacologic options reserved for specific cases [^116Yj38n].

---

Sleep patches may help some individuals, particularly with melatonin or prescription rotigotine, but **evidence is limited** and mixed. Herbal patches lack robust data and may cause skin irritation. CBT-I remains the most effective, evidence-based treatment for chronic insomnia. Use sleep patches cautiously, monitor for side effects, and consult a healthcare provider, especially if you have existing health conditions or take other medications.

Tobacco cessation — pharmacotherapy dosing and precautions for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion sustained release (SR), and varenicline are outlined as follows: NRT patch is available as 21 mg, 14 mg, or 7 mg, with starting dose 21 mg for ≥ 10 CPD and 14 mg for < 10 CPD; local irritation is possible, avoid with skin disorders, and patch may be removed for sleep if needed. Gum or lozenge are 2 mg or 4 mg; starting dose is 4 mg if first tobacco use is ≤ 30 min after waking and 2 mg if > 30 min, with a maximum of 20 lozenges or 24 pieces of gum/d; hiccups/dyspepsia are possible and patients should avoid food or beverages 15 min before and after use. Nicotine nasal spray is 10 mg/mL with starting dose 1–2 doses/d (1 dose — 1 spray each nostril) and maximum 40 doses/d; local irritation is possible and it should be avoided with nasal or reactive airway disorders. Nicotine oral inhaler uses a 10-mg cartridge with puff for 20 min/cartridge every 1–2 h and maximum 16 cartridges/d; cough is possible and it should be avoided with reactive airway disorders. Bupropion SR is dosed 150 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 150 mg twice daily; it may be used in combination with NRT, and should be avoided with history/risk of seizures, eating disorders, MAO inhibitors, or CYP 2D6 inhibitor. Varenicline (0.5 mg or 1 mg) is titrated 0.5 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 d, then 1 mg twice daily followed by continuation pack for 3–6 mo; nausea is common, it should be taken with food, renal dosing is required, and it has very limited drug interactions with near-exclusive renal clearance. Use caution with all NRT products for patients with recent (< 2 wk) MI, serious arrhythmia, or angina; patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding; and adolescents; CPD is defined as cigarettes smoked per day.

### The optimal exercise intervention for sleep quality in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114vLTRL]. Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of various exercise modalities on the improvement of sleep quality in adults remains controversial.

Objective

This study aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to analyze the effects of different exercise interventions on sleep quality in adults.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases were searched for studies published from March 18, 1993, to March 18, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Then, a random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted within a frequentist framework.

Results

A total of 2142 participants from 27 randomized controlled trials were included in the analysis. Exercise modalities such as Pilates, yoga, and traditional Chinese exercises were found to significantly improve sleep quality when compared to a no-exercise control group, with Pilates exhibiting the most potent effect at a 95.3% improvement level.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that exercise interventions are effective in enhancing sleep quality in adults. Adapting exercise to individual preferences and needs may maximize the sleep-related benefits of the activity.

Registration

The review was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42023434565.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116sm4oV]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) pharmacologic management in older and neurodegenerative populations — clonazepam, melatonin, and rivastigmine — includes safety and dosing considerations. Concerning side effects of clonazepam include morning sedation, gait imbalance/falls, depression, and cognitive disturbances, and clonazepam can also exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing; among patients with secondary RBD and DLB or PD, clonazepam is often used in lower doses, starting at 0.25 mg, and dose requirements may decrease with aging, for example from 1.0 mg at age 55 years to 0.5 mg at age 70 years. Melatonin is an intriguing option for older patients (> 50 years old) because it is only mildly sedating, with dosing starting with 3 mg and increasing by 3-mg increments to 15 mg. Rivastigmine is typically administered by transdermal patch with dosing that starts at 4.6 mg applied every 24 hours and can increase to 13.3 mg daily, and adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea, bradycardia, and possible excessive daytime sleepiness in secondary RBD.

### Interventional clinical trials on diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a retrospective analysis [^114aytmu]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of medical products need to be reviewed before they are used in the general population, which is supervised and implemented by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Drugs can be approved by the FDA in a variety of ways.FDA approval of a new drug is associated with an increase in the publication of clinical trial registrations and reports of results for the drug. However, the failure of new DPN drugs approved by the FDA may be related to the low annual registration rate of clinical trials, the delay in reporting test results, the low publication rate of articles or the stage of the clinical trial. Therefore, in future research, we should develop drugs based on the pathogenesis of DPN and reduce side effects. External treatments of DPN include topical drug therapies and device treatments. For patients who cannot tolerate oral medications, topical medication is a good choice. The most common local analgesics are lidocaine, capsaicin, and amitriptyline. Lidocaine patches can improve the quality of life of patients with DPN, and their efficacy is equivalent to that of pregabalin. Capsaicin can reduce pain and improve sleep quality in patients with DPN. Our study found that 11 clinical trials investigated topical drugs as interventions, and 7% of the published clinical trials involved topical drug therapies. Topical drug therapies are safe and effective and are a valuable choice for the treatment of DPN. Due to oral drug intolerance and the high proportion of elderly patients, the development of topical drugs has great potential.

Research on device treatments has shown that high-frequency spinal cord stimulation is a safe and effective means of providing analgesia, and pulsed electromagnetic fields can regulate neuropathic pain and nerve impulses. Plantar electrical stimulation can improve the ankle brachial index and enhance motor ability and plantar sensation in patients with DPN. In this study, we found that electrical stimulation device studies accounted for half of the studies on devices. Electrical stimulation has no contraindications or side effects and may be an effective alternative and adjuvant therapy for DPN.

### The treatment of sleep dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders [^116A1mfa]. Neurotherapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Nocturia

Nocturia is a prominent cause of sleep disruption in Parkinson's disease, affecting around 35 to 66% of individuals, but is also a contributory factor in many patients with other neurodegenerative conditions often secondary to age-related comorbid conditions such as benign prostatic hypertrophy or heart failure. Simple measures such as the optimization of timing of diuretics, reduction of water intake from late afternoon, or convene catheter systems can therefore be of significant benefit to many patients with disrupted sleep. In the setting of Parkinson's, optimization of dopaminergic therapy may effect improvement in nocturia, particularly the nocturnal use of rotigotine patches. Anticholinergic interventions for nocturia, however, should be viewed with caution due to their well-documented deleterious cognitive side effects.

Influence of Medications for Comorbidities

The contribution of medications for comorbid conditions should also be considered. For example, α-blockers, β-blockers, corticosteroids, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors all have detrimental effects on sleep and should therefore be rationalized in the setting of sleep dysfunction.

Influence of Medications for Neurodegenerative Conditions

The contribution of medications administered for the neurodegenerative condition itself should also be considered, especially with respect to timing and dose. For example, donepezil and memantine administered for Alzheimer's have been shown to improve sleep quality overall but donepezil may cause sleep disruption if taken late in the day; modification of timing may therefore bring benefit. Likewise, dopamine agonists improve sleep quality and daytime functioning in Parkinson's but carry a dose-related risk of excessive daytime somnolence and sleep attacks; therefore, dosing should be reviewed in the setting of sleep dysfunction.

Caffeine, Nicotine, and Alcohol Exposure

Exposure to caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine less than 4 h prior to going to bed is associated with poor sleep quality; patients' use of such items should therefore also be reviewed and addressed. Particular effort should be made to probe alcohol use accurately, as 26% of elderly individuals with sleep problems have reported self-medicating with alcohol for sleep induction, and alcohol abuse is frequent in neurodegenerative conditions that promote addictive behaviors/impulse control disorders.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116jL6Yv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — evidence grading and meta-analysis constraints states that quality of evidence grades for randomized clinical trials begin at HIGH and are downgraded progressively for heterogeneity, imprecision, and/or potential publication bias; since the vast majority of studies in this field are industry sponsored, the quality of evidence for nearly all of these studies is, therefore, reduced from HIGH to MODERATE, and when heterogeneity and imprecision are accounted for, the quality of evidence for many treatments considered is LOW or VERY LOW. Meta-analysis requires specific data (numerical data for a given outcome, presented as mean and standard deviation), many studies do not report data in the required format, resulting in exclusion of substantial amounts of data from the formal meta-analyses, and while these studies are discussed and considered in formulation of recommendations, the inability to include such data in meta-analysis represents a distinct limitation.

### Improving sleep quality leads to better mental health: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117EqSzZ]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Manipulation check: did sleep quality improve significantly in the intervention group relative to controls?

Before we examined the effect of improving sleep quality on subsequent mental health, we confirmed that studies included in the review successfully improved sleep quality. The interventions had large and statistically significant effects on sleep quality at the earliest follow-up point reported (g⁺ = −1.07, 95% CI = −1.26 to −0.88, p < 0.001), although heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I² = 79%, Q = 331.93, p < 0.001). After twelve outlying effect sizes were removed, the effect of the interventions on sleep quality remained large and statistically significant (g⁺ = −0.97, 95% CI = −1.07 to −0.88, p < 0.001), and heterogeneity was reduced to moderate levels (I² = 43%, Q = 102.32, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that the primary studies included in the present review successfully manipulated sleep quality, even after accounting for outliers.

What effect do improvements in sleep quality have on mental health?

Table 3 presents the effect of improving sleep quality on composite mental health outcomes, and on measures of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis spectrum experiences, suicidal ideation, PTSD, rumination, and burnout.

Table 3
The effect of improving sleep on mental health outcomes.

Composite mental health

On average, the 72 interventions that successfully improved sleep quality had a statistically significant, medium-sized effect on subsequent composite mental health outcomes, (g⁺ = −0.53, 95% CI = −0.68 to −0.38, p < 0.001); however, there was substantial heterogeneity between the effect sizes, (I² = 76%, Q = 291.94, p < 0.001). After re-running the analysis with eleven outlying effect sizes removed, the effect of improving sleep on composite mental health outcomes was small-to-medium sized but still statistically significant, (g⁺ = −0.42, 95% CI = −0.49 to −0.34, p < 0.001) and now relatively homogeneous (I² = 20%, Q = 75.24, p = 0.0888). See Fig. 2 for a forest plot.

### Membrane potential States gate synaptic consolidation in human neocortical tissue [^117EmUTE]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Synaptic mechanisms that contribute to human memory consolidation remain largely unexplored. Consolidation critically relies on sleep. During slow wave sleep, neurons exhibit characteristic membrane potential oscillations known as UP and DOWN states. Coupling of memory reactivation to these slow oscillations promotes consolidation, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed axonal and multineuron patch-clamp recordings in acute human brain slices, obtained from neurosurgeries, to show that sleep-like UP and DOWN states modulate axonal action potentials and temporarily enhance synaptic transmission between neocortical pyramidal neurons. Synaptic enhancement by UP and DOWN state sequences facilitates recruitment of postsynaptic action potentials, which in turn results in long-term stabilization of synaptic strength. In contrast, synapses undergo lasting depression if presynaptic neurons fail to recruit postsynaptic action potentials. Our study offers a mechanistic explanation for how coupling of neural activity to slow waves can cause synaptic consolidation, with potential implications for brain stimulation strategies targeting memory performance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^115MQyym]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep-promoting medications — evidence limitations and research needs — are characterized by overall quality of evidence that is relatively low in the vast majority of cases, with insufficient evidence for numerous drugs and highly variable, idiosyncratic data reporting that precludes comparing data from one study to another or conducting meta-analyses; virtually all studies of prescription hypnotic agents are industry-funded, and potential publication bias, particularly lack of publication of negative results, and the role of industry in study design and data analysis may compromise evidence quality and uniformity; with these limitations, the task force recommends for future investigations: clear definitions of inclusion and exclusion criteria, adequately powering studies to detect significant differences for key sleep variables, and development and utilization of uniform data collection instruments to improve cross-study analysis and comparisons.

Strengths and limitations

The present review has several strengths. First, it provides a comprehensive and up-to-date search of RCTs examining the effect of improving sleep on a variety of subsequent mental health outcomes. Indeed, with 65 RCTs and N = 8608 participants, the present review is one of the largest studies of the effect of improving sleep on mental health to date. Second, the review was specifically designed to test the causal association between sleep and mental health (i.e. RCTs only, successful sleep improvement required, temporal lag between measures etc.). To our knowledge, the review is the first to adopt this approach in the field of sleep and mental health, although the general approach has been used in other fields. Finally, we provide an analysis of possible moderators of the effect of improving sleep on mental health, identifying several key moderators of the effect.

However, there are limitations that must be considered when interpreting the findings. First, relatively few studies examined the effect of improving sleep over the long term. Those that did report longer follow-ups generally found smaller effects (although still statistically significant), most likely due to the diminishing effects of interventions on sleep quality over time. Consequently, it is important that interventions targeting sleep quality as a route to improving mental health seek to maintain their beneficial effects. Second, there were few primary studies for some of the outcomes included in this review. Consequently, in lieu of more studies reporting these outcomes, the inferences that we can make for mental health outcomes other than depression and anxiety are more limited. Third, although the intention of the present review was to include a broad range of sleep disturbances, most of the analyses are based on CBT interventions for insomnia. This might be due to the relationship between insomnia and mental health being the one that is historically most studied. However, it may be that our focus on sleep quality precluded some studies that do not focus on insomnia from inclusion. For example, different sleep disorders have different conceptualisations of improvement that might not include sleep quality. For example, the timing of sleep is particularly important in circadian rhythm disorders and daytime sleepiness is a key outcome in sleep apnoea research. Future research might consider examining the effect of improving specific sleep disorders on mental health by conceptualising improvements using sleep disorder specific outcomes.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task Force on Clinical practice guidelines [^113vpWNu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Table 8 — Recommended behavioral and pharmacotherapy tobacco treatment modalities for prescribers outline brief counseling timing categories and specific dosing/precautions for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and non‑nicotine agents. Timing of behavioral interventions is categorized as < 3 min, 3–10 min, and > 10 min of tobacco status assessment with cessation counseling at each clinic encounter. For the NRT patch, available strengths are 21 mg, 14 mg, or 7 mg with a starting dose of 21 mg for ≥ 10 CPD and 14 mg for < 10 CPD; local irritation is possible, with advice to avoid use on skin disorders and that patches may be removed for sleep if needed. Nicotine nasal spray is 10 mg/mL with a starting dose of 1–2 doses/h (1 dose = 1 spray each nostril) and a maximum of 40 doses/d. The oral inhaler uses a 10-mg cartridge with instructions to puff for 20 min/cartridge every 1–2 h, with a maximum of 16 cartridges/d; cough is possible, and use should be avoided with reactive airway disorders. Bupropion SR is 150 mg SR initiated as 150 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 150 mg twice daily, and may be used in combination with NRT; avoid use with history/risk of seizures, eating disorders, MAO inhibitors, or CYP 2D6 inhibitor. Varenicline is dosed 0.5 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 d, then 1 mg twice daily (use start pack followed by continuation pack) for 3–6 mo. Additional notes specify that CPD can guide dosing, that 1 CPD is ~1–2 mg of nicotine, and that caution is advised with all NRT products for patients with recent (≤ 2 wk) MI, serious arrhythmia, or angina, and in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and adolescents.

Moderators of the effect of improving sleep quality on composite mental health outcomes

Table 4 presents the findings of analyses evaluating categorical moderators of the effect of improving sleep quality on composite mental health outcomes and Table 5 presents analyses evaluating continuous moderators using meta-regression. Studies that found significant effects of the intervention on sleep quality reported larger effects on subsequent composite mental health, (g = −0.53, 95% CI = −0.68 to −0.38, p < 0.001), than studies that did not find a significant effect of the intervention on sleep quality, (g = −0.12, 95% CI = −0.24 to 0.01, p = 0.0522), a difference that was statistically significant, (Q = 17.59, p < 0.001). This finding strengthens the notion that improvements in sleep are behind improvements in mental health. The effect of improving sleep on mental health was larger in studies with shorter follow-up periods, (i.e. < 6 months, g⁺ = −0.60), than in studies with longer follow-ups, (i.e. 6 months, g⁺ = −0.18, Q = 10.75, p < 0.01). Furthermore, interventions that were delivered face-to-face by a clinician or therapist were associated with significantly larger effects on mental health, (g + = −0.63), than those that were self-administered by participants, (g + = −0.34, Q = 4.50, p < 0.05). Finally, there was significant variation in the size of the effect between countries (Q = 53.69, p < 0.001). No other statistically significant categorical moderator effects were found. Regarding continuous moderators, meta-regression revealed a statistically significant dose–response effect for the association between the effect of interventions on sleep quality and the effect on subsequent mental health outcomes (B = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.52 to 1.02, p < 0.001), suggesting that greater improvements in sleep led to greater improvements in mental health. No other continuous variables significantly moderated the effect of improving sleep on mental health.

### Non-oral dopaminergic therapies for Parkinson's disease: current treatments and the future [^1152oo5Y]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

ND0612 is a novel liquid formulation of LD-CD, which has been developed for subcutaneous delivery for the treatment of moderate (ND0612L) and severe (ND0612H) PD. The subcutaneous route administration of ND0612 shows sustained levodopa plasma levels, thus offering continuous drug delivery. Subcutaneous delivery is achieved either via a novel belt pump in ND0612L or ND0612H, whereby a patch–pump (pump is attached to a transdermal patch and operated by a pump) system is in development for ND0612L (Figures 2 and 3). Currently, three different studies involving ND0612 are recruiting participants and patients. First, a multicenter, open-label Phase 2 trial assesses the long-term safety (12 months) of ND0612H in advanced PD (Hoehn and Yahr scale ≤ 3). Second, another Phase 2 study investigates efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of two dosing regiments of ND0612H in a multicenter, parallel-group, rater-blinded, and randomized manner. Third, an open-label Phase 1 trial compares bioavailability of levodopa between subcutaneous delivery of ND0612 and nasojejunal-infused LD-CD intestinal gel, and seeks to identify optimal concentration of carbidopa. Previous clinical trials (including two Phase 1 and one Phase 2a study) could demonstrate that continuous subcutaneous ND0612 delivery yielded steady-state plasma concentrations estimated to be in a therapeutic window. Furthermore, a Phase 2 trial with N0612L showed reduced "off" time in clinic of 2.42 ± 2.62 h (mean ± s.d.) compared with placebo, and was accompanied by a small decrease in troublesome dyskinesia. Improvements of quality of sleep and life, measured by Panic Disorder Severity Scale and the PD Questionnaire scores, were detected. Safety analysis within the same study showed good tolerability and revealed transient local skin reactions as main adverse events. No systemic adverse reactions, in particular dyskinesia or psychiatric symptoms, were reported

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^113QaaqA]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

A wide range of sleep dysfunction complicates Parkinson's disease during its course from prodromal to palliative stage. It is now increasingly acknowledged that sleep disturbances are thus integral to the disease and pose a significant burden impacting on quality of life of patients. Sleep fragmentation, restless legs syndrome, nocturia, and nocturnal pain are regarded as one of the main components of night-time sleep dysfunction with possible secondary impact on cognition and well-being. The role of dopaminergic therapies, particularly using a continuous drug delivery strategy in managing some of these sleep issues, have been reported but the overall concept remains unclear. This review provides an overview of several aspects of night-time sleep dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and describes all available published open-label and blinded studies that investigated the use of rotigotine transdermal patch targeting sleep. Blinded studies have suggested beneficial effects of rotigotine transdermal patch on maintenance insomnia and restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease patients. Open-label studies support these observations and also suggest beneficial effects on nocturia and nocturnal pain.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^111TSitu]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate and quantify the effects of rotigotine treatment on neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

We searched for articles involving randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published before September 1, 2017, in the PubMed, Clinical Trials, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate changes in the scales used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms. The data were analyzed using Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software.

Results

We identified 8 RCTs involving 1675 subjects. Compared with placebo treatment, treatment with the rotigotine transdermal patch significantly improved scores for the emotion/apathy domains of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Apathy Scale (AS), the sleep/fatigue domains of the NMSS, the 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) and the 39-item PDQ (PDQ-39) (emotion/apathy domain of the NMSS: MD = -2.5, 95% CI [-4.11, 0.89]; BDI-II: MD = -1.19, 95% CI [-2.30, 0.08]; AS: MD = -1.56, 95% CI [-2.67, 0.45]; sleep/fatigue domain of the NMSS: MD = -2.03, 95% CI [-3.08, 0.98]; PDQ-8: MD = -4.93, 95% CI [-6.79, 3.07]; PDQ-39: MD = -3.52, 95% CI [-5.25, 1.79]; PDQ-8 and PDQ-39: SMD = -0.36,95% CI [-0.49,0.23]). The results of the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2) were heterogeneous, and those on the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) were not statistically significant (P = 0.61).

Conclusion

The rotigotine transdermal patch effectively improved neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life in patients with PD. Further studies are warranted.

### Pharmacokinetics of exogenous melatonin in relation to formulation, and effects on sleep: a systematic review [^114uqSDN]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

There is conflicting evidence on the clinical efficacy of exogenous melatonin for the treatment of sleep disorders. This may be due to differences in the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of melatonin formulations used in clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review was to understand the relationship between melatonin formulations and PK parameters and, where possible, the effects on sleep outcomes. To this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and nineteen papers were included. The studies included three melatonin transdermal formulation, thirteen oral formulations, one topical, two buccal, two intravenous and two nasogastric formulations. Seven studies investigated the effect of the melatonin formulation on sleep and six of them found a significant improvement in one or more sleep parameters. The potential for an improved controlled release formulation that delays maximum concentration (C max) was identified. The different formulations and doses affect melatonin PK, suggesting that treatment efficacy maybe affected. Based on the current evidence, we are unable to provide recommendations of specific melatonin formulations and PK parameters for specific sleep disorders. Future studies should systematically investigate how different PK parameters of melatonin formulations affect efficacy treatment of sleep as well as circadian disorders.

### Lidocaine patch 5% with systemic analgesics such as gabapentin: a rational polypharmacy approach for the treatment of chronic pain [^1141YHZm]. Pain Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of the lidocaine patch 5%, a targeted peripheral analgesic, in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and low back pain patients with incomplete responses to their current analgesic treatment regimen containing gabapentin.

Design

This was a 2-week, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter pilot trial in the clinical setting. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, or low back pain with partial responses (average daily pain intensity > 4/10) to their current analgesic treatment regimen were included. Treatment consisted of daily application of up to four lidocaine patches to areas of maximal peripheral pain. Effectiveness was evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Safety was assessed by adverse events, physical and neurologic examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests.

Results

Significant improvements in BPI measures of pain intensity and pain relief were reported for all groups of patients after 2 weeks of lidocaine patch 5% treatment. Significant improvements in BPI measures of pain interference with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships with others, sleep, and enjoyment of life were noted. The lidocaine patch 5% was found to be safe and well tolerated.

Conclusions

Results of this study highlight the potential advantages achieved with rational polypharmacy using a targeted peripheral analgesic, the lidocaine patch 5%, with centrally acting agents such as the anticonvulsant gabapentin. Controlled trials are warranted to further define the impact of such combination therapy.

a As most presented studies were designed in a pragmatic fashion, the wide range of RTG dosages used might reflect different PD population groups regarding disease duration, concomitant dopaminergic therapy, side-effects or local standard clinical practice

Sleep fragmentation

No specific treatment for sleep fragmentation is currently established in clinical guidelines for PD, but some of its causes can be treated by the use of long-acting dopaminergic agents. The multinational, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled RECOVER study investigated the effects of RTG in a sample of 246 PD patients with unsatisfactory early-morning motor symptom control. Nocturnal sleep disturbance measured by PDSS-2 was assessed as a coprimary endpoint. RTG transdermal patch (n = 191; 2–16 mg/24 h; mean age 64.8 ± 9.3 years, 64% male) compared to placebo (n = 96; mean age 64.4 ± 10.6 years; 64% male) significantly improved motor function, early morning akinesia, and nocturnal sleep disturbances in patients with PD (PDSS-2 treatment difference −4.26 [95% CI −6.08, −2.45]; p < 0.0001). Moreover, the reported beneficial effects of RTG patch have been shown to be sustained in a 1 year open label extension of that study as shown in Fig. 1. However, regarding individual items of the PDSS-2, specifically individual item 3 ('Did you have difficulty staying asleep?'), no significant improvement was observed in the original RECOVER study. Whereas patients receiving RTG or placebo showed no significant differences in PDSS-2 total score at baseline, it is not clear whether patients with sleep maintenance problems were well-balanced between treatment arms. Considering the limitations of the study and the importance of specifically assessing whether RTG could be effective for improving sleep fragmentation, posterior studies were performed including patients with self-reported complaints of recurrent nocturnal awakenings.

Non-Levodopa-based therapies

Transdermal rotigotine-patch

Transdermal RTG patch has been in clinical use since the early 2000 for adjunctive and initiating therapy for PD. RTG is a non-ergot dopamine agonist with its activity spanning D1 through D5 receptors, in addition to adrenergic and serotonergic sites. The transdermal approach provides a continuous delivery of RTG with stable and steady plasma levels over 24 h with a single daily application and its doses ranging from 2 to 16 mg/day. The motor efficacy, safety, and tolerability of RTG therapy have been demonstrated in several 6-month studies involving early and advanced PD patients.RTG patch was one of the first products to be tested for non-motor efficacy, and the RECOVER study confirmed the beneficial effects of RTG patch on night-time symptoms of PD as measured by the PD sleep scale. Other key beneficial effects of RTG patch on non-motor symptoms include dopamine-fluctuation-related pain as well as mood and anhedonia. A lower rate of ICDₕas been described with RTG patch compared with other conventional oral dopamine agonists. Skin reactions may complicate therapy, while in some, neuropsychiatric complications may occur.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^115k9piw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Smoking cessation in non-small cell lung cancer — epidemiology, perioperative considerations, and pharmacologic options: Approximately 85% to 90% of cases of lung cancer are caused by cigarette smoking, and among patients aged 20 to 49 years with recent diagnoses, 81% of men and 72% of the women had smoked. Oncologists should encourage smoking cessation, especially in patients with cancer, and the 5 A's framework is a useful tool (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange). Persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, and decreased survival; some surgeons will not operate on individuals who currently smoke due to potential postoperative pulmonary complications, but active smoking should not be used to exclude patients with early-stage lung cancer from surgical treatment that will prolong survival. Programs using behavioral counseling combined with FDA-approved medications can be very useful. Agents include nicotine replacement (gum, inhaler, lozenge, nasal spray, patch), bupropion sustained release, and varenicline; a study suggests that cytisine is more effective than nicotine replacement therapy but with more side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and sleep disorders. Studies have shown that varenicline is better than bupropion or nicotine patch for smoking cessation, although the effectiveness of varenicline for preventing relapse has not been clearly established; the FDA has issued an alert for varenicline regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms, and varenicline has been associated with visual disturbances, movement disorders, unconsciousness, and cardiovascular disorders; therefore, it is banned in truck and bus drivers, pilots, and air traffic controllers; other side effects include nausea, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and headache.

### Digital automation of transdermal drug delivery with high spatiotemporal resolution [^111AQaBX]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Transdermal drug delivery is of vital importance for medical treatments. However, user adherence to long-term repetitive drug delivery poses a grand challenge. Furthermore, the dynamic and unpredictable disease progression demands a pharmaceutical treatment that can be actively controlled in real-time to ensure medical precision and personalization. Here, we report a spatiotemporal on-demand patch (SOP) that integrates drug-loaded microneedles with biocompatible metallic membranes to enable electrically triggered active control of drug release. Precise control of drug release to targeted locations (< 1 mm²), rapid drug release response to electrical triggers (< 30s), and multi-modal operation involving both drug release and electrical stimulation highlight the novelty. Solution-based fabrication ensures high customizability and scalability to tailor the SOP for various pharmaceutical needs. The wireless-powered and digital-controlled SOP demonstrates great promise in achieving full automation of drug delivery, improving user adherence while ensuring medical precision. Based on these characteristics, we utilized SOPs in sleep studies. We revealed that programmed release of exogenous melatonin from SOPs improve sleep of mice, indicating potential values for basic research and clinical treatments.

### Results of fibrin glue applied over the corneal surface immediately after pterygium surgery: a novel pain relief technique [^115zt1PE]. Cornea (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to compare the use of fibrin glue on the corneal epitheliectomy site at the end of pterygium surgery versus conventional eye patch regarding pain levels, need for oral analgesic medications, number of days feeling pain, and awakening due to pain after surgery.

Methods

Forty-eight eyes of 24 patients with bilateral primary pterygium were included in this prospective, randomized, double-masked controlled trial. Each eye of the same patient was randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention group received 2 drops of fibrin glue in the epitheliectomy site at the end of surgery and an eye patch, whereas the control group was only received an eye patch. Patients returned on the first and seventh days after surgery. Pain intensity (measured using the visual pain analog scale), need for oral analgesics, the number of days the pain lasted, and quality of sleep were assessed during follow-up visits and compared between groups. Comparison analysis accounted for sex, age, pterygium grading, and comorbidities.

Results

Visual analog pain scale after surgery was significantly lower in eyes receiving fibrin glue (-1.58; 95% confidence interval: -2.84 to -0.32; P = 0.014). In addition, the intervention group presented a 73% lower chance of using oral analgesics (OR: 0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.07–0.95; P = 0.041). No difference in the awakenings at night was noted (P = 0.240) nor the mean days of ocular pain in the first week after surgery (P = 0.474).

Conclusions

Fibrin glue at the end of pterygium surgery effectively reduces pain and the need for oral analgesics compared with conventional eye patching. This study is the first to describe the results of this strategy.

Especially, tell your doctor if you use or take:

a hormonal birth control method, such as birth control pills, shots, implants, patches, vaginal rings, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Hormonal birth control methods may not work while you take armodafinil tablets. Women who use one of these methods of birth control may have a higher chance for getting pregnant while taking armodafinil tablets, and for 1 month after stopping armodafinil tablets. You should use effective birth control while taking armodafinil tablets and for 1 month after your final dose. Talk to your doctor about birth control choices that are right for you while taking armodafinil tablets.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you if it is safe to take armodafinil tablets and other medicines together. Do not start any new medicines with armodafinil tablets unless your doctor has told you it is okay.

How should I take armodafinil tablets?

Take armodafinil tablets exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Your doctor will prescribe the dose of armodafinil tablets that is right for you. Do not change your dose of armodafinil tablets without talking to your doctor.
Your doctor will tell you the right time of day to take armodafinil tablets.
People with narcolepsy or OSA usually take armodafinil tablets one time each day in the morning.
People with SWD usually take armodafinil tablets about 1 hour before their work shift.
Do not change the time of day you take armodafinil tablets unless you have talked to your doctor. If you take armodafinil tablets too close to your bedtime, you may find it harder to go to sleep.
You can take armodafinil tablets with or without food.
If you take more than your prescribed dose or if you take an overdose of armodafinil tablets, call your doctor or poison control center right away.

### Continuous sleep depth index annotation with deep learning yields novel digital biomarkers for sleep health [^114eeCqJ]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Model structure

An overview of the model is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 4. First, the raw input PSG was segmented into a sequence of patches. Specifically, we had an input PSG epoch, where C was the number of physiological channels and L was the sequence length. In our study, data from four channels were collected in 30-s epochs at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz for predicting sleep states, thus C was 4 and L was 3000. The sequence of each channel was first split into N_c fixed-size patches with patch size P (N_c = [L/P]). Then the patches from different channels were flattened, yielding a 1D vector composed of N = C × N_c patches. The flattened patch vector was projected to D dimensions through a trainable linear projection. The outputs of this projection were conventionally referred to as patch embeddings. Following ideas of the original Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, learnable and randomly initialized positional embeddings were added to the projected patch embeddings to provide the model with information about the position of the patches in the PSG. In addition, we added the channel embeddings since for the PSG every channel has the signal modality varying dramatically and recent works have shown the necessity to take this into consideration. We then prepended a learnable CLS token to the patch embeddings to represent the global contextual information learned by the model. The final embedding vectors then served as input of the standard Transformer encoder which consisted of alternating layers of multihead self-attention (MSA) and (multilayer perception) MLP blocks, where LayerNorm (LN)was applied before every block, and residual connectionsafter every block. The standard self-attention mechanism allowed the model to weigh the importance of different patches relative to each other. With Q, K, V being the query, key, and value matrices linearly projected from the input embedding vector, the attention scores were computed as follows:where Aᵢⱼ was computed based on the respective Qᵢ and Kⱼ representations and D h was computed as [D/m] with m being the number of heads for multihead self-attention. Specifically as for the multihead self-attention, it was an extension of the native self-attention in which m self-attention operations (heads) are conducted. Then these outputs were concatenated and projected to the D dimension

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^112mmWKt]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Rotigotine pharmacology and why it may help with sleep related problems in Parkinson's disease

RTG (previously N-0923) is a non-ergolinic aminotetralin dopamine agonist delivered using a silicone-based transdermal patch. The transdermal formulation has proven to be useful due to RTG's extensive first-pass gastrointestinal metabolism, short elimination half-life after intravenous administration, and high lipid soluble properties. – The important advantages of a 24-hour delivery system, bypassing the gastrointestinal (GI) system and a once daily application have been previously described. Caregivers' perceived advantages over oral therapies have also been highlighted recently, adding a much needed perspective in PD management.

RTG is a D3/D2/D1 dopamine agonist with antagonist activity at α2B receptors and weak, but significant, agonistic activity at 5-HT1A. Analysis of three studies in healthy subjects (SP 871) and early PD (SP630, SP 651) confirm the sustained and steady maintenance of RTG plasma levels overnight with a continuous transdermal delivery system. Moreover, together with apomorphine, RTG is one of the few dopamine agonists extensively used in clinical practice that has significant effect on D1-type receptors.

PD across all motor stages is associated with upper GI dysfunction such as delayed gastric emptyingand comorbidities such as Helicobacter pylori infection. The case for non-oral routes delivery mechanisms, like the transdermal patch, are being increasingly recognized as a cogent choice for management of motor and NMS. Recent evidence suggests that EMO periods are highly prevalent in treated PDand are likely to be related to delayed gastric emptying and consequent poor absorption of oral levodopa. This observation is supported by the fact that RTG and non-oral therapies can overcome EMO symptoms. Furthermore, more long-acting dopamine receptors like ropinirole prolonged release and cabergoline have all been shown to improve sleep by significant reductions of motor PD symptoms at night.

It is reasonable to assume that the non-oral route and the continuous stimulation achieved by RTG patch would be helpful for several aspects of sleep dysfunction in PD as outlined in Table 1 and further described in the following sections. Moreover, the RTG's specific effects on different types dopamine receptors and others, might further contribute to its potential beneficial effects on nocturnal sleep disruption in PD, although this remains speculative. In the following sections we discuss open-label and blinded studies investigating the effects of RTG in night-time sleep disturbances.

(CONDITIONAL). The task force (TF) identified 1 randomized controlled trial testing transdermal rivastigmine that demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD episode frequency, and the overall certainty of evidence was moderate due to imprecision. Reported adverse events with rivastigmine included hypotension and asthenia leading to withdrawal and commonly daytime sleepiness and nausea. Based on clinical expertise, the TF determined that benefits outweighed risks with a balance of effects favoring rivastigmine, and noted costs may be higher than clonazepam or melatonin but relatively small compared to no treatment.

HIV neuropathic pain — nonopioid pharmacological treatments: Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy is recommended for the prevention and treatment of HIV-associated distal symmetric polyneuropathy (strong, low). Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line pharmacological treatment of chronic HIV-associated neuropathic pain (strong, moderate); a typical adult regimen will titrate to 2400 mg per day in divided doses, and evidence also supports that gabapentin improves sleep scores with somnolence reported by 80% of patients who received gabapentin. If patients have an inadequate response to gabapentin, clinicians might consider a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors based on their effectiveness in the general population (weak, moderate), a trial of tricyclic antidepressants (weak, moderate), or a trial of pregabalin for patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (weak, moderate). Capsaicin is recommended as a topical treatment for the management of chronic HIV-associated peripheral neuropathic pain (strong, high); a single 30-minute application of an 8% dermal patch or cream administered at the site of pain can provide pain relief for at least 12 weeks, and erythema and pain are common side effects for which a 60-minute application of 4% lidocaine can be applied and wiped off before applying capsaicin.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^112MYSEe]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A range of sleep dysfunctions complicate Parkinson's disease (PD) and at some stage during the course of the disease, patients may report insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, hyper-somnolence, parasomnias, and sleep-related movement disorders. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), as well as excessive daytime somnolence can be key clinical markers of prodromal PD and be present in untreated early PD together with RLS. – Later on, motor symptoms can disturb sleep maintenance. Frequent awakenings at night due to RLS, periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) or early morning off (EMO) associated with non-motor symptoms (NMS) likely contribute to the complexity of night-time sleep dysfunction.

Rotigotine (RTG) transdermal patch has been suggested to be efficacious for management of some sleep related problems in PD and is currently the only therapeutic strategy examined with the PD Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2) as a primary outcome measure in the RECOVER study, which is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded trial.

In this review, we examine the current state of the evidence base for use of RTG for nocturnal sleep problems in PD. Firstly, we have attempted to summarize the current understanding of some nocturnal sleep disturbances in PD and the rationale for the of RTG transdermal patch in this setting. A more detailed description of studies addressing specific features of sleep disruption and the use of RTG follows. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from inception through to October 15, 2016 using a combination of the following search terms: Parkinson* AND rotigotine AND sleep. The literature search was limited to open-label and blinded studies in the English language.

### Efficacy and safety of 0.625% and 1.25% capsaicin patch in peripheral neuropathic pain: multi-center, randomized, and semi-double blind controlled study [^1152UxTi]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Topical capsaicin therapy may be of benefit in providing pain relief in patients with peripheral neuropathy.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of 0.625% (50 µg/cm²) and 1.25% (100 µg/cm²) capsaicin patches (CPs) compared to conventional 0.075% capsaicin cream or placebo patches in patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy.

Study Design

Early Phase II, multi-center, randomized, semi-double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Two medical college teaching hospitals.

Methods

Sixty patients were randomized to the 0.625% CP, 1.25% CP, placebo-controlled patch, or 0.075% capsaicin cream. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the change of daily numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score. Secondary endpoints included values for the Daily Sleep Interference Scale, the percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction in pain, and data for Global Impression Change (GIC) and EQ-5D.

Results

Patients treated with the 0.625% CP and 0.075% capsaicin cream showed statistically significant improvements in pain after 6-weeks of test drug application. Daily sleep disorder scores were improved only for those patients applying the 0.075% capsaicin cream. For patient-derived GIC scores, the majority (11 of 12) of patients in the 0.625% CP group reported that their pain was improved. For the safety evaluation, 2 severe adverse events were reported for the 0.075% capsaicin cream group only. Repetitive patch application was related to minor skin problems such as a burning sensation, erythema, pruritus, and vesicles in 28 patients (46.67%).

Limitations

The small sample size and relatively high dropout rates.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that the 0.625% CP may prove to be an effective and safe alternative with which to treat patients with peripheral neuropathy and could replace the high concentration (8%) CP. Further studies are now needed to definitively establish efficacy. Key words: Capsaicin, patch, CP, topical capsaicin, neuropathic pain, peripheral neuropathic pain, PNP, high concentration CPTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02228928.

### Improving sleep quality leads to better mental health: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1179ViQD]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Post-hoc moderation analysis

Is the smaller effect of improving sleep on mental health at longer follow-ups associated with smaller effects on sleep quality?

We conducted further (unplanned) post-hoc analysis to investigate whether the smaller effect of improving sleep on mental health at longer follow-ups was accompanied by a reduction in the improvements to sleep quality. Studies reporting the effect of the intervention at shorter follow-ups reported larger improvements in sleep quality, (g = −1.03, 95% CI = −1.27 to −0.78, p < 0.001), than those reporting longer follow-ups (g = −0.44, 95% CI = −0.62 to −0.27, p < 0.001), a difference that was statistically significant, (Q = 14.38, p < 0.001). This suggests that the smaller effect of improving sleep on mental health at longer follow-ups might be driven by a smaller effect of the interventions on sleep quality at longer follow-ups.

Can some of the effect of improved mental health be explained by CBTi modules that target processes associated with mental health?

Finally, although the present review excluded interventions that specifically and directly targeted mental health, some CBTi protocols include modules that might target similar processes associated with some mental health difficulties (rumination around sleep, catastrophizing over the effect of poor sleep etc.). Therefore, we compared CBTi interventions with modules that could target processes associated with mental health vs. interventions that did not include these modules (e.g. sleep restriction alone, sleep hygiene alone, herbal tea, and pharmacological intervention). There were no significant differences in the effect of improved sleep quality on mental health between CBTi interventions including modules addressing processes associated with mental health (g = −0.44, 95% CI = −0.59 to −0.29, p < 0.001), relative to those that did not (g = −0.48, 95% CI = −0.65 to −0.32, p < 0.001, Q = 2.51, p = 0.285). This finding suggests that it is the beneficial effect of improved sleep quality that confers improvements in mental health rather than the inclusion of modules that target processes associated with mental health commonly seen in CBTi protocols.

### Melatonin and health: an umbrella review of health outcomes and biological mechanisms of action [^113Wi2xn]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Circadian rhythms are biological processes that display endogenous, entrainable oscillation cycles that last approximately 24 hours (owing to the Earth's rotation around its own axis). These rhythms tune internal physiology, behaviour and metabolism to external conditions and are considered to be a feature of most living cells and organisms.

At the epicentre of circadian rhythms is melatonin (MLT) or N -acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine, an indoleamine primarily produced by the pineal gland and secreted into the blood. The indoleamine can be administered exogenously, i.e. orally, as capsules, tablets or liquids, sublingually, or as transdermal patches. It is available without prescription (over-the-counter) in many countries for the treatment of insomnia and depression. MLT synchronises the internal hormonal environment to the light–dark cycle of the external environment and controls circadian rhythms. Unfortunately, at night, artificial lighting such as light-emitting diodes (LED) continues to activate the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, suppressing the natural release of MLT and potentially causing health problems. Previous studies have provided evidence of the role of MLT on the regulation of circadian rhythms as well as its connection with the development of various cancers (breast, prostate, endometrial, ovary, colorectal and skin), cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal and digestive problems, diabetes, obesity, depression, sleep deprivation, premature ageing and cognitive impairment.

A comprehensive, informed and up-to-date review of the current knowledge on the effects of MLT on health is not only timely but urgent, given the technological and lifestyle changes, e.g. chronodisruption, following the overwhelming use of the LEDs omnipresent in computers, smartphones and tablets.

Therefore, the objectives of this umbrella review were to evaluate the evidence for the effects of MLT on health from the published literature, specifically systematic reviews (SRs) and narrative reviews (NRs), to investigate the potential mechanisms of action and to identify which health outcomes are associated with the production and/or supplementation of MLT.

### A randomized, open, parallel group, multicenter trial to investigate analgesic efficacy and safety of a new transdermal fentanyl patch compared to standard opioid treatment in cancer pain [^113qtmJ6]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

A new 72-hour transdermal fentanyl matrix patch has been designed, which has a 35%-50% reduction of the absolute fentanyl content compared with other currently available transdermal fentanyl patches that are using the matrix technology. The new patch has previously been shown to be pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to the marketed fentanyl patch. To determine noninferiority in efficacy in cancer patients and to compare safety, a clinical trial comparing the new fentanyl patch with standard oral or transdermal opioid treatment was planned. The design was an open, parallel group, multicenter trial, in which 220 patients were randomized to receive either the fentanyl patch or standard opioid treatment for 30 days. The primary efficacy variable, pain intensity (PI) on a 0–10-point numerical rating scale, was recorded once daily. The primary endpoint was the relative area under the curve of PI expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible PI area under the curve. Any adverse events were recorded; four tolerability endpoints, constipation, nausea, daytime drowsiness, and sleeping disturbances, were assessed daily. Noninferiority was shown; the upper 95% confidence interval limits of the mean difference in relative PI area under the curve between the fentanyl patch and standard opioid treatment were less than 10% for both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. Scores for the tolerability endpoints were similar in the treatment groups. The new fentanyl matrix patch with a lower drug load was found noninferior and as safe as established standard oral and transdermal opioid treatment.

### Clinical validation of a wireless patch-based polysomnography system [^116QCVXK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Onera Health has developed the first wireless, patch-based, type-II polysomnography (PSG) system, the Onera Sleep Test System, to allow studies to be performed unattended at the patient's home or in any bed at a medical facility. The goal of this multicenter study was to validate data collected from the patch-based PSG to a traditional PSG for sleep staging and apnea-hypopnea index.

Methods

Simultaneous traditional PSG and patch-based PSG study data were obtained in a sleep laboratory from 206 participants with a suspected sleep disorder recruited from 7 clinical sites. Blinded, randomized scoring of the traditional PSG and patch-based PSG recordings was completed according to The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events: Rules, Terminology and Technical Specifications (Version 2.6) criteria by 3 independent scorers.

Results

Concordance correlation coefficients were high between the patch-based device and traditional PSG across essential sleep and respiratory variables-total sleep time (.87); wake (.84); non-rapid eye movement (REM) (.80); non-REM sleep stage 1 (N1) (.72); non-REM sleep stage 2 (N2) (.71); non-REM sleep stage 3 (N3) (.64); REM (.80); and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (.94). There was substantial agreement between epoch sleep staging scored on the patch-based device and traditional PSG (average Cohen's kappa of 0.62 ± 0.13 across all scorers).

Conclusions

The patch-based type-II PSG had a similar performance on sleep staging and respiratory variables when compared to traditional PSG, thus making it possible to use the patch-based PSG for a routine PSG study. These results open the possibility of performing unattended PSG studies efficiently and accurately outside the sleep laboratory improving access to high quality sleep assessments for patients with sleep disorders.

### Rotigotine (Neupro) [^116cxLUy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Restless Legs Syndrome

The clinical program included 1309 patients with moderate-to-severe RLS. The efficacy of NEUPRO in the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) was primarily evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials with maintenance periods of 6 months duration. Patients received NEUPRO doses ranging from 0.5 mg/24 hours to 3 mg/24 hours or placebo once daily. In these two trials, the mean duration of RLS was 2.1 to 3.1 years, mean age was approximately 55 years (range 19–78 years), approximately 68% were women, and 97% were Caucasian. In both trials, patches were applied to different application sites including the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, shoulder, and/or upper arm and patch application sites were rotated on a daily basis.

The two outcome measures used to assess the effect of treatment as co-primary efficacy endpoints were the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS Scale) and a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) assessment. The IRLS Scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. The CGI-I is designed to assess clinical progress (global improvement) on a 7-point scale.

### Use of transdermal melatonin delivery to improve sleep maintenance during daytime [^113QjvcD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Oral melatonin (MEL) can improve daytime sleep, but the hormone's short elimination half-life limits its use as a hypnotic in shift workers and individuals with jet lag or other sleep problems. Here we show, in healthy subjects, that transdermal delivery of MEL during the daytime can elevate plasma MEL and reduce waking after sleep onset, by promoting sleep in the latter part of an 8-h sleep opportunity. Transdermal MEL may have advantages over fast-release oral MEL in improving sleep maintenance during adverse circadian phases.

Zolpidem — sleep latency (SL) outcomes show meta-analytic and trial-based reductions. For polysomnography (PSG) SL, five studies were included with a mean difference from placebo of −11.65 min and a 95% CI of −4.15 to −19.15 min; heterogeneity was high and the quality of evidence was rated as very low. For subjective SL, ten studies were meta-analyzed with an improvement at the significance threshold (mean difference: 19.55 min; CI: −14.2 to −24.9 min) and evidence quality was very low due to imprecision, heterogeneity and potential publication bias. Additional trials addressing middle-of-the-night (MOTN) awakenings reported reductions with sublingual zolpidem (PSG: 1.75 mg: −11.2 min versus placebo; 3.5 mg: −14.8 min; subjective: 1.75 mg: −11.3 min versus placebo; 3.5 mg: −15.23 min), immediate-release zolpidem reduced PSG latency by ∼30.5 min versus placebo after induced MOTN awakenings, and sublingual or buccal preparations produced −10.28 min shorter latency than oral preparation.

### Treatment of the sleep disorders associated with Parkinson's disease [^113him8t]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Sleep disorders are common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and preliminary work has suggested viable treatment options for many of these disorders. For rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, melatonin and clonazepam are most commonly used, while rivastigmine might be a useful option in patients whose behaviors are refractory to the former. Optimal treatments for insomnia in PD have yet to be determined, but preliminary evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioral therapy, light therapy, eszopiclone, donepezil, and melatonin might be beneficial. Use of the wake-promoting agent modafinil results in significant improvement in subjective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness, but not of fatigue. Optimal treatment of restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea in PD are not yet established, although a trial of continuous positive airway pressure for sleep apnea was recently completed in PD patients. In those patients with early morning motor dysfunction and disrupted sleep, the rotigotine patch provides significant benefit.

### Different regimens of menopausal hormone therapy for improving sleep quality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117FySjx]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We performed the systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively analyze the effect of HT on sleep disturbance with both subjective and objective sleep outcomes. We included 15 RCTs with similar interventions and sufficient quantitative data for statistical pooling. The pooled effects of subjective sleep quality showed a significant improvement in the HT group. Our pooled results were stable, and the heterogeneity among studies was moderate.

We did subgroup analyses to eliminate heterogeneity and evaluate the effect of different regimens of HT on sleep quality. The results showed that both oral and transdermal regimens positively impacted sleep disturbance, and transdermal administration was more helpful. Both 17β-E₂ and CEE improved sleep quality, whereas EV did not. Furthermore, we found more favorable sleep quality improvement in the 17β-E 2 subgroup. Considering the 17β-E 2 subgroup contained three RCTs and two of them compared transdermal 17β-E 2 to placebo, we speculated that transdermal 17β-E 2 administration led to better effects. The underlying mechanism may be that transdermal estrogen delivery avoids the first-pass effect, resulting in more stable serum estradiol level and higher bioavailability comparing with oral administration.

In the subgroup analysis, the large sample subgroup showed improved sleep quality. Since large sample studies were more likely to avoid sampling error and better represent the actual effect, this result revealed a beneficial effect of HT on sleep disturbance. Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis of the duration of studies, we found that more than 6 months of HT improved sleep quality. Our results provide evidence for the clinical application of HT on menopausal sleep disturbances.

A previous study has proved the sedative and hypnotic effects of progesterone. Lancel et aldemonstrated that progesterone metabolites could produce similar changes to sleep architecture as benzodiazepines. We conducted subgroup analyses to estimate the effect of progesterone on sleep quality. Estrogen plus progesterone alleviated sleep disturbance, but estrogen monotherapy did not. Furthermore, both the estrogen plus micronized progesterone group and the estrogen plus MPA group improved sleep quality, and the former showed a better effect. However, formulations of estrogen may be a confounding factor. Consistent with the study, Leeangkoonsathia et alreported improved sleep quality in the EV plus micronized progesterone group and the EV plus dydrogesterone group. Montplaisir et al observed improved sleep efficiency in the micronized progesterone group. In postmenopausal women taking estrogen, they also observed increased subjective sleep quality in the micronized progesterone and the MPA group. Together with our results, the evidence indicated the critical role of progesterone on sleep.

### Treatment satisfaction, unmet needs, and new treatment expectations for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause: women's and physicians' opinions [^115wKAXM]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes collected for participants were unmet needs with current available VMS treatments, willingness to use new VMS treatments, and expectations for new VMS treatments.

Unmet needs with available VMS treatments

Unmet needs with current available VMS treatments were assessed to elucidate the perceived impact of current treatments on symptom improvement, benefits of current treatments, risks of current treatments, and women's and physicians' involvement in treatment decision-making.

Survey participants rated symptom improvement based on the extent to which current VMS treatments improved hot flashes, night sweats, sleep, mood, sexual desire, work, concentration, disruption in daily activities, and quality of life on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very much).

Perceived benefits of current treatments were rated based on treatment features that met women's and physicians' expectations based on their self-report, including improvement of hot flashes and night sweats, improvement in quality of life, no short-term side effects, minor side effects that required minimal treatment, limited or no long-term safety concerns, convenience of mode of administration, treatment frequency, insurance coverage, low out-of-pocket costs, and an "other" category.

Expectations of new treatments

Expectations of new VMS treatments were assessed based on "women's and physicians" expectations for whether a new treatment was better at reducing frequency of hot flashes and night sweats, was better at reducing severity of hot flashes and night sweats, would improve sleep quality, would reduce the impact of hot flashes and night sweats on work, would improve mood disruptions, would improve sex drive, and would improve general quality of life. Expectations also included how the treatment would be delivered (ie, pill, patch, ring, or topical formulation), how often it would be administered (ie, once daily or less than once daily), if it would have no/fewer interactions with other drugs, if it would lower risk of short-term side effects, if it would have limited/no long-term safety concerns, if it would be covered by insurance/lower cost, and an "other" category.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^114NQAX5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Research has continued to suggest that osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate lessens ADHD symptoms throughout the day and has greater adherence, thought to be associated with the convenience of once-daily dosing. Dexmethylphenidate extended-release (XR) and transdermal methylphenidate also offer this benefit. Dexmethylphenidate comes in capsules that can be opened and mixed with food, and has the earliest onset of efficacy of the long-acting preparations. Transdermal methylphenidate bypasses the oral route entirely, and in short-term studies is associated with efficacy throughout the day, with improved family quality of life, and when carefully titrated, little effect on sleep. Greater absorption of medication occurs when the patch is applied to the buttocks rather than to the subscapular area.

Comorbid anxiety was not found to affect stimulant efficacy in a recent study, and some studies suggest that treatment with stimulants can help to lessen the likelihood of other psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence, including cigarette use and substance abuse. However, meta-analyses of stimulants and other ADHD medications in the treatment of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders concluded that supratherapeutic doses of dextroamphetamine should be avoided in this population. These studies also indicated that methylphenidate gave the best control for ADHD and that α-2-agonists produced the best improvement in both tics and ADHD.

The commonest side-effects of stimulants (decreased appetite, trouble with sleep onset) have also continued to receive recent research interest. Some research suggests that it is difficult to predict which children with ADHD will have adverse effects, based upon demographic and clinical characteristics. Although rare, serious cardiovascular side-effects have been identified with stimulant use; however, the common effects on blood pressure, heart rate and exercise parameters are usually of no clinical significance. Consensus has been reached in the USA, Canada and Europe that routine electrocardiography screening and/or cardiology investigations are needed before starting stimulant use only in those with a positive family or personal cardiac history. Likewise, no cytogenetic side-effects from stimulant use have been reported. However, a recent review article has shown that treatment with stimulants in childhood modestly reduced expected height and weight. These effects were dose-dependent and attenuated over time. The general consensus on cardiovascular side-effects at this point is that the short/medium term side-effects are usually of no clinical significance, but the long-term potential side-effects are less certain.

### Effects of pharmacotherapy on sleep-related outcomes in adults with chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1111Hhn4]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current systematic review included the first meta-analysis to examine the effects of pharmacotherapy on sleep in adults with CLBP. Low to very low quality evidence indicated that pharmacotherapy used primarily for pain management (pain medications) slightly improved sleep by improving sleep quality, and that this effect on sleep was associated with a small reduction in pain intensity and back-related disability. These effects on sleep, pain intensity, and back-related disability, however, did not meet MCID and therefore are unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Very low quality evidence indicated that pain medications had no effect on many sleep characteristics (insomnia symptom severity, total sleep time, trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or use of medication to aid sleep) in this population. The risk of adverse events was higher in pharmacotherapy groups, while the risk of serious adverse events was no different to placebo. Risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of results reduced our confidence in effect estimates. Notably, there were no eligible studies investigating sleep medications, despite being within the scope of this review. Low to very low certainty of evidence reduced confidence in the effect estimates and precluded strong conclusions.

### Not so patchy story of attempted suicide… leading to 24 hours of deep sleep and survival! [^113TJin3]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Here, we present a somewhat unusual suicide attempt where, despite an unbelievable overdose with transdermal fentanyl patches, the patient survived. The patient-a woman aged 70 years, who has suffered from chronic back pain despite starting transdermal fentanyl patches in 2007. The unconventional method of attempted suicide was based on online research into deaths from fentanyl patch toxicity. She had gradually accumulated 100µg fentanyl patches from repeat prescriptions, applying 14 patches with fatal intent, alongside 2 45mg mirtazapine tablets, and concurrent therapeutic doses of tramadol and morphine sulfate oral solution. However, after 24hours, she awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of the telephone ringing, somewhat amazed her drastic efforts had failed. During admission to Great Western hospital, she was seen by liaison psychiatry and subsequently transferred to the care of the pain management team, to which she had already been referred.

### How Do we improve sleep quality after total joint arthroplasty? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^111Jcbr1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the importance of sleep for physiological function, rehabilitation, and recovery, sleep quality after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains poor. The objective of this systematic review was to identify, summarize, and evaluate postoperative interventions aimed at improving sleep quality after TJA.

Methods

A systematic review of PubMed (MEDLINE) and Scopus (Embase, MEDLINE, COMPENDEX) from inception to April 2024 was conducted (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023447317). Randomized controlled trials on interventions to improve sleep quality were included. Sleep outcomes, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System-Sleep Disturbance, Numeric Rating Scale sleep scores, l9 were extracted. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the available data.

Results

Of the 1,549 articles identified, seven randomized trials with a total of 840 patients were included (394 total hip arthroplasties [THA], 446 total knee arthroplasties [TKA]). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was the most commonly used outcome for assessing sleep quality. Among THA studies, zolpidem, combined fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) and dexmedetomidine (DEX), and perioperative methylprednisolone were shown to markedly improve postoperative sleep quality. Neither topical cannabidiol nor topical essential oil was found to improve postoperative sleep quality after TKA. Melatonin had no effect on sleep outcomes after TJA.

Conclusion

Zolpidem, FICB + DEX, and perioperative methylprednisolone are effective interventions to improve sleep quality after THA. Topical cannabis, topical essential oil, and melatonin did not improve sleep quality. No effective sleep interventions for TKA patients were identified. Improving sleep quality remains a potential therapeutic goal to improve patient satisfaction after TJA. Continued investigation on this topic is therefore necessary.

### Using mendelian randomization analysis to better understand the relationship between mental health and substance use: a systematic review [^112tTZkX]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Experimental evidence from human studies

Experimentally induced stress increased the perceived value of cigarettes in smokers with depressive symptoms (Dahne, Murphy, & MacPherson). Similarly, when tested after overnight sleep deprivation smokers were more inclined to pick cigarettes over money than when they were tested after a normal night's sleep (Hamidovic & de Wit). In the other direction, a meta-analysis of 35 clinical trials concluded that participants who were randomly assigned to use nicotine patches to quit smoking experienced more sleep problems than participants assigned not to use them (Greenland, Satterfield, & Lanes). After randomly assigning 31 smokers to continue smoking and 33 smokers to quit, anxiety and depressive symptoms decreased (more) in the latter group during 3 months follow-up (Dawkins, Powell, Pickering, Powell, & West).

Among 540 participants randomly assigned to receive different types of treatment for depression there were significant treatment effects on depressive symptoms, but no changes in alcohol consumption (Strid, Hallgren, Forsell, Kraepelien, & Öjehagen). A considerable amount of work has focussed on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce alcohol consumption. A systematic review including eight RCTs concluded that CBT reduced alcohol use and depressive and/or anxiety symptoms, even when CBT targeted alcohol only (Baker, Thornton, Hiles, Hides, & Lubman). This could mean that decreases in alcohol use led to improvements in mental health, or that, though not targeted to it specifically, CBT affected depressive/anxiety symptoms.

As reflected in the work described here, only a limited number of causal questions can be answered with experimental designs. Moreover, these questions mostly relate to (relatively) short-term effects. Longer-term effects – for instance, potential effects of prolonged smoking on being diagnosed with a mental disorder, or the impact of lifetime alcohol use on the cognitive decline – cannot be investigated. There are also obvious ethical restrictions; it would not be acceptable to randomize people to initiate or increase their use of an addictive substance.

### Treatment impact on patient-reported outcomes in peripheral neuropathic pain: comparing single intervention with topical high-concentration capsaicin to daily oral pregabalin [^113FxmH1]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) is a complex, subjective experience affecting both physical and psychological aspects of functioning. Assessing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) beyond pain relief is important and aligns with the recommendations of IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials). Moreover, PRO data are key to clinical decision-making when evaluating treatment options. However, direct comparisons between such options are scarce. High-concentration capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/w) cutaneous patch (HCCP) is applied to the skin at minimum intervals of 90 days under physician supervision; alternative recommended treatments for PNP are mostly orally administered on a daily basis. The ELEVATE study directly compared HCCP with pregabalin and found noninferior efficacy of HCCP to pregabalin in relieving pain after 8 weeks, with a significantly faster onset of action and fewer systemic side effects.

Objectives

The objective of this analysis was to compare PRO outcomes defined as secondary objectives of the ELEVATE study after a single intervention with HCCP to daily oral pregabalin for 8 weeks.

Study Design

ELEVATE was an open-label, randomized (1:1) multicenter study.

Setting

The study included 92 sites in 22 countries in Europe and Asia.

Methods

Five hundred fifty-nine non-diabetic patients with PNP received a single intervention with HCCP (n = 282; 1–4 patches at baseline) or oral daily pregabalin (n = 277; 150–600 mg, 8 weeks). At baseline (Day 0) and Week 8, patients completed the following PROs in addition to the regular pain assessments: Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Medical Outcomes Study Cognitive Functioning scale (MOS-Cog), Medical Outcomes Study Sleep scale (MOS-Sleep), Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), and EuroQol 5-Dimensions 5-levels (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Index (EQ-UI) and Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS).

Results

At Week 8, 76% and 75.9% of patients on HCCP and pregabalin, respectively, reported to be very much/much/minimally improved on the PGIC. HCCP application was associated with significant improvements from baseline vs. pregabalin in MOS-Cog (mean difference: 4.28 [95% CI: 2.90–5.66]; P < 0.001), EQ-VAS (3.11 [0.30–5.92]; P = 0.030), and TSQM global satisfaction (6.74 [2.29–11.20]; P = 0.029), particularly the side-effects dimension (21.23 [17.55–24.94]; P < 0.0001). No significant differences in improvements were noted for the MOS-Sleep, TSQM convenience, and EQ-UI.

Limitations

The ELEVATE study has an open-label design, with only one comparator (pregabalin); it was limited to 8 weeks. The sample size was determined for the primary endpoint.

Conclusions

A single intervention with HCCP showed benefits vs. daily pregabalin at Week 8 on several PROs. While HCCP has been approved in the United States for PNP treatment in diabetic and PHN patients, these observations provide information on how patients perceive the effects of distinct PNP treatments. They are complementing already existing knowledge on efficacy and safety of different treatment options with data on patient preferences and may help identify the appropriate treatment option in dialogue with the patients and shared decision-making. IRB Approval: At the time of the study, the trial was approved either nationally or at site level. All approvals were granted prior to the initiation of the trial. A list of Ethics Committees that approved the trial is included as a supplemental file.

### Effects of rotigotine on REM sleep behavior disorder in parkinson disease [^114nZWUD]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a common manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD). In this study, we assessed the effects of rotigotine transdermal patch on RBD features in patients with PD.

Methods

In this prospective open-label study, eleven PD patients with untreated RBD were administered rotigotine patches for up to seven months to ameliorate their parkinsonism. The severities of their RBD symptoms before and after rotigotine therapy were evaluated through patient and bed partner interviews, a validated evaluation scale (REM sleep behavior disorder questionnaire-Hong Kong, RBDQ-HK), and blinded assessments based on video-polysomnographic (VPSG) measure.

Results

Rotigotine improved parkinsonism and subjective sleep quality in PD patients with RBD. The RBDQ-HK total score, especially the Factor 2 score, was decreased, which demonstrated that the subjective severity of RBD symptoms was improved after rotigotine treatment, especially the frequency and severity of abnormal RBD-related motor behaviors. The VPSG analyses showed that the total sleep time (TST) and stage 1% were increased and that the PLMS index was decreased. However, no differences in the RBD-related sleep measures were observed.

Conclusions

The improved RBD symptoms and VPSG measures of PD patients in this study (TST, stage 1%, and PLMS index) suggest that, in PD, rotigotine may partially improve RBD-related symptoms. Rotigotine should be considered to be an optional drug for the treatment of RBD symptoms in PD.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

NEUPRO and other medicines may affect each other causing side effects. NEUPRO may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how NEUPRO works.

Especially tell your doctor if you take other medicines that can make you sleepy such as sleep medicines, antidepressants, or antipsychotics.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I use NEUPRO for Parkinson's disease?

Read the Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for specific information about the right way to apply the NEUPRO patch.
Use NEUPRO exactly as your doctor tells you to use it.
NEUPRO comes in 4 different size (dose) patches for Parkinson's disease. Your doctor should start you on a low dose of NEUPRO. Your doctor will change the dose weekly until you are taking the right amount of medicine to control your symptoms. It may take several weeks before you reach the dose that controls your symptoms best.
Apply NEUPRO 1 time each day at the same time each day.
You may bathe, shower, or swim while wearing a NEUPRO patch. Water may loosen your NEUPRO patch.
If the edges of the patch lift, you may tape them down with bandaging tape.
If your NEUPRO patch falls off, apply a new NEUPRO patch for the rest of the day. The next day, apply a new patch at your regular time.
If you miss a dose or forget to change your NEUPRO patch, apply a new NEUPRO patch as soon as you remember. Replace the NEUPRO patch at your normal time the next day.
Do not stop using NEUPRO without talking to your doctor first. If your doctor tells you to stop using NEUPRO, you should ask your doctor for specific instructions on how to slowly and safely discontinue using NEUPRO. If you stop using NEUPRO, you may have withdrawal symptoms (see " What are the possible side effects of NEUPRO? ").

### Estrogen therapy selectively enhances prefrontal cognitive processes: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with functional magnetic resonance imaging in perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women [^115aP4qm]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Estrogen therapy (ET) seems to differentially effect cognitive processes in younger versus older postmenopausal women, suggesting a window of opportunity when ET is most beneficial. Cognitive improvement in younger postmenopausal women has been attributed to ET's influence on hot flushes and sleep, but empiric examination of the mediating role of menopause symptoms versus direct effects of ET on the brain is limited.

Design

In a double-blind trial, 52 women were randomly assigned to estradiol 0.05 mg/day (n = 26) or placebo transdermal patches (n = 26) for 12 weeks. Women completed tests of memory, learning, and executive functioning, and hot flush and sleep assessments at baseline and study end. A subset of women (five ET treated, six placebo treated) also underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies.

Results

Nondepressed perimenopausal and postmenopausal women were studied. The majority had hot flushes and sleep impairment. Compared with placebo, ET selectively reduced errors of perseveration during verbal recall (P = 0.03), a frontal system-mediated function, but did not influence other cognitive processes. Women with baseline hot flushes had greater cognitive benefit with ET (P < 0.05). Cognitive benefit was not associated with sleep problems or its improvement. Measures of fMRI BOLD activation during tests of verbal and spatial working memory showed significant increases in frontal system activity with ET (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Estrogen therapy selectively improves executive functioning as demonstrated by reduced perseverative errors and prefrontal cortex activation during verbal recall tasks. Cognitive improvement with ET is associated with hot flushes, but not with sleep, suggesting that ET has a direct central nervous system effect, rather than an indirect effect mediated through improvement of sleep.

### Predicting response to subacromial injections and lidocaine / tetracaine patch from pretreatment pain quality in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome [^114jXNFJ]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

No existing pain treatment is effective for all pain problems, and response to pain treatment is highly variable. Knowledge regarding the patient factors that predict response to different treatments could benefit patients by providing an empirical foundation for patient-treatment matching. This study sought to test the hypothesis that improvements following two treatments thought to operate via similar mechanisms would be predicted by similar baseline pain qualities.

Design

Prospective prediction analysis using data from a previously published open label trial comparing a heated lidocaine/tetracaine patch versus subacromial corticosteroid injection for the treatment of pain in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome.

Results

Consistent with the study hypothesis, the response to the two treatments were predicted by similar baseline pain qualities; specifically, higher baseline levels of unpleasant, electric, and sensitive pain predicted subsequent improvements in sleep interference, work/activity interference, and patient global ratings of improvement, respectively.

Conclusions

The findings are consistent with the combined ideas that (1) those who have the most to gain (i.e., those reporting the highest levels of various pain qualities) can expect the best response to effective treatments and (2) different pain qualities may be associated with different types of outcomes. The findings support further research to examine how pain quality measures may be used to improve patient-treatment matching, and therefore, ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and overall benefit-risk of pain treatment.

### 17 β-estradiol / progesterone in a single, oral, softgel capsule (TX-001HR) significantly increased the number of vasomotor symptom-free days in the REPLENISH trial [^111aHhbg]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Menopausal women commonly experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS), vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, and difficulty sleeping/insomnia. Although most women going through menopause experience VMS, severity, frequency, and duration can vary widely. In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation study, the mean duration of VMS was 5–7 years, but for some women their VMS may last up to 11 yearsor even longer. VMS are often bothersome to women - and can negatively impact their quality of life, sleep, and work productivity.

Hormone therapy (HT) is the gold standard for relief of bothersome VMS in women who have no contraindication, as it reduces the frequency and severity of VMS. The North American Menopause Society recommends that the lowest HT dose providing symptom relief should be used. For women with a uterus, HT can be provided by prescribing a systemic estrogen (oral, transdermal patch, spray, gel, or vaginal rings) with a progestogen (oral, transdermal [combined patch], intrauterine system, injectable, and vaginal gels or tablets). In October 2018, an HT formulation combining 1 mg 17β-estradiol (E₂) and 100 mg progesterone (P₄), in a single oral softgel capsule, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (Bijuva [E₂ and P₄] capsules, TherapeuticsMD, Boca Raton, FL).

The safety and efficacy of four different doses of the oral E₂/P₄ capsules (TX-001HR, TherapeuticsMD, Boca Raton, FL) were evaluated in the 12-week REPLENISH trial, in postmenopausal women with a uterus who were experiencing bothersome VMS. Compared with placebo, the two highest E2/P4 doses (1/100 mg/mg and 0.5/100 mg/mg) demonstrated significant reductions in the frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS at the coprimary endpoints of weeks 4 and 12, while protecting the endometrium from hyperplasia (safety endpoint). The objectives of this analysis were to examine the response rates of women to treatment and to determine the number of VMS-free days with E2/P4 versus placebo in the REPLENISH trial.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^112bEe1p]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Original evidence for the use of RTG for nocturnal dysfunction in PD has been suggested in several open-label studies, which have been eluded to in this review and, importantly, in the RECOVER study which was the first one to use the PDSS-2 as a core primary outcome measure. The data were extremely powerful, suggesting a strong effect of RTG transdermal patch on several aspects of sleep problems in PD, particularly around maintenance of sleep, nocturnal restlessness, nocturnal akinesia, as well as sleep refreshment. At the same time, it showed that the RTG transdermal patch did not aggravate daytime somnolence as the rates were similar to that of placebo. These observations were confirmed in a post hoc analysis that was published based on the RECOVER study data. Furthermore, subsequently published studies have overall confirmed the potential beneficial effects of RTG transdermal patch on sleep dysfunction in PD, including nocturia, one of the most frequent and distressing symptoms reported as shown by the NIGHT-PD study.

While clinically, sleep dysfunction in PD can be evaluated by the PDSS, now widely used and validated across the globe, the effect of dopaminergic drugs on sleep architecture is rather more complex. Subjective sleep complaints are particularly sensitive to a placebo effect and most studies discussed have not used objective sleep parameters such as polysomnography. However, available evidence suggests that the RTG transdermal has a sustained benefit on sleep fragmentation and sleep efficiency as well.

Strength of recommendations — GRADE assessment and evidence synthesis specify that the GRADE approach was used for the assessment of quality of evidence, with the task force using objective data whenever possible (e.g., polysomnography) and designating objective data as the primary determinant of quality of evidence. Recommendation formulation balanced quality of evidence, benefits versus harms, and patient values and preferences. For quality judgments, criteria included imprecision (when 95% CI cross the clinical significance thresholds), inconsistency (I² cutoff of 75%), indirectness (study population), and risk of publication bias (funding sources), and quality was based exclusively on studies included in meta-analyses. For meta-analyses, pooled results are expressed as the total number of patients, MD and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adverse events presented as risk difference.

### Rotigotine transdermal patch and sleep in Parkinson's disease: where are we now? [^1133EgaY]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2017). Low credibility.

A wide range of sleep dysfunction complicates Parkinson's disease during its course from prodromal to palliative stage. It is now increasingly acknowledged that sleep disturbances are thus integral to the disease and pose a significant burden impacting on quality of life of patients. Sleep fragmentation, restless legs syndrome, nocturia, and nocturnal pain are regarded as one of the main components of night-time sleep dysfunction with possible secondary impact on cognition and well-being. The role of dopaminergic therapies, particularly using a continuous drug delivery strategy in managing some of these sleep issues, have been reported but the overall concept remains unclear. This review provides an overview of several aspects of night-time sleep dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and describes all available published open-label and blinded studies that investigated the use of rotigotine transdermal patch targeting sleep. Blinded studies have suggested beneficial effects of rotigotine transdermal patch on maintenance insomnia and restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease patients. Open-label studies support these observations and also suggest beneficial effects on nocturia and nocturnal pain.

### Nicotine: a targeted therapy for epilepsy due to nAChR gene variants [^112Mssn7]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Genetic variants of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) cause autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. Approximately 30% of autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy patients are medically intractable. In preclinical models, pathogenic nAChR variants cause a gain of function mutation with sensitivity to acetylcholine antagonists and agonists. Nicotine modifies the activity of nAChRs and can be used as targeted therapy.

Methods

We reviewed next-generation sequencing epilepsy panels from a single laboratory (GeneDx) from patients at Children's Medical Center Dallas between 2011 and 2015 and identified patients with nAChR variants. Retrospective review of records included variant details, medical history, neuroimaging findings, and treatment history.

Results

Twenty-one patients were identified. Four patients were prescribed nicotine patches for intractable seizures. Three of 4 patients had a clinical response, with > 50% seizure reduction.

Conclusions

Treatment with a nicotine patch can be an effective therapy in epilepsy patients with nAChR gene variants. We propose consideration of transdermal nicotine treatment in intractable epilepsy with known nAChR variants as an experimental therapy. Further clinical trials are needed to fully define therapeutic effects.

### Effect of transdermal methylphenidate wear times on sleep in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^112HCGKZ]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are common among children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This study sought to evaluate the effects of individualizing wear times of the methylphenidate transdermal system on sleep parameters. In this open-label, randomized trial, 26 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep disturbances were randomized (after dose optimization) to one of four groups with different sequences of patch wear times (i.e., 9, 10, 11, and 12 hours per day wear times each for week in different sequences). The primary endpoint comprised sleep latency. Secondary endpoints included total sleep time, sleep quality, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related signs (assessed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV and Connor's Global Impression-Parent). A mixed-effects regression model evaluated the effects of patch wear time on sleep and symptom measures. Patch wear time exerted no significant effect on sleep latency or total sleep time, although a trend toward improved sleep quality was evident (P = 0.059) with longer patch wear times. Sleep parameters were not adversely affected by longer methylphenidate transdermal system patch wear times. Thus, if replicated in larger samples, the individualization of patch wear times should be considered according to the needs and responses of patients.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114ffYkf]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) with mild cognitive impairment — rivastigmine: The task force (TF) identified 1 randomized controlled trial of transdermal rivastigmine in patients with RBD and mild cognitive impairment who were refractory to conventional therapy, which demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD frequency; the overall certainty of evidence was moderate due to imprecision, and the most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were hypotension and asthenia with other commonly reported adverse events including daytime sleepiness and nausea; costs were relatively small compared to the potential high cost of injury due to dream enactment during sleep, and the majority of patients with RBD with mild cognitive impairment would most likely use rivastigmine compared to no treatment for their isolated RBD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^1169qznJ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine for primary insomnia — Recommendation 11 states, "We suggest that clinicians not use diphenhydramine as a treatment for sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia (versus no treatment) in adults. [WEAK]". This recommendation is based on trials of 50 mg doses, and two RCTs evaluated diphenhydramine 50 mg with overall evidence weakly against effectiveness; the mean reduction in patient-reported sleep latency versus placebo and the small increase in total sleep time both fell below clinical significance, and none of the other objective or patient-reported outcomes reached clinical significance. No meta-analysis was possible for side effects, the task force judged benefits and harms to be approximately equal, and it determined that the majority of well-informed patients would not use diphenhydramine over no treatment.

### Zaleplon [^113k86QM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Zaleplon is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Zaleplon has been shown to decrease the time to sleep onset for up to 30 days in controlled clinical studies (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). It has not been shown to increase total sleep time or decrease the number of awakenings.

The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy ranged from a single night to 5 weeks in duration. The final formal assessments of sleep latency were performed at the end of treatment.

### Wearable devices in clinical trials: hype and hypothesis [^1123TUXX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Since many wearable devices can readily measure heart rate as well as blood pressure, the cardiovascular therapeutic area is a major focus for use of wearable devices. Cardiac monitoring in both healthy individuals and specific disease populations allows monitoring for cardiac events 24/7 and enables better‐informed care. Cardiovascular disease areas in which wearable devices have been or could be used include congestive heart failure, hypertension, and dysrhythmias. For example, The Zio Patch (iRhythm Technologies, San Francisco, CA) is a single‐lead electrocardiographic, continuously recording ambulatory adhesive patch, recently approved by the FDA. In a recent study, the device's 14‐day monitoring of beat‐to‐beat cardiac rhythm had a 57% greater diagnostic yield than the standard 24‐h Holter monitoring. 41

Neuroscience uses of wearable devices are manifold, including the monitoring of sleep, cognition, and movement disorders. Wearable devices commonly measure selected sleep parameters and activity. To assess patients for obstructive sleep apnea outside the laboratory setting, use of medical devices has been steadily increasing. 42 IBM Watson Health and the American Sleep Apnea Association have launched the SleepHealth app to conduct a study identifying connections between sleep habits and health outcomes. This app will record movement and heart rate during sleep and track connection between sleep quality and daytime activities, alertness, productivity, general health, and medical conditions. It will amass the largest collection of sleep data to date. Parkinson's disease is another area that has shown promising results and insight via wearables and machine‐learning techniques. The sensors in wearable devices can be paired with mobile phone apps to measure symptoms such as tremor, balance, gait, memory, and some vocal characteristics.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — adverse events and patient preference considerations explains that beyond the quality of evidence for or against use of a given drug for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, the task force also considered the relative benefit:harm ratio and the likelihood that an informed patient would use a specific agent, and that assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events often rely on spontaneous reporting by research participants with frequencies so low that reported studies are underpowered to find a difference from placebo. It adds that this implies the effect size for a TEAE would be very small and that it is unlikely the clinical significance of TEAEs has been underestimated, but some TEAEs are very infrequent yet very serious when they occur (for example, sleep-related behaviors with BzRA), clinical trials are likely to underestimate such risks due to the limited number of patients and limited duration of treatment, and as a result assessment of potential harms is largely derived from clinical experience and theoretical considerations rather than well-documented evidence; additionally, the task force judged likelihood of patient use and in most cases these judgments were in agreement with recommendations, while in certain cases (e.g., melatonin) informed patients may be likely to use a specific drug even when data do not clearly support a recommendation for use.
