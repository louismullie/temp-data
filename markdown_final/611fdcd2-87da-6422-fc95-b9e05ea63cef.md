Ondansetron ram

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ondansetron, specifically seeking information on its mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, indications, dosing, safety, special populations, and a practical clinical takeaways summary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug class and mechanism. Then, I should verify pharmacodynamic effects, especially GI motility and QT risk. Next, I will review labeled indications and key dosing regimens. After that, I need to examine safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. I will then consider special populations, including pregnancy, pediatrics, hepatic and renal impairment. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical pearls and highlight controversies or off-label uses with the strength of evidence.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanism. Ondansetron is a selective 5‑HT3 receptor antagonist that blocks serotonin at peripheral vagal afferents and centrally in the area postrema, which explains its antiemetic effect; importantly, it is not a dopamine antagonist, so it lacks extrapyramidal effects, though the exact site of antiemetic action remains uncertain and may be mixed central and peripheral [^a8c13efe] [^9fd0d22b] [^69a8f9f9] [^3189b1f3].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacodynamics beyond antiemesis. Single IV doses do not meaningfully alter esophageal or gastric motility or small intestinal transit, but multiday use slows colonic transit, which aligns with constipation risk; clinically, this underpins its occasional use for diarrhea-predominant IBS, though that remains investigational in many regions [^a8c13efe] [^9fd0d22b] [^69a8f9f9] [^ccf1dae2] [^c1003a99].

> I need to check the cardiac electrophysiology carefully. In a crossover study, 32 mg IV over 15 minutes prolonged QTcF by a mean of about 19.5 ms, 8 mg by about 5.6 ms, and there is a clear exposure–response; the FDA subsequently advised avoiding IV doses above 16 mg and emphasized caution in patients with electrolyte disturbances, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs; postmarketing torsades has been reported, though risk is higher with IV use and cumulative risk factors [^9fd0d22b] [^69a8f9f9] [^dfdfbb27] [^ccda9a87].

> Next, I should review labeled indications and core dosing. For highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 24 mg PO once 30 minutes pre-chemo is standard; for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, 8 mg PO 30 minutes pre-chemo, then 8 mg PO 8 hours later, then 8 mg PO BID for 1–2 days; for PONV prophylaxis, 4 mg IV at induction or end of surgery, or 8 mg PO at the end of surgery; for radiotherapy-induced nausea, 8 mg PO 1–2 hours before each fraction; these regimens are supported by randomized trials and consensus guidelines [^14c0ca60] [^79e800d8] [^1fae4565] [^c6627b69] [^83b4ebc1] [^d97f860a] [^7d44f857].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and adverse effects. Common adverse reactions include headache, constipation, diarrhea, and fatigue; clinically important risks are QT prolongation, serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonergic agents, and masking of ileus or gastric distention; hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, can occur, and apomorphine is contraindicated due to profound hypotension and loss of consciousness [^17f27008] [^cc8a68b9] [^dfdfbb27] [^db9526bf] [^13771c72] [^f199f862].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pregnancy. Large cohort data do not show increased risks of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or major congenital malformations versus other antiemetics; ACOG notes insufficient fetal safety data and a possible small increase in oral clefts in some studies, advising individualized risk–benefit discussion and caution before 10 weeks; many clinicians accept ondansetron as a reasonable option after failure of first-line agents, with shared decision-making [^0c19dc80] [^175b8c10] [^d9b2c817] [^50469662].

> Let me consider pediatrics next. Oral ondansetron is labeled for moderately emetogenic CINV in children 4 years and older; for pediatric gastroenteritis, use is off-label but supported by meta-analyses showing improved ORT success and reduced hospitalization, with very low rates of clinically significant QT effects when used appropriately; dose 0.15 mg/kg IV or 2–8 mg orally is typical, and caution is warranted in infants under 3 months due to reduced clearance and higher exposure [^bd994e59] [^cc836acf] [^87198af7] [^c84a6810] [^7a581723].

> I should confirm hepatic and renal considerations. In severe hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the total daily dose should not exceed 8 mg; no dose adjustment is needed for renal impairment, though experience beyond the first day is limited, so monitoring is prudent in prolonged use [^bd994e59] [^10fccb9f] [^cf61100f].

> But wait, what about drug interactions and CYP metabolism. Ondansetron is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2; potent inducers like rifampin or carbamazepine can lower levels, though no routine dose adjustment is recommended; clinically, the most important interaction is with apomorphine, which is contraindicated due to hypotension and loss of consciousness; serotonin syndrome risk rises with other serotonergic drugs, so vigilance is needed [^db9526bf] [^13771c72] [^dfdfbb27].

> Let me synthesize practical clinical pearls. Ondansetron is a first-line antiemetic for CINV and PONV with favorable tolerability and no extrapyramidal effects; use the lowest effective dose, avoid IV doses above 16 mg, and screen for QT risk factors when using IV formulations; in pregnancy, consider after first-line failure with counseling; in pediatrics, it facilitates ORT and reduces hospitalization; for IBS-D, small studies suggest benefit via slowed colonic transit, but larger confirmatory trials are ongoing and it remains off-label in many jurisdictions [^f1eee50d] [^d9b2c817] [^ccf1dae2] [^c1003a99].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ondansetron might directly reduce intestinal secretion, but I should double-check that. A recent MRI study in healthy volunteers showed ondansetron did not reduce small bowel water content even during lactulose-induced diarrhea, suggesting its anti-diarrheal effect is more likely mediated by altered colonic motility rather than inhibition of secretion; this corrects my earlier assumption and aligns with the observed constipation risk and delayed colonic transit with repeated dosing [^678b13ba] [^a8c13efe].

Ondansetron is a **selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist** [^a8c13efe] used to prevent nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery [^ddaf9efa]. It is **not a dopamine antagonist**, so it does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms [^3189b1f3]. Common adverse effects include headache, constipation, and diarrhea [^cc8a68b9]; **QT prolongation** can occur, especially with IV doses ≥ 16 mg or in patients with risk factors [^9fd0d22b] [^dfdfbb27]. No dose adjustment is needed in renal impairment [^10fccb9f], but the total daily dose should not exceed 8 mg in severe hepatic impairment [^bd994e59]. Ondansetron is considered safe in pregnancy [^0c19dc80] based on large cohort data, though it should be used after discussing risks and benefits [^d9b2c817].

---

## Mechanism of action

Ondansetron **selectively antagonizes 5-HT3 receptors** [^a8c13efe] in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, blocking serotonin-mediated emetic reflexes [^0febcbe0]. It is not a dopamine receptor antagonist, so it does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms [^3189b1f3].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: Rapid oral absorption with ~60% bioavailability; peak levels at 1–2 hours.
- **Distribution**: Protein binding ~70–76%.
- **Metabolism**: Hepatic CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2; no significant CYP induction/inhibition [^db9526bf].
- **Elimination**: Half-life ~3–6 hours; excreted in urine and feces [^f1eee50d].

---

## Clinical indications

- **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)**: Highly and moderately emetogenic regimens [^14c0ca60] [^79e800d8].

---

## Special populations

- **Pregnancy**: No increased risk of major malformations or adverse outcomes in large cohorts; use after counseling [^0c19dc80] [^175b8c10].
- **Lactation**: Limited data; use cautiously.
- **Pediatrics**: Safe and effective for CINV and PONV; dose by weight [^bd994e59] [^3afc65a2].
- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment needed [^10fccb9f].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Max 8 mg/day in severe hepatic impairment [^bd994e59].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACOG supports use for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy after discussing risks and benefits [^d9b2c817]. ASCO recommends ondansetron for breakthrough nausea and vomiting in radiotherapy [^d32eebba]. PONV guidelines endorse ondansetron for prophylaxis and treatment, often combined with dexamethasone [^f1eee50d] [^2de9a93c].

---

Ondansetron is a **well-established 5-HT3 antagonist** with broad antiemetic use, a favorable safety profile, and manageable QT risk; it is a key option across CINV, PONV, and radiotherapy-induced nausea, with supportive data for select off-label uses.

12. Clinical Pharmacology

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. While its mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, ondansetron is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron’s antiemetic action is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of emesis. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT3 receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In healthy subjects, single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in healthy subjects. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma-prolactin concentrations.

 Cardiac Electrophysiology 

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a double-blind, single-intravenous dose, placebo- and positive-controlled, crossover trial in 58 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 19.5 (21.8) milliseconds and 5.6 (7.4) milliseconds after 15­-minute intravenous infusions of 32 mg and 8 mg of ondansetron injection, respectively. A significant exposure-response relationship was identified between ondansetron concentration and ΔΔQTcF. Using the established exposure-response relationship, 24 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) ΔΔQTcF of 14.0 (16.3) milliseconds. In contrast, 16 mg infused intravenously over 15 minutes using the same model had a mean predicted (95% upper prediction interval) ΔΔQTcF of 9.1 (11.2) milliseconds. In this study, the 8 mg dose infused over 15 minutes did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between ondansetron exposure during pregnancy and the risk of adverse fetal outcomes?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of cohort studies of 456 963 pregnancies in 3 countries, treatment with ondansetron was not significantly associated with increased risk of fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or major congenital malformations compared with other antiemetics.

Meaning

These findings suggest that ondansetron use during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes compared with the use of other antiemetics.

### Ondansetron has similar clinical efficacy against both nausea and vomiting [^83838491]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is widely believed to prevent postoperative vomiting more effectively than nausea. We analysed data from 5161 patients undergoing general anaesthesia who were randomly stratified to receive a combination of six interventions, one of which was 4 mg ondansetron vs placebo. For the purpose of this study a 20% difference in the relative risks for the two outcomes was considered clinically relevant. Nausea was reduced from 38% (969/2585) in the control to 28% (715/2576) in the ondansetron group, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.74, or a relative risk reduction of 26%. Vomiting was reduced from 17% (441/2585) to 11% (293/2576), corresponding to a relative risk of 0.67, or a relative risk reduction of 33%. The relative risks of 0.67 and 0.74 were clinically similar and the difference between them did not reach statistical significance. We thus conclude that ondansetron prevents postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting equally well.

### Serotonin receptor antagonists for highly emetogenic chemotherapy in adults [^fd0700e0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT(3) RAs) are used to control chemotherapy-induced emesis. Although they have the same general mechanism of action (blockade of serotonin receptors), they have different chemical structures and may have different effects.

Objectives

To compare efficacy of different serotonin receptor antagonists (5-HT(3) RAs) in the control of acute and delayed emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane PaPaS Group, PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS databases. Our most recent search was in March 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing 5-HT(3) RAs in an adult cancer population.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted information from the included studies on the control of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting, either as a single or a combined outcome. Where appropriate, we combined the results of similar trials. We carried out sensitivity and subgroup analyses to test the robustness of our findings.

Main Results

We included 16 randomised trials (7808 participants). Nine of the trials compared granisetron versus ondansetron. No other drug comparison was studied in more than one trial. The meta-analyses of the granisetron versus ondansetron trials found similar results for the two drugs on acute vomiting (eight trials, 4256 participants, odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02), acute nausea (seven trials, 4160 participants, OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10), delayed vomiting (three trials, 1119 participants, OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34) and delayed nausea (two trials, 1024 participants, OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.24). Granisetron and ondansetron showed similar effects on headache and diarrhoea, with the possible exception of less constipation associated with ondansetron.One study of 1114 participants comparing palonosetron plus dexamethasone versus granisetron plus dexamethasone showed superiority of palonosetron in controlling delayed vomiting (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.85) and delayed nausea (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.10). Complete response for delayed nausea and vomiting was also in favour of the combination palonosetron and dexamethasone (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.29 to 2.07).

Authors' Conclusions

Ondansetron and granisetron appear to be equivalent drugs for the prevention of acute and delayed emesis following the use of highly emetogenic chemotherapy.According to one single trial the combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone was superior to granisetron and dexamethasone in controlling delayed emesis. However, more evidence is needed before palonosetron could become the candidate 5-HT(3) RA for the control of delayed emesis induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

As far as the potential mechanisms of action of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists is concerned, there is evidence that the beneficial effect of this drug class in NC-IBS might be related to the prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time and improvement in rectal compliance, as well as a reduction in visceral sensitivity. However, more studies including various mechanistic assessments, as discussed above, are necessary to better define the mode of action of this drug category.

The lack of significant inconsistency in this NWM strengthens our results. However, despite the messages that emerge concerning the effectiveness of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists vs. control drugs (placebo and mebeverine), some limitations should be stressed. The main limitation is related to differences in the design and endpoints used in individual RCTs, as well as to the heterogeneity concerning the Rome criteria used in the individual RCTs, i.e. Rome I vs. Rome II vs. Rome III criteria. In future RCTs these concerns are expected to be addressed by utilizing the standardized FDA-recommended endpoints for patients with IBS-D. Another limitation refers to the fact that some RCTs included only a small number of patients, in particular for evaluations concerning ondansetron. However, a large, well-designed multicenter RCT (the TRITON trial) addresses the ondansetron issue and this trial is expected to be completed soon. A recent systematic review addressed the efficacy of various pharmacological therapies (alosetron, ramosetron, rifaximin and eluxadoline) in patients who had IBS-D or IBS-M stool pattern and found that alosetron and ramosetron were the most effective. As the authors stress, although the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists appeared to perform the best, many IBS patients will be unable to access these drugs. However, drug availability will no longer be a problem if the TRITON trial results fulfill the expectations concerning ondansetron.

### Comparative effectiveness of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists in irritable bowel syndrome: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^c1003a99]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ondansetron, in comparison to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, performed better when bowel habits/consistency were the main efficacy endpoint. This 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, is currently licensed for use in both adults and children, mainly for the management of nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and for postoperative nausea and vomiting. One point of considerable concern is that, in this NWM, all evaluations concerning ondansetron were based on only 2 RCTs that included a total of 170 patients. All these observations point to a need for large well-designed RCTs to better define the efficacy and optimal dose of ondansetron in NC-IBS patients. Along these lines, a large multicenter RCT (the TRITON trial) is in progress and is expected to be completed by December 2021. Of considerable importance is the fact that in this trial several mechanistic assessments, such as gut transit, fecal tryptase and fecal bile acid concentrations, barostat and high resolution rectal manometry tests, will be included in an effort to better define ondansetron’s mechanisms of action. As the authors of this study protocol claim, if ondansetron proved to be effective in this well-designed trial, then it could easily be widely adopted, since it is an inexpensive, safe and generic drug. Therefore, by providing an effective treatment, it could not only reduce patient symptoms, but also reduce healthcare costs associated with repeated referrals and unnecessary investigations.

### A randomised trial of ondansetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea [^ccf1dae2]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction, background and objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) affects approximately 3% of the general population and accounts for approximately 20% of gastroenterology outpatient visits in the UK. Since many conditions can cause diarrhoea, such patients typically undergo numerous negative tests. IBS regardless of subtype is also associated with considerable impairment of quality of life.IBS-D is particularly a debilitating form of IBS as it reduces the ability to eat out and socialise because of fear of pain, urgent defaecation and even incontinence. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) is a major mediator in the gut, signalling via afferent nerves to influence gut motility and secretion.5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RAs) block the vagal stimulation induced by 5-HTand were developed as a highly effective treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, known to be mediated via vagal stimulation by cisplatinum-induced 5-HT release.It was soon discovered that 5HT3RAs also cause constipation.Early studies with ondansetron demonstrated that 16 mg three times a day, the usual dose for chemotherapy-induced emesis, delayed colonic transit in healthy subjects,and reduced the postprandial increase in colonic tone in carcinoid diarrhoea.A small trial using the much lower dose of 4 mg three times a day suggested benefit in IBS and functional dyspepsia.Our aim was to determine whether this inexpensive, safe generic drug would provide similar relief to patients with IBS-D. We also wished to determine the mechanism of action and in particular whether clinical factors or polymorphisms in the SERT genotype could predict those that would respond, as has been suggested for alosetron.

### The role of ondansetron in the treatment of schizophrenia [^979e1e09]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1950-March 2010) and Google Scholar were performed. Key search terms included ondansetron, Zofran, serotonin antagonists, 5-HT(3) serotonin receptor, and schizophrenia.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles published in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. All studies and case reports evaluating ondansetron for the treatment of schizophrenia were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Six clinical trials, including 3 double-blind, randomized trials, and 2 case reports pertinent to ondansetron use in schizophrenia, were identified. Ondansetron daily doses ranged from 4 to 16 mg, with doses administered once or twice daily. Ondansetron was used as monotherapy in 3 trials and as an adjunct to therapy with clozapine, haloperidol, or risperidone, respectively, in 3 trials. Studies were of varying durations, ranging from a single-dose study with a 3-hour follow-up to three 12-week studies. Most studies evaluated ondansetron's efficacy in treating schizophrenia as measured with changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression scale scores. In the 2 largest trials, with a combined patient population of 151, treatment with adjunctive ondansetron resulted in statistically significant improvement in negative symptoms as assessed with PANSS. In all studies, ondansetron was well tolerated, with no severe adverse reactions reported.

Conclusions

Ondansetron may be effective as an adjunct to antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia, specifically negative symptoms, as assessed with PANSS. Due to the variation in concurrent therapies and dosing regimens, it is difficult to establish an optimal dose from the reviewed trials. Further large, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies would be helpful in determining the role of ondansetron in the treatment of schizophrenia.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^f1eee50d]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Ondansetron—Ondansetron was the first 5-HT3 RA on the market and commonly used as the preferred antiemetic for PONV prophylaxis; the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommended dose was 4 mg by slow IV injection or 16 mg of the oral formulation (oral disintegrating tablets, given 1 hour before induction). The IV drug has a mean elimination half-life of 3.1-5.8 hours in adults and is extensively metabolized by the liver, and CYP 2D6 ultrametabolizers are significantly more likely to develop PONV despite ondansetron prophylaxis. In a 2021 Cochrane network meta-analysis (NMA) on drugs for PONV prophylaxis in adults after general anesthesia, 585 randomized trials enrolling 97,516 patients were included to evaluate 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations, and ondansetron was the most investigated single drug followed by dexamethasone. Since the 2020 PONV Guideline, several studies have compared ondansetron 4 mg with dexamethasone 8 mg and concluded that ondansetron 4 mg is more effective for PONV prophylaxis; ondansetron 4 mg is comparable to prochlorperazine 10 mg for PONV prophylaxis, with a trend towards greater risk of side effects in the prochlorperazine group.

14.1 Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy

In 2 randomized, double-blind, monotherapy trials, a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron was superior to a relevant historical placebo control in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2. Steroid administration was excluded from these clinical trials. More than 90% of patients receiving a cisplatin dose greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2in the historical-placebo comparator, experienced vomiting in the absence of antiemetic therapy.

The first trial compared oral doses of ondansetron 24 mg as a single dose, 8 mg every 8 hours for 2 doses, and 32 mg as a single dose in 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2. The first or single dose was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. A total of 66% of patients in the ondansetron 24 mg once-a-day group, 55% in the ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group, and 55% in the ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group, completed the 24-hour trial period with 0 emetic episodes and no rescue antiemetic medications, the primary endpoint of efficacy. Each of the 3 treatment groups was shown to be statistically significantly superior to a historical placebo control.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride and dextrose [^374d0b8d]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics :

Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3receptor antagonist. While ondansetron's mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, it is not a dopamine-receptor antagonist. Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT3type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is not certain whether ondansetron's antiemetic action in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is mediated centrally, peripherally, or in both sites. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine. In humans, urinary 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of vomiting. The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5-HT3receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex.

In animals, the emetic response to cisplatin can be prevented by pretreatment with an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, bilateral abdominal vagotomy and greater splanchnic nerve section, or pretreatment with a serotonin 5-HT3receptor antagonist.

In normal volunteers, single I.V. doses of 0.15 mg/kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility, gastric motility, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or small intestinal transit time. In another study in six normal male volunteers, a 16-mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect of the drug on cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, or electrocardiogram (ECG). Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers. Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations.

In a gender-balanced pharmacodynamic study (n = 56), ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis.

Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.

Some directions for future research should be drawn out from current meta-analysis. The adequate sample, comprehensive side effects should be considered in future research, and the effects of various dosage of ondansetron, anesthetic technique and surgical setting on PAS should also be explored. Furthermore, studies aimed to compare ondansetron and other drugs should be conducted to evaluate the clinical and economic efficacy of ondansetron. Finally, the definition of PAS should be standardized.

STEP 4: CONSENQUENCES FOR ONDANSETRON EFFICACY

Selected outcome criteria were improved rehydration and prevention of hospitalization. No cutoffs were defined.

Use in other populations

Ondansetron is used in children with CINV or postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Ondansetron is not licensed to treat gastroenteritis‐induced nausea and vomiting in any age group. Use in adults is only currently investigated based on promising results in pediatric studies.

Mechanism of action

Ondansetron is a selective 5‐HT3‐receptor antagonist, which blocks serotonin, both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. The vomiting reflex that occurs after cytostatic drugs or radiotherapy is probably caused by the release of serotonin. By blocking 5HT3 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, and the central and peripheral nervous systems, ondansetron counteracts this vomiting reflex. The exact mechanism of action in PONV is unknown, but may be based on a similar principle. Rotavirus also stimulates the release of serotonin (5‐HT), so it is likely that blocking 5HT3 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract also counteracts the vomiting reflex in gastroenteritis. Therefore, extrapolation of data, including dose, in CINV and PONV is possible.

Studies

Three meta analyses (Fedorowicz et al. who included 7 studies, Tomasik et al. who included 10 studies, and Nino‐Serna et al. who included 16 studies) have evaluated the use of ondansetron for gastroenteritis. The overall conclusion based on these meta‐analyses is that the effect of ondansetron on the cessation of vomiting is limited, but treatment with ondansetron compared with placebo reduced the risk of failure of oral rehydration therapy, increased the intake of oral rehydration solution in 1 hour and 4 hours, reduced the risk of hospitalization, and reduced the need for intravenous rehydration. Ondansetron can improve the efficacy of oral rehydration therapy. An observational retrospective study by Freedman using real‐world data concludes that the preventive effect on hospital admission and use for i.v. rehydration is limited. This may be caused by suboptimal implementation of the use of ondansetron in the bundle of care delivered in the emergency department.

### Ondansetron use in pregnancy [^50469662]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends early treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy to stop progression to hyperemesis gravidarum. Nausea and vomiting and hyperemesis gravidarum typically occur during the first trimester, the sensitive time for exposure to teratogens because organogenesis is occurring in the embryo. An efficacious treatment used widely across the United States for both nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum is ondansetron. Recent studies have provided conflicting findings on the safety of ondansetron during pregnancy. There are numerous limitations in the current literature on ondansetron safety including exposure to the medication is not limited to sensitive windows of organogenesis, there is a lack of information on dosing and compliance, self-reports of exposure are commonly used, an inadequate accounting exists for other factors that may explain the relationship between ondansetron exposure and the adverse outcome, and there exists a lack of biologic plausibility by which ondansetron might cause harm. It is the authors' opinion that current data do not support a reluctance to treat women with ondansetron in clinical practice.

### 5-HT (3)-receptor antagonists for the treatment of nausea and vomiting: a reappraisal of their side-effect profile [^9acde85e]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting can cause considerable distress and discomfort to patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Several classes of antiemetic agents exist to combat these side effects, though the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have become the first-line treatment choice for many cancer patients and are considered the "gold standard" in antiemetic therapy. Compared with the older generation antiemetic drugs, 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists are effective, well tolerated, and associated with few side effects. However, emerging differences among these agents suggest that the incidence and/or intensity of adverse events should not be regarded as a class effect. The side-effect profile of any supportive care therapy is particularly important in certain subgroups of patients, including pediatric patients and the elderly, as well as those suffering comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and renal or hepatic impairment. Indeed, dolasetron is associated with cardiovascular effects, and thus, should be used with extreme caution in patients who suffer from or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals. Ondansetron, on the other hand, is associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system side effects than either dolasetron or ondansetron, and pharmacokinetic parameters are affected in patients with hepatic impairment, thereby requiring dose adjustments. Clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patients on an individual basis when choosing which 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist to prescribe.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^5846209c]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

TRADE‐OFFS: BALANCING BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ONDANSETRON

The assessment has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary editorial board of the DPF consisting of pediatricians, pharmacists, and clinical pharmacologists.

Benefits clinically relevant?

Improved efficacy of oral rehydration preventing hospital admission is considered clinically relevant. Drug therapy should only be considered if the child is at high risk for dehydration and oral rehydration is not successful.

Residual risks acceptable?

The multidisciplinary board discussed if pre‐emptive ECG testing is indicated for use in gastroenteritis. Daily practice is quite pragmatic: parents are asked for their family history of cardiac events and comedications. If negative, ondansetron is prescribed without ECG. Domperidone may also induce a prolonged QT interval. For domperidone, an ECG is only recommended when listed risk factors (hypokalemia/ poor renal function/ diabetes mellitus/ QT prolonging or comedication resulting in increased blood levels/ high doses/ pre‐existent prolonged QT time or long QT syndrome) are present. The same approach is considered acceptable to mitigate the risk of QT prolongation in ondansetron. Caution is needed in infants < 3 months old, as clinical monitoring of the drug effect is indicated.

Comparison with alternatives

Metoclopramide and domperidone are contraindicated due to the high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, especially in infants. Hence, domperidone and metoclopramide are still considered to be unsuitable. Ondansetron is considered a safer alternative.

Conclusion on balance

The benefits only outweigh the risks when oral rehydration therapy alone is insufficient and the child is at risk of dehydration. Ondansetron should not be used to treat nausea and vomiting symptoms without (imminent) dehydration.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] .

In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2, was confirmed.

Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. The results of this trial are summarized in Table 7.

### The additive interactions between ondansetron and droperidol for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting [^52d9b452]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Prophylactic ondansetron or droperidol reduces the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Previous studies showed that the combination of these two drugs produced better antiemetic effect than either drug alone. We present a nonparametric method to determine the pharmacologic interaction between ondansetron and droperidol and compared the observed response of the drug combination with that predicted from additivity. This is calculated as the product of the individual drug response, normalized to that of the controls. Five minutes before induction of anesthesia, 400 patients scheduled for laparoscopic gynecologic surgery were randomly assigned to receive 1) saline IV; 2) ondansetron 4 mg IV; 3) droperidol 1.25 mg IV; or 4) a combination of droperiodol 1.25 mg and ondansetron 4 mg IV. A standardized anesthetic technique and postoperative analgesic regimen were used. Patients were reviewed regularly for 48 h. Changes in the heart rate adjusted QT (QTc) interval were measured from electrocardiograms recorded before and 5 min after study drug administration. In a subgroup of 160 patients, QTc intervals were measured again at 2-3 h after surgery. During the first 48 h after the surgery, the proportion of patients experiencing PONV was 68% (95% CI 58-77) in the control group. A single dose of ondansetron or droperidol decreased the incidence of PONV to 30% (95% CI 21-40) and 28% (95% CI 20-38), respectively. The predicted incidence of PONV after drug combination, 11.8% (7.1-11.9), was similar to that observed, 12.1% (6.4-20.2), P = 0.94. The corresponding predicted and observed treatment responses in the combination group were 88.2% and 87.9%, respectively. There was a modest and transient increase in QTc interval after administration of ondansetron, droperidol, or their combination. The changes were however similar among groups. We conclude that the interaction between ondansetron and droperiodol was additive. Both drugs acted independently of each other through their specific mechanisms of action. The incidence of QTc prolongation did not increase with the drug combination.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron tablets have been established in pediatric patients 4 years and older for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Use of ondansetron tablets in these age-groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of ondansetron tablets in adults with additional data from 3 open-label, uncontrolled, non-US trials in 182 pediatric patients aged 4 to 18 years with cancer who were given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 

Additional information on the use of ondansetron in pediatric patients may be found in ondansetron injection prescribing information.

The safety and effectiveness of orally administered ondansetron tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for:

prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.
prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy.
prevention of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects enrolled in cancer chemotherapy-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting in US-and foreign-controlled clinical trials, for which there were subgroup analyses, 938 (19%) were aged 65 years and older.

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years of age and older and younger subjects. A reduction in clearance and increase in elimination half-life were seen in patients older than 75 years compared with younger subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There were an insufficient number of patients older than 75 years of age and older in the clinical trials to permit safety or efficacy conclusions in this age-group. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dosage adjustment is needed in elderly patients.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

In patients with severe hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the apparent volume of distribution is increased, resulting in a significant increase in the half-life of ondansetron. Therefore, do not exceed a total daily dose of 8 mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

### Consensus recommendations for the prevention of vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^2f7961ad]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In this update of our 2005 document, we used an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents for the prevention of emesis and nausea following anticancer chemotherapies of high emetic risk. A three-drug combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant beginning before chemotherapy and continuing for up to 4 days remains the standard of care. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. We conclude that, for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. In trials designed to prove the equivalence of palonosetron to ondansetron and granisetron, palonosetron proved superior in emesis prevention, while adverse effects were comparable. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration.

### Ondansetron and the risk of cardiac arrhythmias: a systematic review and postmarketing analysis [^ccda9a87]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To explore the risk of cardiac arrhythmias associated with ondansetron administration in the context of recent recommendations for identification of high-risk individuals.

Methods

We conducted a postmarketing analysis and systematically reviewed the published literature, grey literature, manufacturer's database, Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System, and the World Health Organization Individual Safety Case Reports Database (VigiBase). Eligible cases described a documented (or perceived) arrhythmia within 24 hours of ondansetron administration. The primary outcome was arrhythmia occurrence temporally associated with the administration of a single, oral ondansetron dose. Secondary objectives included identifying all cases associating ondansetron administration (any dose, frequency, or route) to an arrhythmia.

Results

Primary: No reports describing an arrhythmia associated with single oral ondansetron dose administration were identified. Secondary: Sixty unique reports were identified. Route of administration was predominantly intravenous (80%). A significant medical history (67%) or concomitant use of a QT-prolonging medication (67%) was identified in 83% of reports. Approximately one third occurred in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents, many of which are known to prolong the QT interval. An additional third involved administration to prevent postoperative vomiting.

Conclusion

Current evidence does not support routine ECG and electrolyte screening before single oral ondansetron dose administration to individuals without known risk factors. Screening should be targeted to high-risk patients and those receiving ondansetron intravenously.

### Antiemetic drug use in children: what the clinician needs to know [^87198af7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Vomiting is not only unpleasant for both children and families, but can lead to frequent hospital admission. The persistent vomiting hampers oral intake and increases the risk of dehydration, so the proper use of antiemetic drugs can be useful. The pharmacological treatment of vomiting in children remains a challenge for the pediatrician because several antiemetics are prescribed as "off-label," outside their authorized drug label. Domperidone and ondansetron are the most commonly known antiemetic drugs. A single oral dose of ondansetron has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids, and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis. There is enough evidence to support ondansetron administration in children, so the clinical use can be defined as "off-label/on evidence." This review aims to provide an overview of therapeutic use, safety, and main pharmacological properties of antiemetic drugs in children. A comprehensive search of published literature using the PubMed MEDLINE database was carried out to identify all articles published in English from 1998 to February 2018. At present time, the "off-label/on-evidence" use of some antiemetics could improve the success rate of oral rehydration therapy in pediatric emergency settings and to change the management of vomiting with the prevention of the complications.

### Prophylactic administration of ondansetron in prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus and post-operative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing caesarean section [^bb499d70]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intrathecal morphine is commonly used for post caesarean analgesia. However, their use is frequently associated with the incidence of troublesome side effects such as nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Various mechanisms have been postulated for the opioid-induced pruritus, with a variety of medications with different mechanisms of actions formulated for the prevention and treatment. But, the results are inconsistent and hence the prevention and treatment of opioid-induced pruritus still remains a challenge. Ondansetron which is antiemetic, non-sedative and has no antianalgesic effect is an antagonist to 5-HT3 receptor, the receptor with which opioids interacts and imparts its effects. Ondansetron, thus, would be an attractive treatment strategy for both opioid-induced pruritus and post-operative nausea and vomiting.

Methods

After the approval from institutional review committee and written consent received from the patient, 50 healthy parturients of ASA I and II physical status undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were enrolled for the study. They were randomly categorized into placebo group (2 ml normal saline) and treatment group (2 ml of 4 mg ondansetron), each group containing 25 patients. Pruritus and post-operative nausea and vomiting scores were recorded up to 24 hours after the administration of intrathecal morphine. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test.

Results

The incidence, severity and necessity of treatment for pruritus in the treatment group was significantly reduced compared to the placebo group (16% vs 88%). Similarly, the risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting in the treatment group was less compared to the placebo group (8% vs 56%).

Conclusion

Prophylactic administration of ondansetron to parturients receiving intrathecal morphine for post-operative analgesia provides a significant reduction of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus and nausea and vomiting.

### Mechanisms underlying the laxative effect of lactulose: a randomized placebo-controlled trial showing increased small bowel water and motility unaltered by the 5-HTreceptor antagonist, ondansetron [^678b13ba]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactulose is a laxative which accelerates transit and softens stool. Our aim was to investigate its mechanism of action and use this model of diarrhea to investigate the anti-diarrheal actions of ondansetron.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of the effect of ondansetron 8mg in 16 healthy volunteers. Serial MRI scans were performed fasted and 6h after a meal. Participants then received lactulose 13.6g twice daily and study drug for a further 36h. On Day 3, they had further serial MRI scans for 4h. Measurements included small bowel water content (SBWC), colonic volume, colonic gas, small bowel motility, whole gut transit, and ascending colon relaxation time (T1AC), a measure of colonic water content.

Key Results

Lactulose increased area under the curve (AUC) of SBWC from 0 to 240min, mean difference 14.2L·min (95% CI 4.1, 24.3), p=0.009, and substantially increased small bowel motility after 4h (mean (95% CI) 523 (457-646) a.u. to 852 (771-1178) a.u., p=0.007). There were no changes in T1AC after 36h treatment. Ondansetron did not significantly alter SBWC, small bowel motility, transit, colonic volumes, colonic gas nor T1AC, with or without lactulose.

Conclusion & Inferences

Lactulose increases SBWC and stimulates small bowel motility; however, unexpectedly it did not significantly alter colonic water content, suggesting its laxative effect is not osmotic but due to stimulation of motility. Ondansetron's lack of effect on intestinal water suggests its anti-diarrheal effect is not due to inhibition of secretion but more likely altered colonic motility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Serotonergic Drugs

Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs and SNRIs. Monitor for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. If symptoms occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

7.2 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes

Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

7.3 Tramadol

Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small trials indicate that when used together, ondansetron may increase patient-controlled administration of tramadol. Monitor patients to ensure adequate pain control when ondansetron is administered with tramadol.

7.4 Chemotherapy

Carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.

In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase systemic concentrations of high-dose methotrexate.

7.5 Alfentanil and Atracurium

Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium. Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied.

### Molecular mechanism of setron-mediated inhibition of full-length 5-HTreceptor [^0febcbe0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Considerable progress has been made towards prevention and control of emesis in cancer therapy. First-generation setrons, including ondansetron, dolasetron, granisetron, and tropisetron, are generally well tolerated by most patients with high antiemetic efficacy. However, the conventional antiemetic regimen is suboptimal for acute-phase and delayed-onset emesis. Palonosetron, the only second-generation setron, addresses some of these shortcomings with a higher binding affinity and a longer half-life,. Still, refractory emesis and adverse side effects limit clinical use. A better understanding of setrons’ antagonistic action on 5-HT 3 Rs would enhance their therapeutic potential,.

There has been extensive debate on the binding orientation of setrons in 5-HT 3 R. Previous docking studies have found several energetically favorable poses within the orthosteric binding pocket –. The predicted orientations of setrons and residue interactions vary significantly among these studies due to uncertainties in homology models and the binding pocket conformation. First high-resolution views of setrons’ binding poses came from crystal structures of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), bound to granisetron, tropisetron, or palonosetron –. AChBP, a soluble homolog of the pLGIC extracellular domain (ECD), proved to be an excellent surrogate to explain ligand-recognition properties of the pLGIC family. However, the absence of transmembrane and ICDs in AChBP masks the full range of conformational changes exhibited by the channel. These knowledge gaps could be settled by atomic-resolution structures of the full-length 5-HT 3 R in complex with serotonin and different antagonists. These structures could, in turn, serve as starting points toward the design of more effective therapeutics.

### The effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in children with acute gastroenteritis ; a retrospective observational study [^7a581723]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is one of the most common diseases of children, with 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually and about 500,000 deaths of children under 5 years old. The World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended oral rehydration therapy (ORT) as initial treatment in mildly to moderately dehydrated children. Successful treatment with ORT reduces the need for intravenous (IV) fluid therapy and can reduce the duration of hospital stay and prevent unnecessary use of medical resources. Vomiting control is pivotal in the treatment of mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE. In the emergency department (ED), vomiting is a major obstacle to the use of ORT. Recent studies have recommended the use of oral ondansetron as an antiemetic.

Ondansetron is an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 and may cause QT prolongation due to its mechanism of action. Many studies have reported that ondansetron can enable the successful use of ORT by suppressing vomiting [,–]. Ondansetron has also been safely and effectively used in patients with cancer and postoperative patients. However, the US Food and Drug Administration reported in 2011 that IV ondansetron possibly caused fatal arrhythmias in patients with prolonged QT interval. On the other hand, recent studies found that IV ondansetron did not cause QT prolongation or increase the risk of fatal arrhythmias in mildly to moderately dehydrated pediatric patients with AGE.

For convenience, oral ondansetron has been preferred to IV ondansetron to treat children with vomiting while receiving ORT. Most previous studies have focused on the safety of IV ondansetron, and there have been no studies of changes in QT interval after oral administration of ondansetron. Therefore, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of oral ondansetron on QT interval in mildly to moderately dehydrated children with AGE.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ondansetron; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4)] .

5.2 QT Prolongation

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .

### Investigating the effect of ondansetron in reducing myoclonic movements caused by intravenous administration of etomidate [^6b0c317a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, no study has investigated the effect of ondansetron on etomidate-induced myoclonus. However, some studies have focused on the effects of this drug on other side effects similar to that of etomidate, such as shivering after anesthesia. Postoperative hypothermia and shivering are frequent and unpleasant side effects of general and local anesthesia. Prevention and treatment of post-anesthesia shivering is an important aspect of patient care, as it may be associated with a number of harmful consequences, including increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Shivering may lead to increase in metabolic activity, increased oxygen uptake up to 100% and arterial hypoxia, which are associated with an increased risk of myocardial ischemia. Inhibition of the HT3-5 system leads to a dose-dependent reduction in shivering. Ondansetron is a specific HT3-5 receptor antagonist. The mechanism of action of this drug can be related to inhibition of serotonin in the preoptic area of ​​the anterior hypothalamus. In this regard, a double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted with the aim of comparing the effectiveness of ondansetron and meperidine on 90 patients undergoing general anesthesia; the results indicated the effectiveness of ondansetron versus meperidine in preventing post-operative shivering. There was no difference in the amount of myoclonus, seizures and rashes between the two groups. Similarly, Kelsaka et al. study has supported the effect of ondansetron on preventing postoperative shivering. However, the results of another study indicated that ondansetron does not respond to the shivering threshold. The difference in the results of these studies can be due to the different dosage of the prescribed drug used.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^d9b2c817]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron)—comparative efficacy, safety, dosing limits, and pregnancy risk are described as follows: randomized trials reported that intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide had similar efficacy with fewer adverse symptoms at 24 hours on ondansetron, oral ondansetron was better at controlling vomiting with similar nausea control, and ondansetron was more effective than doxylamine plus vitamin B6 in a small double-blind RCT of 36 women. Common adverse effects include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, and constipation, and ondansetron can prolong the QT interval. In December 2012, the FDA removed the 32-mg single intravenous dose because of QT prolongation leading to torsade de pointes, and recommends ondansetron not be given intravenously in doses greater than 16 mg; electrolyte and electrocardiogram monitoring are recommended for patients with arrhythmia risk factors. There are insufficient fetal safety data; a possible first-trimester association with cleft palate has limited evidence, and a systematic review found eight studies with a small increase in cardiac defects in two studies (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI; 1.3-3.1 and OR, 1.62; 95% CI; 1.04-2.14) but no increase in overall malformations. Women should be counseled regarding the available data, and the use of ondansetron before 10 weeks of gestation should be individualized weighing the risks and benefits.

### Adjunctive ondansetron for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^acbbc65b]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the efficacy and safety of adjunctive ondansetron, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in the treatment of schizophrenia. Only RCTs examining adjunctive ondansetron for schizophrenia were included. Standardized mean difference (SMD), risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed using RevMan, Version 5.3. Study quality was evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias and the Jadad scale. Data of 5 RCTs (n = 304) covering 149 patients on ondansetron (4-8 mg/day) and 155 patients on placebo were analyzed. Three RCTs reported "randomized allocation" with a specific description; the weighted Jadad score was 3.8. Adjunctive ondansetron outperformed placebo in the reduction of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score [3 RCTs, n = 171; SMD: -1.06 (95%CI: -2.10, -0.02), p = 0.04, I 2  = 85%], the negative [4 RCTs, n = 209; SMD: -0.96 (95%CI: -1.71, -0.22), p = 0.01, I 2  = 80%], and general psychopathology symptom scores [3 RCTs, n = 171; SMD: -0.97 (95%CI: -1.91, -0.02), p = 0.04, I 2  = 82%], but not in the positive (p = 0.05) and depressive symptom scores (p = 0.91). The difference in PANSS total score remained significant after excluding one outlying RCT [2 RCTs, n = 141; SMD: -0.50 (95%CI: -0.84, -0.16), P = 0.004, I 2  = 0%]. Four RCTs examined the effect of ondansetron on cognition applying different instruments yielding conflicting findings. Ondansetron was superior over placebo in improving extrapyramidal symptoms, but no group differences were found in overall discontinuation rate and adverse drug reactions. In conclusion, adjunctive ondansetron appears to be efficacious and safe in improving negative symptoms and general psychopathology. The effect of ondansetron on cognitive impairment in schizophrenia needs to be further explored in large-scale RCTs.

### Dexamethasone versus ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^261e3c4e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common distressing symptom in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery and can contribute to anxiety, dehydration, metabolic abnormality, wound disruption, delayed recovery and other issues. The incidence of PONV varies from 20 to 80 %, and it is an economic and social burden. Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, that exhibits an anti-emetic action by antagonizing vomiting signals in the afferent pathway from the stomach or small intestine and solitary tract nucleus, and is effective at preventing PONV, however the high cost of this drug has prevented it from being widely used. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, was first reported as an effective anti-emetic agent in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy in 1981. Wang et al. confirmed that dexamethasone is most effective when it is administered at the induction rather than at the termination of anaesthesia. However, the mechanism underlying the anti-emetic effects of dexamethasone is still unknown. It may be involved in central inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, or it may cause a decrease in serotonin turnover in the central nervous system.

Today, cost-benefit analyses have become an important factor when considering what drugs to use as prophylactic antiemetics. The cost-to-benefit ratio for the patient was much higher in the ondansetron group than in the dexamethasone group. However, it has not been established whether dexamethasone is a cost-effective alternative to ondansetron in the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. It is highly necessary to conduct a meta-analysis to assess the results of the currently published studies on this topic. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to compare the efficacy of dexamethasone with that of ondansetron.

Ondansetron or granisetron are preferred because of the larger body of evidence, and patients can receive breakthrough therapy as needed; alternative explanations for symptoms should be investigated to avoid the need for prophylactic therapy for the remainder of radiation therapy.

### Positive effect of bimodal release ondansetron in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: relevance of low-grade inflammation? [^895c8497]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a clear unmet need for new treatments in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Ondansetron, an old 5-hydroxy-tryptamine3 antagonist, used for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and with favorable side effect profile, has shown promising results in previous trials. In this issue, efficacy with a novel bimodal release ondansetron formulation was presented in IBS-D. The bimodal release ondansetron improved stool consistency, presumably by slowing transit time, and tended to improve other IBS symptoms as well. The authors proposed C-reactive protein levels as a tool to select responders because a better response was seen in patients with slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels. Future large-scale studies will determine the role of bimodal release ondansetron in IBS-D with and without low-grade inflammation.

### Pooled analysis of phase III clinical studies of palonosetron versus ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [^c30aec9b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of pooled patient-level data from four multicenter, phase III, randomized, double-blind, comparative trials demonstrates that palonosetron has a safety profile similar to that of older 5HT 3 RAs but provides superior prophylaxis of CINV. Palonosetron demonstrated significantly higher complete response (CR) and complete control (CC) rates than older 5HT 3 RAs (ondansetron, dolasetron, and granisetron) during the delayed (>24-120 h), and overall (0–120 h) postchemotherapy periods. The number of emetic episodes and severity of nausea were also significantly different for palonosetron compared with older 5HT 3 RAs.

The most noteworthy differences between palonosetron and older 5HT 3 RAs occurred in the delayed phase and throughout the overall 5-day evaluation period. Palonosetron therefore provides an effective option for delayed onset CINV, an effect of chemotherapy that previously had been more difficult to manage due to the limited efficacy of older 5HT 3 RAs in this context. Further, palonosetron may be more effective in controlling nausea (particularly delayed nausea), which remains a challenge despite the antiemetic efficacy of the older 5HT 3 RAs. The observed advantage of palonosetron in efficacy during the delayed phase may be explained by differences in binding characteristics of palonosetron (i.e. a longer elimination half-life relative to other 5HT 3 RAs and triggering of receptor internalization leading to prolonged inhibition of receptor function and NK 1 cross talk). All of the studies evaluated outcomes following a single dose of palonosetron or other 5HT 3 RAs given on day 1 of chemotherapy; outcomes may differ with the use of multi-day antiemetic treatment regimens.

### Effective cross-over to granisetron after failure to ondansetron, a randomized double blind study in patients failing ondansetron plus dexamethasone during the first 24 hours following highly emetogenic chemotherapy [^67cbd2e1]. British Journal of Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

In view of the similarity in chemical structure of the available 5HT 3 -receptor antagonists it is assumed, whilst these agents all act at the same receptor, that failure to one agent would predict subsequent failure to all 5HT 3 -receptor antagonists. We conducted a randomized double blind trial of granisetron 3 mg plus dexamethasone 10 mg versus continued treatment with ondansetron 8 mg plus dexamethasone 10 mg in patients with protection failure on ondansetron 8 mg plus dexamethasone 10 mg during the first 24 hours following highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Of 40 eligible patients, 21 received ondansetron + dexamethasone and 19 received granisetron + dexamethasone. We found a significant benefit from crossing-over to granisetron after failure on ondansetron. Of the 19 patients who crossed over to granisetron, 9 patients obtained complete protection, whereas this was observed in 1 of the 21 patients continuing ondansetron, P = 0.005. These results indicate that there is no complete cross-resistance between 5HT 3 -receptor antagonists, and that patients who have acute protection failure on one 5HT 3 -receptor antagonist should be offered cross-over to another 5HT 3 -receptor antagonist. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ondansetron tablets; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 QT Prolongation

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron tablets. Avoid ondansetron tablets in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials of patients treated with ondansetron, the active ingredient of ondansetron tablets. A causal relationship to therapy with ondansetron tablets was unclear in many cases.

 Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting 

The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 4% of 300 adults receiving a single 24 mg dose of ondansetron tablets orally in 2 trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy (cisplatin  greater than or equal to  50 mg/m2) were: headache (11%) and diarrhea (4%).

The most common adverse reactions reported in 4 trials in adults for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (primarily cyclophosphamide-based regimens) are shown in Table 3.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^3267f0eb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for acute cyclic vomiting syndrome—Recommendation 8 and supporting remarks indicate that the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents not responding to outpatient abortive therapies (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects); the panel noted that ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings, is considered probably effective especially in those with lower-intensity attacks though part of its apparent efficacy may result from treatment bias or placebo effect, and decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety which can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant oral anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine; alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant; background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

RISK TOLERANCE FOR THE USE OF ONDANSETRON FOR GASTROENTERITIS‐INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING

The assessment has been reviewed by the DPF’s editorial board. The board concluded that in cases where prolonged nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea leads to (risk of) dehydration, drug treatment can be considered to prevent hospital admission and to improve the success rate of oral rehydration. Vomiting and diarrhea are uncomfortable symptoms for both the child and parent, but do not need treatment in general. Editorial board members do not have conflicts of interest (as author of any of the papers included or as consultant to pharmaceutical industry). Some board members are familiar with using ondansetron for gastroenteritis. QT prolongation is rare and not conceived as a frequent or serious problem in children in daily practice and is sufficiently covered by—pragmatically—assessing family history on cardiac events and other risk factors. Serious side effects are not observed. This may bias their opinion favoring the use of ondansetron. There is a relevant medical need to treat children in whom oral rehydration alone is not successful, in both university hospitals and regular pediatric clinics.

UNCERTAINTIES ON THE USE OF ONDANSETRON

There are no critical questions that remain unanswered.

Uncertainty

Malignant hyperthermia is reported in a single case study. However, a board member has serious doubts on the validity and directness of the diagnosis malignant hyperthermia. The authors of the case report suggest that malignant hyperthermia can be plausible based on animal studies. No clinical studies were found linking ondansetron to malignant hyperthermia. This is confirmed by a query among anesthesiologists.

Quality of evidence

Beneficial effect of ondansetron in gastroenteritis is confirmed by meta‐analyses. Dose is confirmed in PONV and CINV by SmPC, PK studies, and pediatric dose finding studies. The safety profile of ondansetron is well known based on use in PONV and CINV.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^927cbcd7]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The homo-taurine analog acamprosate is approved for the treatment of alcoholism, and its efficacy is supported by meta-analysis. The effect size is however small, and was not reproduced in the largest trial,. Both in animal models and in patients, acamprosate influences glutamatergic mechanisms,. Animal data suggest that severely dependent individuals, in whom glutamatergic dysregulation is most pronounced, should be most likely to respond to acamprosate. However, the exact molecular mechanism through which acamprosate exerts its effect remains unknown, and it has been suggested that it simply functions as a carrier of calcium-ions into the CNS. This mechanism could help explain its low potency; the recommended daily dose is 2 g. The combination of modest efficacy, a short half-life that necessitates three times daily administration, and a high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects has led to a very limited clinical uptake of acamprosate.

Meta-analytic support for efficacy is also present for some medications that lack approval for the treatment of alcohol addiction, but are approved for other indications. Among these, perhaps the strongest support is available for the anti-epileptic topiramate –. Topiramate has complex molecular mechanisms of action, but because its efficacy appears to be moderated by a polymorphism at the locus encoding the kainate receptor subunit GRIK1, its actions are likely to be mediated through glutamatergic mechanisms. The anti-emetic 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron has support for efficacy in some patient populations –. There are additional approved medications that have some support for their efficacy in alcohol addiction, suggesting that they could be considered for repurposing. These include the nicotinic partial agonist varenicline, that has marketing approval for smoking cessation, and the GABA-B agonist baclofen –, which has long been used for spasticity.

IDENTIFIED BENEFITS AND RISKS

Benefits

Ondansetron improves success of oral rehydration therapy and prevents hospitalization. Appropriate dose selection is possible.

Risks

Infants up to 3 months of age have a greater risk for toxicity as exposure to ondansetron may be increased due to reduced clearance in this population. At the same time, when correcting based on reduced clearance only, these children are at risk for underexposure due to the higher Vd. Dose‐dependent prolongation of the QT interval may occur especially in children with congenital long QT interval syndrome. Prolongation of the QT interval is dose dependent. Use of ondansetron has a limited effect on cessation of vomiting.

### Oral ondansetron administration to nondehydrated children with diarrhea and associated vomiting in emergency departments in Pakistan: a randomized controlled trial [^6aab964c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Diarrhea accounts for greater than 500,000 deaths annually in children younger than 5 years.A critical advance has been the introduction of oral rehydration therapy employing oral rehydration solution. However, oral rehydration solution use has stagnated in most countries.When children in settings with limited health care services have fluid losses that cannot be replaced orally because of intractable vomiting, death is a potential outcome. Vomiting significantly affects oral rehydration therapy success,and in Karachi, Pakistan, 80% of children who develop severe dehydration have persistent vomiting, with a high frequency in the first 6 hours of therapy.Consequently, antiemetic administration and antibiotic use are widespread,along with intravenous fluid administration.

Editor’s Capsule Summary

What is already known on this topic

In high-income countries, ondansetron can reduce intravenous fluid use.

What question this study addressed

In a middle-income country, does oral administration of a single dose of oral ondansetron reduce the rate of intravenous fluid administration in children with vomiting and diarrhea but without dehydration?

What this study adds to our knowledge

In this trial of 626 children, a single dose of oral ondansetron did not reduce intravenous fluid use. No serious adverse events were reported.

How this is relevant to clinical practice

Clinicians should not prescribe ondansetron to vomiting children without evidence of dehydration.

Importance

Oral rehydration therapy failures occur primarily because of persistent vomiting and an inability to drink.Consequently, World Health Organization (WHO) protocols recommend intravenous fluid therapy administration in such circumstances, which may divert resources from more needy patients. An easy-to-administer, effective, safe, and affordable antiemetic agent has the potential to save lives. WHO also recommends that antiemetics not be given to young children with diarrhea or dysentery.Although older antiemetic agents had unacceptable adverse effects and limited efficacy,recent research has demonstrated that a single ondansetron dose can reduce vomiting, intravenous rehydration use, and hospitalization while improving oral rehydration therapy efficacy.

### The pronociceptive effect of ondansetron in the setting of P-glycoprotein inhibition [^6bcabd50]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is a potent antiemetic drug that acts through inhibition of the 5HT3 receptors for serotonin. Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for isoflurane is not affected by systemic ondansetron; however ondansetron is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, a transport pump expressed in the blood-brain barrier. Thus, we hypothesized that central nervous system concentrations of ondansetron might be reduced by the P-gp protein. As potent inhibitors of P-gp are in clinical trials to improve access of desirable chemotherapeutic and antibiotic drugs to the central nervous system, we studied the effect of ondansetron in the absence of extrusion by P-gp. Normal rats were given lumbar intrathecal ondansetron or vehicle. P-gp knockout mice and wild-type controls were treated with systemic ondansetron in the presence and absence of clinically used P-gp inhibitors. Nociception was assessed as thermal hindpaw withdrawal latency and immobility was assessed as isoflurane MAC. In rats, intrathecal ondansetron (20 g) increased thermal pain sensitivity by 20.0% +/- 5.8% (P < 0.01). Systemic ondansetron (2 mg/kg) increased pain sensitivity in P-gp knockout mice but had no effect in wild-type mice (P < 0.01). Systemic ondansetron had a small but statistically significant pronociceptive effect after treatment of wild-type mice with the P-gp inhibitor quinidine but not with cyclosporine or verapamil. Isoflurane MAC was not changed by intrathecal ondansetron in rats or systemically administered ondansetron in P-gp knockout mice. Intrathecal ondansetron can enhance thermal pain sensitivity. In the absence of P-gp protein, ondansetron can reach concentrations sufficient to increase pain sensitivity. Even with direct spinal application, ondansetron does not alter isoflurane MAC, supporting the idea that 5HT3 modulation does not play a role in general anesthetic immobility.

Research agenda for PONV—Future priorities include refinement of risk assessment given wide inter-individual variability in PONV; genome-wide association studies have identified several candidate SNPs in Caucasian and East Asian populations; inflammation may contribute to risk, with early research suggesting that elevated preoperative peripheral blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios may be markers for individual risk; historically, modern approaches started with generic ondansetron, making risk identification actionable with an effective, safe and cost-accessible antiemetic, yet further improvement is still needed in both knowledge and practice.
