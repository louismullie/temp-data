## Question

Differential diagnosis for bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define bradycardia and classify it into major mechanistic buckets. Then, I should verify the high-yield reversible causes that must be excluded early. Next, I will organize intrinsic and extrinsic etiologies, including medications, metabolic, infectious, infiltrative, ischemic, and autonomic contributors. After that, I need to consider special populations and age-specific nuances. Finally, I will integrate a practical diagnostic approach and highlight red flags and pitfalls, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or key studies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor incorrectly. Bradycardia is generally defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute, but I should emphasize that symptoms and context matter more than the number itself, and the two principal categories are sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block, with a third bucket of conduction disorders that can mimic or coexist with bradycardia, which aligns with contemporary guideline frameworks [^e75bd2dc] [^628324c1] [^10e4e2b6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic disease before excluding reversible causes. I need to check for medication-induced bradycardia first because it is common and modifiable: beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics, and even ophthalmic timolol can precipitate clinically significant bradycardia, and withdrawal or dose reduction often resolves the rhythm disturbance, so I should always reconcile the medication list and timing carefully [^5f70546d] [^96fdccf9] [^4ac6f3f8].

> Next, I should review metabolic and systemic contributors that can be corrected. Hypothyroidism, electrolyte derangements such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia, systemic acidosis, hypothermia, and hypoxia can all depress sinus node automaticity or AV nodal conduction, and I need to ensure targeted labs like TSH, potassium, and pH are obtained when clinically suspected rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately [^a47b23a6] [^dcbe727a] [^62c75552].

> I will now examine infectious and inflammatory etiologies because missing them delays definitive therapy. Lyme disease with AV block, myocarditis, Chagas disease, diphtheria, and COVID-19 can all cause bradycardia via direct conduction system injury or autonomic effects; notably, remdesivir has been associated with bradycardia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, so I should correlate timing of drug exposure and consider infectious serologies when the story fits [^62c75552] [^3b6ffa77] [^092ae877].

> Let me consider infiltrative and structural heart disease next. Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, and lymphoma can infiltrate the conduction system, while ischemic cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease can impair sinus node or AV nodal function; in these settings, echocardiography and advanced imaging may be warranted to characterize structure and guide pacing decisions, especially when AV block patterns suggest infranodal disease or myocardial scarring [^62c75552] [^886b51bf].

> But wait, what if the bradycardia is vagally mediated or situational. I should double-check for autonomic triggers such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity, neurally mediated syncope, and sleep-related vagal surges, including obstructive sleep apnea, because these can produce nocturnal bradycardia or high-grade AV block that is often asymptomatic and not an indication for pacing unless there are frequent, correlating syncopal episodes with a dominant bradycardic component [^9aa86332] [^fd2f26e4] [^d9e6b91a].

> I need to ensure I account for ischemia and infarction, particularly inferior MI, which can cause AV nodal ischemia and varying degrees of AV block. In acute settings, I should prioritize reperfusion and supportive care while monitoring for progression, and I should remember that atropine may be less effective in denervated hearts such as after cardiac transplant, prompting earlier consideration of catecholamines or pacing [^62c75552] [^db7022e1] [^4cdc2ddb].

> Let me think about age-specific nuances. In neonates and infants, bradycardia thresholds are much higher and non-cardiac causes predominate, including autonomic immaturity, electrolyte disturbances, hypothyroidism, and medications; in adolescents, marked sinus bradycardia can be physiologic, whereas in older adults degenerative fibrosis and medication effects are more common, so I should tailor the differential and thresholds to age and context [^f3523445] [^9ce16885] [^62c75552].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios. Athletes may have physiologic bradycardia from training and intrinsic nodal remodeling, but symptoms in veteran athletes warrant evaluation for pathologic degeneration; oncology patients on agents like alectinib can develop reversible SND; and patients with epilepsy may exhibit ictal bradycardia or asystole where pacing is reasonable if antiseizure therapy fails and bradycardia is temporally linked to seizures [^9697b8b4] [^bbc95da3] [^aa2f7d77].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach to avoid missing correlating events. A 12-lead ECG is mandatory to define rhythm, rate, and conduction, and ambulatory monitoring should be matched to symptom frequency, with Holter for daily symptoms, external loop or patch recorders for weekly to monthly events, and implantable cardiac monitors for infrequent symptoms beyond 30 days; exercise testing helps assess chronotropic competence and clarify level of AV block when needed [^59552990] [^55a9f421] [^02dc6824] [^84b4c4cc].

> Hold on, I should verify when invasive testing is justified. Electrophysiology study is generally reserved for unexplained syncope with a high pretest probability of conduction disease or when noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic, and it can help distinguish AV nodal from infranodal block and assess sinus node function when clinically relevant, though most bradycardia can be clarified noninvasively [^6c680851] [^52f4975b].

> Let me reconsider red flags and pitfalls so I don't anchor prematurely. Wide-complex bradycardia should prompt consideration of hyperkalemia, drug toxicity, or ischemia; profound nocturnal bradycardia should trigger screening for sleep apnea rather than immediate pacing; and new AV block in a patient on chronic AV nodal blockers may not reverse and could herald progression, warranting closer surveillance or pacing consideration even after drug withdrawal [^db7022e1] [^d9e6b91a] [^5d515406].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm true bradycardia and classify it as SND or AV block, immediately search for and reverse medication, metabolic, infectious, or ischemic causes, tailor the differential to age and comorbidities, correlate symptoms with rhythm documentation using appropriate monitoring, and escalate to pacing only when indications are clear and reversible causes have been addressed, aligning decisions with patient preferences through shared decision-making [^628324c1] [^5f70546d] [^07674dd2].

Bradycardia has a broad differential, but **reversible causes must be prioritized** [^00fc3766] because they are common and correctable [^5f70546d]. The most frequent are **medications** (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics) [^5f70546d], **metabolic disturbances** (hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, acidosis, hypothermia) [^a47b23a6], and **acute ischemia** (especially inferior MI) [^62c75552]. Other important causes include autonomic dysfunction (vasovagal, carotid sinus hypersensitivity) [^9aa86332], infectious/inflammatory disease (Lyme, myocarditis, COVID-19) [^62c75552] [^3b6ffa77], and structural heart disease (degenerative conduction system disease, infiltrative cardiomyopathies) [^44a82e17]. Initial evaluation should include a 12-lead ECG [^59552990], targeted labs (TSH, electrolytes, troponin, Lyme serology if indicated) [^a47b23a6], and medication review; management focuses on correcting reversible causes before considering pacing [^d10677ba].

## Physiological bradycardia

Physiological bradycardia is common in healthy individuals and reflects **increased vagal tone** or **reduced metabolic demand** [^ebf68f32]. It is typically benign and does not require intervention unless symptomatic.

- **Athletic conditioning**: Increased vagal tone from endurance training lowers resting heart rate; often < 50 bpm in elite athletes [^9697b8b4].
- **Sleep**: Parasympathetic dominance during sleep slows heart rate; nocturnal bradycardia is common and usually benign [^9aa86332].
- **Age**: Sinus bradycardia is common in older adults due to degenerative changes in the conduction system [^62c75552].

---

## Pathological bradycardia

Pathological bradycardia results from **intrinsic conduction system disease** or **extrinsic factors** that impair sinus node or AV nodal function [^62c75552].

---

### Intrinsic causes

Intrinsic causes reflect **primary conduction system disease** or structural heart disease [^44a82e17].

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Degenerative conduction system disease | - Sick sinus syndrome <br/> - AV block (first, second, third degree) <br/> - Bundle branch block [^628324c1] |
| Structural heart disease | - Ischemic cardiomyopathy <br/> - Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy <br/> - Valvular heart disease <br/> - Congenital heart disease [^44a82e17] |
| Infiltrative diseases | - Amyloidosis <br/> - Sarcoidosis <br/> - Hemochromatosis <br/> - Lymphoma [^44a82e17] |
| Infectious/inflammatory | - Lyme disease <br/> - Myocarditis <br/> - Chagas disease <br/> - COVID-19 [^62c75552] [^3b6ffa77] |
| Genetic/congenital | - Long QT syndrome <br/> - Brugada syndrome <br/> - Congenital AV block [^notfound] |

---

### Extrinsic causes

Extrinsic causes are **reversible or modifiable** and should be actively sought and corrected [^5f70546d].

- **Medications**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol), opioids, sedatives, and ophthalmic beta-blockers (timolol) [^5f70546d] [^96fdccf9].
- **Metabolic disturbances**: Hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, acidosis, hypothermia, hypoxia [^a47b23a6].
- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, neurocardiogenic syncope [^9aa86332].
- **Acute ischemia**: Especially inferior MI causing AV nodal ischemia [^62c75552].
- **Trauma/surgery**: Cardiac surgery, ablation, catheterization, or direct conduction system injury [^44a82e17].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential to identify reversible causes and guide therapy [^bb63b3e2].

- **History**: Symptoms (syncope, presyncope, fatigue, dyspnea), medication use, comorbidities, family history, occupational exposures (e.g. Lyme) [^ab10b358].
- **Physical exam**: Vitals, signs of hypothyroidism, heart failure, neurologic deficits, stigmata of infiltrative disease [^notfound].
- **ECG**: 12-lead ECG to document rhythm, rate, conduction, and ischemia [^59552990].
- **Labs**: TSH, electrolytes, troponin, Lyme serology if indicated, drug levels (digoxin) [^a47b23a6].
- **Imaging**: Echocardiography for structural heart disease; consider MRI for infiltrative disease or myocarditis [^886b51bf].

---

## Management principles

Management centers on **correcting reversible causes** and instituting pacing only when indicated [^d10677ba]. Reversible causes should be treated promptly — withdraw offending drugs, correct metabolic derangements, treat ischemia, infections, or hypothyroidism, and manage autonomic dysfunction [^5f70546d]. Permanent pacing is indicated for symptomatic SND or AV block after reversible causes are excluded, or for acquired second-degree Mobitz II, high-grade, or complete AV block regardless of symptoms [^d9e6b91a].

---

Bradycardia spans physiological variants and serious disease; **prioritize reversible causes** — especially medications, metabolic disturbances, and ischemia — and use a structured evaluation to guide targeted therapy and pacing decisions [^5f70546d].

Introduction

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

Objective

This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

Discussion

Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Conclusion

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

### Bradycardia and coronavirus disease 2019: what is behind? [^092ae877]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

We read with interest the paper by Kumar et al. on the prevalence of bradycardia and its association with mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Among 1053 patients hospitalized with COVID‐19, 24.9% had absolute (< 60 bpm) and 13.0% profound (< 50 bpm) bradycardia. Subjects with absolute bradycardia exhibited a higher mortality risk compared with those with normal heart rhythm (odds ratio: 6.59; 95% confidence interval: 2.83–15.36).

It is well established that SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is associated with cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and rhythm abnormalities, including bradycardia. Severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells in the setting of myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, electrolyte and intravascular volume imbalances, along with cytokine release syndrome and drug‐associated side effects have been proposed as probable causes of arrhythmias in this setting.

Corticosteroids, remdesivir, tocilizumab, and anakinra are the commonly used drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. Among them, remdesivir has been previously associated with bradycardia. Mitochondrial dysfunction prompted by the strong affinity of remdesivir for human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h‐mtRNAP), along with atrioventricular nodal inhibition due to its resemblance with adenosine, could be potential mechanisms. Kumar et al. reported that 28.7% of patients treated with remdesivir developed an absolute bradycardic response. In this regard, a formal statistical comparison between patients on versus off remdesivir would be useful in determining whether this medication was associated with increased bradycardia risk in their study. Moreover, the association of day of remdesivir administration with bradycardia diagnosis should be explored. Finally, it would be quite interesting if the authors investigated any association between remdesivir‐associated bradycardia and mortality.

Bradycardia is frequent and clinically relevant in patients with COVID‐19. Additional studies are needed to elucidate its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Cardiac arrhythmias in oncological patients-epidemiology, risk factors, and management within the context of the new ESC 2022 guidelines [^06601e7e]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Bradycardia

Bradycardia episodes secondary to cancer treatment are usually asymptomatic depending on the heart rate at the time of the episode. Possible symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, pre-syncope, or syncope. If the patient is symptomatic, Holter-ECG is recommended to assess the severity of the bradycardia and exclude long sinus pauses. A trial of withdrawing anticancer drugs should be performed to confirm the coincidence with the symptoms. A multidisciplinary team should discuss the risks and benefits of continuing the treatment at a lower dose and eventually consider alternative therapy. The pacemaker implantation is indicated, when there is no substitution for the current treatment. The final decision should take into account patients' preferences and should be made after cardiologist and oncologist consultation.

To summarize, the management of arrhythmias in oncological patients should be based on current clinical practice guidelines, especially the newest ESC Guidelines on Cardio-oncology. Careful patient observation for possible symptoms of the arrhythmia and ECG monitoring are the basis of the management during oncological treatment with high arrhythmogenic potential.

### Clinical implication of COVID-19 associated bradycardia [^0356776b]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Kumar and colleagues performed a large‐scale multicenter retrospective study including more than 1000 COVID‐19 patients and found that bradycardia was prevalent and associated with higher mortality among them. Their findings are of great interest because infection and high fever are, in general, associated with tachycardia. Several concerns have been raised.

To further clarify the mechanism of COVID‐19 associated bradycardia, it is of great interest to investigate the type of bradycardia: sinus bradycardia, AV block, or atrial fibrillation. Noncardiac causes should be carefully excluded, including sedation, conduction‐suppressive medications, and hypothyroidism.

The causality between bradycardia and mortality remains unclear. Bradycardia might be a marker of the advanced stage of COVID‐19 or a direct cause of death. Bradycardia might be more prevalent in patients with COVID‐19 associated myocarditis with incremental troponin level. On the other hand, bradycardia might cause low cardiac output accompanying cardiogenic shock. If bradycardia is harmful, aggressive intervention to bradycardia, including pacemaker therapy, would be beneficial. In their study, was the dominant cause of death in patients with bradycardia respiratory failure or heart failure?

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — methodology and evidence review — The recommendations listed in this guideline are, whenever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evidence review of human studies in English indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was conducted from January 2017 to September 2017, with key search words including AV block, bradycardia, bundle branch block, conduction disturbance, left bundle branch block, loop recorder, pauses, permanent pacemaker, sick sinus syndrome, sinus node dysfunction, and temporary pacemaker. Additional relevant studies published through January 2018 were considered and added to evidence tables when appropriate, and the final evidence tables in the Online Data Supplement summarize the evidence used to formulate recommendations. An independent evidence review committee was commissioned to perform a formal systematic review of 11 critical clinical questions related to bradycardia, after which findings were formally presented and discussed and then recommendations were developed. A systematic review titled "Impact of Physiologic Versus Right Ventricular Pacing Among Patients With Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Greater Than 35%" is published in conjunction with this guideline, and its data supplements are available online.

Acute management of SND — reversible causes recommends that in symptomatic patients presenting with SND, evaluation and treatment of reversible causes is recommended. Most patients with SND present with chronic complaints that do not require acute treatment, and most causes of SND are chronic and irreversible, although sinus bradyarrhythmias are attributable to potentially reversible causes such as acute MI, atrial tachyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, medications, infections, and metabolic abnormalities. Because patients are typically stable and minimally symptomatic on presentation with SND, no acute therapy is usually required and evaluation of SND and assessment for potentially reversible causes can be performed in an outpatient setting. In some cases, although evaluation of reversible causes for SND should be undertaken, treatment may not be necessary, for example stopping a beta blocker in an asymptomatic patient with sinus bradycardia after ST-elevation MI, and some patients with tachy-brady syndrome may have improvement of sinoatrial node function after treatment aimed at maintaining sinus rhythm.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: how to manage neonatal bradycardia [^f3523445]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal bradycardia is characterised by a heart rate below 80 bpm, irrespective of gestational age. It is generally self-resolving but, in some cases, represents an underlying pathology which may be cardiac or non-cardiac in origin. The common causes for bradycardia are non-cardiac in origin such as autonomic immaturity in premature infants, electrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism and medications. Cardiac causes include-sinus bradycardia, conduction system abnormalities, congenital heart disease and channelopathies. Diagnostic investigations typically include a standard 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter monitor and an echocardiogram. This article aims to provide a practical framework for the management of neonates with bradycardia and guide further investigation and/or referral to specialist paediatric cardiology services.

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^ebf68f32]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals, and in patients as part of normal aging or disease (Table 1). Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. In this review, we will highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — transient/reversible causes of sinus node dysfunction (SND) states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of the offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms; medications are frequent culprits, including negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Additional reversible contributors noted include hypothyroidism with cardiovascular abnormalities that respond to thyroxine, metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia in acute settings, and other treatable conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure, acute MI, severe hypothermia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of bradycardia — symptoms and definitions: Bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: SND and atrioventricular block. The electrocardiographic findings in patients with SND are varied and the diagnosis may be considered in patients with sinus bradycardia or atrial depolarization from a subsidiary pacemaker other than the sinus node (ie, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm, or ventricular escape), intermittent sinus pauses, or a blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia (usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest, but sometimes with atrioventricular block). Regardless of whether the bradycardia is caused by SND or atrioventricular block, the term "symptomatic bradycardia" is used throughout this document and has been defined as a "documented bradyarrhythmia that is directly responsible for development of the clinical manifestations of syncope or presyncope, transient dizziness or lightheadedness, heart failure symptoms, or confusional states resulting from cerebral hypoperfusion attributable to slow heart rate". Direct attribution of bradycardia as the sole source of symptoms is challenging, and nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue can be multifactorial and therefore difficult to correlate with bradycardia particularly in the setting of modest resting sinus bradycardia or with exercise.

Chronic SND management algorithm — Begin by confirming symptoms and ruling out reversible causes. If bradycardia is due to required guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) with no reasonable alternative, proceed to permanent pacing (Class I). If symptoms correlate with bradycardia, permanent pacing (Class I) is pursued. For cases not clearly symptomatic, oral theophylline (Class IIb) may be used, followed by reassessment of whether the response suggests symptomatic sinus node dysfunction and whether the patient is willing to have a permanent pacemaker (PPM). In patients who are asymptomatic or in whom symptoms do not correlate, permanent pacing is designated Class III: Harm.

Shared decision-making process — The bradycardia guideline writing committee endorses shared decision-making as part of the general care for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, and a commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making, and if time permits the patient should be directed to trusted material which supports and itemizes appropriate considerations which should be factored into their decision-making.

Bradycardia — clinical manifestations and definition state that bradycardia can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrioventricular block, with SND electrocardiographic findings including sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm or ventricular escape, intermittent sinus pauses, and blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence). Vagally mediated atrioventricular block during sleep can be recognized by concomitant sinus node slowing (P–P prolongation), and a sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia, usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest but sometimes atrioventricular block.

Clinical manifestation of bradycardia and conduction disorders — clinical manifestations of bradycardia vary widely and "can vary widely from insidious symptoms to episodes of frank syncope", and bradycardia "can be broadly classified into 2 general categories: SND and atrioventricular block". In SND, electrocardiographic findings are varied and diagnosis may be considered in patients "with sinus bradycardia or atrial depolarization from a subsidiary pacemaker other than the sinus node (i.e., ectopic atrial rhythm, junctional rhythm, or ventricular escape), intermittent sinus pauses, or a blunted heart rate response with exercise (chronotropic incompetence)". For atrioventricular block, manifestations depend on "whether the atrioventricular block is fixed or intermittent and the ventricular rate or duration of ventricular asystole associated with atrioventricular block", and symptoms "will vary depending on underlying cause and timing". Vagally mediated atrioventricular block may be asymptomatic "if the periods of atrioventricular block occur at night while sleeping when parasympathetic tone is increased" and "can be recognized by the presence of concomitant sinus node slowing (P-P prolongation)". Conversely, "the sudden increase in parasympathetic tone with vasovagal syncope can cause bradycardia (usually sinus node slowing or sinus arrest, but sometimes with atrioventricular block)".

Vagally mediated atrioventricular block — features and management: Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring may reveal episodes during sleep or associated with syncope, attributable to neural reflexes causing simultaneous bradycardia and hypotension, with typical sinus rate slowing and block that can be high grade or complete. Atrioventricular block from high vagal tone, such as during sleep, is almost always asymptomatic; the level of block is at the atrioventricular node with normal atrioventricular nodal function when tested at electrophysiology study (EPS). If asymptomatic, medical treatment or pacemaker implantation is not warranted; if frequent syncopal episodes occur, treatment may be warranted if bradycardia appears dominant in these episodes.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

Bradycardia guideline top take-home messages — In patients with sleep-related bradycardia, "the presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea", yet "nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing". The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram "markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease", and "echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test". In sinus node dysfunction, "there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended", and "establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important" when deciding on pacing. For atrioventricular block, in acquired second-degree Mobitz type II, high‑grade, or third‑degree block not due to reversible or physiologic causes, "permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms", whereas for other AV block types, pacing "should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block". In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction "between 36% to 50%" with AV block who are expected to require ventricular pacing " > 40% of the time", techniques providing more physiologic activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy, His bundle pacing) "are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent heart failure". After transcatheter aortic valve replacement, conduction abnormalities are common and "recommendations on postoperative surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline". For pacemaker implantation, "shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized", and decisions are based on "the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences". Using shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients or legally defined surrogates "has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent", which "should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide". Identification of patients who will benefit most from emerging pacing technologies (eg, His bundle pacing, transcatheter leadless pacing systems) "will require further investigation".

Electrophysiology study (EPS) role and diagnostic yield in suspected bradycardia — An EPS is an invasive, catheter-based procedure that can be used to test the integrity of cardiac conduction system and to assess potential inducibility of various cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and EPS are well tolerated with the risk of serious procedural complications such as cardiac tamponade and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia minimal; an EPS is generally not performed as the first-line diagnostic assessment in patients with suspected bradycardia, and the use of an EPS has almost exclusively been examined in patients with syncope or presyncope and is generally an adjunctive tool in the evaluation of patients in whom bradycardia is suspected but has not been documented after noninvasive evaluation. In most cases, the cause of symptomatic bradycardia can be established without invasive evaluation, the diagnostic yield of EPS in symptomatic patients with suspected bradycardia has been shown to vary widely (range, 12%–80%), and in 1 study of patients presenting with unexplained syncope those who had history of heart disease had a higher incidence of an abnormal EPS compared with patients who had a structurally normal heart; in addition, the likelihood of an abnormal EPS was greater in patients who had an abnormal ECG at baseline, and EPS may also be performed when the patient is undergoing an invasive procedure such as an endomyocardial biopsy.

### Dengue and relative bradycardia [^1f3510f1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To the Editor: We have found that relative bradycardia is a notable clinical feature of dengue fever in Singapore. To our knowledge, this sign has not been previously associated with dengue. Awareness of this possible clinical finding could help in the early recognition of dengue and potentially reduce illness and death associated with dengue virus infection. Clinical features that can be used in the initial assessment of febrile patients are essential tools for clinicians, especially in limited resource settings.

Dengue fever is a potentially fatal illness; > 2.5 billion persons are at risk and the disease is endemic in almost 100 countries. Singapore recorded > 14,000 cases in 2005, its highest annual figure. No specific clinical features distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses; thus, diagnosis relies heavily on results of laboratory investigations. Virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies only become detectable after 5–7 days, and false-positive results can confound the diagnosis. PCR is a useful diagnostic tool; however, it is limited by the short duration of viremia and requirements for sophisticated laboratory support.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) procedural role and typical use in suspected bradycardia: EPS are well tolerated and the risk of serious procedural complications such as cardiac tamponade and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia is minimal. An EPS is generally not performed as the first-line diagnostic assessment in patients with suspected bradycardia, and most patients who undergo an EPS have already undergone a series of noninvasive cardiac evaluations, such as ECG, tilt table testing, echocardiogram, and/or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, which may have been inconclusive. EPS have been performed almost exclusively in patients with unexplained syncope or presyncope, and in most cases the cause of symptomatic bradycardia can be established without invasive evaluation. The use of an EPS has almost exclusively been examined in patients with syncope or presyncope, and is generally an adjunctive tool in patients in whom bradycardia is suspected but has not been documented after noninvasive evaluation; EPS may be a reasonable approach in syncope associated with trauma with high pretest probability for significant conduction disease (eg, LBBB), and may also be performed when the patient is undergoing an invasive procedure such as an endomyocardial biopsy.

Cardiac rhythm monitors — external loop recorder (patient or auto triggered) is a device that continuously records and stores rhythm data over weeks to months; it can be patient activated or auto triggered (e.g., to record asymptomatic arrhythmias) to provide a recording of events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) the triggered event, with newer models transmitting triggered data automatically over a wireless network; it is used for frequent, spontaneous symptoms potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder, likely to recur within 2–6 wk, and has higher yield in patients who are able to record a diary to correlate with possible arrhythmia.

Epilepsy and symptomatic bradycardia — In patients with epilepsy associated with severe symptomatic bradycardia (ictal bradycardia) where antiepileptic medications are ineffective, permanent pacing is reasonable for reducing the severity of symptoms. In approximately 0.15% to 0.3% of patients with seizures, profound bradycardia can be observed and is often referred to as ictal bradycardia; bradycardia can be attributable to either sinus node arrest or complete heart block and is most commonly associated with temporal lobe source of seizures. Rate support in patients with profound bradycardia during seizures could theoretically attenuate the severity of associated syncope.

### Synergistic bradycardia from beta blockers, hyperkalemia, and renal failure [^1e525d93]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bradycardia is a common vital sign encountered in the emergency department. These patients are often hemodynamically stable and require no emergent intervention. On occasion, bradycardia can cause hemodynamic instability, and there are established treatment pathways involving atropine, ionotropic and vasopressive infusions, and eventual mechanical pacing, if necessary. However, these pathways fail to account for the many and varied causes of bradycardia and their treatment.

Case Report

A 24-year-old man presented to our emergency department with syncope caused by symptomatic bradycardia. This was caused by a largely unrecognized synergistic bradycardia resulting from renal failure, AV nodal blocker use, and hyperkalemia. Our patient's worsening renal failure caused accumulation of both potassium and beta blocker, which resulted in bradycardia and hypotension, in turn worsening renal failure secondary to poor renal perfusion and potentiating his hyperkalemia and beta blocker toxicity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? There is a growing number of cases that suggest this is an underrecognized synergistic and potentially lethal mechanism of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia and the treatment falls outside of typical algorithms for handling bradycardia. Understanding the multiple causes of these patients' hemodynamically unstable bradycardia allows for maximal medical management and can prevent unnecessary invasive management for these patients.

Vagally mediated atrioventricular block — features and management explain that it may be an incidental finding that occurred while the patient was sleeping or in other cases be associated with syncope and is felt to be attributable to neural reflexes, which result in simultaneous bradycardia and hypotension, with typically sinus rate slowing in conjunction with the onset of atrioventricular block and the atrioventricular block can be high grade or complete; atrioventricular block attributable to high vagal tone, such as during sleep, is almost always asymptomatic, the level of the block is at the atrioventricular node with normal atrioventricular nodal function when tested at EPS, and if asymptomatic, medical treatment or pacemaker implantation is not warranted; if the patient is having frequent syncopal episodes, treatment may be warranted if bradycardia appears to be the dominant factor, and although PPM implantation is a relatively low-risk cardiac procedure, procedural complications and death directly related to implant can occur, and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

### Significance of alectinib-induced bradycardia: rhythm and reversibility matter more than rate [^bbc95da3]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, it may be most practical to regularly assess patients on alectinib for symptoms of symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (eg, light-headedness, dizziness, exercise intolerance, presyncope, and syncope) rather than meticulously follow heart rates. Pruis et alobserved that bradycardia, including asymptomatic bradycardia, was the most common reason for dose reduction of alectinib. However, whether dose reductions for asymptomatic bradycardia are warranted is debatable. Equally, when interventions such as pacemaker insertion are considered, the reversibility of a potential drug-induced bradycardia with dose modification also has to be considered. Although central nervous system coverage could be lessened at lower doses of alectinib, systemic efficacy of the drug is likely to be well maintained across several alectinib dose reductions. Other potential interventions to consider would also include drug substitution (given all of the licensed ALK TKI options). Evidence of reversibility of bradycardia on dose reduction or drug replacement was not documented in this trial, but in clinical experience (D.R.C.) reversibility of drug effects with dose modification or drug discontinuation is the norm. In many ways, a dialogue between the patient, oncologist, and cardio-oncologist may be the approach that is most in order in the setting of drug-induced bradycardia to manage fears and expectations and to discuss intervention vs explanation and observation as the best approach for any given patient moving forward.

### A novel study on SARS-COV-2 virus associated bradycardia as a predictor of mortality-retrospective multicenter analysis [^a5e4e08a]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The clinical implications of this novel descriptive study include the following:

(1) This is the first large scale study to report an absolute bradycardia response in COVID‐19 patients.

(2) Within the bounds of our study, no obvious cause for bradycardia was identified in these patients suggesting a primary toxic effect of COVID‐19 infection on heart rate.

(3) Absolute bradycardia events during hospital admission were associated with an odds ratio of 6.59 for mortality as compared with patients who had a normal heart rate response, therefore we recommend early triage and appropriate level of care in this high‐risk group.

5.1 Clinical perspective

This retrospective cohort study reports that a quarter of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients had an absolute bradycardia event. Cases with a bradycardia event are particularly associated with higher odds of mortality compared to those with normal heart rates. There was no obvious cause of bradycardia identified in these patients, suggesting a primary toxic effect of COVID‐19 infection on heart rate. Therefore, it is imperative to identify and triage these patients earlier as they are a high‐risk group for potentially adverse outcomes. In the future, elevation of inflammatory marker in correlation with onset of bradycardia can be elucidated in detail. The impact of COVID‐19 medications, such as Remdesivir and Dexamethasone, can also be investigated further to help determine the effect on bradycardia.

ACC/AHA/HRS device-based therapy — pediatric bradycardia and pacemaker indications state that children and adolescents are defined as less than 19 years of age and that the clinical significance of bradycardia is age dependent; a heart rate of 45 bpm may be a normal finding in an adolescent, whereas the same rate in a newborn or infant indicates profound bradycardia. In young patients with sinus bradycardia, the primary criterion for pacemaker implantation is the concurrent observation of a symptom with bradycardia, including heart rate less than 40 bpm or asystole more than 3 seconds; in general, correlation of symptoms with bradycardia is determined by ambulatory ECG or an implantable loop recorder. Symptomatic bradycardia is an indication for pacemaker implantation provided that other causes have been excluded, whereas SND (sick sinus syndrome) is not itself an indication for pacemaker implantation, and because there are no randomized clinical trials in pediatric or congenital heart disease patients, the level of evidence for most recommendations is consensus based (Level of Evidence: C).

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia definitions — sinus node dysfunction: Sinus bradycardia is defined as a sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization from an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence of blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue. A sinus pause is sinus node depolarizations ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, and sinus node arrest is no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with demand and in many studies translates to failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation is atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization from an atrioventricular nodal, His, bundle, or ventricular site.

Cardiac rhythm monitors (Table 6) — Holter monitoring provides continuous recording for 24–72 h; up to 2 wk with newer models and is selected when symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within a fairly short period (24–72 h) of monitoring. External loop recorders continuously record over weeks to months and can be patient activated or auto triggered to provide a recording of events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) the triggered event, typically for frequent, spontaneous symptoms potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder, likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders have various models that record from 2–14 d and can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data (up to 30 d) to a central monitoring station attended by trained technicians 24 h/d and is suited to spontaneous symptoms that are too brief, too subtle, or too infrequent to be readily documented with patient activated monitors, including high-risk patients whose rhythm requires real-time monitoring. Implantable cardiac monitors are subcutaneously implanted with a battery life of 2–3 y and are used for recurrent, infrequent, unexplained symptoms, potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease.

Bradyarrhythmias including sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block are frequently encountered in endurance athletes especially at night. While these are well tolerated by the young athlete, there is evidence that generally from the fifth decade of life onward, such arrhythmias can degenerate into pathological symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacemaker therapy. For many years, athletic bradycardia and AV block have been attributed to high vagal tone, but work from our group has questioned this widely held assumption and demonstrated a role for intrinsic electrophysiological remodeling of the sinus node and the AV node. In this article, we argue that bradyarrhythmias in the veteran athlete arise from the cumulative effects of exercise training, the circadian rhythm and aging on the electrical activity of the nodes. We consider contemporary strategies for the treatment of symptomatic bradyarrhythmias in athletes and highlight potential therapies resulting from our evolving mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon.

Pacemaker deactivation — patients with decision-making capacity, or their legally defined surrogate, have the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemakers regardless of whether treatment prolongs life and even if withdrawal would result in death, and withdrawal of a life sustaining medical intervention with informed consent should not be considered physician-assisted suicide and should be considered to be an integral aspect of patient-centered care; these decisions should be undertaken by patients or legally defined surrogate and physicians together using the principles of shared decision-making, and physicians should clarify for patients or their legally defined surrogates and their families the expected consequences of pacemaker deactivation; because pacemaker pulses are painless, in most cases pacemaker deactivation is unnecessary and reassurance of patients and family in addition to turning off cardiac monitoring may be all that is needed, but if a pacemaker is deactivated, death may follow immediately if the patient is completely pacemaker dependent whereas in those who are not pacemaker dependent the process of death may be unpredictable, so patients must be monitored closely for potential symptoms such as respiratory distress which may require intensification of comfort care measures; pacemaker deactivation requires a written order from the responsible physician accompanied by a do-not-resuscitate order, with documentation confirming the patient or surrogate request, decision-making capacity or appropriate surrogate, consideration of alternative therapies, and discussion of deactivation consequences; palliative care and medical support should be provided, access to clergy (or chaplain) should be offered according to the patient's beliefs, and if a clinician has religious or ethical objections he or she should not be forced to deactivate the device and the patient should be referred to a different physician who is capable and willing; ideally, providers and healthcare systems should have processes in place for device deactivation, conversation related to end-of-life issues ideally should begin either at the time of device implant or early in the terminal illness, and clinicians should encourage patients undergoing device implantation to complete advanced directives and specifically address device management and deactivation if the patient is terminally ill.

Seizure-associated bradycardia and asystole — In approximately 0.15% to 0.3% of patients with seizures, profound bradycardia (ictal asystole) can occur, attributable to sinus node arrest or complete heart block and most commonly linked to a temporal lobe source. Bradycardia is most commonly defined as a pause > 3 seconds with a 2-fold increase in the preceding R-R interval, but reported pauses were commonly > 10 seconds and one study noted syncope only with asystole > 6 seconds. Rate support during seizures could theoretically attenuate syncope, and with limited follow-up, pacing appears to be beneficial for reducing syncope symptoms. Effective seizure treatment with antiepileptic medications or surgery should be considered before implanting a PPM, and rate support with a PPM will not affect any accompanying vasodepressor effect.

### Identification of bradycardia following remdesivir administration through the US food and drug administration American college of medical toxicology COVID-19 toxic pharmacovigilance project [^3b6ffa77]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

For hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving remdesivir, is there an association between dose and time to bradycardia in those experiencing bradycardic events?

Findings

In this cohort study, among 188 patients receiving remdesivir who had bradycardia, the most substantial decrease in heart rate occurred within 24 hours of the loading dose. The median time to minimum heart rate was 60.7 hours after remdesivir administration.

Meaning

In this study, bradycardia in patients receiving remdesivir was seen during the infusion and after 1 or more doses; however, these findings are limited because a large proportion of patients had cardiac risk factors and/or severe COVID-19.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for sick sinus syndrome, more specifically with respect to electrophysiology study, ACC/AHA/HRS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining an electrophysiology study in selected patients with symptoms suspected to be attributable to bradycardia for diagnosis and elucidation of the bradycardia mechanism, if the initial noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic.
