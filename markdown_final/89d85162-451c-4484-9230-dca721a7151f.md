## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about furunculosis, including pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, differential, and management, with explicit self-verification and citations throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining furunculosis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk factors, especially CA-MRSA and PVL. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach, including when to culture. After that, I need to construct a differential diagnosis and distinguish mimics. Finally, I will outline evidence-based management, including incision and drainage, antibiotic indications, MRSA coverage, and recurrence prevention, and I will close with special considerations and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Furunculosis is a deep infection of the hair follicle extending into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with abscess formation and inflammatory nodules; CA-MRSA has become a major driver in many regions, and PVL toxin is strongly associated with recurrent disease, which helps explain the aggressive follicular necrosis and recurrence patterns seen clinically [^113rxiey] [^1148vfGg] [^1168vKXV].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and risk factors before drawing conclusions. CA-MRSA has fueled outbreaks and increased prevalence of furunculosis in the U.S., with PVL-positive strains disproportionately represented among furuncle isolates; nasal carriage of S. aureus is a key risk factor for recurrence, reported around 60% in some cohorts, and impaired neutrophil chemotaxis has been identified as an independent risk factor in outbreak settings, underscoring host susceptibility alongside microbial virulence [^1148vfGg] [^115WKq9J] [^11353apZ] [^111MhcVm].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation and diagnostic approach. Typical lesions are tender, erythematous, fluctuant nodules centered on hair follicles, often with a central pustule; in the external auditory canal, furunculosis presents as localized otitis externa with severe otalgia and focal swelling, and I should remember that otalgia without canal swelling suggests referred pain rather than primary otologic disease; for recurrent or atypical cases, obtaining pus for culture and susceptibility testing is reasonable, though routine culture is not mandatory for every uncomplicated furuncle [^112dPPGu] [^111eVYNk] [^111zKqSD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis without considering mimics. I need to check the differential: hidradenitis suppurativa presents with chronic, recurrent, deep-seated nodules and sinus tracts in intertriginous areas and lacks a central punctum; nodulocystic acne has a different distribution and course; inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts often have a history of a preexisting noninflamed cyst and a visible punctum; distinguishing these entities prevents mislabeling chronic inflammatory disease as recurrent infection and guides appropriate therapy [^112K54pg] [^116j1SFu].

> Next, I should review management principles and ensure I align with guidelines. Incision and drainage is the cornerstone for furuncles and carbuncles; systemic antibiotics are generally unnecessary unless there is systemic involvement, rapid progression, immunocompromise, or failure of local therapy; when antibiotics are indicated, empiric therapy should cover MRSA in areas with high prevalence or when risk factors are present, with TMP-SMX or doxycycline as common oral options, reserving vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, or ceftaroline for severe infection or systemic inflammatory response [^115aUj6s] [^111eVYNk] [^1149pVqY] [^1111JWUp].

> Let me think about recurrence prevention and decolonization strategies. For patients with recurrent furunculosis, I should confirm nasal carriage and consider decolonization regimens such as intranasal mupirocin with or without chlorhexidine body washes, coupled with strict hygiene measures and fomite control; although high-quality randomized data are limited, these interventions are widely used and supported by outbreak-control experience and expert guidance, and I need to ensure I tailor to local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^113rxiey] [^112kEBGe].

> But wait, what if the patient has frequent recurrences despite appropriate care? I should double-check for host factors like neutrophil dysfunction, diabetes, or immunosuppression, and consider whether PVL-positive strains are implicated, as these can drive more aggressive and recurrent disease; in such cases, prolonged or repeated decolonization courses and consideration of suppressive strategies may be reasonable, recognizing the evidence base is largely observational and expert-opinion driven [^111MhcVm] [^1168vKXV].

> I need to ensure I address special anatomic sites. In the external auditory canal, furunculosis can cause severe pain and even referred symptoms; conservative measures such as local heat may help, but if fluctuant, incision and drainage is appropriate, and systemic antibiotics with MRSA coverage are indicated when there is surrounding cellulitis, immunocompromise, or systemic features, with close follow-up given the narrow canal anatomy and risk of complications [^112dPPGu].

> Let me reconsider the role of PVL testing. While not routinely required, in recurrent or outbreak settings, identifying PVL-positive S. aureus can support the diagnosis and reinforce the rationale for decolonization and MRSA-active therapy; I should confirm that local microbiology resources can provide this testing when clinically indicated, especially for epidemiologic investigations or refractory cases [^1168vKXV].

> In summary, I should confirm that furunculosis is a deep follicular infection in which incision and drainage is primary, antibiotics are adjunctive and reserved for specific indications, CA-MRSA and PVL shape epidemiology and recurrence, and prevention hinges on decolonization and hygiene; maintaining vigilance for mimics like hidradenitis suppurativa ensures accurate diagnosis and avoids mismanagement, and I will continue to verify evolving local resistance patterns to guide empiric therapy choices [^115aUj6s] [^1148vfGg] [^112K54pg].

Furunculosis is a **deep follicular infection** caused predominantly by Staphylococcus aureus [^115aUj6s], with MRSA increasing in prevalence [^112KKe2m] and PVL toxins driving severity and recurrence [^1168vKXV]. It presents as a **painful, fluctuant nodule** with a central pustule and often recurs due to nasal carriage, skin trauma, or immunosuppression [^1148vfGg]. Management centers on **incision and drainage** [^111eVYNk]; antibiotics are added for systemic signs, immunocompromise, or MRSA risk [^1149pVqY]. Recurrent cases need nasal decolonization, hygiene measures, and evaluation for underlying host factors [^113rxiey].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

- **Primary pathogen**: Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA, is the predominant cause [^1148vfGg].
- **Virulence factors**: PVL toxins are strongly associated with severe, recurrent furunculosis [^1168vKXV].
- **Risk factors**: Nasal carriage, skin trauma, poor hygiene, diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression increase risk [^1148vfGg].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Lesion characteristics**: Painful, erythematous, fluctuant nodules with central pustules, often in areas of friction or shaving [^112K54pg].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever and malaise may occur in severe or multiple lesions [^115aUj6s].
- **Recurrence**: Common due to persistent nasal carriage or inadequate treatment [^1148vfGg].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **clinical** [^notfound]; obtain cultures for recurrent, severe, or atypical cases to identify MRSA or unusual pathogens [^111zKqSD]. Imaging is rarely needed unless deep or extensive infection is suspected.

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Carbuncles**: Deeper, multiloculated infections [^notfound].
- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**: Chronic, recurrent lesions in intertriginous areas [^116j1SFu].
- **Epidermal inclusion cysts**: Noninfectious unless inflamed [^notfound].
- **Acne vulgaris**: Typically nonfluctuant and nonpurulent [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute management

Incision and drainage is the **cornerstone of therapy** [^111eVYNk]. Antibiotics are indicated for systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, or MRSA risk; options include TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or vancomycin [^1149pVqY].

---

### Preventive measures

- **Hygiene**: Regular handwashing, antiseptic soaps, and avoiding shared personal items [^113rxiey].
- **Nasal decolonization**: Mupirocin nasal ointment and chlorhexidine body washes for recurrent cases [^notfound].
- **Addressing underlying factors**: Glycemic control, weight management, and immunologic evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Complications include **abscess formation**, **cellulitis**, and **bacteremia** [^notfound]. Chronic or recurrent disease can cause scarring and disfigurement, and MRSA carriage increases the risk of invasive infections [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate treatment [^117XRnu9]. Recurrence is common without preventive measures, and MRSA-associated disease may require prolonged or repeated therapy [^notfound].

---

Furunculosis is a **manageable deep follicular infection**; **incision and drainage** is primary, with antibiotics for select cases and recurrence prevention via decolonization and risk-factor control [^111eVYNk].

### Innovative management of recurrent furunculosis [^113rxiey]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

One of the most common bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissue is furunculosis (boil), an inflammatory nodule that involves the hair follicle, with small abscess formation extending through the dermis into the subcutaneous layers. Treatment of recurrent furunculosis is a difficult and challenging process. The mainstay of therapy is incision and drainage of a furuncle coupled with bacterial culture. Affected patients and their family members must practice good hygiene, predicated with regular hand washing, fomite cleaning, and avoiding contact with contaminated skin.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112dPPGu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Other causes of otalgia or otorrhea that may mimic acute otitis externa — differential and evaluation: Furunculosis is the presence of an infected hair follicle on the outer third of the ear canal, sometimes referred to as localized otitis externa; clinical findings include acute otalgia, otorrhea, localized tenderness, focal swelling, and pustular lesions, and treatment may include local heat, incision and drainage, or systemic antibiotics that cover S aureus. Complaints of otalgia in the absence of swelling of the ear canal and without apparent middle ear disease should arouse suspicion of pathology outside the ear, and perhaps the most common cause of referred otalgia is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. A complete head and neck examination with visualization of the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck, assessment of any neck masses, and palpation of the tongue base is recommended. Other potential etiologies include dental pathologies, tonsillitis, peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscesses, carotidynia, styloid process elongation, angina, intrathoracic aneurysms, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and geniculate neuralgia. Although otorrhea may accompany AOE, other causes should be considered; cholesteatoma may be mistaken for AOE or chronic external otitis but is typically painless.

### Recurrent furunculosis: a review of the literature [^1148vfGg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in incidence and manifests as skin and soft tissue infections including furuncles. The majority of studies have focused on the epidemiology of single furuncles and not recurrent disease. There is a lack of data concerning the incidence of furunculosis outside the U.S. A.

Objectives

This report reviews the literature of recurrent furunculosis and the impact of CA-MRSA on the disease.

Methods

Article citations were searched within PubMed. Search terms used were 'furunculosis', 'recurrent furunculosis', 'skin abscess' and 'recurrent boils'. Articles were discarded if they did not refer to furunculosis secondary to S. aureus.

Results

A total of 1515 articles were initially retrieved with the term 'furunculosis', 77 with the term 'recurrent furunculosis', 2778 with the term 'skin abscess', and 1526 with the term 'recurrent boils'. After excluding articles not referring to S. aureus furunculosis, 86 articles were included for this review.

Conclusions

Furunculosis is increasing within the U.S. A. secondary to the CA-MRSA epidemic and the resistant organism's close association with the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) virulence factor. PVL is associated with follicular infections in general, having its strongest association with furunculosis and its recurrence. The majority of furuncles in the U.S. A. are caused by CA-MRSA, while elsewhere in the world they are caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is the primary risk factor for recurrent furunculosis and occurs in 60% of individuals.

### Therapies and vaccines for emerging bacterial infections: learning from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^112KKe2m]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an emerging bacterial infection worldwide, and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infection, which has increased dramatically in frequency in many areas, is of particular clinical and public health concern. CA-MRSA outbreaks and severe infections have been reported more frequently in children, often manifesting in one of two distinct clinical syndromes, furunculosis or necrotizing pneumonia. This article outlines the molecular biology of MRSA, how molecular biology has contributed to the understanding of MRSA infections, current therapy and prevention of MRSA, and the prospects for a vaccine against S aureus.

Differential Diagnosis for Hidradenitis Suppurativa

Hidradenitis suppurativa is hypothesized to be an inflammatory, not infectious, disease of the hair follicle. Follicular hyperkeratosis, with subsequent rupture of the hair follicle and spillage of contents into the dermis, provokes intense inflammation associated with upregulation of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Though dysbiosis and colonization with biofilm-forming bacteria occurs, its role in disease pathogenesis is unclear.

### Management of common bacterial infections of the skin [^112kEBGe]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bacterial skin infections commonly encountered in the community include impetigo, folliculitis/furunculosis, simple abscesses, erysipelas and other nonnecrotizing cellulitis. The review focuses on recent epidemiological, bacteriological and therapeutic advances.

Recent Findings

Impetigo and erysipelas occur in about 20 and 1 person/1000/year, respectively. Main risk factors for erysipelas are toe-web intertrigo and lymphedema. The true incidence of furunculosis is unknown, whereas outbreaks in small communities are reported worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen for impetigo and furunculosis, and methicillin-resistant strains play a growing role in both diseases. Erysipelas are mainly caused by streptococci, whereas local complications (i.e. abscesses or blisters) may be due to staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains in involved geographic areas. Recent trends for treating impetigo and furunculosis predate community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. For outbreaks of furunculosis, stringent decolonization measures are showing promise, whereas there is no validated therapeutic regimen for chronic furunculosis. Current trends for erysipelas involve ambulatory treatments and reduced duration of antibiotics.

Summary

Despite better epidemiological or bacteriological knowledge of common bacterial skin infections, the exact role of methicillin-resistant staphylococci needs regular surveys in involved geographic areas. Antibiotic treatment must be active on staphylococci and, to a lesser degree, on streptococci.

### Impaired neutrophil functions in the pathogenesis of an outbreak of recurrent furunculosis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among mentally retarded adults [^111MhcVm]. Microbes and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of skin infections. We recently described an outbreak of recurrent furunculosis involving methicillin-resistant S. aureus among mentally retarded adults. We sought to determine the role of impaired neutrophil functions in its pathogenesis. Blood neutrophil functions were determined during both the outbreak (1997) and a disease-free period (2000). Chemotaxis was measured by migration toward formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), specifically and randomly; phagocytosis of opsonized zymosan (OZ) was assessed by microscopy; superoxide production was determined by cytochrome c reduction in unstimulated neutrophils and after stimulation with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate, 1 mg/ml OZ or 5 x 10(-7)M FMLP. Functions were compared between recurrent furunculosis (n = 10) and non-recurrent furunculosis patients (n = 13). During 2000, functions were normal among the 23 subjects, except for specific/nonspecific chemotaxis (mean 68% ± 26 and 69% ± 28). During infection, recurrent furunculosis patients had a significantly increased basal superoxide production as compared to disease-free period (10.5 ± 4.7 vs. 4.9 ± 1.9 nmol O(-)(2)/10(6) cells/min, p = 0.003). During the disease-free period, recurrent furunculosis patients had lower basal superoxide production (4.9 ± 1.9 vs. 7.7 ± 3.5, p = 0.067) and impaired specific chemotaxis (57% ± 28 vs. 76% ± 21, p < 0.05) as compared to non-recurrent furunculosis patients. Only specific chemotaxis was an independent risk factor for recurrent furunculosis. Mentally retarded adults have impaired chemotaxis, with recurrent furunculosis cases having an even greater impairment. Abnormal specific chemotaxis is an independent risk factor for recurrent furunculosis. Impaired neutrophil functions thus have a role in the pathogenesis of outbreaks of recurrent furunculosis.

### Eruptive furunculosis following the soak and smear regimen [^1174A3dY]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The 'soak and smear' regimen is a highly effective method for localised topical therapy employed by dermatologists for widespread inflammatory skin conditions. The regimen involves application of topical medication under occlusion after soaking in water. Complications from this treatment method are rare. We present a case of multiple, generalised methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-positive furuncles arising in a patient as an unexpected consequence of therapy. The case highlights an unanticipated risk of a commonly employed treatment amid an epidemic of MRSA in the community.

### Pathophysiology of generalized pustular psoriasis [^112Gq5UJ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

GPP places a considerable burden on patients, and while efforts have been made to better understand the disease and its management, progress is slowed by the small number of cases. As a result, there are many important knowledge gaps and unmet treatment needs. Identification of the key role of the IL-36 pathway in the immunopathology of GPP has paved the way for new therapies targeting disease-associated genetic and molecular pathways, and these agents have shown promise in patients presenting with GPP flares. Further elucidation of the unique pathogenesis of GPP may identify additional genetic variants that could provide effective therapeutic targets. Accurate knowledge of the pathophysiology of GPP and its genetic determinants will help physicians to personalize treatment and more effectively manage patients with this rare disease.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^117XRnu9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Primary skin infections (ie, pyodermas) typically are initiated by some breach in the epidermis, resulting in infection by organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, that normally colonize the skin. Host-associated factors, such as immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or decreased lymphatic drainage, may predispose to skin infection. The clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often characteristic and are defined most simplistically by anatomic distribution. Although often mild and self-limited, skin infections can be more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle. This article discusses skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo, hair follicle-associated infections (ie, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles) erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, septic bursitis, and tenosynovitis.

### Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis: clinical features, pathophysiology, and therapy [^117QgCFv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis (ALEP) is a rare disease characterized by the acute onset of multiple localized non-follicular, pinhead-sized pustules. ALEP is considered a localized form of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis but its pathogeny is not well identified. We performed a systematic review of the literature of all publications regarding ALEP cases using the term "acute localized exanthematous pustulosis", to provide an update on this disease and its management. Results and conclusion ALEP is an uncommon skin condition attributed primarily to a hypersensitivity reaction to a systemic drug (classical or herbal); though a contact mechanism has been reported. It may be misdiagnosed as infectious or inflammatory disease but the clinico-pathological correlation in addition to the rapid response to withdrawal of the culprit agent supports this diagnosis. The pathogenesis of ALEP is still unclear, and there are no standardized treatment guidelines to manage this disease. Both AGEP and ALEP have a good prognosis if an early diagnosis is made.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^113xWzMa]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Initial evaluation of pilonidal disease — history and examination: "A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and presence of secondary infection. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C". The guideline notes that "The diagnosis of pilonidal disease is most often a clinical one", urges distinction from "alternative diagnoses, such as hidradenitis suppurativa, infected skin furuncles, Crohn's disease, perianal fistula, and infectious processes, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and actinomycosis", and states that on exam patients "will almost always have characteristic midline pits in the gluteal cleft". Acute presentations may include "cellulitis or a painful, fluctuant mass indicating the presence of an abscess", whereas chronic disease is "most often associated with chronic draining sinus disease in the intergluteal fold". It adds, "Special attention should be directed toward identification of concomitant cellulitis or an acute abscess to direct additional therapy".

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115sNUpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America skin and soft tissue infection guideline — scope and methods are described as a panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines, with recommendations developed to be concordant with recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); the focus is diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, the guideline addresses SSTIs in immunocompromised hosts and emphasizes promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments; Figure 1 was developed to simplify management of localized purulent staphylococcal infections such as skin abscesses, furuncles, and carbuncles, Figure 2 is provided to simplify the approach to surgical site infections, and the panel used systematic weighting of strength of recommendation and quality of evidence using the GRADE system.

### Pathophysiology of hidradenitis suppurativa: an update [^116CPtji]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) or acne inversa is not completely understood. Recent research has led to greater insight into the mechanisms involved in the disease. The primary defect in HS pathophysiology rests with the hair follicle. Follicular occlusion, followed by follicular rupture, and a foreign body-type immune response are necessary conditions for the development of clinical HS. A specific genetic signature and environmental factors, such as cigarette smoking, microbial colonization, and adiposity, all contribute to the HS phenotype. Translational research focused on the inflammatory mechanisms involved in HS is needed to develop novel therapeutic options for this debilitating disease.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111eVYNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### Community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: an emerging threat [^115WKq9J]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming an important public-health problem. New strains of S aureus displaying unique combinations of virulence factors and resistance traits have been associated with high morbidity and mortality in the community. Outbreaks of epidemic furunculosis and cases of severe invasive pulmonary infections in young, otherwise healthy people have been particularly noteworthy. We review the characteristics of these new strains of community-acquired MRSA that have contributed to their pathogenicity and discuss new approaches to the diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed community-acquired MRSA infections.

Sayed. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Management Update. Obstet Gynecol 2021.

Diagnosis is based on the clinical criteria of 1) typical inflammatory lesions: abscesses, nodules, and tunnels (openings at the skin surface, sometimes draining malodorous fluid), 2) in intertriginous locations (eg, axilla, inframammary areas, crural folds), with 3) history of recurrence. Disease progression can be staged using the Hurley classification system: stage I connotes the absence of tunnels or scarring, stage II connotes the presence of tunnels or scarring interspersed among areas of normal skin, stage III connotes diffuse tunnels or scarring replacing all, or nearly all, normal skin in an entire anatomic region. Female and male patients with hidradenitis suppurativa have a similar likelihood of axillary involvement, with females more commonly having disease activity in mammary, intermammary, and inguinofemoral regions, and males more commonly having sequelae in perianal, perineal, and buttock regions; it is unknown whether the frequency of misdiagnosis differs for men and women. Principal diseases in the differential diagnosis include inflamed epidermal inclusion cyst (or epidermoid cyst), nodulocystic acne, and furuncle (or carbuncle) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Furuncles and inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts typically have a punctum, are not predominantly localized in intertriginous areas, and with inflamed cysts there is typically a chronic history of a noninflamed cyst present before onset of inflammation. Nodulocystic acne typically is localized to the face and torso, and acne lesions do not typically form tunnels.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1116bQXs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How should SSTIs be classified?

The term "skin and soft-tissue infections" describes a wide heterogeneity of clinical conditions. We recommend that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

SSTIs encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision for drainage of abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

### Familial furunculosis associated with community-acquired leukocidin-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ST152 [^113W4Chs]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is associated with staphylococcal skin and pulmonary infections. Community dissemination of PVL-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains constitutes a public health concern. Family transmission and spread of community-acquired leukocidin-positive methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ST152 isolates associated with severe clinical symptoms are herein described.

### Association of recurrent furunculosis with panton-valentine leukocidin and the genetic background of Staphylococcus aureus [^1168vKXV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infections, such as furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses, but it also frequently colonizes the human skin and mucosa without causing clinical symptoms. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin that has been associated with soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. We have compared the genotypes, virulence gene repertoires, and phage patterns of 74 furunculosis isolates with those of 108 control strains from healthy nasal carriers. The large majority of furunculosis strains were methicillin sensitive. Clonal cluster (CC) 121 (CC121) and CC22 accounted for 70% of the furunculosis strains but for only 8% of the nasal isolates. The PVL-encoding genes luk-PV were detected in 85% of furunculosis strains, while their prevalence among colonizing S. aureus strains was below 1%. luk-PV genes were distributed over several lineages (CCs 5, 8, 22, 30, and 121 and sequence type 59). Even within the same lineages, luk-PV-positive phages characterized furunculosis strains, while their luk-PV-negative variants were frequent among nasal strains. The very tight epidemiological linkage between luk-PV and furunculosis, which could be separated from the genetic background of the S. aureus strain as well as from the gene makeup of the luk-PV-transducing phage, lends support to the notion of an important role for PVL in human furunculosis. These results make a case for the determination of luk-PV in recurrent soft tissue infections with methicillin-sensitive as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

TABLE 3
Patient‐reported diagnostic journey.

The top reported initial symptom of particular worry in both groups was having bumps or boils that did not heal (62.8% of PREG, 65.0% of White patients, P = 0.704). PREG more frequently reported being worried about repeated outbreaks of bumps or boils (62.8% compared to 41.8% of White patients, P < 0.001), spreading of bumps or boils (52.6% compared to 27.0%, P < 0.001), and bumps or boils starting to smell (35.9% compared to 23.1%, P = 0.023).

Following first consultation with a physician, PREG took significantly longer to receive an HS diagnosis (2.7 ± 5.3 years), compared to White patients (1.5 ± 4.1 years, P = 0.029). Misdiagnoses occurred in 46.2% of cases, with no significant effect of ethnicity. Overall, the most commonly reported misdiagnoses were boils (45.2%), acne (33.3%), and furunculosis (22.8%). However, misdiagnosis with boils was significantly more common in PREG (P < 0.001), whereas furunculosis was more frequently diagnosed incorrectly in White patients (P = 0.008). The majority of patients (59.9%) were referred to a specialist immediately following an HS diagnosis, with no significant difference between ethnicity groups. For those that were not referred to a specialist immediately, the mean length of delay was 1.1 ± 2.7 years, with no significant effect of ethnicity. At the time of the survey, PREG were diagnosed more recently than White patients (2.7 ± 4.7 years ago compared to 3.7 ± 4.5 years, P = 0.002).

### Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus toxins and nasal carriage in furuncles and impetigo [^11353apZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The precise role of Staphylococcus aureus toxins and nasal carriage in common skin infections remains unclear.

Objectives

To seek correlations between toxin expression, S. aureus nasal carriage and clinical manifestations in patients with community-acquired furuncles and impetigo.

Methods

From November 2004 to August 2005, we studied clinical data and bacteriological samples prospectively collected from 121 patients presenting with furuncles or impetigo.

Results

Sixty-four patients (31 with furuncles and 33 with impetigo) had S. aureus-positive skin culture. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were present in 13 of 31 (42%) isolates from furuncles and were associated with epidemic furunculosis. Exfoliative toxin genes were present in 10 of 10 (100%) and 12 of 21 (57%) bullous and nonbullous impetigo isolates, respectively. Nasal carriage of S. aureus was found in 58% of patients overall. It was strongly associated with chronic furunculosis but not with simple furuncles (88% vs. 29%, P < 0.007). Skin and nose isolates from a given patient always had identical characteristics. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for four of 64 (6%) positive skin cultures.

Conclusions

PVL is not involved in all types of furuncles but is associated with epidemic furunculosis. Both bullous and nonbullous forms of impetigo are associated with exfoliative toxins. Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage is associated with the chronicity of furuncles.

### Hidradenitis suppurativa: epidemiology, clinical presentation, and pathogenesis [^111cpepE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an inflammatory disorder that is characterized by chronic deep-seated nodules, abscesses, fistulae, sinus tracts, and scars in the axilla, inguinal area, submammary folds, and perianal area. This disfiguring condition is accompanied by pain, embarrassment, and a significantly decreased quality of life. Although the mechanism of HS has not been entirely elucidated, lesion formation is believed to center around follicular hyperkeratosis within the pilosebaceous-apocrine unit. Recent research has provided new insight into the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of HS, helping close some existing knowledge gaps in the development of this condition. The first article in this continuing medical education series reviews HS epidemiology, clinical presentation, and classification. We also provide an update on the most recent understanding of HS pathogenesis, including the central role of inflammatory cytokines and other contributing factors, such as genetics, hormones, and pathogenic microorganisms.

3.2 Pathophysiology of

HS begins with hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of the infundibular epithelium, accompanied by immune cell infiltration around blood vessels and hair follicles(Figure 2). These alterations in the infundibular epithelium lead to the occlusion of hair follicles, causing the stagnation of follicular content and the proliferation of resident bacteria. The occlusion and subsequent dilation of the hair follicles eventually cause follicular rupture, releasing follicular contents such as keratin and bacteria into the surrounding dermis, triggering a foreign‐body reaction and immune response. This results in a strong chemotactic response of neutrophils and lymphocytes, contributing to the formation of subcutaneous inflammatory nodules.

FIGURE 2
Pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The intertriginous skin areas, which are commonly affected sites of HS, differ from other skin areas due to higher temperature, higher moisture, and increased mechanical stress. Obesity, a worsening factor for HS, enlarges the skinfolds in the body and increases mechanical stress. The mechanical stress may induce cutaneous microinjuries that provoke the release of cellular damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and the entry of microbiome components, pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), into the skin, both favoring local inflammation by activating resident immune cells and inducing the production of cytokines and chemokines, leading to perifollicular and perivascular immune cell infiltration. The perifollicular immune cells induce hyperplasia of the infundibular epithelium of the hair, causing keratin plug and follicular occlusion. Smoking, a well‐known exacerbating factor for HS, may favor infundibular hyperplasia and dysbiosis. Follicular occlusion induces intrafollicular stasis and propagation of resident bacteria, accompanied by dilatation of the hair follicle. Insufficient activity of γ‐secretase may contribute to follicular instability. The intrafollicular content further activates innate immune cells, strengthening the production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α and interleukin (IL)‐1β. These cytokines activate the endothelium of local blood vessels and induce the expression of a broad range of chemokines such as IL‐8, CXCL11, CCL2, and CCL20 in keratinocytes and CXCL1 and CXCL6 in fibroblasts. Additionally, obesity induces subclinical inflammation in the adipose tissue, with secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL‐1β and TNF‐α. These signals boost further infiltration of immune cells into the tissue, including granulocytes, monocytes, T cells, and B cells. T cells involved in HS pathogenesis mainly comprise IL‐17‐producing Th17 cells and IFN‐γ‐producing Th1 cells. IL‐23 and IL‐12, produced by dendritic cells (DCs), support the development of Th17 and Th1 cells, respectively. Further dilatation of the hair follicle results in its rupture, releasing immunostimulatory content into the surrounding dermis, triggering a foreign body reaction and immune responses. This induces a strong chemotactic response from neutrophils and lymphocytes, clinically manifesting as an inflamed nodule or abscess. Extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), repeated rupture of the hair follicle, and migration of follicular stem cells into the dermis result in the formation of pus‐draining sinus tracts. Activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and B‐cell activating factor (BAFF). The latter promotes B‐cell development, and plasma cells produce antibodies reactive to NET‐related antigens.

The pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) remains to be fully elucidated. Seminal clinical and translational investigations from the preceding 10 years have highlighted substantial variability in the contributors to inflammatory pathways involved in HS. These span from hormonal, metabolic, and microbial to genetic factors, each with potential flow on effects on immune cell polarization and subsequent clinically apparent inflammation. Understanding the heterogeneous drivers of HS and its progression may empower clinicians to take a more holistic approach in treatment planning, including addressing inflammatory comorbidities; therapeutic selection based on clinicopathological biomarkers; and appropriate patient counseling.

### Denying the truth does not change the facts: a systematic analysis of pseudoscientific denial of complex regional pain syndrome [^116c5Mbf]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

There is No Clear Pathophysiology

In four papers, critical remarks are made regarding the lack of a definitive pathophysiology of CRPS. Some of these arguments focus on the heterogeneity in signs and symptoms of CRPS. For example, patients may display either a cold or a warm extremity, with skin that may appear either blue or red. These very different signs and symptoms are interpreted as pointing towards very different pathophysiological mechanisms, which in turn lead the critics to believe that there can be no common underlying pathophysiological mechanism of CRPS. Likewise, the variable clinical course of the disease leads to uncertainty about a common underlying pathophysiology. Even though different possible pathophysiological mechanisms are hypothesized in the literature, Chang et al assert that a direct relationship between trauma and prolonged chronic CRPS has not been proven and that there is no biological explanation for the development of CRPS following minor traumas, such as cuts, bumps, contusions and bruises that occur in everyday life. Chang et al further write that studies on CRPS often do not elaborate on details such as the inciting event or the duration of immobility, so the association between these factors and the development of CRPS is unknown. Interestingly, the second author in the manuscript by Chang et al is a corporate defense attorney routinely defending large corporations against claims of injury-related CRPS. Thus, the arguments presented by Chang et al must be considered in light of the potentially biased opinions of this author. Nevertheless, the confusion surrounding the causes and pathophysiology of CRPS must be addressed.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic relapsing disease of follicular occlusion that causes immense clinical and psychosocial morbidity when refractory to treatment. HS is no longer considered a disease of primary infectious etiology, although bacteria play a role. There is increasing evidence that HS is associated with immune dysregulation, based on its clinical association with other immune-mediated disorders, by its response to biologic therapy in the clinical arena, and from molecular research. This article summarizes what is known in relation to the inflammatory pathways in HS.

### Diphtheria [^114CuVkc]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diphtheria:

- **Definition**: Diphtheria is a potentially fatal infection caused by toxin-producing strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and occasionally by toxigenic Corynebacterium ulcerans and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis strains, causing upper respiratory tract or cutaneous disease.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of diphtheria involves the production of an exotoxin by the pathogen, which inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death. This leads to the formation of a pseudomembrane in the throat, a characteristic feature of the disease. However, atypical cases without pseudomembrane formation have been reported.
- **Epidemiology**: There were 16,611 reported cases of diphtheria globally in 2018. The last confirmed case of respiratory diphtheria in the US was in 2003, and there were 4 reported cases of cutaneous diphtheria between 2015 and 2018.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for diphtheria include lack of immunization or partial immunization, as well as living in crowded or unsanitary conditions.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, diphtheria presents as an acute upper respiratory tract infection. Symptoms include sore throat, fever, and difficulty breathing due to airway obstruction caused by the pseudomembrane. Cutaneous presentations include scaly rash and skin ulcers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of diphtheria is generally good with prompt treatment, which includes the administration of diphtheria antitoxin and antimicrobial therapy. However, severe cases can lead to complications such as myocarditis and neuropathy, which are associated with increased fatality risk.

7 DISCUSSION

All of these conditions are categorized as neutrophilic dermatoses. In PG, the role of a critical neutrophil‐activating factor, G‐CSF, and a mutation in its signal mediator JAK2, have been identified as important contributors to the disease, suggesting the role of activated neutrophils in the pathogenesis of PG. Additionally, the identification of NFKB1 mutation in PG may indicate importance of the enhanced NF‐κB pathway and potential inflammasome activation in PG. Pathergy is a phenomenon characteristic in PG but not in HS. This may indicate that factors released from epithelial cells, such as DAMPs, IL‐36, and IL‐8, which can activate both NF‐κB and G‐CSF signals, might be crucial in the pathogenesis of PG. Hair follicles appear to be important sites in the early stage of PG, but the extent of their prominent role in PG pathogenesis requires further investigation.

PAPA [Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and acne]

Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and acne (PAPA) syndrome were first reported in 1997. It is an autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disease due to mutations in proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene and presenting with cutaneous and articular manifestations. Painful, recurrent, sterile monoarticular arthritis with a prominent neutrophilic infiltrate usually occurs in childhood and may be the presenting sign of the disease. Since pyoderma and cystic acne may not appear in the early course of disease, PAPA syndrome is prone to be misdiagnosed as a joint abscess.

PAPA syndrome has been recently included in the group of PAPA spectrum disorders. PAPA is the most common type of PAPA spectrum disorder. PSTPIP1 has a role in innate immunity and several inflammatory pathways. It interacts with pyrin, encoded by the MEFV, which is found in association with the cytoskeleton in monocytic cells and modulates immunoregulatory functions. Pyrin and PSTPIP1 form homotrimers, but in this unbound conformation, the PYD (protein pyrin domain) of pyrin is masked by its B box. The binding of PSTPIP1 to the pyrin's B box unmasks the PYD and this event leads to interaction and dimerization of ASC (Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD). Consequently, the formation of the ASC pyroptosome recruits and activates caspase-1 and IL-1β production. Its complex pathophysiology includes disordered keratinization with abnormal sebaceous stem cell differentiation. It has recently been demonstrated that an autoinflammatory component induced by Propionibacterium acnes via inflammasome activation is also involved, thus linking acne to classic SAIDs. As expected, increased amounts of IL-1β and TNF-α have been detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PAPA patients and augmented levels of IL-18 have been observed in the serum of these patients.

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^115ikRo6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as acne inversa and Verneuil disease, is a chronic disease of the apocrine gland–bearing areas of the skin. The prevalence of HS is estimated to be as high as 1% to 2% in the general population, and the disease has a serious effect on quality of life, placing it among the most distressing conditions observed in dermatology. It is therefore of major public health concern.

HS usually begins after puberty; the clinical severity of the disease varies among patients. Most patients have a mild form of the disease, manifested as painful large and deep-seated nodules. These lesions can resolve spontaneously, persist as "silent" nodules, or lead to abscess formation. In contrast, patients with severe HS have chronic, painful, suppurating lesions that persist for years. Chronic lesions usually involve multiple areas connected by inflamed and suppurating sinus tracts surrounded by hypertrophic scars.

The pathophysiology of HS is mostly unknown and probably multifactorial, including genetic, infectious, hormonal, and immunologic factors. Approximately one third of HS patients have a familial history of HS. Familial HS is transmitted with a dominant autosomal inheritance pattern, and mutations in the gamma secretase genes have been associated with a subset of familial cases. The current hypothesis is that the HS primary event is a hyperkeratinization of the follicular infundibulum, followed by follicular occlusion, dilatation and rupture; the spread of bacterial and cellular remnants would trigger the local inflammatory response. Previous microbiological studies found a wide range of bacteria sporadically associated with HS lesions: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, milleri group streptococci, anaerobes, and corynebacteria. Because of these confusing microbiological observations and the rapid relapse of HS lesions after standard antimicrobial drug treatments, bacteria were considered to be contaminants of primarily inflammatory lesions.

Recently, the rifampin-clindamycin drug combination was reported to substantively improve HS lesions, and our research team showed that complete healing of HS lesions can be obtained by using the rifampin-moxifloxacin-metronidazole drug combination. These findings suggest that suppurative lesions associated with HS may be of infectious origin. In this study, we performed an extensive microbiological study of HS lesions and identified 2 main profiles of opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with HS lesions. These pathogens are commonly isolated from skin and soft tissue infections and are known to be sensitive to antimicrobial drug treatments used to obtain improvement or remission of HS lesions.

### Bacterial pathogens associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, France [^1167SXQL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Altogether, our study demonstrates that HS lesions are associated with bacterial species that can cause abscesses and severe infections. Compared with S. aureus or S. pyogenes, the low pathogenicity of these bacteria could account for the chronicity of suppuration of HS lesions that can last for years. In addition, the particular propensity of HS patients to develop recurrent or chronic skin infections highly suggests that HS is not primarily an infectious disease but a predisposing condition that allows these low pathogenic species to cause soft tissue and skin infections.

Histopathologic studies of noninflammatory areas of the skin of HS patients have shown the presence of dilated and distorted hair follicles. These anatomic abnormalities are thought to be caused by the hyperkeratinization of the follicular infundibulum, which can lead to dilatation and rupture and release of bacteria within the dermis. This event may predispose S. lugdunensis and anaerobic bacteria to cause nodules and abscesses in HS. Conversely, chronic suppurating HS lesions are deep abscesses drained by interconnected epithelialized sinus tracts. Colonization of these deep-seated lesions by anaerobic bacteria, streptococci of the Milleri group, and actinomycetes may account for chronic inflammation.

A limitation of our study is that HS patients who come to our center usually seek treatment for severe forms of the disease. Thus, the study population may not be representative of the HS patient population.

In summary, this study demonstrates that bacterial pathogens known to cause soft tissue and skin infections are found in HS lesions. The unexpected efficacy of wide-spectrum antimicrobial treatments for HS highly suggests that these bacteria are partly causative agents for suppurative hidradenitis and should be considered to be treatment targets. These data open an avenue for future research on the pathophysiology of this disease, and provide a rational basis for clinical trials of treatment of HS.

1.2 Hidradenitis suppurativa

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also called acne inversa or Verneuil's disease, is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory skin condition. Characterized by recurrent subcutaneous painful nodules, it often advances to persistent abscesses. Typically emerging post‐puberty, the condition exhibits deep‐seated, inflamed lesions predominantly in areas where apocrine glands are abundant, such as the axillary, inguinal, perineal, and anogenital regions. The course of HS is punctuated by cycles of remission and flare‐ups; without consistent treatment, these episodes become progressively severe. The signature abscesses and deep lesions of HS frequently evolve into draining sinus tracts. Over time, due to dermal fibrosis and subsequent healing, these tracts can induce skin deformities and contractures, HS has a notable prevalence, with estimates suggesting it affects 1%–4% of the Western population.

The exact pathogenesis of HS remains elusive. However, it is believed that hyperkeratosis within the follicular epithelium, coupled with follicular occlusion, prompts the rupture of the hair follicle infundibulum, subsequently inciting dermal inflammation. This inflammation can then pave the way for bacterial infiltration and secondary infections. Notably, there is a discernible link between HS and other immune‐mediated conditions, including Crohn's disease and PG. Current consensus increasingly acknowledges the significance of immune dysregulation in exacerbating the inflammation associated with HS. There appears to be a notable inclination towards the IL‐1 pathway and type 1 immune response in the context of HS. A range of cytokines, including TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐17, and IL‐23, play roles in this immune dysregulation. In managing HS, beyond the standard usage of oral corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents like cyclosporin, there is growing evidence supporting the efficacy of TNF‐α inhibitors as primary therapeutic agents. Additionally, IL‐1β is implicated in the inflammatory process, marked by the activation of caspase‐1, the inflammasome, and Nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐like receptor family, pyrin domain‐containing 3 (NALP3). The early appearance of immune cells in HS‐affected skin, even before the emergence of an inflammatory lesion, underscores the pivotal role of the immune system in HS pathogenesis.

In this review, we delve into the latest treatment advancements for PG and HS. While we scrutinize the roles of target molecules in the pathogenesis of both conditions, it is noteworthy that most of the available literature either offers limited clinical evidence or pertains to ongoing clinical trials.

PSTPIP1 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and is involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Disease‐associated mutants result in hyperphosphorylation of PSTPIP1 and enhanced interaction with pyrin, the protein encoded by the MEFV gene. Mutations in MEFV cause familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). This hyperphosphorylation of PSTPIP1 and enhanced interaction with pyrin lead to the enhanced assembly of the pyrin inflammasome, resulting in subsequent aberrant IL‐1β release. The PAMI‐associated mutant has been shown to possess an enhanced avidity to pyrin due to an altered electrostatic potential of PSTPIP1.

Serum IL‐18 levels are significantly elevated in PAPA patients who are positive for PSTPIP1 mutations, but not in "PAPA‐like" patients without the mutations. This serves as a reliable marker to distinguish whether individuals carry true PSTPIP1 mutations or not. Interestingly, elevated IL‐18 levels in PAPA syndrome do not correlate with an increased risk of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), despite the assumed critical role of high IL‐18 in MAS. The underlying mechanisms behind the significant elevations of IL‐18 in the serum of PAPA and PAMI syndromes, as well as the high serum zinc levels specifically in PAMI syndrome, are yet to be fully understood. The existence of dysregulated neutrophils and enhanced formation of NETs in PAPA syndrome have been shown.

4.3 Treatment of/syndrome

The clinical symptoms of PAPA and PAMI syndrome may change with age, and currently there is no evidence‐based therapeutic approach available. Until now, treatment options for PAPA have included steroids, anti‐TNF‐α, and anti‐IL‐1 agents. In the case of PAMI syndrome, neutropenia persists in all patients, even if other symptoms may improve with the use of immunosuppressants and biologics.

### Genetic mutations in pyoderma gangrenosum, hidradenitis suppurativa, and associated autoinflammatory syndromes: insights into pathogenic mechanisms and shared pathways [^1146oGq9]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In HS, the hair follicle is a central pathological site, and major mutations identified in HS are related to γ‐secretase. Discernable structural changes in the epithelium, such as sinus tracts and fistulas, are characteristic in HS but not in PG. This may indicate that γ‐secretase and its downstream signaling, such as NOTCH, are critical in driving such structural changes in the epithelium and concurrent chronic inflammation in HS. Other characteristics of HS include an increased presence of B cells and distinct exacerbating factors, such as smoking and obesity, which require further investigation in the future.

PSTPIP1‐associated conditions include PAPA, PAMI, PASH, and PAPASH syndromes. This suggests that PSTPIP1 may activate shared pathways related to both HS and pyogenic arthritis, in adddition to PG and acne. Mutant PSTPIP1 triggers the pyrin inflammasome, leading to the aberrant release of IL‐1β, a potent proinflammatory cytokine. However, unlike monogenic autoinflammatory diseases such as cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndrome (CAPS), a straightforward treatment such as IL‐1 blockade is not consistently effective for PSTPIP1‐associated conditions. This may indicate that pathogenic mechanisms in these conditions could be attributed to the effects of pyrin inflammasome activation beyond abnormal IL‐1β production, such as pyroptosis or IL‐18 release. Alternatively, mutant PSTPIP1 may have pathogenic roles beyond the pyrin inflammasome, such as regulating cytoskeletal structures and cellular dynamics. Additionally, dysregulation of PSTPIP1‐associated pathogenic pathways might be exacerbated by the involvement of multiple genetic factors and interactions with environmental factors, such as smoking contributing to HS development, in PSTPIP1 ‐mutation negative PG, HS, pyogenic arthritis, and acne.

Patients with PAMI, the severe form of PAPA, develop treatment‐resistant neutropenia and experience failure to thrive. Furthermore, none of these neutrophilic dermatoses have an established therapeutic approach. A more comprehensive understanding of the clinical, genetic, and molecular studies underlying these conditions may help in developing improved patient management strategies and identifying key therapeutic targets.

3 HIDRADENITIS SUPPURATIVA

3.1 Clinical features of

HS, also known as acne inversa, is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory skin condition characterized by abscesses, nodules, sinus tracts, and scars affecting the skin with apocrine glands. It primarily involves the intertriginous areas such as the axillary, inguinal (groin), gluteal, perianal, perineal, and inframammary regions. The prevalence of HS ranges from 0.7% to 1.2% in the general US and European populations, with a higher incidence in females (more than twice that of men). Importantly, ethnic variations might exist, as African Americans may have a higher prevalence of HS, while HS prevalence is lower in Japan and Korea, indicating the importance of genetic or environmental factors in the pathogenesis of HS. Symptoms of HS typically manifest post‐puberty, with usual onset in the second or third decade of life.

The clinical symptoms and signs of HS manifest as painful subcutaneous nodules accompanied by pruritus and hyperhidrosis. Over time, these nodules gradually progress to deep dermal abscesses and sinus tracts, ultimately resulting in scar formation and fibrosis. These symptoms are associated with pain, malodor, drainage, and disfigurement, which have a significant psychosocial impact on patients. Early recognition and accurate diagnosis are crucial to prevent disease progression. The severity of HS is typically assessed using Hurley staging, with stage I representing mild disease, stage II indicating moderate disease, and stage III indicating severe HS.

HS has been frequently associated with metabolic syndrome, IBD, spondyloarthritis (SpA) and smoking. Up to 50% of individuals with HS have reported having metabolic syndrome, characterized by concomitant obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. Additionally, approximately 40% of HS patients are found to have active SpA. Although the exact ratio may vary across studies, the prevalence of IBD among HS patients is estimated to be around 3%, whereas the prevalence of HS in patients with IBD has been reported to be 23%. Smoking is a well‐established risk factor for developing HS, with up to 90% of patients being active or former smokers.

### Practical multidisciplinary framework for the assessment and management of patients with unexplained chronic aerodigestive symptoms [^111AK9UB]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Vocal demand and voice behaviour

Dysphonia and other irritating throat symptoms are more prevalent among professional voice usersdue to prolonged or exaggerated vocal fold vibration, which cause mechanical epithelial injury and inflammation, termed phonotrauma. Laryngeal muscle tension and fatigue related to excess vocal strain may play a roleand contributions from psychosomatic factors are common themes in the literature.

Diagnostic approach

A history of increased voice demand is sought although chronic phonatory symptoms (cough and throat clearing) are also considered potential precipitants. Nasoendoscopic findings involving laryngeal inflammation, motor tension or disrupted vocal cord movement may be contributory although such features are non-specific.

Treatment approach

Treatments include strategies to improve vocal hygiene and minimise excess voice demands, as well as targeted therapies to normalise aberrant motor patterns or tensionand address sensory components which may drive phonotraumatic symptoms. Patients may also be provided with reflux therapies in a 'cover all' approach.

Aerosolised irritants

Numerous airborne aerosols are irritative or noxious to the respiratory tract, including the laryngopharynx. Irritants are classified by occupational, domestic and environmental source. Impacts on the aerodigestive tract are specific to irritating agents and are associated with several throat symptoms.

Diagnostic and treatment approach

Comprehensive analysis of environmental aerodigestive irritants and proposed aerodigestive symptom implications are available, including diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Respiratory allergy

Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are among the most common allergic manifestations in the general population. Despite a continuous respiratory epithelium extending between the nasal and lower airways, the larynx and pharynx are excluded among defined airway allergy phenotypes. Chronic throat symptoms are more prevalent in allergic populationsand vice versa. Historically, throat symptoms when present are regarded as secondary manifestations, caused by irritative secretions travelling up from the lower airway or falling from the nasal cavity or via unified airway pathophysiology. However, emerging evidence advances IgE-mediated eosinophilic inflammation within the laryngopharynx as a previously under-recognised consequence of allergen sensitisation in some. This concept of an 'allergic laryngitis' (AL) is supported by a developing literature that points to epidemiological evidence and results from direct allergy provocation studies in both animal and human studies. Further research is needed to clarify its biological basis and clinical implications.

Diagnostic and treatment approach

AL is yet to be accepted as a valid diagnosis of airway allergy and has no established diagnostic or treatment directions beyond chronic cough under the 'upper airway cough syndrome' framework.

Impetigo and ecthyma — clinical features describe that impetigo can be either bullous or nonbullous, with bullous impetigo caused by strains of S. aureus producing a toxin that cleaves the dermal-epidermal junction to form fragile, thin-roofed vesiculopustules that may rupture into crusted, erythematous erosions; nonbullous impetigo may be due to β-hemolytic streptococci or S. aureus and begins as erythematous papules that evolve into vesicles and pustules forming honey-colored crusts. Ecthyma is a deeper infection than impetigo caused by S. aureus and/or streptococci, with lesions that rupture into circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts and surrounding edema, and unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.

### Hypothesis: determining phenotypic specificity facilitates understanding of pathophysiology in rare genetic disorders [^116UZq7c]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Since improving understanding of underlying pathophysiology in the rapidly growing group of rare genetic disorders demands for an intelligible use of available data, we here explored a strategy focusing on systematically assessing phenotypic specificity and shared pathophysiology. Our results confirm the power of HPO in reliably aligning heterogeneous phenotypic information from multiple case series and case reports. We showed that calculating phenotypic frequency, while revealing the most prevalent phenotypic features, did not aid pathophysiological understanding. In contrast, determining phenotypic specificity did lead the way towards features easily linked to the underlying pathophysiology. Seven features could be linked to the major known pathophysiological process glycosylation, whereas episodic fever could be linked to disturbances of cellular processes (eg, autophagy) of which the importance was previously uncertain. Thus, we here provide support for our hypothesis that phenotypic specificity could facilitate progress in understanding underlying pathophysiology of rare genetic disorders.

### Acute and chronic urticaria: evaluation and treatment [^112xXbHJ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute urticaria:

- **Definition**: Acute urticaria is a self-limited cutaneous condition characterized by transient, erythematous, and pruritic wheals or hives.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute urticaria is caused by mast cell and basophil activation, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which results in vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, leading to characteristic skin lesions. The activation of these cells can occur through multiple triggers, including IgE- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute urticaria in the United Kingdom is estimated at 355 per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, acute urticaria presents as itchy, raised welts that can appear anywhere on the body. These hives are transient, often moving from one area of the body to another. In some cases, acute urticarial lesions may display central clearing with an ecchymotic or hemorrhagic hue.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of acute urticaria is generally good, as it is typically a self-limiting condition that resolves within 6 weeks.

### Eruption on the vulva and groin [^116meLdP]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover disease) – Incorrect. Grover disease is a self-limited pruritic papulovesicular condition with predilection for the trunk, neck, and proximal extremities, sparing the genitocrural region. Histology may resemble pemphigus, Darier disease, or Hailey-Hailey disease or be spongiotic.
B. Segmental follicular dyskeratosis (Darier disease) – Incorrect. Darier disease presents in adolescence as greasy, scaly brown papules that may form large verrucous plaques. Histology displays acantholysis with hyperkeratosis and dyskeratotic cells; verrucous epidermal hyperplasia and prominent folliculocentricity are typical. Seborrheic regions are affected with distribution on the trunk, scalp, face and neck in addition to the groin. Nail abnormalities are common. A segmental distribution indicates this form of Darier follows the lines of Blaschko, which is inconsistent with the genitocrural distribution found in this patient.
C. Segmental Hailey-Hailey disease – Incorrect. Histopathology shows dyskeratosis and suprabasilar acantholysis with loss of intercellular bridges, classically described as a dilapidated brick wall. The clinical morphology is dissimilar, with painful flaccid vesicles and crusted erosions on intertriginous skin such as the neck, axilla, and groin in a blaschkoid distribution.
D. PAD (of the genitocrural folds) – Correct. Discrete white to skin-colored smooth or verrucous papules that coalesce into plaques on the vulva and perineum reflect the morphology of PAD. PAD is a rare chronic acantholytic dermatosis that presents in young women with asymptomatic but persistent lesions limited to the genital, inguinal, and perineal skin. PAD occurs less frequently in men and can involve the penis, scrotum, perineum, or thighs. Histology shows overlapping features of Hailey-Hailey and Darier disease, including suprabasilar acantholysis, parakeratosis, and dyskeratosis. Verrucous epidermal hyperplasia is also typical.
E. Familial dyskeratotic comedones – Incorrect. Although the clinical morphology includes discrete asymptomatic hyperkeratotic papules, comedones are the principal lesions. The trunk, extremities, face, and groin are involved. Histology shows dilated infundibula filled with keratin and dyskeratosis; acantholysis is occasionally observed.

An obvious factor is the longitudinal and ill-defined nature of AR that necessitates long-term investment in AR research that is economically prohibitive and leads to regulatory issues relevant to the development and approval of AR drugs. There are intrinsic characteristics of AR research that render it difficult to perform, including that there are multiple features of AR and a lack of consensus regarding which are important, and that what induces AR in the human is not well defined.

### Inordinate attention to minor pathophysiology variations in musculoskeletal research: example of rotator cuff tendinopathy [^111epRQ1]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests variation in pathophysiology is less relevant to musculoskeletal illness than variation in mental health factors. For diseases such as rotator cuff tendinopathy, attention may be placed on aspects of tendon thinning and suture techniques when studies show that variations in muscle quality and defect size have limited association with comfort and capability compared with variations in thoughts and feelings regarding symptoms. Using rotator cuff tendinopathy as an example, we studied the degree to which research addresses relatively minor degrees of variation in pathophysiology and relatively minor differences in treatments to better understand the relative emphasis on pathophysiology. We asked the following questions: What factors are associated with relative pathophysiology severity in comparative therapeutic studies of musculoskeletal conditions? What factors are associated with relative differences in interventions in comparative therapeutic studies of musculoskeletal conditions?

Methods

We systematically reviewed clinical trials of patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy for the relative severity of pathophysiology (low, moderate, or high) and variation in interventions (minimal, moderate, or large). An example of a relatively minor variation in rotator cuff tendon pathophysiology is bursal- vs. articular-sided thinning of the tendon. An example of a relatively minor variation in treatment is single- vs. double-row defect closure.

Results

Most studies of rotator cuff tendinopathy treatment addressed low (39%) or medium (50%) levels of pathophysiology. Greater relative pathology severity was independently associated with operative treatment (odds ratio, 12 [95% confidence interval, 3.2–45]; P < .001). Of 127 studies, 113 (89%) were rated as comparing treatments with minimal difference.

Conclusion

Despite the evidence of limited variation in comfort and capability due to pathophysiological variations, a large percentage of research on rotator cuff tendinopathy addresses relatively limited severity of pathophysiology and relatively minor variations in treatment. This may be typical of musculoskeletal research and suggests a possibility of focusing, on the one hand, on more impactful interventions such as treatments that can delay or avoid rotator cuff arthropathy and, on the other hand, on management strategies that optimize accommodation of common age-related changes in the rotator cuff tendons.

### Surgeon prioritization of mental, social, and pathophysiological aspects of health among people with traumatic and nontraumatic musculoskeletal conditions [^111esDdK]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is mounting evidence that, among musculoskeletal patients, variation in capability has more notable associations with variations in mental and social health factors than with variation in pathophysiology severity. This study sought factors that could limit the integration of this evidence into more comprehensive care models.

Methods

In two scenario-based experiments, surgeon participants in an international collaborative, the Science of Variation Group, reviewed scenarios of (a) nontraumatic (83 participants) and (b) trauma-related (130 participants) pathophysiologies for which tests and treatments were discretionary. The following demographic, mental, and social health elements were varied randomly: sex, age, race/ethnicity, mindsets, social health aspects, and specific pathophysiologies. For each scenario, participants rated their likelihood to offer surgery (continuous) and their sense of presence of an opportunity to address better mental or social health in treatment (yes or no). Factors associated with each rating were sought in multivariable analysis.

Results

Greater likelihood to offer discretionary surgery for nontraumatic pathophysiologies was associated with greater pathophysiology severity, trapeziometacarpal arthritis, and greater distress and unhelpful thoughts regarding symptoms. Lateral elbow enthesopathy was associated with a lower likelihood. For trauma-related pathophysiologies, an ankle fracture with slight articular subluxation was associated with greater likelihood to offer surgery, and several other trauma-related pathophysiologies were associated with a lower likelihood. For both nontraumatic and trauma-related pathophysiologies, surgeons noticed unhelpful thinking, distress, and social issues as reasons to consider addressing mental and social health in treatment, relatively independent of pathophysiology.

Conclusion

Surgeons seem to recognize opportunities to address mental and social needs but ultimately base their decision to offer discretionary surgery on pathophysiological factors.

Clinical Relevance

Comprehensive, whole-person care for musculoskeletal illness might be supported by strategies for ensuring that aspects of stress and distress that contribute to greater symptom intensity are not misinterpreted as a reflection of greater pathophysiology severity.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113pcetu]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

Chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) pathophysiology — research needs emphasize that an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of CMI is needed and that this gap is one of the greatest barriers in CMI research and ultimately CMI patient treatment. The guideline notes that intervention studies have used analogous syndromes such as FMS, IBS, and ME/CFS that may overlap but not fully capture the mechanisms, and that clinically relevant subcategories of CMI with different pathophysiological processes may exist. It states that additional research to clarify the specific etiologic and pathophysiological processes in CMI and any relevant subgroups will allow researchers and clinicians to identify, study, and implement treatments that more specifically engage the whole person and more effectively treat CMI. This research should focus on determining whether (and to what extent) CMI overlaps with other symptom-based syndromes, and such research must explicitly justify the selection of specific interventions and putative mechanisms of action based on current understanding of the pathophysiology.

### Methodologies for the development of the management of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114rmk98]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Cough guideline methodology — PICO refinement, literature searches, and quality assessments are outlined as follows: Each topic-specific committee drafted key clinical questions that a frontline clinician and consumer representative agreed would provide important guidance, and with a methodologist these key questions were formulated to examine descriptors of the relevant PICO; these PICO elements then informed the search strategies, including synonyms, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for study screening and acceptance. Searches were conducted in the National Guidelines Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network Library, with additional searches for published systematic reviews in PubMed and the Cochrane Library; when no reasonable quality systematic reviews were identified, primary literature searches were conducted in at least two databases using the predefined search strategies, and Medline and the Cochrane Library were always searched for relevant English language studies and, depending on the topic, other databases (eg, EMBASE, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched. Identified English-language articles were initially screened by title and abstract, using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria followed by full-text screening of qualified articles; search strategies are available upon request at science@chestnet.org, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferentially assessed using DART, which was adopted in 2011 for CHEST guidelines and consensus statements; quality was assessed for individual studies and the body of relevant evidence, with randomized controlled trials primarily indicating benefits and observational studies helpful in identifying harms and examined when RCTs were not available.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^114jVyTu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Airway remodeling (AR) research barriers and solutions — Table 2 — details methodological obstacles such as "Lack of consensus regarding physiologically or clinically relevant features/aspects of AR" and "Difficulties in accessing or measuring critical indices", with approaches including "Agreement on definitions and indices for AR", "Assessment of importance of indices in asthma pathophysiology and symptoms (and, conversely, responses to therapy)", and "Identification of biomarkers or indicators of AR that correlate with disease phenotype, severity, responsiveness to therapy, and other relevant factors". Modeling gaps are addressed by "Identification of preclinical models that most closely approximate the human condition for both AHR and AR". For the "Costs and logistics given longitudinal and slow-developing nature of AR", proposed actions include "Attention to balance between reasonable timeframes for AR development or intervention in preclinical models vs. much slower AR development in humans" and "Exploration of AR prevention/prophylaxis in asthma, thus identifying "at-risk" populations (aided by research using genetic and phenotypic markers), overall reducing timeframe of studies". To improve funding prospects, the table notes "Perceived limited impact of AR research and associated difficulties and increased competitiveness for funding" and calls for "Education, education, education, regarding importance of AR and the many limitations that render AR research and advancement of AR therapeutics difficult". Economic/regulatory obstacles — "Jaundiced perspective of regulatory bodies (lack of FDA regulatory indicators for asthma medications that include changes in airway histopathology)" and "Difficulties of proposing deliverables with any anti-AR drug leading to limited interest by pharmaceutical industry (lack of regulatory indications, proof of concept, and unclear commercialization strategy)" — are paired with solutions to "Encourage preclinical and clinical studies establishing that AR features cause or exacerbate regulatory indicators of asthma (airflow obstruction, AHR, resolution of inflammation, and inflammatory markers)" and "Establish regulatory precedent that includes AR features", plus to "Assess drugs targeting AR in the context of current regulatory indicators, given the history of difficulty in establishing a new regulatory indicator for most diseases" and to "Initiate and maintain dialogue among investigators, funding agencies, and regulatory agencies with frequent informational meetings, preferably at large scientific/clinical gatherings, to provide updates on research and drug development in AR", citing examples including "the NIH Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer grants, R33 and other grants for drug repurposing, and larger clinical/translational grants and contracts".

### Treating cough due to non-CF and CF bronchiectasis with nonpharmacological airway clearance: CHEST expert panel report [^111mHdSP]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel methods — PICO question, quality assessment, and peer review: "The identified systematic reviews were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Documentation and Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews", and screening used "dual review", with "four panelists independently reviewed the titles and abstracts" and "In each step, dual review and dual extraction were performed". Initially, the key question was phrased as "Is there evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects for non-pharmacological therapies in cough treatment for patients with diseases that affect airway clearance and ineffective cough?" and "During the review process, the panel decided to substitute the word 'important' for 'relevant', eliminate the phrase 'ineffective cough', and to focus on bronchiectasis". The manuscript "went through 2 rounds of review".

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^111u4fn2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Airway remodeling (AR) research — specific challenges are outlined as follows: There is a "Lack of consensus regarding the importance of multiple features of AR", and "a majority of studies have focused on a subset of features… or simply noted the existence of AR-relevant changes in different disease models, with some attempts to implicate specific effectors". Moreover, "the pathophysiological role of specific AR indices in more well-accepted asthma features (airway hyperreactivity [AHR], airway impedance independent of AHR, or inflammation) is largely conceptual and associative/correlative but does not demonstrate necessity and sufficiency of AR in disease, leading to lack of clear direction and rationale for AR research, identification of therapeutic targets, and development of anti-AR drugs". Additional barriers include "Fundamental methodological limitations, including cost, lack of standardized methodology, relevance of nonhuman model systems, prolonged time frame of AR development in humans, and inherent limitations of tools/techniques", "Difficulty of proposing 'deliverables' for research testing anti-AR drugs due to lack of prioritized AR outcomes and lack of empirical basis to guide timing and targets for intervention", and "Economic and regulatory issues, including perceived economic risk in investing in AR research or potential anti-AR therapeutics and regulatory indicators that are not AR outcomes".

### The A to E of airway disease [^116JNFKG]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

The terms asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have evolved from their original very specific physiology-based definition to describe additional disease entities such as symptoms, airway inflammation and airway structure. We argue that as a result there is widespread confusion about what the terms mean. This has become a significant hurdle to optimal disease management and drug development. We propose that these disease labels should be replaced with a new alphabetical assessment tool for characterizing airway disease, which provides a checklist of five relatively independent factors potentially responsible for morbidity in patients with airway disease: Airway hyperresponsiveness, Bronchitis, Cough reflex hypersensitivity, Damage to the airway and surrounding lung and Extrapulmonary factors. We speculate that the use of this system to characterize airway disease will improve outcomes by promoting better targeting of new and existing treatments.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current challenges facing research and therapeutic advances in airway remodeling [^11619LYa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on airway remodeling (AR) — scope, methods, findings, and conclusions are summarized as follows: Airway remodeling (AR) is a prominent feature of asthma and other obstructive lung diseases that is minimally affected by current treatments, and the goals are to discuss the scientific, technological, economic, and regulatory issues that deter progress of AR research and development of therapeutics targeting AR and to propose approaches and solutions to these specific problems; this Statement is not intended to provide clinical practice recommendations on any disease in which AR is observed and/or plays a role. An international multidisciplinary group from academia, industry, and the National Institutes of Health was invited to participate in one internet-based and one face-to-face meeting, and a literature search of PubMed was performed to support conclusions; the search was not a systematic review of the evidence. Multiple conceptual, logistical, economic, and regulatory deterrents that limit AR research and impede accelerated, intensive development of AR-focused therapeutics were identified, and complementary solutions that leverage expertise of academia and industry were proposed. The statement concludes that numerous intrinsic and economic factors have thwarted the ability to understand AR pathology and mechanisms and to address it clinically, and it identifies potential solutions while emphasizing educating the global research community as a critical first step in developing effective strategies for: (1) increasing the extent and impact of AR research and (2) developing, testing, and ultimately improving drugs targeting AR.

### Interactions between fibroblastic reticular cells and B cells promote mesenteric lymph node lymphangiogenesis [^1111pQdR]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In summary, our data indicates that BAFF provides a feed-forward loop in which B-cell-mediated FRC activation results in the upregulation of lymphotoxin by B cells, thereby licensing these cells to provide further stimulatory signals to FRCs and to promote increased BAFF production (Fig. 8). These data likely explain the requirement for B cell–FRC cross talk in eliciting increased VEGF production and promoting mLN lymphangiogenesis following Hp infection (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
Schematic of FRC–B cell interactions resulting in mLN lymphangiogenesis following Hp infection. Lymphotoxin expression by IL-4- and antigen-activated B cells (1) signals to LTβR expressed by FRCs (2) to promote the expression of BAFF (3). BAFF then synergizes with IL-4 to further upregulate lymphotoxin expression on antigen-activated B cells in a feed-forward manner that acts to amplify total BAFF levels (4). BAFF and IL-4 then synergize to promote VEGF production by B cells (5) which drives helminth-induced lymphangiogenesis and continued DC accumulation within the mLN (6). FRC-derived BAFF also stimulates lymphotoxin expression by interacting B cells creating a feed-forward loop that furhter promotes FRC activation (7)

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115stpxn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation in febrile neutropenia with skin and soft tissue lesions — key diagnostic steps are specified. Signs and symptoms are often diminished or absent in neutropenia, and skin lesions, no matter how small or innocuous in appearance, should be carefully evaluated. Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist, a surgeon, and a dermatologist may result in improved outcome. Initial clinical impressions should be supplemented with a systemic approach to enhance diagnosis and management. Blood cultures are critical, and at least 2 sets should be obtained. Radiographic imaging should be performed as clinically indicated and can help define extent of disease; chest/sinus imaging may identify silent pulmonary or sinus infection with dissemination. The most specific method is biopsy or aspiration of lesions for histological, cytological, and microbiological evaluation.

### Pectus excavatum and carinatum: a narrative review of epidemiology, etiopathogenesis, clinical features, and classification [^113EeVbD]. Journal of Thoracic Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on pectus excavatum:

- **Definition**: Pectus excavatum is a congenital chest wall deformity characterized by a depression of the anterior chest wall, specifically the sternum and lower costal cartilages.
- **Pathophysiology**: The cause of pectus excavatum is unknown, but a genetic predisposition is suggested, with a positive family history reported in up to 54% of cases. The pathophysiology involves an imbalance in the growth of the rib cage and sternum, often associated with connective tissue disorders, leading to a depression of the sternum.
- Epidemiology: Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall deformity in the world, with a reported prevalence of 8 per 1,000 live births and a male-to-female ratio of 5:1.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for pectus excavatum include a family history of the condition, male gender, and certain connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Other associated conditions include Turner syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome, Noonan's syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b, spinal muscular atrophy, and prune belly syndrome.
- **Disease course**: Pectus excavatum can be asymptomatic, but depending on the severity, it can present with shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, poor endurance, and cardiac compression, particularly during adolescence when growth spurts occur. Physical and psychological symptoms, such as precordial pain after exercise, impairments of pulmonary and cardiac function, and social isolation, occur in severe cases.
