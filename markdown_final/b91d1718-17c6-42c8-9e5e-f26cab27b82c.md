## Question

Empiric pertussis treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about empiric pertussis treatment, including when to treat, which antibiotic to choose, dosing by age, special populations, postexposure prophylaxis, and how to monitor and adjust therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical threshold for empiric treatment and the diagnostic features that raise suspicion. Then, I should verify the goals of therapy and the window of benefit. Next, I will select first-line agents and dosing by age, including neonates, and consider alternatives and macrolide resistance. After that, I need to check postexposure prophylaxis indications and timing. Finally, I will review monitoring, duration of contagion, and when to modify therapy based on response or test results, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from the sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical threshold for empiric treatment, because I need to ensure we are not over- or under-treating. In adults with acute or subacute cough, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever are sensitive but nonspecific, whereas inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting are more specific and should prompt empiric therapy while awaiting confirmation, especially if there is known exposure or community transmission; in children, posttussive vomiting is moderately sensitive and specific and should similarly trigger empiric treatment when suspected, particularly in infants and unvaccinated hosts [^111zU7JA] [^114T29Fd] [^111fQfap] [^111yJXpL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptom modification. I should verify the therapeutic goals. Antibiotics eradicate Bordetella pertussis from the nasopharynx and reduce transmission, but they do not reliably shorten the cough once paroxysms begin. Early treatment in the catarrhal or early paroxysmal phase may lessen severity, so the public health rationale remains strong even when cough persists [^115JfKgH] [^112sZv2S] [^11158xnk].

> Next, I should review first-line agents and dosing, and I need to be precise by age. For patients 1 month and older, macrolides are preferred: azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily on days 2–5 for adults, or weight-based pediatric dosing. Clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days in adults. Erythromycin 40–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for 14 days in children, with adult regimens typically 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days, though azithromycin is generally better tolerated and supports adherence due to shorter duration and once-daily dosing [^115GN55P] [^1148SmqV] [^111rY2GC] [^114mgK2x].

> Wait, let me verify neonatal management because infant safety is critical. In infants under 1 month, azithromycin is the preferred macrolide despite concerns about infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The risk of severe pertussis complications outweighs the small absolute risk of IHPS, and parents should be counseled to monitor for feeding intolerance and projectile vomiting, with azithromycin dosed at 10 mg/kg on day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg daily on days 2–5, while erythromycin should be avoided in neonates due to a stronger IHPS signal [^11158xnk] [^116vZ1ST].

> I should double-check alternatives for macrolide intolerance or resistance. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an acceptable alternative for patients older than 2 months when macrolides are contraindicated or not tolerated, typically dosed for 7 days; however, TMP-SMX is not recommended for infants under 2 months, and I need to ensure I do not inadvertently prescribe it in that age group [^11158xnk] [^116U6kAu].

> But wait, what if macrolide resistance is a concern? I need to check local epidemiology and travel history. Macrolide resistance has been reported in some regions, notably parts of Asia, and in such contexts TMP-SMX may be preferred in older infants and children; in the U.S., resistance remains uncommon, but vigilance for treatment failure is prudent, and culture with susceptibility testing can be considered in refractory cases or outbreaks [^116U6kAu] [^111v2qjg].

> Next, I should review postexposure prophylaxis, and I need to ensure timing is correct. Close contacts, especially household members and those who will interact with high-risk individuals such as infants under 12 months or pregnant women, should receive PEP within 21 days of exposure regardless of immunization status; azithromycin is preferred for convenience and tolerability, with the same agents and durations used for treatment applied to prophylaxis [^115cChTU] [^112s4tUL].

> I will now examine special populations and settings to avoid missing high-risk scenarios. Pregnant women in their third trimester should receive PEP when exposed and should be prioritized for Tdap vaccination during 27–36 weeks' gestation to protect the newborn; healthcare personnel with exposure to high-risk patients should receive PEP and be excluded from work for the first 5 days of effective therapy if symptomatic, with symptom monitoring for 21 days; in residential pediatric facilities, strict isolation and clearance policies apply until 5 days of appropriate therapy are completed [^1124hVrH] [^114Tvm2S] [^11742qQo].

> Let me consider supportive care and what not to prescribe, because I should avoid ineffective interventions. Routine use of bronchodilators, corticosteroids, or antitussives is not recommended for pertussis-specific cough modification; severe infant disease may require hospitalization, oxygen, and monitoring for complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary hypertension, with exchange transfusion considered for extreme leukocytosis with lymphocytosis in critical illness [^116U6kAu] [^113zuU3V].

> I should confirm the duration of contagiousness and when to return to normal activities. Persons with pertussis are considered noninfectious after 5 days of appropriate macrolide therapy; cough may persist for weeks, but this does not imply ongoing infectivity once the 5-day treatment threshold is met, which is important for school, childcare, and healthcare return-to-work decisions [^11742qQo].

> Hold on, I should verify how to monitor and when to adjust therapy. Clinical improvement in cough frequency and severity is expected over days to weeks, but eradication of carriage is the key microbiologic endpoint. If PCR remains positive beyond 5 days of therapy in young infants, I need to consider adherence, drug absorption, or rare resistance, and in outbreaks or refractory cases, culture and susceptibility testing can guide alternative therapy, with TMP-SMX as a reasonable switch when macrolides are not suitable [^11766cTS] [^116U6kAu].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting statements before concluding. Some older or lower-credibility sources suggest erythromycin as the historical standard, but contemporary guidance and comparative trials favor azithromycin for better tolerability and adherence, with clarithromycin and erythromycin remaining acceptable alternatives; thus, my final algorithm aligns with current CDC and CHEST-aligned recommendations while preserving historical context where relevant [^11158xnk] [^113ktKik] [^114mgK2x].

> Final synthesis: treat empirically when clinical suspicion is moderate to high based on paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whoop, and absence of fever, especially with exposure risk or in infants. Start a macrolide promptly, preferring azithromycin for its short course and tolerability, adjust dosing by age with neonatal precautions, provide PEP to close contacts within 21 days, and ensure 5 days of therapy before declaring noninfectious, while recognizing that antibiotics eradicate carriage but do not reliably modify established cough [^111zU7JA] [^115GN55P] [^112s4tUL] [^11742qQo].

Empiric pertic treatment is **early macrolide therapy** (azithromycin preferred) for suspected pertussis, especially in infants and close contacts, to reduce transmission and severity [^11158xnk] [^113ktKik]. Azithromycin is favored for its short course, good tolerability, and safety in infants, while erythromycin is avoided in neonates due to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis risk [^114mgK2x] [^112s4tUL]. TMP-SMX is an alternative for macrolide intolerance or resistance [^1145XPWw]. Treat within 21 days of exposure or onset; **earlier treatment better reduces severity and transmission** [^11158xnk] [^116U6kAu]. Monitor for adverse effects and adjust therapy based on test results and clinical response [^11158xnk].

## Indications for empiric pertussis treatment

Empiric treatment is indicated when clinical suspicion is moderate to high, especially in **infants, close contacts, or outbreaks** [^115JfKgH] [^113nJPkM]. Clinical features supporting empiric treatment include:

- **Paroxysmal cough**: Recurrent prolonged coughing spells with inability to breathe during spells [^113Uafbh].
- **Posttussive vomiting**: Moderately sensitive and specific in children [^112QvZaw].
- **Inspiratory whoop**: High specificity, though less sensitive [^112QvZaw].
- **Absence of fever**: High sensitivity but low specificity [^111zU7JA].

---

## Recommended empiric antibiotic regimens

Macrolides are **first-line** because of efficacy, safety, and tolerability [^11158xnk]:

| **Antibiotic** | **Age group** | **Dosage and duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Azithromycin | ≥ 1 month | 10 mg/kg on day 1, then 5 mg/kg/day on days 2–5 | - Short course <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Preferred in infants [^11158xnk] |
| Clarithromycin | ≥ 1 month | 15 mg/kg/day divided BID for 7 days | Alternative macrolide |
| Erythromycin | ≥ 1 month | 40–50 mg/kg/day divided QID for 14 days | - Higher GI side effects <br/> - Avoid in neonates [^112s4tUL] |
| TMP-SMX | ≥ 2 months | 8–12 mg/kg/day of TMP component divided BID for 14 days | Alternative for macrolide intolerance/resistance [^1145XPWw] |

---

## Timing of treatment initiation

Early treatment within 1–2 weeks of symptom onset reduces severity and transmission; **treat as soon as suspicion is moderate to high**, ideally within 21 days of exposure or symptom onset [^11158xnk] [^116U6kAu].

---

## Special considerations and precautions

- **Infants < 1 month**: Use macrolides cautiously; monitor for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) [^11158xnk].
- **Pregnancy**: Azithromycin is preferred; erythromycin is avoided due to IHPS risk.
- **Macrolide resistance**: Consider TMP-SMX in areas with known resistance [^11158xnk].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical monitoring**: Track cough, respiratory status, and complications.
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Use PCR or culture to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy [^111pUcbz].
- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for GI upset, rash, and IHPS in infants [^114mgK2x].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Clinical course**: Antibiotics do not reliably shorten cough duration once paroxysmal stage begins [^11158xnk].
- **Resistance**: Macrolide resistance is rare but rising; surveillance is needed [^notfound].
- **Prophylaxis**: Postexposure prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts, especially infants and pregnant women [^116U6kAu].

---

Empiric pertussis treatment relies on **early macrolide therapy**, with azithromycin preferred for its safety and adherence profile. Treatment should start promptly when suspicion is moderate to high, with attention to age, pregnancy, and resistance patterns.

Background and Epidemiology of Pertussis

Pertussis is an acute respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Classic pertussis disease is characterized by three phases of illness: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. During the catarrhal phase, infected persons experience coryza (inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities), mild occasional cough, and low-grade fever. The paroxysmal phase is characterized by spasmodic cough, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop. Symptoms slowly improve during the convalescent phase, which generally lasts 7–10 days, but can last for months. Factors that affect the clinical presentation of pertussis include age, the level of immunity, history of vaccination, and use of antimicrobials early during the course of the illness.

B. pertussis is transmitted primarily from person to person through aerosolized respiratory droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. Persons with pertussis are most infectious during the catarrhal and early paroxysmal phases of illness. Pertussis generally is treated with antibiotics, which are used to control the signs and symptoms and to prevent infected persons from spreading the infection to others. Recommended antibiotics for pertussis include azithromycin, clarithroymycin, erythromycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Guidance for the treatment of pertussis has been published previously. Guidance on postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis is available at.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^1153ojYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low-income countries. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 2014, Issue 2), accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to 30 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 30 January 2014), AMED (1985 to 30 January 2014), CINAHL (1980 to 30 January 2014) and LILACS (30 January 2014). We searched Current Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (SB, MT) independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors (SB, KW) independently reviewed additional studies identified by the updated searches in 2012 and 2014. The primary outcome was frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), development of serious complications, mortality from any cause, side effects due to medication, admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay.

Main Results

We included 12 trials of varying sample sizes (N = 9 to 135), mainly from high-income countries, including a total of 578 participants. Ten trials recruited children (N = 448 participants). Two trials recruited adolescents and adults (N = 130 participants). We considered only three trials to be of high methodological quality (one trial each of diphenhydramine, pertussis immunoglobulin and montelukast). Included studies did not show a statistically significant benefit for any of the interventions. Only six trials, including a total of 196 participants, reported data in sufficient detail for analysis. Diphenhydramine did not change coughing episodes; the mean difference (MD) of coughing spells per 24 hours was 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.7 to 8.5 (N = 49 participants from one trial). One trial on pertussis immunoglobulin reported a possible mean reduction of -3.1 whoops per 24 hours (95% CI -6.2 to 0.02, N = 47 participants) but no change in hospital stay (MD -0.7 days; 95% CI -3.8 to 2.4, N = 46 participants). Dexamethasone did not show a clear decrease in length of hospital stay (MD -3.5 days; 95% CI -15.3 to 8.4, N = 11 participants from one trial) and salbutamol showed no change in coughing paroxysms per day (MD -0.2; 95% CI -4.1 to 3.7, N = 42 participants from two trials). Only one trial comparing pertussis immunoglobulin versus placebo (N = 47 participants) reported data on adverse events: 4.3% in the treatment group (rash) versus 5.3% in the placebo group (loose stools, pain and swelling at injection site).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions for the cough in whooping cough. More high-quality trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of potential antitussive treatments in patients with whooping cough.

### Pertussis: common questions and answers [^113ktKik]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, remains a public health concern despite expanded immunization recommendations over the past three decades. The presentation of pertussis, which is variable and evolves over the course of the disease, includes nonspecific symptoms in the catarrhal stage, coughing with the classic whooping in the paroxysmal stage, and persistent cough in the convalescent stage. When there is clinical suspicion for pertussis, the diagnosis should be confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing, which has replaced culture as the preferred confirmatory test. Recent evidence has confirmed a waning of acquired immunity following pertussis immunization or infection, leading to changes in tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) immunization recommendations. Patients 11 years or older should receive at least one dose of Tdap, although Tdap may replace any dose of the tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine. All pregnant patients should receive Tdap between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation with each pregnancy to convey immunity to the newborn. Cocooning (vaccinating close contacts of high-risk individuals) is no longer recommended because immunized patients can still contract and transmit pertussis. A history of seizure or hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes after a prior pertussis vaccination is no longer a contraindication to immunization. Antibiotic treatment is intended to prevent transmission of pertussis to others and does not shorten the disease course or improve symptoms. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for household contacts of someone with pertussis and for those exposed to pertussis who are at high risk of severe illness (e.g., infants, people who are immunocompromised or in the third trimester of pregnancy) or in close contact with someone at high risk. Azithromycin is the preferred antibiotic for treatment or prophylaxis.

### The incidence, duration, risk factors, and age-based variation of missed opportunities to diagnose pertussis: a population-based cohort study [^113RVGrk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

We identified 2 other potential risk factors for diagnostic delays associated with pertussis. First, prior receipt of an antibiotic commonly used to treat respiratory infections was associated with a diagnostic delay. We did not include macrolides because these drugs were used to identify pertussis cases. Assuming that these potential therapeutic interventions would be successful likely results in delayed diagnostic testing (eg, patients told to wait for these treatments to take effect). Second, diagnostic delays were also more common for patients who visited the ED, without an inpatient visit on the same day. Diagnostic errors may occur commonly in the ED setting, and revisits to an ED are often due to misdiagnosis. In the ED, physicians are often treating patients they are seeing for the first time, and they may be unaware of the patients' medical history. In addition, many patients have vague symptoms with a wide range of severity, and physicians in the ED are often interrupted. Finally, when diagnostic errors do occur, ED physicians may not be able to learn from missed opportunities to diagnose a disease because follow-up care occurs in other healthcare settings. Improving clinical suspicion for pertussis is clearly needed. Improving illness scripts among clinicians could improve diagnostic accuracy. Future work describing different clinical presentations in different clinical settings may also help strategies to decrease diagnostic delays.

Our study had several limitations. First, we relied on diagnostic codes from claims to identify pertussis cases and potential symptoms prior to diagnosis. However, we also used outpatient medications to validate our case definition, and we conducted sensitivity analyses using all visits. We only captured patients who were eventually diagnosed; thus, our findings may represent underestimates. Second, our data set was restricted to an insured population, with employer-sponsored health insurance or privately managed Medicaid coverage, and our findings may not be generalizable to uninsured populations. Third, vaccination may make it more difficult to diagnose people with pertussis, but we were not able to account for vaccination in our investigation. Finally, we grouped all adults together, but there may be specific risk factors for older adults, and these should be addressed in future work.

Despite an effective vaccine, pertussis has been reemerging both worldwide and in the United States. Given the limitations of vaccination strategies and approaches, the early identification of cases may play an important role in the public health response. However, our results show that diagnostic delays are frequent, and more work is needed to improve timely diagnostic strategies, especially among adolescents and adults.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a guide to pertussis [^113nJPkM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a bacterial infection caused by the organism Bordetella pertussis It can lead to severe illness and death, especially in neonates and young infants. Pre-vaccination, pertussis was a major contributor to childhood morbidity and mortality. Despite global vaccination programmes, it remains a considerable public health challenge. Infants at high risk of infection presenting with cough and/or apnoea with a peripheral hyperleucocytosis due to lymphocytosis should be investigated and managed with caution. It is important for clinicians to recognise the risk of severe disease in young infants and test symptomatic patients rapidly to guide treatment decisions and inform public health response. The testing of asymptomatic persons or close contacts is not routinely recommended. Antimicrobial treatment, usually an oral macrolide, is recommended for infants, close contacts of symptomatic patients and individuals at risk of severe disease to decrease both severity and the infectious period. Preventative strategies such as immunisation programs encompassing vaccination during each pregnancy, childhood immunisation and considering lifelong additional pertussis vaccine booster doses for adults (especially when in close contact with infants and other vulnerable persons) are important patient-centred public health strategies for clinicians.

### Pertussis in young infants throughout the world [^112nhr7X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

PREVENTION OF PERTUSSIS IN YOUNG INFANTS

In 2016, the mainstay of preventing pertussis in young infants is pertussis immunization and the use of prophylactic antibiotics (usually a macrolide) in an exposed infant.

Acellular pertussis vaccines are less reactogenic than whole-cell pertussis vaccines, but their effectiveness and duration of protection are less than that of whole-cell vaccines. Therefore, it is my recommendation that all countries presently using whole-cell vaccines continue to do so. The primary schedule for whole-cell pertussis vaccination is at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks.

In countries using acellular vaccines, it is my recommendation that the first dose of the primary series be given at 6 weeks of age and subsequent doses given at 4 and 6 months of age.

Of most importance today, in all countries, is the administration of Tdap to all pregnant women, with each pregnancy, during the second or third trimester (before 36 weeks' gestation). Maternal immunization along with administration of the first vaccine dose to the infant at 6 weeks of age, if implemented, will prevent all pertussis deaths and most severe cases of infant pertussis.

### Erythromycin ethylsuccinate (ery-ped) [^111XZ6rT]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ery-Ped and other antibacterial drugs, Ery-Ped should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Ery-Ped is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)

Lower-respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected

individuals rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed

### Pertussis: a disease affecting all ages [^115okZhR]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis is a highly contagious bacterium known to cause pertussis (whooping cough) and is transmitted via airborne droplets. Although childhood vaccination has dramatically reduced reported pertussis cases, the incidence of the disease has increased over the past 20 years, most notably in previously immunized adolescents and adults. Pertussis should be suspected in patients of all ages with cough who meet the clinical criteria for the disease. Diagnostic tests currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for pertussis infection have low sensitivity. Regardless of test results, physicians should treat clinically suspected pertussis with antimicrobials and report cases to their state health department. A 14-day erythromycin regimen has been the treatment of choice; however, shorter-course macrolide antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, clarithromycin) may be as effective with fewer adverse effects and better adherence to therapy. The recently recommended tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for adolescents and adults may decrease the incidence of pertussis in infants — the group at the greatest risk of pertussis complications.

### Bordetella pertussis isolates with a heterogeneous phenotype for erythromycin resistance [^111v2qjg]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Erythromycin is currently being used for both prophylaxis and treatment of pertussis infections. Erythromycin resistance was first recognized in Bordetella pertussis in Arizona in 1994, and since then, three additional resistant isolates have been identified in the United States. To better assess the potential public health impact of erythromycin-resistant B. pertussis, we used the disk diffusion assay to evaluate the frequency of erythromycin resistance among 1,030 recently circulating U.S. isolates and found the rate of occurrence to be < 1%. We also describe a novel heterogeneous phenotype, with erythromycin-resistant colonies appearing only after a 7-day incubation period. To optimize patient management, we recommend that clinicians be alert to potential treatment failures and that laboratorians use a 7-day incubation period when screening for resistance. Our ongoing national surveillance will continue to monitor for resistant B. pertussis isolates and their potential association with changing pertussis epidemiology.

### The global pertussis initiative: process overview [^112wJkUw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

In 2001, the Global Pertussis Initiative was established as a scientific forum to analyze the status of pertussis globally and to evaluate various immunization strategies to improve disease control. Thirty-seven multidisciplinary experts from 17 countries participated. The initiative was conducted in 3 stages: assessment of the international epidemiology, diagnosis, health and economic burden, and prevention and treatment of pertussis; evaluation and prioritization of 7 immunization strategies to address the problems; and identification of solutions to surmount potential barriers to the implementation of these strategies. A health-economic model, created for the Initiative, analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the selected immunization strategies. Discussion, debate, and consensus were facilitated via a roundtable meeting, teleconferences and use of a closed, interactive website, allowing the participants to share data, knowledge, experience, and opinion. This article describes the processes undertaken to conduct the Initiative.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom ofinfection [^113DZpzS]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

B. pertussis develops its pathogenic effects via several toxins, which can be assumed to play a major role even in the development of angioedema. The most relevant toxin, Pertussis toxin, is a soluble exotoxin and is known to act systemically, leading to changes in G-protein mediated cellular responses. It has also been shown to increase vascular permeability and thereby induce oedema. Pertussis toxin results in vasodilatation by reducing the contractile properties of smooth muscle cells in resistance arteries, leading to oedema.

Pertussis toxin is also responsible for lymphocytosis, which was another systemic response to B. pertussis infection seen in our patient. While neutrophilia is common in cases of bacterial infection, lymphocytosis is characteristic for B. pertussis infection and can even be used as a prognostic marker for poor outcomes.

In adults, infection with B. pertussis is likely heavily underdiagnoseddue to a few reasons. First, the clinical presentation may be atypical. Second, there has been increasing evidence to suggest that acellular vaccines introduced in the 1990s only last for 4–12 years, which leaves adolescents and adults at risk of infection. For patients in the early disease stage, PCR is the diagnostic method of choice, after 3 weeks, serological diagnosis is recommended. PCR sensitivity is lower in adults compared with children. In our patient, 7–8 weeks after symptom onset, high titres of IgG and IgA antibodies to pertussis toxin were detected, which is highly sensitive and specific for a recent pertussis infection.

Antibiotic treatment effectively eliminates the bacteria and thereby reduces the risk of transmission. However, evidence suggests that it only affects the clinical course when given during the first week of infection. Even though the patient had been suffering from cough and angioedema for 7–8 weeks at the time of diagnosis, we still decided to prescribe antibiotic treatment due to the severity and duration of symptoms and the lack of other causal treatment options. It is possible that the clinical improvement was related to the initiation of antibiotic treatment, but may also represent the natural course of the disease with spontaneous improvement of symptoms.

To conclude, therapy-resistant angioedema and coughing for several weeks should prompt early testing for possible B. pertussis infection. In the clinical routine, the focus must be placed on achieving an early diagnosis and, above all, on disease prevention by vaccination.

PERTUSSIS VACCINE AND RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE

Outbreaks of pertussis were initially described in the 16th century with the bacteria isolated in 1906. While the combined whole‐cell pertussis and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTP) vaccine was licensed in 1914 and became available for routine infant immunization in 1948, the acellular pertussis and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTaP) vaccine was developed in 1992 and associated with less adverse events, replacing doses of the whole‐cell DTP vaccine in the United States in 1997. Today, all pertussis vaccines in the United States are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. The Tdap vaccine, formulated for adolescents and adults, contains reduced quantities of diphtheria toxoid and some pertussis antigens compared with DTaP.

The vaccine schedule approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends five doses of pertussis‐containing vaccines for children before 6 years of age. The first dose of DTaP is recommended at 2 months of age, followed by two additional doses, each separated by 2 months. Public health authorities may recommend immunization as early as 6 weeks of age with intervals as short as 4 weeks between the second and third doses during a community pertussis outbreak. The fourth dose is recommended at 15 through 18 months, and the fifth dose is advised at 4 through 6 years. The DTaP vaccine is available in combination with other recommended vaccines for the primary vaccination series. A booster dose is recommended for adolescents 11 years and older with Tdap. In the event of a pertussis infection, no interval between disease and immunization is needed, and the age‐appropriate doses should be given to complete the immunization series on schedule as the duration of immunity from infection remains uncertain. Tdap is also recommended during each pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation to maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant along with immunizing all close contacts in hopes of protecting young infants from pertussis, a strategy known as cocooning.

### Erythromycin (erythromycin ethylsuccinate) [^116PddVH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)

Lower-respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.

### Treatment of hemolytic uremic syndrome related to Bordetella pertussis infection-is plasma exchange or eculizumab use necessary? [^113s6Rqn]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Was our case an aHUS triggered by pertussis infection or a secondary TMA due to pertussis infection? It is very difficult to make a decision; however, we consider that this patient is more likely to have had a secondary TMA rather than an aHUS based on the following reasons. First, the HUS of our patient showed spontaneous remission without PE/PI or ECZ treatment. Second, a specific genetic mutation related to complement regulation was not identified. Third, past reports do not describe recurrent HUS after the first episode and our patient did not experience HUS recurrence within 3 years after achieving remission (Table 1).

B. pertussis infection-associated HUS was first reported by Berner et al. who suspected a patient of having a CFH mutation; the patient had a fatal outcome. Therefore, treatment with PI/PE or ECZ has been performed for most reported cases with B. pertussis -related HUS (Table 1). Hence, we are unsure whether these reported patients survived due to treatment-related benefits or due to spontaneous recovery. To our knowledge, ours is the first reported case of suspected aHUS to show a spontaneous recovery, suggesting that HUS secondary to a pertussis infection is actually a secondary TMA. If all patients with potential aHUS receive PI/PE or ECZ treatment, they would probably recover. However, such treatment may be unnecessary for patients with a secondary TMA. Regardless, according to a recent report, immediate (within 24–48 h) administration of ECZ is recommended, especially for pediatric patients suspected of having aHUS. A definite understanding of the clinical presentation of HUS following a pertussis infection, and the judicious use of ECZ, is necessary to avoid unnecessary treatment.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^111MxqzP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### Clinical and economic effects of pertussis outbreaks [^1176YBLP]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The reported incidence of pertussis is increasing, especially among the adolescent population. Current outbreak management strategies include investigating cases, contact follow-up, diagnostic testing, and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. The cost of these methods is substantial and can be attributed to the mobilization within public health departments to control the outbreaks.

Methods

Through an extensive review of the literature, the clinical and economic effects of pertussis outbreaks in various nonhousehold settings are discussed.

Results

The reported incidence of pertussis among adolescents and adults in the United States since the early 1980s continues to rise. The challenges of preventing and controlling pertussis outbreaks involve diagnosing pertussis in a timely, accurate, and standardized fashion and understanding the true burden of disease in different age and socioeconomic groups. The economic effects of pertussis have been demonstrated to be significant to individuals and communities, both locally and globally. Costs associated with pertussis often include diagnostic testing, hospitalization, emergency and/or medical office visits, antibiotic and symptomatic treatment, lost work days, and other reductions in productivity. In outbreak settings, increased surveillance, antibiotic prophylaxis, isolation of infected cases, and enhanced communication and education add to the economic burden of this disease. The potential opportunity to apply the use of pertussis booster vaccination to these populations, particularly among adolescents, likely would reduce the occurrence of pertussis and minimize the clinical and economic repercussions of pertussis outbreaks.

Conclusions

In the near future, it is anticipated that evaluating the effects of a licensed acellular pertussis booster vaccine in persons ≥ 10 years of age will become routine in pertussis prevention and outbreak-control activities.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

### Bordetella holmesii: an under-recognised Bordetella species [^117KSaSW]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Bordetella holmesii, first described in 1995, is believed to cause both invasive infections (bacteraemia, meningitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, pneumonia, and arthritis) and pertussis-like symptoms. Infection with B holmesii is frequently misidentified as being with B pertussis, the cause of whooping cough, because routine diagnostic tests for pertussis are not species-specific. In this Review, we summarise knowledge about B holmesii diagnosis and treatment, and assess research needs. Although no fatal cases of B holmesii have been reported, associated invasive infections can cause substantial morbidities, even in previously healthy individuals. Antimicrobial treatment can be problematic because B holmesii's susceptibility to macrolides (used empirically to treat B pertussis) and third-generation cephalosporins (often used to treat invasive infections) is lower than would be expected. B holmesii's adaptation to human beings is continuing, and virulence might increase, causing the need for better diagnostic assays and epidemiological surveillance.

### Erythromycin (Ery-tab) [^116wGgrZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.

Acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Erythrocin™ Lactobionate-I.V. (erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP) followed by erythromycin base orally, as an alternative drug in treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae in female patients with a history of sensitivity to penicillin. Patients should have a serologic test for syphilis before receiving erythromycin as treatment of gonorrhea and a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months.

Erythromycins are indicated for treatment of the following infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections during pregnancy. When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults due to Chlamydia trachomatis.

When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.

Primary syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum. Erythromycin (oral forms only) is an alternative choice of treatment for primary syphilis in patients allergic to the penicillins. In treatment of primary syphilis, spinal fluid should be examined before treatment and as part of the follow-up after therapy.

Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires' Disease.

### Erythromycin (erythromycin ethylsuccinate) [^111rY2GC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension may be administered without regard to meals.

Children:

Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. In mild to moderate infections, the usual dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate for children is 30 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 6 hours. For more severe infections this dosage may be doubled. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours.

The following dosage schedule is suggested for mild to moderate infections:

Adults:

400 mg erythromycin ethylsuccinate every 6 hours is the usual dose. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, one-half of the total daily dose may be given every 12 hours. Doses may also be given three times daily by administering one-third of the total daily dose every 8 hours.

For adult dosage calculation, use a ratio of 400 mg of erythromycin activity as the ethylsuccinate to 250 mg of erythromycin activity as the stearate, base or estolate.

In the treatment of streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of erythromycin ethylsuccinate should be administered for at least 10 days. In continuous prophylaxis against recurrences of streptococcal infections in persons with a history of rheumatic heart disease, the usual dosage is 400 mg twice a day.

For treatment of urethritis due to C. trachomatis or U. urealyticum: 800 mg three times a day for 7 days.

For treatment of primary syphilis: Adults: 48 g to 64 g given in divided doses over a period of 10 days to 15 days.

For intestinal amebiasis: Adults: 400 mg four times daily for 10 days to 14 days. Children: 30 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses for 10 days to 14 days.

For use in pertussis: Although optimal dosage and duration have not been established, doses of erythromycin utilized in reported clinical studies were 40 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day, given in divided doses for 5 days to 14 days.

For treatment of Legionnaires' Disease: Although optimal doses have not been established, doses utilized in reported clinical data were 1.6 g to 4 g daily in divided doses.

### Pertussis detection in children with cough of any duration [^113Q31bD]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Several findings of the current study were important for clinical practice: (a) laboratory confirmed pertussis can be present in children irrespective of cough duration; (b) children with pertussis with different cough durations have clinical features that are influenced by the child's age and immunization state; and(c) those with chronic cough have nonspecific cough, lacking characteristic symptoms. This may suggest that in the context of the likely underestimation of the burden of pertussis, the "one-size-fits-all" clinical pertussis case definition is no longer optimal to recognize this disease in a population and large comprehensive studies of children with all types of cough is required to confirm or refute our findings. This may make substantial inroads into increasing both the sensitivity and specificity in pertussis diagnosis, will impact public health.

This study also suggests that amoxicillin maybe an alternative for children with marolide-resistant B.pertussis infection. But these analysis were only based on the in vitro test, as the dose and course of treatment were not clear. Clinical studies should be designed and performed to confirm that this alternative drug could eliminate the bacteria in vivo effectively.

### Use of antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of pertussis [^111k9XHz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are commonly used for treating confirmed cases of pertussis and also for disease prevention in outbreak situations, and there is little evidence of antibiotic resistance of Bordetella pertussis. The most commonly used antibiotic is erythromycin, but the associated side effects limit compliance and therefore efficacy. Other antibiotics, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, have been shown to be at least as effective as erythromycin in preventing and treating pertussis, and they also have fewer side effects, which improves compliance. This article outlines the use of different antibiotics in pertussis management and their effect on preventing disease transmission and reducing disease severity and duration.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^112oJDTL]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a vaccine‐preventable respiratory disease with rising incidence due to declining vaccination rates and waning immunity. The most severe disease course is seen in unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants less than 2 months of age, accounting for the largest burden of hospitalization and death, but adolescents and adults play an important role in pertussis transmission and outbreaks. Prompt recognition and diagnosis remain critical for hospitalists in the management of pertussis disease and prevention.

### An observational study of severe pertussis in 100 infants ≤ 120 days of age [^113zuU3V]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis in young infants is a unique, severe, afebrile, cough illness that is frequently fatal.

Methods

All pertussis cases ≤ 120 days of age admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in California between October 1, 2013, and April 25, 2015, were evaluated.

Results

Of 100 pertussis patients ≤ 120 days of age admitted to pediatric intensive care unit, there were 5 deaths. The white blood cell counts in the fatal cases were significantly higher than in the nonfatal cases. Thirty-four percent of patients were intubated, 18% received inotropic and/or vasoactive support, 22% received steroid, 4% received extracorporal membrane oxygenation, and 3% underwent exchange blood transfusion. The median age at the time of illness onset in the patients who died was 23 days.

Conclusions

These data, as well as data from previous California studies, suggest updated strategies for the management of severe pertussis. These include perform serial white blood cell counts, treat all presumptive cases with azithromycin, evaluate for pulmonary hypertension, intubate and administer oxygen for apneic episodes and administer inotropic/vasoactive agents for cardiogenic shock. Do not administer steroids or nitric oxide. Criteria for exchange blood transfusion therapy for leukocytosis with lymphocytosis are suggested.

Pertussis prevention and exposure management in health care — more than one million adults and adolescents are estimated to contract pertussis annually in the United States, outbreaks have occurred in health care settings, and disease is spread avidly by droplets and direct contact. Tdap acellular pertussis vaccine for adults has been approved since 2005, has an efficacy ranging from 66–92%, and is recommended for health care workers. Following unprotected exposure, antibiotic prophylaxis is still recommended for vaccinees if they are likely to have contact with high-risk patients, e.g. neonates, immunocompromised patients or pregnant women, and exposed health care workers who work with high-risk patients should receive a macrolide antibiotic or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All exposed health care workers should undergo daily symptom monitoring for 21 days following exposure, with antibiotic treatment only if symptoms of pertussis develop.

CHEST guideline — adult clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough: For adult patients complaining of acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess for the 4 key characteristics of paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever in ruling in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis (Grade 2C). For adult patients complaining of acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature (Grade 2C), and we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is likely to be caused by pertussis if there is posttussive vomiting or is associated with an inspiratory whooping sound (Grade 2C). Fever is defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### Adults are whooping, but are internists listening? [^113cNkJb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although studies have shown that pertussis is responsible for approximately 20% to 30% of cases of cough lasting more than 2 weeks in adults and adolescents, physicians have generally considered pertussis a disease that affects only children. Epidemiologic trends demonstrate that the incidence of pertussis has been rising, especially in adolescents and adults. Consequently, pertussis is not a "zebra" diagnosis but deserves a place among the community-acquired list of adult pathogens. Increased awareness among physicians about pertussis is important because adults may transmit the infection to infants, in whom the disease often leads to hospitalization and may result in death. Reporting this disease to the local health department is critical to its control because both case-patients and their close contacts should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis. A booster vaccine for adolescents and adults is likely to become available in the near future, so this is an important time to ensure that all physicians, not just pediatricians, are knowledgeable about the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting requirements for pertussis.

### Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis) [^112sZv2S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is currently recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis, but is of uncertain benefit.

Objectives

To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2007); EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2007).

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of, and contact prophylaxis against, whooping cough.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three to four review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial.

Main Results

Thirteen trials with 2197 participants met the inclusion criteria: 11 trials investigated treatment regimens; 2 investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three to five days, or clarithromycin or erythromycin for seven days) were as effective as long-term (erythromycin for 10 to 14 days) in eradicating Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx (relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05), but had fewer side effects (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for seven days was also effective. Nor were there differences in clinical outcomes or microbiological relapse between short and long-term antibiotics. Contact prophylaxis of contacts older than six months of age with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases developing culture-positive B. pertussis.

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotics were effective in eliminating B. pertussis, they did not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^11742qQo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with pertussis from the family-centered residential facility until they have completed treatment and obtained written medical clearance from a licensed clinician. A person who has pertussis is contagious until they have completed 5 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Facilities do not need to restrict individuals who have received effective treatment but are still coughing. Cough may persist for many weeks after the illness.
During the initial routine screening process upon facility entry, screen family members and other close contacts of children who have respiratory symptoms. Infants and young children commonly acquire pertussis from a family member who has not yet sought medical care for their illness.
Restrict individuals who have been exposed to pertussis from the facility, even if they do not have symptoms of illness, until active infection has been ruled out and preventative antibiotics have been started. Preventative antibiotics are indicated even if exposed people are up to date on immunization. Written medical clearance from a licensed clinician is required for a person who has been exposed to pertussis to be allowed to enter the facility.
Individuals exposed to pertussis who refuse or are unable to take their prescribed antibiotics should be restricted from the facility for 21 days after last pertussis exposure, even if they do not have symptoms of illness. Require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician before allowing entry.
If a guest is suspected to have pertussis, notify the program manager immediately and refer them to get a medical evaluation by their primary care physician or a licensed clinician. The program manager should notify the local health department to help identify and notify exposed guests.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^111eT4Xm]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial respiratory disease that continues to infect individuals and cause deaths despite available vaccines. While there have been increases in case numbers every 2–5 years, 2024 proved to be a significant year in terms of both incidence and deaths from pertussis. Preliminary CDC data from 2025 shows a continuation of this trend with 8,472 pertussis cases through April — twice as many as the same time period in 2024. Given the high risk of severe disease and death among young infants and in un‐ or under‐vaccinated individuals, vaccination is a prevention strategy that remains a mainstay in protecting the most vulnerable.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^113NdPkM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The case definitions of pertussis delineated here should first be tested in clinical trials to determine their utility to the average clinician and then be compared with existing case definitions to determine whether they confer increased sensitivity and/or specificity. Although retrospective analyses are subject to bias, such analyses could be performed first in a "proof-of-principle" approach. If the new case definitions appear promising, a prospective study should be conducted to evaluate the proposed diagnostic criteria in the 3 different age categories (0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, ≥ 10 years).

The protocol we propose would involve the prospective evaluation of all persons in a defined population with cough illnesses of ≥ 7 days' duration stratified into the 3 different age categories. The study populations should include geographic regions with different vaccine usage patterns (acellular, whole-cell, or both). Protocols could be adopted from the Adult Pertussis Trial (APERT) and the vaccine efficacy trial in Erlangen, Germany. In both of these studies, investigators contacted participants every 2 weeks, and all subjects with cough illness of ≥ 7 days that was not improving were evaluated. Intensive education programs will be necessary to prevent observer bias. Studies should be of such duration that they cover the cyclical epidemiologic patterns of pertussis and include populations of sufficient size to allow statistical analysis.

The development and utilization of 3 age-related definitions for pertussis can be expected to increase both the sensitivity and specificity in its diagnosis, which will result in the recognition of pertussis in all age groups, potentially leading to better control of pertussis.

### The etiology of pneumonia in Zambian children: findings from the pneumonia etiology research for child health (PERCH) study [^117FHboN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Vaccine-preventable diseases (Haemophilus influenzae type b, vaccine-type S. pneumoniae, pertussis) were relatively rare among the PERCH cases (EF: 6.8, 95% CI: 0.02–14.4). Disease due to B. pertussis was infrequent (EF: 2.0%), presumably due in part to very high DTP vaccination rates (≈80%), but was more common in infants, an age group of higher pertussis mortality. Despite only a handful of children being fully immunized to PCV10 in Zambia, disease due to PCV10 serotypes of S. pneumoniae was infrequent (EF: 1.7%).

Potentially treatable causes for pneumonia comprised a large proportion of cases in Zambia. Six of the top 10 pathogens at our site (descending order — M. tuberculosis, E. coli, H. influenzae type b, Salmonella species, P. jirovecii and S. aureus) accounted for almost 40% of disease. Empiric antibiotic treatment, for commonly presenting bacterial pathogens, needs to be updated accordingly and guided by local antibiotic resistance patterns. Additional trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole coverage for P. jirovecii, particularly for under-1 children exposed to HIV, should also be emphasized in Zambia. Further efforts for detecting M. tuberculosis in all children presenting with pneumonia in Zambia should be considered.

Overall in-hospital mortality among HIV-exposed-uninfected children was nearly double that in HIV-unexposed-uninfected cases (22% vs. 11%, P < 0.001). This may be due to the lower viral etiology (EF: 30.3% HIV exposed vs. 53.2% HIV unexposed), and higher bacterial (S. aureus, Salmonella species and E. coli) causes, along with P. jirovecii, among the HIV-exposed children. In a nested substudy, we have previously shown that standardized empiric therapy for these HIV-exposed children improves outcome. P. jirovecii was somewhat common (EF: 4.5% in CXR+ cases) among this HIV-uninfected cohort reported here and was associated with high in-hospital mortality. However, most of the P. jirovecii was found in the HIV-exposed children (10.9% vs. 0.7% HIV unexposed).

### Erythromycin ethylsuccinate [^115ZfRq1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin ethylsuccinate and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin ethylsuccinate should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Erythromycin ethylsuccinate for oral suspension USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below:

Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved). (See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information.)

Lower-respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pneumonia or Streptococcus pyogenes.

Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.

Management of Health Care Personnel Exposed to Pertussis

Depending on the approach used, management of pertussis exposures in health care settings can be complicated, time-consuming, and costly. Exposed health care personnel with cough illness must be evaluated and might require diagnostic testing, administration of prophylactic antimicrobial agents, and possible exclusion from work. Several studies have shown that the costs of investigating pertussis outbreaks in the health care setting and implementing control measures are substantial. The cost of managing pertussis exposures in the health care setting over a 12-month period ranged from $84,000 to $98,000. The associated costs of dealing with hospital-based pertussis outbreaks ranged from $74,000 to $263,000. Since the promulgation of the 2005 Tdap recommendations for health care personnel, only one study has tried to determine whether it is necessary to give Tdap-vaccinated health care personnel postexposure antimicrobial prophylaxis, but the results were inconclusive due to the low risk for disease during the study period.

Guidance on Postexposure Prophylaxis for Health Care Personnel

Tdap vaccination status does not change the approach to evaluating postexposure prophylaxis when health care personnel are exposed to pertussis. Postexposure prophylaxis is recommended for health care personnel in contact with persons at risk for severe disease (e.g. hospitalized neonates, newborn infants, and patients with chronic respiratory conditions). Other health care personnel can either receive postexposure prophylaxis or be carefully monitored for 21 days after pertussis exposure. Health care personnel should be treated with antibiotics at the onset of signs and symptoms of pertussis, and excluded from work for the first 5 days while receiving appropriate antibiotics. Recommended antimicrobial agents for postexposure prophylaxis among health care personnel exposed to pertussis include azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Guidance on postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis is available at.

### Pertussis: a reemerging infection [^115q3NkG]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an acute respiratory tract infection that has increased in incidence in recent years. The initial catarrhal stage presents with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, rhinorrhea, sneezing, lacrimation, and mild cough. During the paroxysmal stage, severe outbreaks of coughing often lead to the classic high-pitched whooping sound patients make when gasping for breath. The paroxysmal stage is followed by the convalescent stage and resolution of symptoms. Complications vary by age, with infants more likely to experience severe complications such as apnea, pneumonia, seizures, or death. In adolescents and adults, complications are the result of chronic cough. The diagnosis depends on clinical signs and laboratory testing. Both culture and polymerase chain reaction testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis; serologic testing is not standardized or routinely recommended. Although antibiotics have not shown clear effectiveness in the treatment of pertussis, they eradicate nasal bacterial carriage and may reduce transmission rates. Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin are first-line treatments to prevent transmission; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an alternative in cases of allergy or intolerance to macrolides. Immunization against pertussis is essential for disease prevention. Current recommendations in the United States consist of administering five doses of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine to children before seven years of age, and administering a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster between 11 and 18 years of age. Recent efforts have focused on the vaccination of adolescents and adults, with new recommendations for a single dose of the Tdap booster if it has not been previously administered.

Key points
- Treatment within the first 1–2 weeks is most effective for reducing symptom severity.
- Healthcare providers should consider treating prior to test results if certain circumstances are present.
- Choosing the type of antibiotic to use may depend on a number of factors, including age and antibiotic resistance patterns.
- Find more information below about who to treat, when to treat, and antibiotic selection. Early treatment can reduce severity The earlier someone, especially an infant, starts treatment the better. If someone starts treatment during the first 1 to 2 weeks before coughing paroxysms occur, symptoms may be lessened. Antibiotics won't alter the course of the illness or prevent transmission if given later in the illness. Antibiotic choice The recommended antibiotics for treatment or postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis are
- Macrolides
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Important considerations Healthcare providers should choose an antibiotic after consideration that includes the
- Potential for adverse events and drug interactions
- Tolerability
- Ease of adherence to the regimen prescribed
- Recent travel to a country where macrolide resistance is common
- Cost. Treatment options vary by age Infants less than 1 month of age Use macrolides with caution. An association between orally administered erythromycin or azithromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been reported. However, azithromycin remains the drug of choice for treatment or prophylaxis of pertussis in very young infants. The risk of developing severe pertussis and life-threatening complications outweighs the potential risk of IHPS. Monitor infants < 1 month of age who receive a macrolide for the development of IHPS and for other serious adverse events.

People 1 month of age and older Macrolides are preferred for the treatment of pertussis. Azithromycin remains one of the recommended drugs for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of pertussis but consider using an alternative drug in those who have known cardiovascular disease, including: Patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias.

TREATMENT

Antibiotics, most specifically macrolides, have proven to be only helpful in improving symptoms if given before the onset of the paroxysmal cough (within the first 2 weeks of the illness) but are still recommended if diagnosed after this time period to eradicate bacteria from the nasopharynx to prevent spread of infection to others. Azithromycin is favored over erythromycin due to erythromycin's higher tendency to cause QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as, its association with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants. Azithromycin still has some association with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in those less than 1 month of age, but is less likely to cause it when compared to erythromycin. Azithromycin also requires a shorter antibiotic duration of 5 days along with daily dosing, allowing for better adherence and less risk of drug‐to‐drug interactions. There have been reports of macrolide‐resistant strains in China, where trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole has now become the preferred drug of choice. However, trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole should not be used in those less than 2 months of age. Other supportive methods have been used during hospitalizations with nasogastric feeding tubes for nutrition, supplemental oxygen, and aid in clearing sputum from the respiratory tract. The routine use of bronchodilators, steroids, and antitussives are not recommended.

Those with more severe courses (respiratory distress, apnea, inability to feed) who are admitted to the hospital may require additional imaging, such as an X‐ray of the chest or echocardiogram, to evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Pulmonary vasodilators have proven useful in treating pulmonary hypertension. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has not improved overall survival rates, potentially because of its late initiation when organ damage has already occurred. Lastly, plasma exchange transfusions or leukapheresis have been studied as possible treatment options in patients with a rapidly rising lymphocyte count to reduce lymphocyte aggregation in the small pulmonary vessels.

Postexposure prophylaxis with azithromycin is recommended for close contacts, including household contacts and childcare providers, within 21 days of exposure, regardless of immunization status. Prophylaxis with azithromycin should also be offered to contacts beyond the household who are at high risk or will have contact with someone who is at high risk for pertussis‐associated morbidity (e.g. infants < 12 months, pregnant women). Immunization with a pertussis‐containing vaccine is also recommended in those unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated who are exposed.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^1144dude]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Pertussis vaccine is recommended worldwide for infants and young children and recommended in many countries for adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and others; details are available at WHO websites [245, 286, 287].

In the United States, the ACIP recommends that every infant receive pertussis vaccine at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4–6 years. The Tdap vaccine is recommended at least once for every person age 11 or older; periodic Tdap boosters have been considered but not recommended due to rapid pertussis antibody waning and consequent poor cost-utility. However, ACIP has recently recommended that Tdap can be used whenever Td would be indicated, thus easing provider inventory management and permitting elective decennial Tdap boosting. More importantly, Tdap is also recommended during weeks 27–36 of every pregnancy. In 2016, the United Kingdom modified their maternal Tdap recommendation to include weeks 20–32 of pregancy; this has reduced the incidence of pertussis among premature infants, without adverse effect on protection of full-term infants [289]. Pertussis vaccine is contraindicated in persons with a history of anaphylaxis or encephalopathy after prior pertussis vaccine.

Recommendations are beneficial only if followed. Although antivaccine sentiments have circulated since the time of Jenner [290–291], the global increase in vaccine hesitancy or outright antivaccine activism in recent decades has proved challenging. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccines prevent far more mortality and morbidity than they cause, when people cannot personally see the benefits of vaccination (illnesses that did not happen, deaths that did not occur), they may see only risks, often exaggerated or invented [291]. Numerous studies have shown that avoidance of vaccination — typically, through personal belief or unwarranted medical exemptions from school-entry vaccination requirements — results in increased risk of disease, not merely for the un(under)-vaccinated child but also for persons whom that child exposes, persons who may have medical contraindications to vaccination, immune deficits that elevate their risk despite vaccination, or simply breakthrough disease despite vaccination [292–295].

Special Studies Using the EPS Platform

One of the hallmarks of the EIP infrastructure is the flexibility to add special studies. The EPS platform has served as a foundation for several key pertussis projects ranging from resource-intensive, case–control evaluations to activities considered "low-hanging fruit". Through EPS, it has been observed that ≈30% of pertussis hospitalizations are occurring in age groups other than infants and the elderly (EPS, unpub. data), prompting the question, why are older children and adults being hospitalized for pertussis? EPS investigators conduct expanded reviews of medical records of all hospitalized EPS case-patients. Data gathered enable characterization of the severity of infections in hospitalized patients across age groups, determination of reasons for hospital admission, documentation of underlying health conditions associated with severe illness, assessment of current practices in treatment, and outcomes of severe pertussis infection.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of E.E.S. and other antibacterial drugs, E.E.S. should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Pertussis incidence is likely to continue to increase in the United States. Prevention efforts should be focused on preventing severe disease and death from pertussis in young infants. The preferred strategy is vaccination of pregnant women during the third trimester of each pregnancy to provide placental transfer of maternal antibodies to the infant. Prenatal care providers are encouraged to provide Tdap to pregnant women (considered best practice) or refer patients to obtain vaccine from an alternative provider, such as a pharmacy or local public health department. Efforts should be made to eliminate barriers to receiving vaccines from prenatal care providers.

Very few mothers of infants with pertussis had received Tdap during pregnancy; many more were vaccinated after delivery, which does not confer any direct protection to the infant and is no longer a preferred strategy. Recently published data indicate that Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant women was only 19.5% in 2012 across California Vaccine Safety Datalink sites. Similarly, in a survey conducted at 100 birthing hospitals in California during October 2013, only 25% of new mothers reported receiving Tdap during pregnancy, whereas an additional 44% received Tdap in the hospital after delivery (CDPH, unpublished data, 2013). However, efforts to increase vaccine coverage have been successful among Northern California Kaiser patients, and in the third quarter of 2014, an estimated 84% of pregnant women received Tdap vaccine in their third trimester (T. Flanagan; Northern California Kaiser; personal communications; November 26, 2014).

Prenatal care providers should vaccinate all pregnant patients with Tdap during the third trimester of each pregnancy, ideally at 27–36 weeks' gestation, as is recommended by ACIP. If Tdap cannot be administered on-site during routine prenatal care visits, CDPH encourages prenatal care providers to take the following steps: 1) provide the patient with a strong recommendation and patient-specific prescription for Tdap; 2) refer the patient to specific alternative sites for vaccine, such as pharmacies, primary care providers, or local health departments; and 3) assess Tdap status at follow-up visits to confirm and record receipt of vaccine. In addition, timely initiation of the primary DTaP infant series is essential for reducing severe disease in young infants. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, DTaP can be administered to infants at an accelerated schedule, with the first dose administered as early as age 6 weeks, when pertussis is prevalent in the community. Even 1 dose of DTaP might offer some protection against serious pertussis disease in infants.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis prevents infection and/or complications of infection, and is a routine practice for defined procedures in the hospital. Emergency rooms and pediatric acute care facilities do not have automated procedures for antimicrobial prophylaxis in place. The responsibility thus falls on the physician caring for the child to appropriately prescribe antibiotics to prevent infection and complications of infection. Common indications for antimicrobial prophylaxis in the pediatric acute care setting include traumatic wounds, meningococcal exposures, pertussis exposures, and influenza exposures. For each of these indications, the assessment, management and disposition of pediatric patients are reviewed.

### Prevention of bacterial infections in the newborn by pre-delivery administration of azithromycin: study protocol of a randomized efficacy trial [^1165ytVP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The last decade witnessed a substantial reduction in the risk of under-five child mortality. However, the greatest reduction occurred in children older than 1 month. Neonatal deaths, estimated at approximately 4 million annually, now account for almost 40% of the world's deaths in children under-five with approximately 75% of these deaths occurring during the first week of life. The highest rates of mortality in this age group occur in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

Invasive bacterial disease, which mainly presents as sepsis, is estimated to cause one out of three deaths in this age group. In the African continent, neonatal sepsis is caused by a wide range of bacterial pathogens that differ between the early (first week of life) and late (days 8 to 28) neonatal period. During the early neonatal period, when most neonatal sepsis occur, gram positive bacteria predominate among sepsis case with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequently bacteria isolated, closely followed by group B Streptococcus (GBS).

Vertical transmission from the mother plays an important role in early neonatal sepsis. Newborns may be infected during labour as they pass through the birth canal, or during the first hours/days of life through close physical contact with the mother, if, as is commonly the case in SSA, the mother carries pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharyngeal tract or breast milk.

Azithromycin (AZI) is a macrolide with a wide antimicrobial spectrum; it is effective against organisms such as macrolide-susceptible Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species. AZI is currently licensed for use in infants aged > 6 months and is used to treat a wide range of infections, including those occurring during pregnancy. Data on the effect of treating pregnant women with up to 2 g of AZI for prevention of malaria and preterm birth are available. Although scarce information exists, AZI appears to be excreted in human milk at a very low concentration. According to a case report, an infant who is exclusively breastfed would receive approximately 1/10 or 1/20 of the dose recommended in infants ≥ 6 months old. Thus far, there are limited safety data on AZI in neonates. Two trials among hospitalized neonates (one including 111 low birth weight neonates admitted to hospital and the other involved 2400 infants including neonates) have not shown severe adverse reactions. In another published study, AZI was given to 58 newborns as prophylaxis for pertussis and only mild gastrointestinal adverse reactions were observed. No additional adverse events were observed in the same study among newborns from AZI treated mothers.

Key points
- The primary objective of postexposure prophylaxis is to prevent death and serious complications in people at high risk of severe pertussis infection.
- Public health professionals can help identify those who need PEP.
- Broader use of PEP may be reasonable in some settings. Use antibiotics only when necessary Inappropriate use of antibiotics is an important consideration. CDC advises healthcare providers to prescribe and people to use antibiotics only when necessary. This can help reduce antibiotic resistance and protect against potential antibiotic side effects. PEP use CDC supports providing PEP especially to Household contactsof a pertussis case People at high riskof developing severe pertussis infection Those who will have contactwith people at high risk of developing severe pertussis infection.

Broader use of PEP in some settings A broader use of PEP may be appropriate in limited closed settings when
- The number of identified cases is small and
- There isn't a community-wide outbreak. However, when continued transmission of pertussis is evident, multiple rounds of antibiotics wouldn't be recommended. Instead, healthcare providers should monitor people exposed to pertussis for onset of pertussis signs and symptoms for 21 days. During increased incidence and widespread community transmission Extensive contact tracing and widespread use of PEP among contacts may not be an effective use of limited public health resources. Antibiotics may prevent pertussis if given prior to symptom onset. However, there are no data to suggest widespread PEP use among contacts effectively controls or limits outbreaks.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^117R1TCx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the absence of systematic vaccination with pertussis vaccine, essentially every person will suffer whooping cough during infancy or childhood; many will suffer serious sequelae or die. No medical intervention is risk-free, but modern pertussis vaccines are both effective and safe — indeed, vastly safer than avoiding vaccination. Pertussis is an endemic and highly contagious disease; outbreaks will continue to occur. In an outbreak, vaccinated children are less likely to be infected; if infected, illness will be less severe [51–53, 332]. Unvaccinated children are at much higher risk of infection and, if infected, at much higher risk of adverse outcome. A number of approaches to new vaccines with more durable protection are under investigation.

### The prevalence and clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated pneumonia among infants in Botswana [^111XBB1M]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic treatment is indicated for all cases of pertussis, regardless of the clinical presentation or the severity of the illness. While treatment of pertussis early in the course of the disease is more likely to ameliorate symptoms than treatment later in the disease course, an additional benefit of treatment of pertussis disease is the reduction of person-to-person transmission. Interrupting transmission is an important public health benefit because there is high prevalence of subclinical or mild infections among household contacts of pertussis cases, which may play a critical role in the maintenance of ongoing transmission of pertussis.

Immunization against pertussis in pregnancy has been shown to decrease the risk of pertussis infection and the severity of pertussis disease among young infants. An additional benefit to pertussis immunization in pregnancy may be the prevention of illnesses that are not classically associated with pertussis. Given that pertussis vaccination in pregnancy is highly effective (~ 85% efficacy) in preventing pertussis disease among young infants, it is also reasonable to anticipate that the majority of pertussis-associated pneumonia cases in this study could have been prevented by pertussis immunization in pregnancy.

This study has a number of strengths. B. pertussis was tested for in a large number of infants with pneumonia in an African country with long-standing high uptake of the wP vaccine. The study was prospective and conducted over 5 years, thus minimizing the possibility that seasonal variation and the cyclical pattern of pertussis might influence the results. This study also has several important limitations. It was conducted at a single referral center and the results may not be generalizable to non-tertiary care centers. Furthermore, patients with more severe pneumonia may have died before admission to hospital, and consequently some cases of pertussis may have been missed. The small sample size of HIV-infected infants limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions about the prevalence of B. pertussis among infants with pneumonia in this population. Finally, the study did not include infants < 1 month of age, an age group that is highly susceptible to severe pertussis infection.

### Population-based study of pertussis incidence and risk factors among persons > 50 years of age, Australia [^113rzKAA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

From a public health standpoint, this study highlights the importance of pertussis prevention for Australians ≥ 50 years, especially among those with COPD or asthma, thus improving community awareness and uptake of immunization at age 50 and 65 years, which is currently suboptimal. An effective vaccination strategy is necessary to reduce complications and increased healthcare costs associated with pertussis among patients with COPD or asthma. For patients with COPD or asthma who have unrecognized or undiagnosed pertussis, inappropriately prescribed antibiotics may empirically treat pathogens causing other respiratory illnesses but delay the diagnosis and control of pertussis. Conversely, timely pertussis vaccinations can protect vaccinated persons against pertussis development and prevent community-level transmission. Other strategies include increasing pertussis testing by GPs to improve ascertainment of cases and ensure timely treatment.

Future studies might consider the effect of policy interventions on pertussis vaccination behavior, underuse of pertussis vaccines, and cost-effectiveness of potential new models of pertussis immunization programs to address policy gaps in the present program. In summary, a sizeable burden of pertussis in older adults in Australia has a greater impact on persons with COPD or asthma. This study highlights the importance of pertussis prevention for Australians ≥ 50 years of age.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zU7JA]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis-associated cough in adults — clinical feature-based diagnosis: For adult patients with acute cough (< 3 weeks in duration) or subacute cough (3–8 weeks), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever to help rule in or out a clinical diagnosis of pertussis; paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity and low specificity, whereas inspiratory whoop and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity but high specificity, and for adult patients with acute or subacute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough is unlikely to be due to pertussis if the patient has a fever or the cough is not paroxysmal in nature, with fever defined as any body temperature above the normal of 98.6°F (37°C).

### Pertussis vaccination of health care workers [^112xyyoT]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Pertussis vaccination of health care workers — prioritization, postexposure management, and coverage are described: The recommendation assigns the highest priority to health care workers who have contact with infants younger than 12 months and encourages health care institutions to utilize methods shown to maximize vaccination rates, namely education about the benefits of vaccination, convenient access, and the provision of Tdap to health care workers at no cost. A recent study based on 86 Tdap-vaccinated subjects exposed to pertussis over a 30-month period found that 98% of those who received antibiotic prophylaxis did not develop pertussis and, among those who received no antibiotic prophylaxis, 86% did not contract illness; of the seven subjects who met criteria for pertussis infection, one developed a cough illness. Based on the study outcome, ACIP recommends antibiotic postexposure prophylaxis for exposed health care workers likely to secondarily expose high-risk patients (eg, neonates, pregnant women), and health care workers without high-risk patient contact are recommended to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis or daily symptom monitoring for 21 days, with antibiotic treatment if symptoms of pertussis develop. Based on 2011 data, Tdap vaccination coverage among health care workers is 37%.

### Use of macrolides in mother and child and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: nationwide cohort study [^116vZ1ST]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications and conclusions

Whether an absolute risk increase of 24.4 cases of IHPS per 1000 infants exposed to macrolides within the first two weeks of life should prompt doctors to withhold the use of macrolides in infants of this age, depends on the indication for treatment. Pertussis infection in infants is associated with serious complications and is potentially fatal if untreated. In infants younger than 6 weeks, the macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin are the only treatment alternatives for pertussis according to recommendations from the UK Health Protection Agency and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; no other agents are recommended for this age group. It seems probable that the absolute excess risk of IHPS, a condition treatable by a relatively uncomplicated surgical procedure, is outweighed by the risks of pertussis left untreated. Conversely, if effective and safe treatment alternatives exist (for example, for other infections) or if a clear and pertinent indication for treatment is missing, macrolides are best avoided in young infants. Although the absolute risks for IHPS were smaller for maternal use of macrolides when the infant was less than 14 days old and for use in infants during days 14 to 120 after birth, they should still be considered when treatment decisions are made. Most studies, including ours, implicate erythromycin; however, no study has been able to rule out associations with other macrolide agents with certainty. Therefore, a cautious prescription practice acknowledging the possibility of a class effect seems warranted pending additional data.

### Efficacy and safety of clarithromycin versus erythromycin for the treatment of pertussis: a prospective, randomized, single blind trial [^111ujx2Q]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Pertussis is still a prevalent public health problem, and antibiotic therapy may decrease disease severity and limit communicability. Erythromycin is the recommended antibiotic for treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis; however, side effects of erythromycin limit its usefulness in some patients. Clarithromycin, a newer macrolide, has good in vitro activity against Bordetella pertussis and a better side effect profile.

Goals Of The Study

To compare the microbiologic and clinical efficacy and the clinical safety of a 7-day course of clarithromycin vs. a 14-day course of erythromycin in children with pertussis.

Design

Prospective, randomized, single blind (investigator), parallel group trial.

Methods

Children from 1 month to 16 years of age presenting with a clinically defined pertussis syndrome were eligible for the study. After obtaining informed written consent, we randomized patients to receive either clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg/dose twice a day for 7 days) or erythromycin (13.3 mg/kg/dose three times a day for 14 days). Nasopharyngeal cultures for B. pertussis were performed at enrollment and after end of treatment. Clinical assessments were performed at enrollment, at end of treatment and at a 1-month follow-up visit. Adverse event data were collected throughout the study.

Results

The clarithromycin (n = 76) and erythromycin (n = 77) groups were well-matched for age and previous pertussis immunization. Microbiologic eradication and clinical cure rates were 100% (31 of 31) for clarithromycin and 96% (22 of 23) for erythromycin. The clarithromycin group had significantly fewer adverse events [45% (34 of 76) for clarithromycin vs. 62% (48 of 77) for erythromycin; P = 0.035], and compliance with the medication regimen was significantly higher in these patients.

Conclusions

A 7-day regimen of clarithromycin and a 14-day course of erythromycin were equally effective for treatment of pertussis. Clarithromycin was better tolerated than conventional erythromycin therapy.

### Pertussis: review of epidemiology, diagnosis, management and prevention [^111neyS8]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Bordetella pertussis — the cause of pertussis or whooping cough — is an exclusively human pathogen. Disease elimination by vaccination should, therefore, be possible, but has proved elusive. Many industrialised countries with long established immunisation programs are currently seeing a resurgence of pertussis, despite universal vaccination with high uptake, with the highest burden in the least immunised age groups (infants under 6 months of age and persons over 10 years old). However, low recognition and reporting and insensitive diagnostic tests mean that the true burden of pertussis is still underestimated. Recently, efforts to improve diagnostic yield include the expanded use of polymerase chain reaction and serological tests but both have significant limitations. The range of antibiotics available for treatment and prophylaxis has expanded to include the newer macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and a range of universal and targeted vaccination strategies have been implemented or proposed. This paper reviews the current epidemiology of pertussis in developed countries, including modes of clinical presentation, diagnosis, management and potential vaccination strategies.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^1118n5ut]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — pertussis testing: "Clinicians May Obtain Testing for Pertussis in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Weak Recommendation)". Benefits include "Identify a potentially treatable infection", "Monitor for progression of symptoms, additional apneic episodes", and "Potentially prevent secondary spread and/or identify and treat additional cases", while harms/costs include "Cost of test", "Discomfort of nasopharyngeal swab", and the possibility that "Rapid testing not always available" and "False reassurance from negative results". The benefit–harm assessment states that "The benefits of identifying and treating pertussis and preventing apnea and secondary spread outweigh the cost, discomfort, and consequences of false test results and false reassurance; the benefits are greatest in at-risk populations (exposed, underimmunized, endemic, and during outbreaks)". Clinically, "Pertussis infection has been reported to cause ALTEs in infants… color change followed by respiratory pause", and such infants "can be afebrile and may not develop cough or lower respiratory symptoms for several days afterward". Testing decisions should consider "potential exposures, vaccine history… awareness of pertussis activity in the community, and turnaround time for tests". If available, "Polymerase chain reaction testing for pertussis on a nasopharyngeal specimen… offers the advantage of rapid turnaround time to results", while culture "will take days to yield results but may still be useful in the face of identified risk of exposure".

### What's old is new again: pertussis [^116Ld8xd]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of a vaccine, pertussis is a particularly difficult disease to control. Improvements in molecular diagnosis, changes in vaccine components, and missed opportunities for vaccination have resulted in rising pertussis disease incidence. Young infants are at the highest risk of severe complications and mortality, but immunization of mothers during pregnancy can provide protection. The presentation of infant pertussis differs somewhat from the traditional catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent stages seen in adults. By understanding the clinical presentation of pertussis in all age groups, providers can more quickly prescribe appropriate antibiotic therapy and postexposure prophylaxis. Providers are also an essential source of evidence-based vaccination counseling for pregnant women and families, and understanding the complications of this disease is an important part of these sometimes difficult but critical conversations.

### Uncomplicated acute bronchitis [^114fk38g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Acute bronchitis is an acute cough illness in otherwise healthy adults that usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. This review describes the pathophysiology of the condition and provides a practical approach to the evaluation and treatment of adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Practical points to be made are:1. Respiratory viruses appear to cause the large majority of cases of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.2. Pertussis infection is present in up to 10% to 20% of adults with cough illness of more than 2 to 3 weeks' duration. No clinical features distinguish pertussis from nonpertussis infection in adults who were immunized against pertussis as children.3. Transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness appears to be the predominant mechanism of the bothersome cough of acute bronchitis.4. Ruling out pneumonia is the primary objective in evaluating adults with acute cough illness in whom comorbid conditions and occult asthma are absent or unlikely. In the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate > 100 beats/min, respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min, and oral body temperature > 38 degrees C), the likelihood of pneumonia is very low.5. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials do not support routine antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.6. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that inhaled albuterol decreases the duration of cough in adults with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.7. Intervention studies suggest that antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis can be reduced by using a combination of patient and physician education. Decreased rates of antibiotic treatment are not associated with increased utilization, return visits, or dissatisfaction with care.

### Antibiotics for whooping cough (pertussis) [^1145XPWw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease. Infants are the population at highest risk of severe disease and death. Erythromycin for 14 days is recommended for treatment and contact prophylaxis but this regime is considered inconvenient and prolonged. The value of contact prophylaxis is uncertain.

Objectives

To study the benefits and risks of antibiotic treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004); MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2004); EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2003); conference abstracts and reference lists of articles were searched. Study investigators and pharmaceutical companies were approached for additional information (published or unpublished studies). There were no constraints based on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of and contact prophylaxis against whooping cough were included in the systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the quality of each trial.

Main Results

Twelve trials with 1,720 participants met the inclusion criteria. Ten trials investigated treatment regimens and two investigated prophylaxis regimens. The quality of the trials was variable. Results showed that short-term antibiotics (azithromycin for three days, clarithromycin for seven days, or erythromycin estolate for seven days) were equally effective with long-term antibiotic treatment (erythromycin estolate or erythromycin for 14 days) in the microbiological eradication of Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) from the nasopharynx. The relative risk (RR) was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.05). Side effects were fewer with short-term treatment (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). There were no differences in clinical improvement or microbiological relapse between short and long-term treatment regimens. Contact prophylaxis (of contacts older than six months of age) with antibiotics did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or the number of cases that developed culture positive B. pertussis.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics are effective in eliminating B. pertussis from patients with the disease, rendering them non-infectious, but do not alter the subsequent clinical course of the illness. Effective regimens include: three days of azithromycin, seven days of clarithromycin, seven or 14 days of erythromycin estolate, and 14 days of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Considering microbiological clearance and side effects, three days of azithromycin or seven days of clarithromycin are the best regimens. Seven days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also appeared to be effective for the eradication of B. pertussis from the nasopharynx and may serve as an alternative antibiotic treatment for patients who cannot tolerate a macrolide. There is insufficient evidence to determine the benefit of prophylactic treatment of pertussis contacts.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115JfKgH]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pertussis laboratory diagnosis and treatment context: There are several recognized laboratory methods to confirm a diagnosis of pertussis; culture (100% specific), polymerase chain reaction (88%-100% specific), serology (72%-100% specific), and oral fluid testing (91%-99% specific). There are several effective antibiotics; these eliminate B pertussis but do not alter the clinical course of the illness. However, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after onset of illness to prevent spread of the disease. The decision to treat with antibiotics is therefore frequently based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation.

### CDC releases guidelines on antimicrobial agents for the treatment… [^112s4tUL]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

The use of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents for postexposure prophylaxis eliminates Bordetella pertussis from the nasopharynx of infected persons. Early macrolide administration can reduce the duration and severity of symptoms and shorten the communicability period. Postexposure chemoprophylaxis can be given to asymptomatic contacts to prevent secondary cases, but symptomatic contacts should be treated as if they have pertussis. TREATMENT Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are preferred for the treatment of pertussis in persons one month and older. In thoses younger than one month, the use of erythromycin and clarithromycin is not recommended, and azithromycin is preferred. For patients two months and older, an alternative agent, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, is available.

When choosing an antimicrobial for treatment or prophylaxis, the following factors should be taken into account: effectiveness, safety, tolerability, ease of adherence, and cost. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are as effective as erythromycin for treatment of pertussis in patients six months and older. They also are better tolerated and are associated with fewer and milder side effects than erythromycin. However, erythromycin is available in generic form and is less expensive. Giving postexposure prophylaxis to asymptomatic household contacts within 21 days of the original patient's cough onset can prevent symptomatic infection. Symptomatic household members should be treated as if they have pertussis. Postexposure prophylaxis should be administered in infants younger than 12 months or women in the third trimester of pregnancy, because they are at risk for severe and possibly deadly complications.

The recommended antimicrobial agents and dosages for postexposure prophylaxis are the same as those for the treatment of pertussis. B. pertussis, their more convenient dosing, and their recognized safety and effectiveness in older children and adults. However, it should be noted that untreated infants with pertussis remain culture-positive for a longer duration than older children and adults. SAFETY A macrolide is contraindicated if there is a history of hypersensitivity. The common side effects of oral macrolides are gastrointestinal and rashes. Side effects are more common and severe with erythromycin therapy.

### Pertussis: what the pediatric infectious disease specialist should know [^114CbpV3]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Pertussis is a bacterial disease that is transmitted very efficiently from human to human by droplets. It occurs at any age, is endemic in any population, and can cause outbreaks in highly variable frequencies. Hallmark of the disease is cough with or without paroxysms, whoop, and vomiting. Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion followed by laboratory confirmation (PCR, Serology) and should be followed by prompt antibiotic treatment to stop spread of the bacteria to contact persons. Control of pertussis by acellular vaccines is possible to some extent if immunization coverage is high and booster doses are given lifelong. However new vaccines with higher efficacy rates are warranted.

### The burden of pertussis hospitalization in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed South African infants [^117TgNVo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation of the B. pertussis– Positive Cases

Forty-one of the 42 (95.1%) cases with B. pertussis –associated hospitalizations had a history of cough at admission, but only 8 (20.5%) reported a cough duration ≥ 14 days at enrollment. Furthermore, paroxysmal coughing spells were evident in 14 (33.3%) of the cases with B. pertussis– associated hospitalization. Twenty-eight (66.7%) of the cases were classified as severe illness using the MPS, while 16 (38.1%) fulfilled the CDC criteria of "confirmed cases" and 13 (30.1%) met the "probable pertussis" definition. Thirteen (30.1%) did not meet either the CDC "confirmed" or "probable" case definitions, including 1 participant who had no cough, other symptoms or culture attempted; 4 participants who had cough < 2 weeks, no other symptoms, and tested negative on culture; 1 who had cough > 2 weeks but no other symptoms and tested negative on culture; and 7 who had cough < 2 weeks, no other symptoms, and tested negative on culture.

The mean length of the pertussis-associated hospitalization was 5.6 days, and antibiotics were prescribed during admission to 36 (85.7%) cases, although only 14 (33.3%) received a macrolide. Ten of the 14 (71.4%) infants who received a macrolide as empiric treatment had a history of cough for ≥ 14 days (n = 4) or presence of a paroxysmal cough (n = 6). Four (9.5%) infants, all < 3 months of age (aged 4, 7, 7, and 8 weeks), were admitted to the intensive care unit, including 1 who required mechanical ventilation. Comparing the frequency of the clinical signs and symptoms associated with B. pertussis PCR positivity between HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants, there were no differences (Table 2).

### Azithromycin is as effective as and better tolerated than erythromycin estolate for the treatment of pertussis [^114mgK2x]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Although universal immunization against Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough) infection has resulted in dramatic reductions in the incidence of pertussis, outbreaks continue to occur in countries with excellent vaccine coverage. Treatment of infection may ameliorate symptom severity during the catarrhal phase of pertussis but has no effect on established paroxysms, emesis, or apnea if given during the paroxysmal or convalescent phases. Erythromycin, recommended for treatment of pertussis to prevent transmission of infection, is poorly tolerated because of gastrointestinal side effects. We compared the safety and efficacy of erythromycin with azithromycin for treatment of pertussis in a large, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled children from primary care practices in 1 American and 11 Canadian urban centers.

Methods

Children who were 6 months to 16 years of age and had cough illness that was suspected to be or was culture confirmed as pertussis were randomized to azithromycin (10 mg/kg on day 1 and 5 mg/kg on days 2–5 as a single dose) or erythromycin estolate (40 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 10 days) with stratification by center. The primary outcome measure was bacteriologic cure of infection as determined by cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates. Culture-positive participants had a second aspirate collected at the end of therapy (days 5–7 for azithromycin, days 10–12 for erythromycin) and 1 week after therapy. Bacteriologic cure was defined as negative cultures at the end of therapy. Bacteriologic relapse was defined as a positive culture 1 week after completion of therapy and after a negative end-of-therapy culture. Secondary outcomes were pertussis diagnosed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), treatment-associated adverse events, compliance, and presence of clinical symptoms at the end of the treatment course. Serology was performed using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. A participant was considered to have pertussis when the PCR was positive or a 4-fold increase in pertussis toxin antibody between baseline and follow-up visits was observed. PCR was performed using a 1046-bp ClaI DNA fragment from B pertussis. Adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, any gastrointestinal complaint, or other) were determined by a parent-completed diary that was reviewed with study personnel during study visits. Compliance was measured by review of the parent medication diary during study visits and observation of medication containers by the pharmacist at study completion. Symptoms were determined by history collected by study personnel at enrollment and subsequently from the diary. The design of the study was an equivalence trial, aimed at demonstrating that the bacteriologic failure rates with the 2 therapies did not differ by > 8%. For the safety analysis, all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included. In the per-protocol efficacy analysis, all culture-positive participants with end-of-treatment cultures were considered.

Results

A total of 477 children were enrolled and randomly assigned to either azithromycin (n = 239) or erythromycin (n = 238). Of these children, 114 (24%) grew B pertussis from nasopharyngeal specimens (azithromycin group: 58 of 239 [24%]; erythromycin group: 56 of 238 [23%]); these children composed the efficacy cohort for the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses. Serology and PCR added 52 children to the number considered to have pertussis for a total of 35% (166 of 477) of all children who presented with cough illness. In the safety analysis (antibiotic side effects, compliance) and comparison of cough symptoms after treatment, all randomized children are reported in their assigned treatment group. At end of therapy, bacterial eradication was demonstrated in all 53 patients in the azithromycin group and all 53 patients in the erythromycin group with follow-up cultures available (eradication 100%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.3–100). No bacterial recurrence was demonstrated in children with 1 week posttreatment nasopharyngeal cultures available (51 and 53 participants in the azithromycin and erythromycin arms, respectively [0%, 95% CI: 0–7.0; and 0%, 95% CI: 0–6.7]). No serious adverse events attributable to study drug were observed. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported less frequently in azithromycin (18.8%; 45 of 239) than in erythromycin estolate (41.2%; 98 of 238) recipients (90% CI on difference: -29.0% to -15.7%) as a result of less nausea (2.9% vs 8.4%; 95% CI: -8.9% to -2.0%), less vomiting (5.0% vs 13.0%; 95% CI: -4.9% to -1.4%), and less diarrhea (7.1% vs 11.8%; 95% CI: -9.0% to -0.3%). Children who were randomized to azithromycin were much more likely to have complied with antimicrobial therapy over the treatment period. In the azithromycin group, 90% of children took 100% of prescribed doses, whereas only 55% of children in the erythromycin group took 100% of prescribed doses.

Conclusions

In this large, multicenter, randomized trial, we found that azithromycin is as effective as erythromycin estolate for the treatment of pertussis in children. Gastrointestinal adverse events were much more common with erythromycin treatment than azithromycin. Compliance with therapy was markedly better with azithromycin than with erythromycin in this study.

### Does this coughing adolescent or adult patient have pertussis? [^111yJXpL]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Pertussis is often overlooked as a cause of chronic cough, especially in adolescents and adults. Several symptoms are classically thought to be suggestive of pertussis, but the diagnostic value of each of them is uncertain.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence regarding the diagnostic value of 3 classically described symptoms of pertussis: paroxysmal cough, posttussive emesis, and inspiratory whoop.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

We searched MEDLINE (January 1966-April 2010), EMBASE (January 1969 to April 2010), and the bibliographies of pertinent articles to identify relevant English-language studies. Articles were selected that included children older than 5 years, adolescents, or adults and confirmed the diagnosis of pertussis among patients with cough illness (of any duration) with an a priori-defined accepted reference standard. Two authors independently extracted data from articles that met selection criteria and resolved any discrepancies by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Five prospective studies met inclusion criteria; 3 were used in the analysis. Presence of posttussive emesis (summary likelihood ratio [LR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–2.2) or inspiratory whoop (summary LR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6) increases the likelihood of pertussis. Absence of paroxysmal cough (summary LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.0) or posttussive emesis (summary LR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44–0.77) reduced the likelihood. Absence of inspiratory whoop was less useful (summary LR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66–0.93). No studies evaluated combinations of findings.

Conclusions

In a nonoutbreak setting, data to determine the diagnostic usefulness of symptoms classically associated with pertussis are limited and of relatively weak quality. The presence or absence of posttussive emesis or inspiratory whoop modestly change the likelihood of pertussis; therefore, clinicians must use their overall clinical impression to decide about additional testing or empirical treatment.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112AmyVT]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — pediatric clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough: For children complaining of acute cough (< 4 weeks in duration), we suggest that clinicians should specifically assess for the 3 classical characteristics of paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whooping (Ungraded consensus-based statement). For children complaining of acute cough, we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough could be caused by pertussis if there is posttussive vomiting (Grade 2C), and we suggest that clinicians consider that the cough could be caused by pertussis if there is paroxysmal cough or inspiratory whooping (Ungraded consensus-based statement).

### Pertussis immunization in the global pertussis initiative European region: recommended strategies and implementation considerations [^116ZHj6s]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Approaches to pertussis diagnosis, surveillance and immunization vary widely across Europe. Nonetheless most countries report high levels of vaccine coverage in infants and toddlers, and significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality have been achieved. As a consequence of the effective protection of infants and toddlers, the absolute incidence of pertussis has substantially decreased, but the relative proportion of older age groups, adolescents and adults in particular, has increased. These groups, however, are a relevant source of infection of unimmunized or incompletely immunized infants. In addition to efficient childhood vaccination, other approaches to pertussis immunization are required. Among the various strategies evaluated, 3 were recommended by the European participants in the Global Pertussis Initiative that might be adapted to each country's specific needs: the reinforcement of implementation of current schedules, the addition of an extra dose of vaccine to current immunization schedules and the selective immunization of health care workers, which is already included in a European Commission directive. The main barriers to the acceptance of these strategies are low awareness of pertussis in immunized populations, poor recognition of the disease in adults and adolescents, lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and poor access to laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. These obstacles have led to underreporting of pertussis and an underestimation of the disease burden. Actions to overcome these issues are crucial to the implementation of new or improved immunization strategies to combat pertussis in Europe.

### Clinical definitions of pertussis: summary of a global pertussis initiative roundtable meeting, February 2011 [^112enVt3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Existing clinical case definitions of pertussis are decades old and based largely on clinical presentation in infants and children, yet an increasing burden is borne by adolescents and adults who may manifest distinct signs/symptoms. Therefore, a "one-size-fits-all" clinical case definition is no longer appropriate. Seeking to improve pertussis diagnosis, the Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) developed an algorithm that delineates the signs/symptoms of pertussis most common to 3 age groups: 0–3 months, 4 months to 9 years, and ≥ 10 years. These case definitions are based on clinical presentation alone, but do include recommendations on laboratory diagnostics. Until pertussis can be accurately diagnosed, its burden will remain underestimated, making the introduction of epidemiologically appropriate preventive strategies difficult. The proposed definitions are intended to be widely applicable and to encourage the expanded use of laboratory diagnostics. Determination of their utility and their sensitivity and/or specificity versus existing case definitions is required.

### Empirical or susceptibility-guided treatment forinfection? A comprehensive review [^117BxQUV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the effectiveness of susceptibility-guided strategy for third-line treatment?

It has been frequently recommended that performing culture at first-line treatment or after a first eradication failure may not be necessary and therefore assessing H. pylori sensitivity to antibiotics in clinical practice may be suggested only after failure of the second treatment. However, previous meta-analyses could not find any RCT comparing cure rates of susceptibility-guided therapies versus those of empirical third-line therapy. In our updated meta-analysis, only two studies including at least third-line rescue regimens were identified, and similar efficacy results were found between both tailored and empirical strategies.

The aim of a recent systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of susceptibility-guided therapy as third-line therapy (without comparing it with empirical treatment). Four observational studies were included (no comparative studies were found), and the pooled mean eradication rate with susceptibility-guided therapy was only 72%. Therefore, the authors concluded that susceptibility-guided therapy may be an acceptable option as rescue treatment, but cure rates are, at best, moderate; therefore, the evidence in favor of susceptibility-guided therapy as rescue therapy is currently insufficient to recommend its use.

### Pertussis infection in critically ill infants: meta-analysis and validation of a mortality score [^117UYSuc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis and cohort study highlight the severity of severe pertussis infection in infants and identify key risk factors for mortality. We propose a simple bedside-based mortality risk score based on WBC > 30 G/L, age < 30 days, and tachycardia > 200/min. While promising, this score requires further external validation and real-world testing.

### Antibiotic treatment of pertussis: are 7 days really sufficient? [^11766cTS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Short courses of antibiotic therapy are recommended for treatment of pertussis. We report 2 young unvaccinated infants with persistently positive Bordetella pertussis by polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal swabs despite 7 days of clarithromycin (15mg/kg/d) therapy. In 1 patient, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was 7.02 (log GEq/mL) at the onset of treatment, 6.26 at the end of treatment and remained positive with 2.64 and 2.69 during and after a second 7-day course, respectively. The generally believed assumption that contagiousness of pertussis is terminated after 5 days of antibiotic treatment should be challenged, at least in young infants.

Rationale for Recommendations

In 2013, ACIP did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap; the rationale was described in previously published guidance. In 2019, ACIP again concluded that in light of the higher cost of Tdap relative to Td and uncertainty about the impact that receipt of multiple Tdap doses would have on pertussis control and transmission, there continues to be insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend that Tdap replace Td. However, given the reassuring safety profile and evidence of widespread use of Tdap in place of Td, to allow providers more flexibility, either Tdap or Td was recommended for use in situations when previously only Td was recommended. ACIP recommends that either Td or Tdap be used for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and for additional required doses in the catch-up immunization schedule if a person has received at least 1 Tdap dose.
