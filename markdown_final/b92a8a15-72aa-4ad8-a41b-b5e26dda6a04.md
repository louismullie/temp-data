## Question

can risperidone cause brain fog in combination with invega?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether risperidone can cause brain fog when used in combination with Invega (paliperidone). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacological relationship between risperidone and paliperidone. Then, I should verify the cognitive and sedative adverse-effect profiles for each agent. Next, I will define "brain fog" in clinical terms and map it to known drug effects. After that, I should examine regulatory and pharmacokinetic evidence about concomitant use and additive exposure. Finally, I will synthesize a risk assessment and offer practical recommendations for switching, overlap, and monitoring, making sure I double-check any specific rate claims along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology, because that frames everything else. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, and both exert antipsychotic activity primarily via dopamine D2 and serotonin 5‑HT2A receptor antagonism, with additional α1/α2-adrenergic and H1-histaminergic antagonism for paliperidone; importantly, paliperidone has no muscarinic affinity, which matters when I consider anticholinergic cognitive effects later [^111pa9NN] [^112Xgsap].

> I should now review the cognitive adverse-effect profile for paliperidone specifically. The FDA labeling repeatedly warns about the potential for cognitive and motor impairment, including somnolence and impaired judgment or thinking, and advises caution with activities requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery, which directly corresponds to patient-reported "brain fog" experiences [^111ZgmCQ] [^115xujTr]. These warnings are reiterated for the long-acting paliperidone palmitate product (Invega Trinza), highlighting somnolence, sedation, and dizziness as adverse reactions and the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, again reinforcing the link to cognitive clouding in routine use [^113MTw1k] [^113mueJL].

> Next, I will examine risperidone's cognitive signal, and I need to be careful to separate disease-related cognitive deficits from drug effects. In dementia populations, the CATIE-AD analysis found that cognitive function declined more in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, than in those receiving placebo over 36 weeks, which supports a potential for medication-related cognitive worsening in susceptible groups, though confounding by indication and illness severity should be considered [^111ksZgB]. Mechanistically, dopaminergic antagonism can slow processing speed and attention even in healthy volunteers, which provides a plausible pathway by which D2 blockade contributes to subjective "brain fog" during treatment initiation and steady-state dosing [^11128kny].

> Hold on, before I equate "brain fog" with a single adverse event, I should define it clinically and ensure it maps to labeled effects. Patients use "brain fog" to describe reduced alertness, slowed thinking and processing speed, impaired concentration and working memory, and mental fatigue, which aligns with labeled somnolence and impaired judgment/thinking for paliperidone and the broader dopaminergic antagonism literature showing slowed processing and attentional deficits under antidopaminergic exposure [^111ZgmCQ] [^115xujTr] [^11128kny].

> I will now examine concomitant use and additive exposure warnings, because this is the crux of the combination question. The FDA explicitly states that since paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when Invega (or Invega Trinza) is coadministered with risperidone for extended periods, noting limited safety data and the need to consider additive paliperidone exposure if the two are used together, which directly supports a pharmacologically predictable increase in the same active moiety with combined therapy [^112bXfpe] [^112bXfpe].

> Wait, I need to check the pharmacokinetic logic for why overlap could magnify cognitive adverse effects. Oral risperidone is hepatically converted to 9‑hydroxy‑risperidone (paliperidone), while paliperidone itself is largely renally eliminated and not extensively metabolized; with the long-acting paliperidone palmitate formulations, apparent median half-lives range from roughly 84 to 139 days, so any overlap can raise cumulative paliperidone exposure and increase D2/H1/α1 receptor occupancy over time, plausibly amplifying sedation and cognitive clouding without unique therapeutic benefit beyond one agent alone [^111A4JdE] [^115RfHEW] [^112Xgsap].

> But wait, what if anticholinergic mechanisms were driving "brain fog" here; do I need to consider that pathway too. Paliperidone has no muscarinic activity, making direct anticholinergic cognitive toxicity less likely from paliperidone itself, although additive anticholinergic burden from other co‑prescribed agents (e.g., antiparkinsonian drugs, antidepressants) is a well‑documented contributor to impaired cognition in psychosis and could worsen perceived brain fog if present, which I should remember to screen and deprescribe when possible [^111pa9NN] [^116oZ5JB].

> Let me synthesize the answer clearly now. Yes, using risperidone in combination with Invega (paliperidone) meaningfully increases the risk of "brain fog", because it produces additive exposure to the same active moiety and therefore higher net D2 antagonism and H1/α1 contributions to somnolence and cognitive slowing, a risk pattern that FDA labeling anticipates and cautions against with combined use of risperidone and paliperidone [^112bXfpe] [^111ZgmCQ]. The clinical phenotype of brain fog maps directly to labeled warnings for paliperidone about impaired judgment, thinking, and somnolence, and is biologically plausible through dose‑dependent dopaminergic blockade effects on processing speed and attention, with additional sedation from histaminergic and adrenergic antagonism [^115tXEsv] [^115xujTr] [^11128kny].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I previously thought somnolence rates of 14% were a paliperidone figure; I should double‑check that. The 14% somnolence rate is a ziprasidone statistic, not paliperidone, so I should not ascribe that number to paliperidone; instead, I will stick to the paliperidone labels' qualitative warnings about somnolence and cognitive/motor impairment, which remain clinically relevant and reinforce caution with combined exposure despite variable numeric rates across formulations and trials [^113SmSpE] [^113mueJL] [^115tXEsv].

> Next, I should review practical clinical guidance, because risk management hinges on switching tactics and monitoring. Routine long‑term coadministration of risperidone with paliperidone lacks therapeutic rationale and is discouraged due to additive paliperidone exposure and limited safety data, whereas brief, minimal overlap may be justified only during a planned switch, with efforts to minimize duration and dose stacking, especially when transitioning to long‑acting paliperidone given its long terminal half‑life and prolonged tail [^111ZgmCQ] [^115RfHEW]. If overlap occurs, I need to monitor for excessive sedation, cognitive slowing affecting daily function, orthostatic hypotension, and falls, and I should counsel patients to avoid driving or hazardous tasks until they are clearly stable without impairment, consistent with labeling precautions for paliperidone products [^113MTw1k] [^115xujTr].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure no loose ends remain. The combination of risperidone and Invega exposes patients to the same active entity via two routes, raising receptor occupancy and the likelihood of dose‑related cognitive and sedative adverse effects that patients experience as "brain fog", and regulators advise caution for exactly this scenario, so the conservative and mechanistically sound approach is to avoid chronic coadministration, limit overlap during switching, and actively monitor cognition and alertness if any combined exposure cannot be avoided during transition [^112bXfpe] [^111ZgmCQ] [^115tXEsv].

Yes, risperidone can cause brain fog when combined with Invega because both share the same active metabolite, paliperidone [^112bXfpe], leading to **additive exposure** [^111ZgmCQ] and a higher risk of cognitive impairment [^113MTw1k]. This combination is **not recommended** due to limited safety data and the potential for **cumulative cognitive effects** [^115tXEsv]. If co-administration is necessary, use the lowest effective doses, monitor closely for cognitive symptoms [^113mueJL], and consider alternative antipsychotics to reduce cognitive burden [^113FZFnZ].

## Pharmacological relationship between risperidone and invega

Regarding the **metabolic pathway**, risperidone is metabolized to paliperidone — the active ingredient in Invega [^111pa9NN] — so co-administration increases paliperidone exposure [^112bXfpe]. The shared **receptor profile** includes antagonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors, as well as histamine H1 and alpha-adrenergic blockade, which can contribute to sedation and cognitive impairment [^112Xgsap].

---

## Evidence of cognitive impairment with risperidone and invega

**Risperidone** is associated with cognitive impairment — including attention, memory, and executive function deficits — especially at higher doses or with prolonged use [^111ksZgB]. **Invega** is linked to cognitive impairment [^113MTw1k], somnolence, and sedation, which can present as brain fog [^113mueJL].

---

## Additive cognitive effects of combined risperidone and invega

**Additive exposure** occurs with combined risperidone and Invega because co-administration increases paliperidone levels [^112bXfpe], raising the risk of cognitive impairment and sedation [^113MTw1k]. There are **limited safety data**, so caution is advised [^111ZgmCQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

It is advisable to **avoid combination**; concomitant use is not recommended due to limited safety data and an increased risk of cognitive impairment. If used together, **monitor closely** for cognitive impairment [^113mueJL], sedation, and other adverse effects [^111ZgmCQ].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing cognitive impairment

- **Age**: Older adults are more susceptible to cognitive impairment from antipsychotics [^1114KKbZ].

- **Renal function**: Impaired renal function increases paliperidone exposure and cognitive risk [^111A4JdE] [^111ZgmCQ].

- **Dose and duration**: Higher doses and longer use increase cognitive impairment risk [^11487oUs].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Dose adjustment**: Use the lowest effective doses to minimize cognitive impairment [^112bXfpe].

- **Alternative medications**: Consider antipsychotics with lower cognitive impairment risk [^113FZFnZ].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor cognitive function and adjust treatment as needed [^113mueJL].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Risperidone and Invega share the same active metabolite; therefore, **co-administration increases paliperidone exposure** [^112bXfpe] and the risk of cognitive impairment, including brain fog [^113MTw1k]. This combination is **not recommended** due to limited safety data and the potential for additive cognitive effects. If used together, **monitor closely** [^113mueJL] and consider alternatives to minimize cognitive impairment [^113FZFnZ].

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^115npb9r]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

In subgroup analyses, we observed that patients with normal BMI, those without active endocrine diseases at baseline, and those who are male and White may appear to benefit more from risperidone treatment, demonstrating statistically significant interactions with treatment effects, although the effect size is small. These findings suggest that certain patient characteristics, possibly reflecting underlying pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, might influence how effectively risperidone can reduce psychosis, aggression, and anxiety/phobias.

Risperidone primarily acts via dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, with moderate affinity for α1-adrenergic and H1 receptors. It is primarily metabolized by the hepatic enzyme cytochrome (CYP) 2D6 into its active metabolite, 9-hydroxy-risperidone, which shares similar pharmacological properties with risperidone itself. Both compounds are predominantly eliminated through renal excretion.

The identified treatment modifiers — sex, BMI, endocrine status, and race/ethnicity — are consistent with previous evidence suggesting these factors may influence pharmacokinetics (e.g. altered drug distribution, CYP activity, or plasma protein binding, P-glycoprotein function) or pharmacodynamics (e.g. variations in receptor D2 and 5-HT2A genes, different receptor affinity) of risperidone. However, they only partially explain the observed variability as the precise relationship between risperidone plasma concentration and clinical outcomes remains uncertain and may not follow a simple linear pattern.

In this comparison, pooled estimates for all outcomes of interest were compared across the three data sources (CSR, trial registry, and journal publication) to assess for consistency. The pooled effects from each data source were then compared using the 'ratio of relative risks' or 'ratio of means' to observe for statistical differences. For the primary efficacy outcome (PANSS), IPD-MAs effect sizes were included also in the ratio of mean comparisons. In total, sixty-one possible outcome-specific meta-analysis comparisons were made, enabling comparisons of the pooled effects from the different data sources.

Aggregate data from CSRs, journal publication, and registry reports were meta-analyzed using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects. For continuous outcomes, standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated using Hedges' g and interpreted according to Cohen's criteria. Hartung-Knapp confidence intervals were used to account for uncertainty in the variance estimate. For dichotomous outcomes (including AEs), effects were assessed by pooling the relative risk (RR). Effect estimates were pooled across trials using Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect or inverse-variance random-effects meta-analysis, depending upon the number of studies reporting the outcome of interest. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, pooling the relative difference instead of RR for rare events. For studies reporting single or double zero events in one or both treatment groups, we used the 'exact' fixed-effect meta-analysis method for pooling the effects.

Safety narratives were also obtained from clinical study reports to contextualize the quantitative findings.

### Invega [^115xujTr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe INVEGA®:

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, particularly at the time of initiating treatment, re-initiating treatment, or increasing the dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Interference with cognitive and motor performance**: Since INVEGA® has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that INVEGA® therapy does not affect them adversely [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Pregnancy**: Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with INVEGA® [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Nursing**: Caution should be exercised when INVEGA® is administered to a nursing woman. The known benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the unknown risks of infant exposure to paliperidone [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

- **Concomitant medication**: Patients should inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a potential for interactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Alcohol**: Patients should avoid alcohol while taking INVEGA® [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Heat exposure and dehydration**: Patients should be advised regarding appropriate measures to prevent heat exposure and dehydration.

### Cognitive effects of atypical antipsychotic medications in patients with Alzheimer's disease: Outcomes from CATIE-AD [^111ksZgB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to assess the impact of the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone on cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The authors evaluated the effects of time and treatment on neuropsychological functioning during the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease study (CATIE-AD).

- **Method**: CATIE-AD included 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and either psychosis or agitated/aggressive behavior, randomly assigned to receive a masked, flexible-dose of olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. Based on clinicians' judgment, patients could discontinue their originally assigned medication and receive another randomly assigned medication. Patients were followed for 36 weeks, with cognitive assessments obtained at baseline and at 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Outcomes were analyzed for 357 patients with data available for at least one cognitive measure at baseline and one follow-up assessment after being on their prescribed medication or placebo for at least 2 weeks.

- **Results**: Overall, patients exhibited steady, significant declines over time in most cognitive areas. This included decreases in scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; -2.4 points over 36 weeks) and the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (-4.4 points). Cognitive function declined more in patients receiving antipsychotics than in those given placebo on multiple cognitive measures, including the MMSE and the cognitive subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.

**Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, have been observed in patients treated with risperidone and paliperidone. INVEGA® (paliperidone) is a metabolite of risperidone and is therefore contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to either paliperidone or risperidone, or to any of the excipients in INVEGA®. Known hypersensitivity to paliperidone, risperidone, or to any components in the formulation.

### Cognitive functioning and acute sedative effects of risperidone and quetiapine in patients with stable bipolar I disorder: a randomized, double-blind, crossover study [^115xVVGL]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medications differ in their sedative potential, which can affect cognitive performance. The primary objective of this double-blind study was to compare the effects of treatment initiation with risperidone and quetiapine on cognitive function in subjects with stable bipolar disorder.

Subjects had a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder in partial or full remission and a Young Mania Rating Scale score ≤ 8 at screening. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences: risperidone-quetiapine or quetiapine-risperidone. Subjects in the risperidone-quetiapine sequence received 2 mg of risperidone with dinner and placebo with breakfast during period 1 and 100 mg of quetiapine with dinner and 100 mg with breakfast during period 2. Subjects in the quetiapine-risperidone sequence received the same treatments in reverse order. The two treatment periods were separated by a 6- to 14-day washout period.

Cognitive function, including attention, working memory, declarative memory, processing speed, and executive functions, was measured before and after dosing. The Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue was also completed. The primary endpoint was a neurocognitive composite score (NCS). The study was conducted from November 2004 through August 2005.

Thirty subjects were randomly assigned; 28 took all doses of study medication and completed a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment in each treatment. On the NCS, significantly better overall cognitive function was seen after risperidone than after quetiapine at each time point after administration.

### Risperidone for the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia [^115FVkCF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Risperidone offers physicians the unique combination of extensive published clinical experience and a good safety profile for treating patients with dementia who have symptoms of aggression, agitation, and psychosis. Numerous open-label and, more recently, placebo-controlled trials have documented the efficacy of risperidone in the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. These trials also show that risperidone is better tolerated than conventional neuroleptic agents. Comparatively, patients treated with risperidone experience substantially fewer side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms, cognitive toxicity, and tardive dyskinesia.

### First- and second-generation antipsychotic medication and cognitive processing in schizophrenia [^111xinze]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia has consistently been characterized by deficits in the cognitive domains of executive function, working memory, attention, and episodic memory. While some cognitive abnormalities, such as motor slowing, may be associated with antipsychotic medication administration, the cognitive deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia can generally be attributed at least in part to the disease process.

Modulation of the dopamine neurotransmitter system, notably through D2 receptor blockade, has been linked with reductions in psychotic symptoms and improvements in cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia. Although first-generation antipsychotic medications were initially thought not to result in cognitive improvement, recent studies comparing second-generation antipsychotics to low doses of first-generation antipsychotic medication have shown cognitive benefits for first-generation drugs, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as those after treatment with second-generation medication. Cognitive improvement associated with the administration of antipsychotic medication may reflect improvements in general cortical information processing.

Recent work has demonstrated that specific genetic polymorphisms may interact with antipsychotic medication treatment to influence the degree of cognitive improvement following treatment. Notably, the catechol-O-methyltransferase val108/158met polymorphism has been shown to predict working memory improvement after the administration of antipsychotic medication to patients with schizophrenia.

### Invega Trinza [^1114KKbZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Studies in specific populations with INVEGA TRINZA are lacking, as no pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in these groups. The available information is derived from studies on oral paliperidone or population pharmacokinetic modeling of both oral paliperidone and INVEGA TRINZA. Paliperidone exposure in specific populations, such as those with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and in the elderly, is summarized [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

After oral administration of paliperidone in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the plasma concentrations of free paliperidone were comparable to those in healthy subjects. However, total paliperidone exposure decreased due to a reduction in protein binding. Paliperidone has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

In elderly subjects, after oral administration of paliperidone, the Cmax and AUC increased 1.2-fold compared to younger subjects, though age-related decreases in creatinine clearance may occur [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Based on in vitro studies using human liver enzymes, paliperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A2, suggesting smoking should not impact its pharmacokinetics. Slower absorption was observed in females in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. At apparent steady-state with INVEGA TRINZA, the trough concentrations were similar between the groups examined.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^117Y47TH]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly prevalent and debilitating severe mental illnesses worldwide. Patients often experience both simultaneously because they share a similar causative process of diagnoses.

Risperidone is a leading second-generation antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents and for the short-term treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. It is indexed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines. However, the manufacturers 'Johnson & Johnson' have been involved in over 13,500 legal cases due to their failure to disclose that risperidone may cause hormonal imbalances that could lead to breast tissue development ('gynecomastia') and increased blood prolactin levels ('galactorrhoea hyperprolactinaemia') in boys and girls. There have also been 'black box warnings' about misleading marketing of the drug for off-label uses in children and adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and in elderly patients with dementia. Moreover, the clinical benefit of risperidone is questionable when compared to other antipsychotics and was recently found to be only the sixth best treatment option for overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia.

Paliperidone is another second-generation antipsychotic drug also manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and used to treat schizophrenia. As both risperidone and paliperidone act via the same pathways in the body, research has suggested strong links of drug-induced hormonal

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^113avEts]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Using individual participant data (IPD) from the drug manufacturer, we found that risperidone and paliperidone lead to small clinical improvements in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, which are more conservative compared to those of previous studies based on publicly available data. Clinical study reports (CSRs) also contained a significantly greater volume of major harms compared to journal articles and trial registry reports. Our findings clearly support the use of IPD and CSRs for accurately assessing the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic drug interventions. More informed guidance is needed to encourage researchers to access and analyze these data sources efficiently for this type of in-depth analysis.

### Invega [^111A4JdE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Absorption and distribution**: The absolute oral bioavailability of paliperidone following INVEGA® administration is 28%. Administration of a 12 mg paliperidone extended-release tablet to healthy ambulatory subjects with a standard high-fat/high-caloric meal resulted in mean Cmax and AUC values of paliperidone that were increased by 60% and 54%, respectively, compared with administration under fasting conditions. Clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of INVEGA® were carried out in subjects without regard to the timing of meals. While INVEGA® can be taken without regard to food, the presence of food at the time of INVEGA® administration may increase exposure to paliperidone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Based on a population analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of paliperidone is 487 L. The plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%.

- **Metabolism and elimination**: Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of paliperidone, in vivo results indicate that these isozymes play a limited role in the overall elimination of paliperidone [see Drug Interactions (7)]. One week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release 14C-paliperidone to 5 healthy volunteers, 59% (range 51%–67%) of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, 32% (26%–41%) of the dose was recovered as metabolites, and 6%–12% of the dose was not recovered. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and 11% in the feces.

Four primary metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo.

### One-year double-blind study of the neurocognitive efficacy of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol in schizophrenia [^114Z4wcz]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

Neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia can reach 1 to 2 standard deviations below healthy controls. The comparative effect of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications on neurocognition is controversial and is primarily based on studies with small samples and large doses of typical comparator medications. The present study assessed neurocognitive efficacy. It was hypothesized that olanzapine treatment would improve neurocognitive deficits to a greater degree than either risperidone or haloperidol treatment.

This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel study with neurocognition assessed at baseline, and at 8, 24, and 52 weeks. Per protocol, the haloperidol arm was discontinued. Four hundred and fourteen inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were treated with oral olanzapine (n = 159), risperidone (n = 158), or haloperidol (n = 97).

- **Individual domains**: Executive function, learning and memory, processing speed, attention/vigilance, verbal working memory, verbal fluency, motor function, and visuospatial ability were transformed into composite scores and compared between treatment groups. At the 52-week endpoint, neurocognition significantly improved in each group (p < 0.01 for olanzapine and risperidone, p = 0.04 for haloperidol), with no significant differences between groups. Olanzapine- and risperidone-treated patients significantly (p < 0.05) improved on domains of executive function, learning/memory, processing speed, attention/vigilance, verbal working memory, and motor functions.

### Antipsychotic medication and cognitive function in schizophrenia [^112udfbW]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic polypharmacy and excessive dosing still prevail worldwide in the treatment of schizophrenia, while their possible association with cognitive function has not been well examined. We examined whether the "non-standard" use of antipsychotics (defined as antipsychotic polypharmacy or dosage > 1,000 mg/day of chlorpromazine equivalents) is associated with cognitive function. Furthermore, we compared cognitive function between patients taking only atypical antipsychotics and those taking only conventional antipsychotics. Neurocognitive functions were assessed in 67 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 92 controls using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and the Advanced Trail Making Test (ATMT). Patients showed markedly poorer performance than controls on all these tests. Patients on non-standard antipsychotic medication demonstrated poorer performance than those on standard medication on visual memory, delayed recall, performance IQ, and executive function. Patients taking atypical antipsychotics showed better performance than those taking conventional antipsychotics on visual memory, delayed recall, and executive function. Clinical characteristics such as duration of medication, number of hospitalizations, and concomitant antiparkinsonian drugs were different between the treatment groups (both dichotomies of standard/non-standard and conventional/atypical). These results provide evidence for an association between antipsychotic medication and cognitive function. This association between antipsychotic use and cognitive outcomes underscores the need for careful prescription practices in the management of schizophrenia.

### Galantamine augmentation of long-acting injectable risperidone for cognitive impairments in chronic schizophrenia [^115Q5FQA]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

Galantamine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor with effects on nicotinic receptors, has shown mixed effects on cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia. Given these mixed results, we examined whether galantamine, compared to an adjunctive placebo, may improve cognitive functions in patients treated concomitantly with a long-acting atypical antipsychotic.

- **Method**: The parent study was a 52-week double-blind, randomized study of treatment with long-acting injectable risperidone, 25mg or 50mg every two weeks. Adjunctive galantamine or placebo treatment was administered from Month 6 to 12. Outcome measures were neurocognitive, psychopathology, social, and quality of life functions. Patients were randomized to blinded galantamine up to 24mg/day or matching placebo tablets. All patients were maintained on their randomized long-acting injectable risperidone regimen for the duration of the trial.

- **Results**: Thirty-two patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. No statistically significant differences were found for attention vigilance, declarative memory, processing speed, reasoning/problem solving, working memory domains, and the neurocognitive composite score. Group-specific analysis showed a statistically significant group interaction (p = 0.043) with the social cognition domain showing the galantamine group had significantly lower scores at endpoint than placebo patients. The PANSS general psychopathology subscale showed significantly higher scores in the galantamine group at endpoint (p = 0.05). An ANCOVA model for within-treatment group comparisons showed a significant interaction.

### Dose reduction of risperidone and olanzapine can improve cognitive function and negative symptoms in stable schizophrenic patients: A single-blinded, 52-week, randomized controlled study [^11487oUs]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). High credibility.

The long-term effects of dose reduction of atypical antipsychotics on cognitive function and symptomatology in stable patients with schizophrenia remain unclear. We sought to determine the change in cognitive function and symptomatology after reducing risperidone or olanzapine dosage in stable schizophrenic patients.

- **Methods**: Seventy-five stabilized schizophrenic patients prescribed risperidone (≥ 4 mg/day) or olanzapine (≥ 10 mg/day) were randomly divided into a dose-reduction group (n = 37) and a maintenance group (n = 38). For the dose-reduction group, the dose of antipsychotics was reduced by 50%; for the maintenance group, the dose remained unchanged throughout the whole study. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Negative Symptom Assessment-16, Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Side Effects, and Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery were measured at baseline, 12, 28, and 52 weeks. Linear mixed models were performed to compare the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Negative Symptom Assessment-16, Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Side Effects, and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery scores between groups.

- **Results**: The linear mixed model showed significant time by group interactions on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale negative symptoms, Negative Symptom Assessment-16, Rating Scale for Extrapyramidal Side Effects, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, and total score of MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (all p < 0.05). Post hoc analyses showed significant improvement.

### Cognitive function and variability in antipsychotic drug-naive patients with first-episode psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111RpnJP]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Cognitive impairment plays a significant role in clinical outcomes and functional levels in individuals with psychotic disorders. These impairments are evident even at the onset of psychosis at a group level. However, the heterogeneity in cognitive function among patients has not been systematically investigated. The objective of this study was to provide an updated quantification of cognitive impairment at psychosis onset before patients receive potentially confounding antipsychotic treatments and to investigate variability in cognitive function compared with healthy controls.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed articles were searched up to September 15, 2022. Original studies reporting data on cognitive function in antipsychotic drug-naive patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) were included. Data were independently extracted by two researchers. Cognitive tasks were clustered according to six domains of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery and the domain of executive function. Random-effects model meta-analyses of mean differences and coefficient of variation ratios (CVRs) were performed, as well as meta-regressions, assessments of study quality, and publication bias.

The main outcome measure was Hedges' g for mean differences in cognition and CVR for within-group variability. Fifty studies were included in the analysis with a total of 2625 individuals with FEP.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^111TsPte]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Our most notable finding was the inconsistencies in the reporting of harms between CSRs and journal publications. CSRs provided over double the number of adverse events (AEs) and almost eight times more serious adverse events (SAEs), showing a significant increase in the relative differences favoring CSRs. The effect estimates from CSRs, which involved more patients and studies, revealed an increased risk in the number of AEs and elevated risks for other harms such as 'extrapyramidal disorder', 'tardive dyskinesia', and 'weight increased'.

Limited outcome data were available for 'gynecomastia' and 'cerebrovascular events'. As these are very rare events with considerable delayed onset in younger children, it is likely that they are not well-documented in these short-term randomized trials of only 63 days follow-up. Therefore, we recommend that both antipsychotics are administered with caution to children and adolescents until more solid evidence about the risks of hormonal imbalances and infertility is available from trials with long-term follow-up data.

The combination of individual participant data (IPD) and the corresponding CSR is the most comprehensive and trustworthy source of Johnson & Johnson trial evidence available at the time of writing. However, a significant limitation of this study is that we were unable to access all company data and CSRs for 22 further eligible trials, which meant that this review was not entirely systematic and may be subject to selection bias. We made several requests for CSRs for Paliperidone trials at the European Medicines Agency, but one ongoing court case meant that they were unable to provide access to the CSR for several studies.

### Alzheimer disease: Treatment of cognitive and functional symptoms [^117HxWTY]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, specifically concerning antipsychotics, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend offering risperidone for the acute management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with dementia.

### Cognitive function and variability in antipsychotic drug-naive patients with first-episode psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Bw52c]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis identified cognitive dysfunction already present at the onset of psychotic illness and before the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. For the first time, to our knowledge, the study revealed higher variability between individuals with first-episode psychosis compared with controls. These results highlight the importance of cognitive assessments in clinical practice to identify individuals at risk for poor functional outcomes and to select individuals for cognitive remediation as part of a precision medicine approach.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^1116if5q]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Among risperidone users, we found that achieving early therapeutic response or improvement at week 2 significantly predicted subsequent response at weeks 4 and 8 in both total and individual symptom scores. This finding aligns with a previous study on Alzheimer's disease patients treated with antipsychotics, which reported that symptom improvements observed at week 2 were associated with treatment outcomes at week 8. Clinically, evaluating response at week 2 could inform decisions about continuing antipsychotic treatment, helping to minimize associated risks. However, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) may also be influenced by non-pharmacological factors, such as addressing unmet needs or environmental triggers, which were not mentioned in the trial protocol.

Higher baseline cognitive function (higher MMSE scores) was modestly linked to improvements in most BEHAVE-AD subscales, but was paradoxically associated with slightly worse outcomes in psychosis and anxiety/phobia symptoms. These mixed findings reflect the complex and sometimes contradictory relationship between cognitive impairment and BPSD. Although some studies have reported that psychosis was associated with worsening cognitive function, others have shown minimal or even slight improvement. Given the modest associations observed, further research is needed to clarify whether baseline cognition can inform treatment decisions and optimize the benefit-risk balance.

The concomitant use of anxiolytics during the trials predicted higher overall symptom scores, possibly due to greater baseline symptom severity. However, this combination should be cautiously avoided.

### Towards enhancing drug development methodology to treat cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions: Insights from 2 decades of clinical trials [^114ijNaM]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

If, as described above, a monotherapy treatment demonstrates short-term clinical efficacy, including cognitive benefit, and acceptable safety/tolerability across placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 trials with acute patients, the value of placebo-controlled trials with stable patients is uncertain, as are the conceptual and ethical considerations associated with requiring placebo in stable patients. A placebo-controlled monotherapy study of stable patients would require a washout from prior stability-inducing treatments. There is a greater than 2-fold increase in risk of relapse among placebo-treated patients (35%) with schizophrenia compared to antipsychotic-treated patients (14%) over 3 months; symptom relapses or even associated symptom increases/fluctuations in a placebo group would add noise and jeopardize cognitive data quality. Furthermore, the high relapse risk will likely contribute to reluctance in treatment providers, family members, and patients to participate given the major psychosocial disruption and potential neurotoxic impact associated with relapse.

An alternative to these clinical, ethical, and scientific risks would be a superiority design with an active comparator drug known to be cognitively neutral based on previous large-scale evidence, such as the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial, wherein several different medications were found to have minimal cognitive benefits or liabilities (e.g. olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone).

### Invega [^115tXEsv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis**: In clinical trials and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported in temporal relation to antipsychotic agents, including Invega. Agranulocytosis has also been noted. Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include a pre-existing low white blood cell (WBC) count and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of clinically significant low WBC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should undergo frequent complete blood count (CBC) monitoring during the initial months of therapy. Discontinuation of Invega should be considered at the first indication of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be closely monitored for fever or other signs of infection and should receive prompt treatment if such symptoms occur. Severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm) necessitates discontinuing Invega, with WBC followed until recovery.

- **Cognitive and motor impairment**: Somnolence has been reported in subjects treated with Invega. Antipsychotics, including Invega, have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that paliperidone therapy does not adversely affect these abilities.

### Antipsychotic drugs and cognitive function: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113FZFnZ]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Cognitive deficits are a substantial part of the symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and contribute heavily to the burden of disease. Antipsychotic drugs are not cognitive enhancers, but due to their different receptor-binding profiles, they could differ in their effects on cognition. No previous network meta-analysis compared antipsychotics to placebo, which is important to determine whether use of these drugs is associated with cognitive performance in SSDs at all.

- **Objective**: To determine the association of treatment with various antipsychotics and cognition in patients with SSDs.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Schizophrenia Trials Register through June 25, 2023.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials examining the effects on cognition of antipsychotic drugs or placebo in participants with SSD.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: A systematic review and random-effects frequentist network meta-analysis was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Network Meta-Analysis reporting guideline.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was change in overall cognition score calculated for each study. Secondary outcomes included cognitive domains, quality of life, and functioning.

- **Results**: This study included 68 studies involving 9,525 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.1 [8.9] years; 5,878 male [70%] and 2,890 [30%] female; some studies did not provide this information). There were few clear differences between antipsychotics, but first-generation dopamine antagonists such as haloperidol showed noteworthy findings.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^1157JAFB]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

This study adds to existing evidence supporting the effectiveness of risperidone in managing psychosis, aggression, and possibly anxiety in people with dementia. Developing a data-driven prediction model to identify patients most likely to benefit or experience harm could substantially improve clinical decision-making, support personalized BPSD management, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that well-designed prediction models of antipsychotic use in people with schizophrenia can assist clinicians in personalizing treatment, optimizing therapeutic effectiveness, and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects.

Subgroups that may influence treatment response — possibly due to risperidone's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics — were identified, and these hypotheses should be tested to enable clinically meaningful interpretation. Finally, early response at week 2 was strongly associated with achieving response at weeks 4 and 8, suggesting that early treatment evaluation could help guide more informed clinical decisions.

### Treatment of cognitive impairment in early psychosis: a comparison of risperidone and haloperidol in a large long-term trial [^115VAJ5C]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). High credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a major determinant of functional outcome in schizophrenia. Treating cognitive impairment at the time of the first episode may have the potential to change the functional outcomes of the illness. This study examined changes associated with treatment with risperidone compared with haloperidol in aspects of cognitive functioning known to be associated with functional outcomes. The study was conducted in a large group of patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia.

Cognitive assessments were conducted in 533 patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia or a related psychosis who had been randomly assigned to receive low doses of risperidone or haloperidol. The cognitive assessments were repeated at several different follow-up intervals, and 359 patients were reexamined at the 3-month follow-up. The assessments included examinations of verbal and visuospatial episodic memory, vigilance, executive functioning, processing speed, and verbal fluency. Patients' clinical symptoms were also rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.

Improvements from baseline were found in the risperidone-treated patients for episodic memory, verbal fluency, vigilance, executive functioning, and visuomotor speed. Haloperidol-treated patients also showed improvements from baseline in episodic memory, vigilance, and visuomotor speed, but not in executive functioning or verbal fluency. Comparison of differential treatment effects on a composite measure of cognitive functioning found that risperidone was significantly more effective.

### Meta-analysis of cognitive performance in drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia [^1166NTBk]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Cognitive deficits represent a significant characteristic of schizophrenia. However, a majority of the clinical studies have been conducted in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Thus, it remains unclear if significant cognitive impairments exist in the absence of medication. This is the first meta-analysis of cognitive findings in drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive data from 23 studies encompassing 1,106 patients and 1,385 controls published from 1992 to 2013 were included. Tests were ordered largely in cognitive domains according to the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) battery.

Analysis was performed with STATA using the random-effects model, and heterogeneity as well as Egger's publication bias was assessed. Overall, the results show that patients performed worse than healthy controls in all cognitive domains with medium to large effect sizes. Verbal memory, speed of processing, and working memory were three of the domains with the greatest impairments. The pattern of results aligns with previous meta-analytic findings in antipsychotic-treated patients. The present meta-analysis confirms the existence of significant cognitive impairments at the early stage of the illness in the absence of antipsychotic medication.

### Cognitive and functional effects of atypical antipsychotic medications [^112TVfed]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Several meta-analyses, along with some direct comparative studies of atypical antipsychotics, indicate that these medications may be more effective than conventional antipsychotic medications at enhancing cognition. However, differences between studies exist; for instance, short-term studies of cognitive enhancement may not provide results similar to those of long-term studies. Comparative studies are superior to meta-analyses in this regard. Direct measurement of changes in functional capacity may be a desirable feature of such studies. The population studied, including the treatment the subjects receive, is likely to have a substantial impact on the results. Additionally, cognitive enhancement is not a stand-alone phenomenon. Depression and negative symptoms, for example, also affect individuals with schizophrenia and their functioning in the real world, in contrast to within clinical studies.

### A randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation and long-acting injectable risperidone following a first episode of schizophrenia: Improving cognition and work/school functioning [^113NqL7p]. Psychological Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Cognitive deficits at the first episode of schizophrenia are predictive of functional outcomes. Interventions that improve cognitive functioning early in schizophrenia are critical if we hope to prevent or limit long-term disability in this disorder.

- **Methods**: We completed a 12-month randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation and long-acting injectable (LAI) risperidone with 60 patients who had recently experienced a first episode of schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation involved programs focused on basic cognitive processes as well as more complex, life-like situations. Healthy behavior training of equal treatment time was the comparison group for cognitive remediation, while oral risperidone was the comparator for LAI risperidone in a 2 × 2 design. All patients were provided supported employment/education to encourage their return to work or school.

- **Results**: Both antipsychotic medication adherence and cognitive remediation contributed to cognitive improvement. Cognitive remediation was superior to healthy behavior training in the LAI medication condition but not in the oral medication condition. Cognitive remediation was also superior when medication adherence and protocol completion were covaried. Both LAI antipsychotic medication and cognitive remediation led to significantly greater improvement in work/school functioning. Effect sizes were larger than in most prior studies of first-episode patients. Additionally, cognitive improvement was significantly correlated with work/school functional improvement.

- **Conclusions**: These results indicate that consistent antipsychotic medication and cognitive remediation are effective in improving cognitive and functional outcomes in patients following a first episode of schizophrenia.

### Effects of antipsychotic treatment on cognition in healthy subjects [^11128kny]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). High credibility.

Cognitive impairments are observed in the majority of diseases with disturbed dopamine transmission. They are considered core symptoms of schizophrenia, where they appear to be particularly pronounced. The neurobiological background is not yet sufficiently investigated, but dopaminergic systems are believed to play a crucial role.

The aim of this single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was to examine the effects of subchronic antidopaminergic treatment on cognitive functions in healthy subjects. A total of 72 healthy volunteers, randomized into four groups, received one antidopaminergic substance (aripiprazole, haloperidol, or reserpine) or placebo for 7 days. A comprehensive neurocognitive assessment was conducted at baseline, 24 hours after the last medication intake, and 7 days later.

In the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a distinct, statistically significant improvement was measured in the second session in the placebo group but not in the medication group. A significant group*time interaction for reaction times in three subtests of the Test Battery for Attentional Performance (TAP) was also found. Our findings indicate that the modulation of dopaminergic systems primarily affects the speed of information processing, attention, and learning. The absence of effects on other functions, differing from previous reports, may be an expression of sufficient counter-regulation.

### Invega [^111pa9NN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown. It has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Paliperidone is a centrally active dopamine Type 2 (D2) antagonist with predominant serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) activity. It is also active as an antagonist at α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone has no affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and (-)- paliperidone enantiomers is qualitatively and quantitatively similar in vitro.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Following a single dose, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone gradually rise to reach peak plasma concentration (Cmax) approximately 24 hours after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following Invega® administration are dose-proportional within the available dose range. The terminal elimination half-life of paliperidone is approximately 23 hours. Steady-state concentrations of paliperidone are attained within 4–5 days of dosing with Invega® in most subjects. The mean steady-state peak:trough ratio for an Invega® dose of 9 mg was 1.7, with a range of 1.2–3.1.

Following administration of Invega®, the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone…

### Studies of cognitive change in patients with schizophrenia following novel antipsychotic treatment [^113HpTjZ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Novel antipsychotic medications have been reported to have beneficial effects on cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia. However, these effects have been assessed in studies with considerable variation in methodology. Numerous investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored clinical trials are currently underway to determine the effect of various novel antipsychotics on cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. The ability to discriminate between high- and low-quality studies will be required to understand the true implications of these studies and their relevance to clinical practice.

This article addresses several aspects of research on cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia, emphasizing how the assessment of cognitive function in clinical trials requires certain standards of study design to lead to interpretable results. Novel antipsychotic medications appear to have preliminary promise for the enhancement of cognitive functioning; however, the methodology for assessing the treatment of cognitive deficits is still being developed.

Researchers and clinicians alike need to approach publications in this area with a watchful eye toward methodological weaknesses that limit the interpretability of findings.

### Towards enhancing drug development methodology to treat cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions: Insights from 2 decades of clinical trials [^114eHm8y]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a pervasive feature of schizophrenia, significantly impacting patients' functional outcomes and quality of life. A similar profile of functionally disabling cognitive impairment extends to other neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD), even during euthymic states and in unimpaired relatives. Despite its well-established functional consequences, pharmacological treatments targeting cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) and other neuropsychiatric disorders remain elusive, as there are no regulatory agency-approved therapies to treat CIAS.

Over the past two decades, substantial efforts have been made to develop novel treatments. The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative represents a landmark achievement in this endeavor. Through consensus-building among diverse stakeholders, which included representatives from academia, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), MATRICS laid the groundwork for standardized assessment methodologies and clinical trial designs. However, the translation of these efforts into effective treatments has met with numerous challenges, including operational complexities, scientific and conceptual uncertainties, and replication failures in later-stage trials.

In this article, we review lessons learned from conducting industry-sponsored clinical trials for CIAS and other neuropsychiatric disorders, and relevant scientific findings.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^115kxHcy]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

- **Predictors of therapeutic response**: Table 2 presents the results of the multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression examining predictors of therapeutic response. No statistically significant factor was found in models including only baseline variables. Models with treatment-emergent variables showed that early response at week 2 was strongly associated with achieving therapeutic response at both week 4 (OR: 9.04; 95% CI: 6.10–13.39) and week 8 (OR: 4.46; 95% CI: 3.01–6.61). A sensitivity analysis using Dataset B, which included additional adjustment for comorbidities, shared consistent results. No other predictors were found to be significantly associated with therapeutic response.

- **Predictors of symptom improvement**: Table 3 presents the statistically significant results of the linear mixed-effects regression models, including treatment-emergent factors, for the BEHAVE-AD total score and its subscales at week 8. Across all models, early score reduction at week 2 was consistently associated with lower symptom scores after 8 weeks. A unit increase in the baseline MMSE score was modestly associated with greater reductions in the BEHAVE-AD total score, aggression, and activity disturbances, but associated with increased psychosis and anxiety/phobia scores. In the BEHAVE-AD total score model, concomitant use of anxiolytics was associated with higher scores (SMD: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.05–0.41).

### A double-blind study of combination of clozapine with risperidone in patients with schizophrenia: effects on cognition [^111qNqHH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotic drugs produce improvement in some domains of cognition as well as psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. However, the effect of combinations of atypical antipsychotic drugs on cognitive function is unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of risperidone or placebo on cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia who were previously treated with clozapine monotherapy.

- **Method**: This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week study included 30 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia. Patients whose psychopathology was no more than partially responsive to clozapine treatment were randomly assigned to receive adjunctive treatment with risperidone (N = 16) up to 6 mg/day or placebo (N = 14). Cognitive test scores for verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency, attention, executive function, verbal working memory, and motor function were the primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures included assessment of psychopathology, extrapyramidal side effects, and global functioning. Data were collected between November 2001 and July 2003.

- **Results**: Significant improvement was found in both treatment groups in a variety of cognitive measures, but there was significantly greater improvement in the placebo-augmented group on measures of initial learning acquisition and attention. The improvement in cognition was not correlated with improvement in psychopathology. There were significant correlations between improvement in verbal working memory, verbal learning and memory, and attention and quality of life.

### Invega Trinza [^115RfHEW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Metabolism and Elimination

In a study with oral immediate-release¹⁴C-paliperidone, one week following administration of a single oral dose of 1 mg immediate-release¹⁴C-paliperidone, 59% of the dose was excreted unchanged into urine, indicating that paliperidone is not extensively metabolized in the liver. Approximately 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and 11% in the feces. Four metabolic pathways have been identified in vivo, none of which accounted for more than 10% of the dose: dealkylation, hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and benzisoxazole scission. Although in vitro studies suggested a role for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in the metabolism of paliperidone, there is no evidence in vivo that these isozymes play a significant role in the metabolism of paliperidone. Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicated no discernible difference on the apparent clearance of paliperidone after administration of oral paliperidone between extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates.

The median apparent half-life of paliperidone following Invega Trinza administration over the dose range of 273–819 mg ranged from 84–95 days following deltoid injections and 118–139 days following gluteal injections. The concentration of paliperidone remaining in the circulation 18 months after dosing of 819 mg Invega Trinza is stopped is estimated to be 3% (following deltoid injection) or 7% (following gluteal injection) of the average steady-state levels.

### Invega [^113GqNg7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

The acute efficacy of INVEGA® (3 mg to 15 mg once daily) was established in three placebo-controlled and active-controlled (olanzapine), 6-week, fixed-dose trials in non-elderly adult subjects (mean age of 37) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Studies were conducted across North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Asia. The doses studied in these trials included 3 mg/day, 6 mg/day, 9 mg/day, 12 mg/day, and 15 mg/day, and dosing was administered in the morning regardless of meals.

- **Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS)**: Efficacy was evaluated using PANSS, a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to assess positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression.

- **Personal and social performance (PSP) scale**: Efficacy was also assessed using the PSP scale, a validated clinician-rated tool that measures personal and social functioning in domains such as socially useful activities (e.g. work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors.

In all three studies (n = 1665), INVEGA® showed superiority over placebo on the PANSS at all doses. Mean effects across all doses were fairly similar, although higher doses were numerically superior. INVEGA® also demonstrated superiority over placebo on the PSP in these trials.

### Treatment modifiers and predictors of risperidone response in dementia: An individual participant data meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials [^111mYyMc]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Throughout the course of dementia, individuals often experience changes in behavior associated with cognitive decline. These are commonly referred to as behaviors and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and sometimes described as neuropsychiatric symptoms or responsive behaviors. They include manifestations such as psychosis, aggression, agitation, anxiety, depression, changes in sleep or appetite, and apathy. BPSD are prevalent among people with dementia, with estimates reaching 32% in community-dwelling populations and up to 90% in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents.

Antipsychotics are often used to manage BPSD in people living with dementia, with the prevalence reaching up to 37.5%. These symptoms vary widely between individuals, and evidence suggests that antipsychotics offer only modest benefits in treating psychosis and agitation in this population. Meanwhile, these medications can increase the risk of adverse events, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality in older adults. In light of these risks, antipsychotics should be initiated only for severe symptoms or cases where non-pharmacological approaches prove ineffective. Therefore, identifying treatment modifiers, which are patient-specific characteristics that define subgroups more likely to experience different benefits or risks from medication, can facilitate more targeted and effective treatment strategies. Additionally, exploring predictors of therapeutic response is critical to enhancing patient care.

### Developing treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: The challenge of translation [^116UFsCN]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a life-long, debilitating mental disorder affecting tens of millions of people worldwide. The serendipitous discovery of antipsychotics shifted pharmaceutical research towards developing better antipsychotics. However, our understanding of the disorder has advanced with the knowledge that cognitive enhancers are required to improve patients' everyday lives. While antipsychotics address psychosis, they do not enhance cognition and hence are not antischizophrenics. Developing pro-cognitive therapeutics has been extremely difficult, especially when no approved treatment exists.

In lieu of stumbling on an efficacious treatment, developing targeted compounds can be facilitated by understanding the neural mechanisms underlying altered cognitive functioning in patients. Equally important, these cognitive domains will need to be measured similarly in animals and humans so that novel targets can be tested prior to conducting expensive clinical trials. At the time of writing, the limited similarity of testing across species has resulted in a translational bottleneck.

In this review, we emphasize that schizophrenia is a disorder characterized by abnormal cognitive behavior. Quantifying these abnormalities using tasks with cross-species validity would enable the quantification of comparable processes in rodents. This approach would increase the likelihood that the neural substrates underlying relevant behaviors will be conserved across species. Hence, we detail cross-species tasks that can be used to test the effects of manipulations relevant to schizophrenia.

### Ziprasidone and cognition: The evolving story [^117Mmbtr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment, a central characteristic of schizophrenia, can profoundly limit patients' abilities to acquire or maintain skills needed for adequate functioning. Consequently, research on the efficacy of antipsychotic medications increasingly focuses on the potential benefits of these agents on cognitive function. Although data are limited, it appears that atypical antipsychotics consistently improve cognitive function to a greater extent than older, conventional agents. This review examines the atypical agent ziprasidone and its effects on cognitive function.

The most recent data on the cognitive effects of ziprasidone come from a comparative trial with olanzapine (40–80 mg b.i.d. and 5–15 mg q.d., respectively) and from three studies where patients were switched to ziprasidone (40–160 mg/day) due to suboptimal efficacy or tolerability with other antipsychotics. Generally, ziprasidone-treated patients demonstrated significant improvements in multiple cognitive domains — such as episodic memory, attention/vigilance, executive function, and visuomotor speed — that are generally associated with improved functional outcomes.

In the switching studies, path analysis indicated that improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) cognitive subscale directly affected changes on the PANSS anxiety-depression cluster and a PANSS "prosocial" subscale composed of items related to social engagement. Improvement in cognitive function observed with ziprasidone may have implications for long-term patient outcomes.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^11571Nt6]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In the UK, there is a policy drive towards improving transparency and open access to clinical trial data. The challenge for funders of research grant applications lies in deciding where comprehensive evidence syntheses are most likely to make a difference. This requires prioritizing their funding despite the greater resource and time demands involved. A framework approach would help support groups grappling with how to respond to the increased availability of these new sources of information. This approach could likely increase the scientific return on the funder's investment in the trial and, most importantly, the benefits to the public and future patients.

Calls for improved reporting standards, especially for harm outcomes in journal publications, continue to be debated even after the introduction of reporting guidelines such as the CONSORT harms. Many journals now allow for the publication of de-identified IPD segments and redacted sections of CSRs, including tables or narratives of harms, as supplementary online material. However, not all trials provide this level of data, and they are not as exhaustive as the full CSRs and/or IPD. Developing a central repository where all available redacted CSRs can be indexed and uploaded could help alleviate some challenges associated with accessing and using these data. Such a development would require full cooperation and backing from all key stakeholders.

### Invega [^112BMqMY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Pregnancy**

Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Invega® in pregnant women. Invega® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Use of first-generation antipsychotic drugs during the last trimester of pregnancy has been associated with extrapyramidal symptoms in the neonate; these symptoms are usually self-limited. It is not known whether paliperidone, when taken near the end of pregnancy, will lead to similar neonatal signs and symptoms.

In animal reproduction studies, there were no increases in fetal abnormalities when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated during the period of organogenesis with up to eight times the maximum recommended human dose of paliperidone (on a mg/m² basis).

In rat reproduction studies with risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in rats and humans, there were increases in pup deaths seen at oral doses that are less than the maximum recommended human dose of risperidone on a mg/m² basis (see risperidone package insert).

- **Nursing Mothers**

Paliperidone is 9-hydroxyrisperidone, the active metabolite of risperidone. In animal studies, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were excreted in milk. Risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone are also excreted in human breast milk. Caution should be exercised when Invega® is administered to a nursing woman. The known benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed against the unknown risks of infant exposure to paliperidone.

- **Pediatric Use**

The safety and effectiveness of Invega® in patients under 18 years of age have not been established.

### Paliperidone for treatment of schizophrenia [^112jErw7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In short-term studies, oral paliperidone is an antipsychotic that is more efficacious than placebo. We found its adverse effects to be similar to those of its parent compound, risperidone, with movement disorders, weight gain, and tachycardia all more common with paliperidone than placebo. In addition, paliperidone is associated with substantial increases in serum prolactin that may be associated with sexual dysfunction, although sexual functioning outcomes were not reported. At doses greater than 3 mg per day, oral paliperidone appears comparable in efficacy to oral olanzapine 10 mg per day. Regarding the critical comparison of oral paliperidone to risperidone, we have no information and are thus unable to determine if paliperidone has any advantages or disadvantages compared to its well-known parent compound.

### Efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of second-generation antipsychotics for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112iT66k]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). Low credibility.

Adverse event outcomes

Mortality has been reported in a total of four trials involving quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. The network meta-analysis (NMA) showed that none of the included atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) were significantly different from the placebo or from each other. According to SUCRA, placebo had the highest probability of safety, followed by olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine.

Cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAEs) have been reported in a total of five trials involving quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. The NMA showed that risperidone had a significantly increased risk of CVAEs compared with placebo (OR = 4.01, 95% CI 1.48 to 10.90) and quetiapine (OR = 4.65, 95% CI 1.12 to 19.38). According to SUCRA, quetiapine has the highest probability of safety, followed by placebo, olanzapine, and risperidone.

Falls were reported in 15 trials involving quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, brexpiprazole, and aripiprazole. The NMA showed that none of the included AAPs were significantly different from the placebo or from each other. According to SUCRA, brexpiprazole had the highest probability of safety, followed by quetiapine, risperidone, placebo, aripiprazole, and olanzapine.

Sedation was reported in 16 trials involving quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, brexpiprazole, and aripiprazole. The NMA showed that compared with placebo, quetiapine (OR = 5.04, 95% CI 3.24 to 7.83), olanzapine (OR = 3.68, 95% CI 2.43 to 5.55), risperidone (OR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.31), and aripiprazole (OR = 2.74, 95% CI 1.25 to 6.02) had a significant impact.

### Invega Trinza [^111ZgmCQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Use with risperidone or with oral paliperidone**: Since paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, caution should be exercised when Invega Trinza is coadministered with risperidone or oral paliperidone for extended periods. Safety data involving concomitant use of Invega Trinza with other antipsychotics is limited.

- **Dosage recommendations in patients with renal impairment**: Invega Trinza has not been systematically studied in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min [Cockcroft-Gault Formula]), adjust the dosage and stabilize the patient using the 1-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension, then transition to Invega Trinza (see Table 1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Refer to the prescribing information of the 1-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension product for the recommended dosage in patients with mild renal impairment. Invega Trinza is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Switching from Invega Trinza to the 1-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension**: For switching from Invega Trinza to Invega Sustenna (1-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension), the 1-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension should be started.

### Paliperidone overdose with delayed onset of toxicity [^111y9FFU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Paliperidone, or 9-hydroxy risperidone, is the newest atypical antipsychotic agent approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Despite being the primary active metabolite of risperidone, paliperidone differs in several ways from risperidone. The most notable difference is that paliperidone is formulated as an extended-release product. We present a case of a 14-year-old, 59-kg girl with a history of psychosis and major depressive disorder who developed toxicity after an ingestion of 180 mg (3.1 mg/kg) of paliperidone. This case is not only one of the first cases of paliperidone overdose described in the literature but also unique in that it describes a delayed onset of toxicity, as well as an extended duration of symptoms.

### Cognitive functioning following discontinuation of antipsychotic medication. A naturalistic sub-group analysis from the OPUS II trial [^1117j3oM]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The effect of antipsychotic medication on cognitive functioning in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia is poorly understood. Some studies of second-generation antipsychotics have indicated they improve cognitive functioning, while other studies have found that they decrease the level of cognitive functioning.

- **Method**: We included patients with schizophrenia who were in treatment with antipsychotics 1.5 years (baseline) after initiation of treatment and followed them up 3.5 years later (n = 189). At follow-up, 60 patients (32%) had discontinued their antipsychotic treatment, and 129 patients (68%) were still taking antipsychotics. Using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), we assessed cognition at baseline and follow-up.

- **Results**: Patients who discontinued their medication had a higher level of cognitive functioning in all domains at baseline, as well as global cognitive function [mean z-score -1.50 (s.d. 1.24) vs. -2.27 (s.d. 1.30), p = 0.00015]. After controlling for relevant confounders, those who discontinued antipsychotic medication improved significantly more than those who remained on medication during the follow-up in the Token Motor task [estimated mean change difference -0.46 (95% CI -0.89 to -0.04)], the Speed of Processing Domain [estimated mean change difference -0.38 (95% CI -0.68 to -0.08)], and global cognition [estimated mean change difference -0.36 (95% CI -0.66 to -0.07)].

- **Conclusion**: Due to the naturalistic design, we cannot conclude on the direction of the relationship between antipsychotics and cognition.

### Invega [^112bXfpe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Administration instructions**: Invega® can be taken with or without food. Clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of Invega® were carried out in patients without regard to food intake. Invega® must be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids. Tablets should not be chewed, divided, or crushed. The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate. The tablet shell, along with insoluble core components, is eliminated from the body; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet.

- **Use with risperidone**: Concomitant use of Invega® with risperidone has not been studied. Since paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone, consideration should be given to the additive paliperidone exposure if risperidone is coadministered with Invega®.

- **Dosage in special populations**:
	- **Renal impairment**: Dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to < 80 mL/min), the recommended initial dose of Invega is 3 mg once daily. The dose may then be increased to a maximum of 6 mg once daily based on clinical response and tolerability. For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 10 mL/min to < 50 mL/min), the recommended initial dose of Invega is 1.5 mg once daily, which may be increased to a maximum of 3 mg once daily after clinical reassessment. As Invega has not been studied in patients with creatinine clearance below…

### Anticholinergic burden and cognitive function in psychosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oZ5JB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

The authors synthesized evidence from studies quantifying the relationship between anticholinergic medication and cognitive function in psychosis. They additionally explored studies investigating whether reducing anticholinergic medications affects cognitive function in individuals with psychosis.

- **Methods**: A database search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, from database inception to October 2023, for studies reporting objective cognitive assessment and quantification of anticholinergic burden using clinical scales, serological anticholinergic activity, or tapering of anticholinergic medications. Analyses were carried out in R using the metafor package. Random-effects meta-analysis models were employed, along with assessment of heterogeneity, study quality, and meta-regressions (age, sex, and antipsychotic dosage in chlorpromazine equivalents).

- **Results**: Of 1,337 citations retrieved, 40 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 25 anticholinergic burden studies (4,620 patients), six serological anticholinergic activity studies (382 patients), and nine tapering studies (186 patients). A negative correlation was identified between anticholinergic burden and global cognition (r = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.48, -0.25), verbal learning (r = -0.28, 95% CI = -0.36, -0.21), visual learning (r = -0.17, 95% CI = -0.28, -0.06), working memory (r = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.29, -0.14), processing speed (r = -0.24, 95% CI = -0.35, -0.13), attention (r = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.29, -0.08), executive functions (r = -0.17, 95% CI = -0.27, -0.06), and social cognition (r = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.19, -0.05).

### Towards enhancing drug development methodology to treat cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions: insights from 2 decades of clinical trials [^112B2cVr]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

The alternative approach is to recruit clinically stable patients who have demonstrated cognitive impairments while on various approved antipsychotic treatments. These patients are then randomized to receive either the dual-benefit monotherapy agent or another treatment, such as risperidone. The advantage of this design is the ability to compare post-treatment cognitive performance associated with the comparator versus the dual-benefit monotherapy agent, relative to pre-randomization cognitive performance across different baseline treatments. A disadvantage is that some patients may destabilize on either the comparator or the dual-benefit monotherapy agent, preventing examination for "stability and superiority". However, these patients could still provide information about potential cognitive gains despite new-onset clinical instability.

Thus, this design presents a theoretical risk of destabilization for all patients due to medication changes. However, the study aims to collect evidence of cognitive function improvement both in patients who remain clinically stable and those who destabilize. It is worth noting that the European Medicines Agency guidelines suggest that comparing new agents with older ones for the treatment of identical conditions does not necessitate a placebo-controlled design.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: A meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^111rFmTo]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Yale University Open Data (YODA) project was set up to promote better transparency of clinical trial results. As of 2014, YODA has been enabling scientists across the world to gain access to Johnson & Johnson's clinical trial data assets, including risperidone and paliperidone. Using more innovative methodologies on a previously unavailable and more complete database from individual participant data (IPD) and clinical study reports (CSRs) contained in YODA, we aim to compare in a meta-analysis the benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone with data from corresponding trial register entries and journal publications.

### Geodon [^113SmSpE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction in patients treated with ziprasidone. In the 4- and 6-week placebo-controlled trials, somnolence was reported in 14% of patients on ziprasidone compared to 7% of placebo patients. Somnolence led to discontinuation in 0.3% of patients in short-term clinical trials. Since ziprasidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ziprasidone therapy does not affect them adversely.

- **Priapism**: One case of priapism was reported in the premarketing database. While the relationship of the reaction to ziprasidone use has not been established, other drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism, and it is possible that ziprasidone may share this capacity. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention.

- **Body temperature regulation**: Although not reported with ziprasidone in premarketing trials, disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, such as exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or similar conditions.

### Invega Trinza [^112Xgsap]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Paliperidone palmitate is hydrolyzed to paliperidone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The exact mechanism of action of paliperidone is unclear; however, its therapeutic effect in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: In vitro, paliperidone acts as an antagonist at the central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptors, with binding affinities (Ki values) of 1.6–2.8 nM for D2 and 0.8–1.2 nM for 5HT2A receptors. Additionally, paliperidone is active as an antagonist at histamine H1 and α1 and α2 adrenergic receptors, with binding affinities of 32 nM, 4 nM, and 17 nM, respectively. It has no affinity for cholinergic muscarinic or β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and (-)-paliperidone enantiomers is qualitatively and quantitatively similar.

### Invega Trinza [^113MTw1k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Somnolence, sedation, and dizziness were reported as adverse reactions in subjects treated with Invega Trinza [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Antipsychotics, including Invega Trinza, have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that paliperidone therapy does not adversely affect them.

- **Seizures**: In the long-term maintenance trial there were no reports of seizures or convulsions. In the pivotal clinical studies with the 1-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension, which included four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in subjects with schizophrenia, less than 1% (1/1293) of subjects treated with the 1-month injection experienced an adverse event of convulsion compared with less than 1% (1/510) of placebo-treated subjects who experienced an adverse event of grand mal convulsion. Like other antipsychotic drugs, Invega Trinza should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older.

- **Dysphagia**: Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Invega Trinza and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

- **Priapism**: Drugs with
