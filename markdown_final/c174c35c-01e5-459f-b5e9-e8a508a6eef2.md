## Question

What kind of study case control or cohort study done for outbreaks of disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which study design is most appropriate for outbreak investigations and why, with a specific focus on choosing between case-control and cohort designs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the operational constraints of outbreak settings. Then, I should compare the core features and trade-offs of case-control versus cohort designs. Next, I will review real-world evidence and field guidance to see what investigators actually use. After that, I should consider special scenarios where cohorts are preferable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note key limitations and quality safeguards to ensure the conclusion is sound.

> Let me first confirm the operational constraints that shape design choice in outbreaks. Outbreaks demand rapid hypothesis testing with limited time, resources, and a small number of cases, and they often begin after cases have already occurred, which pushes investigators toward designs that can be mounted quickly and efficiently in the field [^114xJPKs] [^115cDzHH].

> Now, I will examine the core features of case-control studies and why they fit these constraints. Case-control studies start with cases and non-cases and look backward for exposures, which means they can be initiated immediately, require fewer subjects for rare outcomes, and are generally faster and less costly than cohorts; they are particularly appropriate for outbreaks, rare diseases, or when the outcome has already occurred, and they allow calculation of odds ratios to estimate associations with exposures, though they cannot directly estimate incidence or attributable risk [^1156feBm] [^116SZwLt] [^115WkXMA].

> Next, I should review cohort studies and their strengths and limitations in outbreak settings. Cohort studies follow exposed and unexposed individuals forward to measure disease incidence, enabling direct estimation of relative risks and a clearer temporal sequence from exposure to outcome; however, they are slower to set up, more resource-intensive, and can be impractical when the population at risk is ill-defined or the outbreak is already underway, which limits their utility for rapid field investigations [^117KPuTg] [^111qHM9E] [^114xJPKs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify what field guidance and real-world practice show. The CDC Field Epidemiology Manual explicitly recommends case-control studies as the most common and appropriate analytic design for outbreak investigations because they are feasible when a cohort is impractical, while cohort designs are reserved for well-defined exposed groups such as attendees of a specific event; similarly, systematic reviews of outbreak investigations show that case-control and cohort studies markedly increase the likelihood of identifying a food vehicle compared with descriptive methods alone, underscoring their analytic value in real outbreaks [^114xJPKs] [^113g1QzZ] [^114bN3s5].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall in my reasoning. I initially thought cohort studies might be "more rigorous" and therefore preferable when time allows, but that overgeneralizes; properly designed case-control studies can achieve validity comparable to cohort studies, and the choice should be driven by the question, timing, and feasibility rather than a presumed hierarchy of rigor, especially when rapid action is needed in outbreaks [^114YpTzi].

> I will now examine special scenarios where cohort approaches are indeed preferable. When the exposed population is clearly defined and accessible — such as all attendees at a wedding, passengers on a flight, or residents of a facility — cohort studies can efficiently estimate attack rates and relative risks and allow dose-response analyses that strengthen causal inference; likewise, when the research question involves incidence, natural history, or long-term sequelae, prospective cohorts are better suited despite their logistical demands [^113g1QzZ] [^116wFaqy] [^117KPuTg].

> Let me consider the role of observational designs beyond case-control and cohort. Descriptive case series and cross-sectional surveys are useful early for hypothesis generation, but they lack comparison groups and cannot quantify associations; analytic case-control or cohort studies are needed to test hypotheses and provide actionable evidence for control measures, which is why guidelines and outbreak manuals emphasize moving to comparative designs once a hypothesis is formed [^114xJPKs] [^115PDQfw].

> I should double-check the quality caveats because design choice alone does not guarantee valid inference. Case-control studies are vulnerable to selection, information, and confounding biases, and temporal bias can occur if exposure windows are misspecified; careful case and control definitions, comparable selection, blinded exposure ascertainment, and attention to confounding are essential to reduce bias and improve credibility of findings in outbreak settings [^116SZwLt] [^113JpPEG] [^112yxhE5].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation matches both evidence and practice. For most outbreak investigations — particularly when cases are rare, the population at risk is not a discrete cohort, and rapid answers are needed — case-control studies are the preferred design; cohort studies are appropriate when the exposed group is well-defined, when attack rates and relative risks are needed, or when studying incidence and natural history, recognizing their slower deployment and greater resource needs [^114xJPKs] [^113g1QzZ] [^117KPuTg].

> Final answer: Case-control studies are the primary analytic design for outbreak investigations because they are fast, efficient, and feasible when the outbreak is ongoing or recently concluded; cohort studies are used when the exposed population is clearly defined and accessible or when incidence and natural history are the key questions, but they are less suitable for rapid field response in most outbreak contexts [^114xJPKs] [^113g1QzZ] [^1156feBm].

---

Outbreak investigations primarily use **case-control studies** to rapidly identify exposures and risk factors when the outbreak is ongoing or recent, as they are fast, efficient, and suitable for rare outcomes [^1156feBm] [^116SZwLt]. Cohort studies are used when a defined exposed group can be followed prospectively or retrospectively to estimate incidence, attack rates, and relative risk, and are preferred for assessing interventions or natural history [^117KPuTg] [^116wFaqy]. The choice depends on outbreak size, timing, and the specific question; case-control studies are most common for rapid hypothesis testing, while cohort studies are better for incidence estimation and intervention evaluation [^114xJPKs] [^116wFaqy].

## Case-control studies in outbreak investigations

### Definition and design

Case-control studies compare exposures between **cases** (those with the outcome) and **controls** (those without), working backward from outcome to exposure to identify risk factors [^114xJPKs].

---

### Advantages in outbreak settings

- **Speed**: Rapid identification of exposures and risk factors during ongoing outbreaks [^1156feBm].
- **Efficiency**: Suitable for rare outcomes or small outbreaks [^114xJPKs].
- **Feasibility**: Practical when the population at risk is undefined or large [^114xJPKs].

---

### Limitations

- **Bias**: Susceptible to recall, selection, and confounding bias [^116SZwLt].
- **Causality**: Cannot establish causation; associations only [^112ABYFd].
- **Exposure ascertainment**: Retrospective exposure assessment can be imprecise [^116SZwLt].

---

### Examples

- **COVID-19**: Identified risk factors (e.g. healthcare work, close contact) and effectiveness of PPE and quarantine [^113mHPEt] [^116CVrXZ].
- **Cholera**: Linked unsafe water and poor hygiene to transmission [^112dAtqs].
- **Foodborne outbreaks**: Identified contaminated foods (e.g. caramel apples, leafy greens) [^113g1QzZ].

---

## Cohort studies in outbreak investigations

### Definition and design

Cohort studies follow exposed and unexposed individuals forward to compare disease incidence and estimate **relative risk** [^117KPuTg].

---

### Advantages in outbreak settings

- **Incidence estimation**: Allows calculation of attack rates and relative risk [^114MEc4G].
- **Temporal relationships**: Establishes exposure–outcome sequence [^117KPuTg].
- **Intervention assessment**: Evaluates effectiveness of interventions or natural history [^116wFaqy].

---

### Limitations

- **Time and resources**: Prospective cohorts can be slow and resource intensive [^116Nhphu].
- **Attrition**: Loss to follow-up can bias results [^117KPuTg].
- **Rare outcomes**: Less efficient for rare diseases or small outbreaks [^117KPuTg].

---

### Examples

- **COVID-19**: Assessed incidence, transmission, and long-term sequelae [^111McMMt] [^115onvX3].
- **Measles**: Quantified long-term infectious disease risks post-infection [^113yW2ZL].
- **Healthcare outbreaks**: Evaluated nosocomial transmission and interventions [^113NEvDa].

## Factors influencing study design choice

Key factors influencing study design choice:

| **Aspect** | **Case-control studies** | **Cohort studies** |
|-|-|-|
| Outbreak stage | Early outbreaks favor case-control [^notfound] | later phases may use cohorts [^notfound] |
| Population size | undefined or large populations suit case-control [^114xJPKs] | Large, defined groups suit cohorts [^114xJPKs] |
| Research question | Risk-factor identification (case-control) [^116wFaqy] | incidence/intervention (cohort) [^116wFaqy] |
| Resources | Available time, funding, and personnel influence feasibility [^1156feBm] | Available time, funding, and personnel influence feasibility [^1156feBm] |

## Emerging and hybrid study designs

Hybrid designs combine case-control and cohort elements to improve efficiency and validity; for example, **case-control-with-follow-up** reconstructs a source population for incidence estimation [^112xqbVZ], and **test-negative designs** are used in vaccine effectiveness studies [^113UcRQb].

---

## Conclusion

Case-control studies are the **primary tool for rapid outbreak investigation**, especially for identifying exposures and risk factors, whereas cohort studies are preferred for estimating incidence, evaluating interventions, and understanding natural history. The choice depends on outbreak characteristics, research questions, and available resources [^114xJPKs] [^116wFaqy].

### Identifying outbreak risk factors through case-controls comparisons [^113jNb77]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Outbreaks are typically investigated using approaches that aim to identify place- and context-dependent causative factors. As the focus is on understanding the basis of a specific outbreak, the resulting narratives are rarely suitable for forecasting risk or developing generalizable predictive and preventative measures. This Perspective article proposes applying a case-control framework as an outbreak epidemiological study design to promote evidence-based decision-making for prevention and response to outbreaks. The approach involves identifying counterfactuals, with case-control comparisons drawn to test hypotheses about conditions that manifest outbreaks. First, a framework is described for iterative multidisciplinary interrogation to elucidate and identify minimally sufficient sets of factors that lead to disease outbreaks. Next, example case-control comparison frameworks are discussed, centered on pathogen(s), influential contributor(s), or landscape(s), illustrated with examples focused on pathogen transmission.

### Identifying outbreak risk factors through case-controls comparisons [^115YTSFQ]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Modern medical research serves as a valuable precedent, illustrating the merits of adopting case-control comparisons to investigate multifactorial dynamics. Medical research shifted from investigating pathology in the human body as a set of independent tests of hypotheses based on expert opinion and careful observation towards employing a framework for evidence-based inquiry that forces an inclusion of otherwise unanticipated drivers and that provides a pathway for synthesis within a hierarchy of evidence. Within that hierarchy are tools designed specifically to move scientific understanding from enigmatic, heterogeneous, multifactorial data to a well-supported, evidence-based understanding of the drivers of pathology. A basic tool of evidence-based medicine is the concept of the Case-Control Study: a retrospective analysis in which individuals who exhibit an observed outcome (cases) are "paired" in study design with individuals who do not exhibit the observed outcome (controls), with analysis then performed to identify which exposures (i.e. potential driving factors) they share and which are distinct only among the cases. This allows for the calculation of measures such as odds ratiosto estimate the likely impact of combinations of particular features on health outcomes.

Analogous to clinical medicine concerning pathologies of the body, epidemiology considers outbreaks as pathologies of a population. Unlike physiology, however, a multitude of potential types of controls may be matched to outbreak cases for exploration and analysis. To isolate and understand epidemiological risk and the factors that drive (re)emergence of pathogens of concern, three main categories of case-control formulation are proposed for outbreaks that can serve as a general foundation for evidence-based epidemiological analysis of outbreak risk: factors; pathogens; and landscapes. In each of these categories, the observed outcome that exists for cases and that does not for controls is a circulating outbreak, but what constitutes a well-matched control is partitioned into a narrower equivalence class, concentrating on the nature of the comparators considered.

### Observational research in epidemic settings: a roadmap to reform [^115cDzHH]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Based on this evidence, observational studies clearly have a vital and complementary role to RCTs for advancing biomedical knowledge (figure 1B). Their strengths lie in generating rapid, real-world evidence, addressing broad research questions and providing insights unobtainable through RCTs alone. Observational studies are often the only viable option for studying rare diseases, ethically challenging exposures, hard-to-reach populations and emerging epidemics. However, the diminished attention paid to strengthening observational studies' design and conduct in epidemic settings presents an inherent challenge to achieving insights robust enough to advance science and justify appropriate policy changes. We next discuss the most pressing challenges to observational studies and provide examples and recommendations to overcome them (table 1). Achieving these reforms before future epidemics will aid the scientific community in producing robust, actionable data for policy-making and public health.

### Observational research in epidemic settings: a roadmap to reform [^115TCB6C]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

High-quality biomedical research is key for ensuring effective treatment and epidemic response: poor-quality evidence harms patients, undermines public trust and diverts resources. While randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for answering questions about treatment efficacy in tightly controlled settings, high-quality observational studies offer valuable advantages for answering an array of clinical questions. First, observational studies deliver evidence rapidly, efficiently and ethically in settings where RCTs are impractical or raise ethical concerns. Second, observational studies' scope of inquiry extends beyond quantifying potentially causal associations to address non-experimental questions that hold direct relevance to patient care and epidemic response. As with ongoing developments in RCT methodology, significant resources are needed to strengthen observational research methods, particularly in epidemic settings, where the urgent nature of an unfolding crisis demands robust evidence on which to base public health and policy recommendations. By harnessing the full potential of both observational and experimental approaches, we can substantially enhance the quality and generalisability of clinical evidence for global benefit.

This paper opens with a discussion of how well-designed observational studies contribute to biomedical evidence and provides examples from across the clinical literature of how these methods generate hypotheses for future research and uncover otherwise unattainable insights by providing examples from across the clinical literature. Then, we present obstacles that remain in ensuring observational studies are optimally designed, conducted and communicated. These challenges occur throughout the research lifecycle ranging from technical questions of study design to dwindling community engagement during and after outbreaks. Finally, we provide actionable solutions to many of these problems.

### Identifying outbreak risk factors through case-controls comparisons [^115zHcoc]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While many factors driving outbreak risk are well-studied, more work is warranted to better understand what allows an infectious disease to emerge and then tip from endemic to epidemic to pandemic. Greater knowledge and predictive capacity can be achieved by employing a case-control framework for inquiry that forces consideration of multidisciplinary drivers of disease outbreaks, providing a pathway towards synthesis across a hierarchy of evidence (Box 2). Case-control formulations allow for more rigorous and explicit consideration of complex interactions among sets of factors (Box 1) that may not yet be fully identified or understood; generate hypotheses for further investigation; and bridge gaps among disciplines in ways that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. This illustrates the versatility and merits of a case-control approach to promote evidence-based decision-making. Further, the merits of isolating minimally sufficient sets of factors allow us to move away from a more traditional focus on identifying and reducing one large single-source risk, since that may inadvertently create equal, if not greater, risks from a diffuse suite of other, now slightly altered contributory factors. While many of the factors driving outbreak risk have been well studied, and many case-control studies have focused on individual risk factors at the scale of the individuals who are infected (or not) during an outbreak, further work is warranted to better understand the many ways in which an infectious disease can tip from endemic to epidemic to pandemic. Employing a more robust analytical framework and investigative toolkit can only aid in ongoing efforts to progress beyond phenomenological interrogation and establish a consistent basis for developing generalizable preventable measures that respond to dynamic, multifactorial risks.

### Research methods in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship-observational studies [^1138akMh]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies compare outcomes among subjects with and without an exposure of interest, without intervention from study investigators. Observational studies can be designed as a prospective or retrospective cohort study or as a case-control study. In healthcare epidemiology, these observational studies often take advantage of existing healthcare databases, making them more cost-effective than clinical trials and allowing analyses of rare outcomes. This paper addresses the importance of selecting a well-defined study population, highlights key considerations for study design, and offers potential solutions including biostatistical tools that are applicable to observational study designs.

### Importance of outbreak response research in bridging knowledge gaps on emerging infectious diseases [^116wFaqy]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Selection of specific research designs and methodologies must depend on the knowledge gaps being addressed and the feasibility of the research, including what is acceptable and implementable within the outbreak setting (table 1). Case series can illuminate clinical features, severity and outcome, demographic features and suggest potential exposures. Cohort and community studies, such as following the behaviours and movements of residents living within an outbreak-impacted community, can provide opportunities to assess incidence rates and temporal trends, as well as geographic variations in incidence that could generate hypotheses on the source of an outbreak, especially when overlayed with animal, vector, and demographic data. Such study designs can also help to evaluate human-to-human transmissibility and, ultimately provide fundamental data for assessing effectiveness of interventions and diagnostic tools. Longitudinal data from cohorts can inform long-term sequelae of the disease, as well as duration of transmissibility of the pathogen. Likewise, case–control studies can provide a relatively quick approach for hypothesis generation on specific risk characteristics and exposures, and identify transmission patterns, and effectiveness of existing pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. Evaluating new vaccines or pharmaceutical treatments would require randomised controlled trials, and may have unique ethical design considerations when there are existing tools that are routinely used to treat the outbreak pathogen or disease.

Appropriately configured local ethical review committees must have the opportunity to expeditiously review and determine conditions for approval of research involving human subjects conducted during outbreaks. Both WHO and the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have recognised the unique challenges of ethical review of research in the context of outbreaks or epidemics and have published insightful recommendations. These include the development of template clinical trial agreements reflecting shared understandings about key issues such as data sharing, post-trial access to interventions, storage and analysis of biospecimens, and investments to build local capacity.

### Observational research in epidemic settings: a roadmap to reform [^116JoUcp]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Observational studies are critical tools in clinical research and public health response, but challenges arise in ensuring the data produced by these studies are scientifically robust and socially valuable. Resolving these challenges requires careful attention to prioritising the most valuable research questions, ensuring robust study design, strong data management practices, expansive community engagement, and access and benefit sharing of results and research materials. This paper opens with a discussion of how well-designed observational studies contribute to biomedical evidence and provides examples from across the clinical literature of how these methods generate hypotheses for future research and uncover otherwise unattainable insights by providing examples from across the clinical literature. Then, we present obstacles that remain in ensuring observational studies are optimally designed, conducted and communicated.

### Observational research methods. research design II: cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies [^1164kQdp]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies are collectively referred to as observational studies. Often these studies are the only practicable method of studying various problems, for example, studies of aetiology, instances where a randomised controlled trial might be unethical, or if the condition to be studied is rare. Cohort studies are used to study incidence, causes, and prognosis. Because they measure events in chronological order they can be used to distinguish between cause and effect. Cross sectional studies are used to determine prevalence. They are relatively quick and easy but do not permit distinction between cause and effect. Case controlled studies compare groups retrospectively. They seek to identify possible predictors of outcome and are useful for studying rare diseases or outcomes. They are often used to generate hypotheses that can then be studied via prospective cohort or other studies.

### Observational studies: cohort and case-control studies [^1143SgbQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Observational studies constitute an important category of study designs. To address some investigative questions in plastic surgery, randomized controlled trials are not always indicated or ethical to conduct. Instead, observational studies may be the next best method of addressing these types of questions. Well-designed observational studies have been shown to provide results similar to those of randomized controlled trials, challenging the belief that observational studies are second rate. Cohort studies and case-control studies are two primary types of observational studies that aid in evaluating associations between diseases and exposures. In this review article, the authors describe these study designs and methodologic issues, and provide examples from the plastic surgery literature.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^116CVrXZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support the WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Objectives

To assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high disease transmission.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and updated the search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 23 June 2020.

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies, case-control studies, time series, interrupted time series, case series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles in duplicate. Two review authors then independently screened all potentially relevant full-text publications. One review author extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We used three different tools to assess risk of bias, depending on the study design: ROBINS-I for non-randomised studies of interventions, a tool provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-randomised, non-controlled studies, and recommendations from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) for modelling studies. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and costs.

Main Results

We included 51 studies; 4 observational studies and 28 modelling studies on COVID-19, one observational and one modelling study on MERS, three observational and 11 modelling studies on SARS, and three modelling studies on SARS and other infectious diseases. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and undertook a narrative synthesis. We judged risk of bias to be moderate for 2/3 non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) and serious for 1/3 NRSI. We rated risk of bias moderate for 4/5 non-controlled cohort studies, and serious for 1/5. We rated modelling studies as having no concerns for 13 studies, moderate concerns for 17 studies and major concerns for 13 studies. Quarantine for individuals who were in contact with a confirmed/suspected COVID-19 case in comparison to no quarantine Modelling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases may have averted 44% to 96% of incident cases and 31% to 76% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 6 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, 1 on SARS, low-certainty evidence). Studies also indicated that there may be a reduction in the basic reproduction number ranging from 37% to 88% due to the implementation of quarantine (5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings may be (2 modelling studies on SARS). Quarantine in combination with other measures to contain COVID-19 in comparison to other measures without quarantine or no measures When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, such as school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated that there may be a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than measures without quarantine or no interventions (incident cases: 9 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 5 modelling studies on COVID-19, low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. Quarantine for individuals travelling from a country with a declared COVID-19 outbreak compared to no quarantine Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths may be small for SARS, but might be larger for COVID-19 (2 observational studies on COVID-19 and 2 observational studies on SARS).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence is limited because most studies on COVID-19 are mathematical modelling studies that make different assumptions on important model parameters. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, although there is uncertainty over the magnitude of the effect. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak and the impact of the measures implemented. This review was originally commissioned by the WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems. The update was self-initiated by the review authors.

### Identifying outbreak risk factors through case-controls comparisons [^112uJNDz]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Investigations of infectious disease outbreaks often focus on identifying place- and context-dependent factors responsible for the emergence and spread of that specific outbreak. This makes it hard to develop generalizable predictive and preventive measures. Understanding disease emergence and spread is a complex challenge that extends beyond the current modes of investigation. While it is widely understood that factors rarely act in isolation, conventional approaches can fall short when disease dynamics arise from synergies among multiple factors, warranting study from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Contributing factors can be firmly rooted in virology, immunology, and pharmacology, or may describe ecological and environmental influences, while others might relate to social and engineering domains involving human actions, behaviors, and interventions. Phenomenological investigations of particular outbreaks also can fail to capture the contingent nature of multifactorial dynamics, where the importance of one factor can be contingent on a "perfect storm" of other concurrent factors.

Progress has been made in developing new approaches to investigate outbreaks. For example, capturing complex dynamics in landscape-based epidemiological modeling of outbreaks –. Whereas initial models considered a particular outbreak scenario of interest and hypothesized the contributions of observable sets of features –, more recent efforts examined multiple outbreaks – and have utilized techniques such as fore- and hindcasting to test predictive models relying on either statistical patterns, or inferred causal dynamics, as described previously. While these approaches have provided valuable insights, it is unclear whether they will provide a robust basis for studying and forecasting dynamics of outbreaks that rely on many different contributing, potentially synergistic, factors.

This Perspective article proposes adopting a multidisciplinary case-control hypothesis testing framework, at the scale of an outbreak rather than of an individual, to substantively advance understanding of disease emergence and spread. This provides a key component of a case-control analytical toolkit. Existing case-control epidemiological analysis methodology can serve as a platform for iterative rounds of hypothesis generation and testing. By analyzing combinations of conditionally dependent factors from across disciplines, the approach allows identification of minimally sufficient sets of factors (Box 1) present in early stages of outbreaks that turn emergent infections into outbreaks. In this Perspective, we propose a case-control approach as a way of increasing the capability of epidemiological studies to isolate and predict causal scenarios that increase the likelihood of outbreaks occurring, presenting three types of controls, with examples as illustrations.

IDSA–US Public Health Service grading used in this guideline defines strength of recommendation and quality of evidence as follows: A — Good evidence to support a recommendation for or against use; B — Moderate evidence to support a recommendation for or against use; C — Poor evidence to support a recommendation for or against use. Quality of evidence categories are: I — Evidence from 1 or more properly randomized controlled trials; II — Evidence from 1 or more well-designed clinical trials, without randomization; from cohort or case–control analytic studies (preferably from > 1 center); from multiple time–series; or from dramatic results from uncontrolled experiments; III — Evidence from opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.

### Temporal bias in case-control design: preventing reliable predictions of the future [^113JpPEG]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Preventing temporal bias.

A Whitehead's cholera study benefited from the short period between infection and death. Had Whitehead been faced with an outbreak of typhoid fever, his sampling strategy would oversample late-stage features. B Hypothetical interview data from Whitehead's case-control study. Lacking underlying knowledge regarding disease etiology, Whitehead's experimental design would have experienced temporal bias given a disease with a longer incubation period. Shaded columns represent information hidden to the investigator. C Randomizing the lookback window among case patients can uniformly sample the trajectory, if the lookback times go far back enough. D Evaluating person-days, person-weeks, or person-months can allow for the entire trajectory to be considered. E Conducting a cohort study by creating a well-defined date from which a look forward window is deployed does not uniformly sample the trajectory in all individuals, but is still prospectively implementable since the starting date can be determined in real time.

Many factors have contributed to unconscious adoption of bias-susceptible experimental designs. From a data efficiency perspective, case-control studies are often motivated by large class imbalances. A case-control experiment is one of the only ways to take efficient advantage of all minority class observations in a model. The analogous cohort experiment would require identifying a starting alignment date common to all study subjects. Furthermore, longitudinal observational data are often expensive or difficult to acquire, compared to the ease of one-shot, non-temporal case-control datasets. Without the use of retrospective observations, a case-control study is one of the only types that can be conducted immediately after the study is conceived, rather than waiting for observations to be generated, as in prospective studies.

More concerningly, publication biases towards larger effect sizes and higher accuracy may have driven researchers towards methods that accentuate the differences between cases and controls. Temporal bias can be interpreted as a relatively invisible symptom of this subconscious aversion towards ambiguity in prognostic models. Strong predictive models (in terms of accuracy) are naturally easier to create when structural differences between the two groups are used to provide additional signal. The increasing popularity of large data sets and difficult-to-interpret deep learning techniques facilitates this strategy.

### False alarms and pseudo-epidemics: the limitations of observational epidemiology [^112yxhE5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Most reported associations in observational clinical research are false, and the minority of associations that are true are often exaggerated. This credibility problem has many causes, including the failure of authors, reviewers, and editors to recognize the inherent limitations of these studies. This issue is especially problematic for weak associations, variably defined as relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) less than 4. Such associations, commonly reported in the medical literature, are more likely to be attributable to bias than to causal association. All observational research has bias (which can include selection, information, and confounding bias). Hence, detection of small associations falls below the discriminatory ability of observational studies. In general, unless RRs in cohort studies exceed 2 to 3 or ORs in case-control studies exceed 3 or 4, associations in observational research findings should not be considered credible. However, these guidelines are not foolproof: strong (yet spurious) associations can result when large amounts of bias are present. Only in a properly performed randomized controlled trial, free of bias, should small associations merit attention. Better training and more circumspection on the part of investigators, tougher editorial standards on the part of journals, and hefty skepticism on the part of referees and readers are necessary to avoid the dangers of false alarms, pseudo-epidemics, and their unfortunate consequences.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^113myzqT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

Objectives

We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use.

Main Results

We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions. This review was commissioned by WHO and supported by Danube-University-Krems.

### Restarting human participant research at community-based observational studies during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1169Wv7A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

At the onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, just as public institutions and businesses closed, research programs performing human participant research (HPR) also largely ceased operations. With the partial ebbing of the pandemic in some areas, universities and healthcare organizations conducting HPR are considering reopening. Whereas guidelines from governmental authorities and medical specialty societies currently exist to help restarting health services and resuming clinical trials, no clear guidance is available to aid resumption of HPR at community-based observational cohort studies. Indefinite stoppage of observational research at cohort studies carries many drawbacks and its safe resumption is important and feasible. In this narrative review, we describe a potential path forward for safely reopening community-based observational studies, drawing on scientific knowledge and best practices from a variety of medical and lay sources. We highlight current recommendations regarding pandemic status assessment and the metrics useful for guiding decisions regarding safe reopening/reclosing and for screening and surveillance of COVID-19 among employees and participants. We synthesize insights from contemporary literature regarding infection prevention and environmental safety into a set of easy to operationalize plans for restructuring HPR. And lastly, we suggest ways in which observational studies can potentially aid the efforts to characterize the pandemic.

### Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses: systematic review [^114gMgiv]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We considered trials (individual level or cluster randomised, or quasi-randomised), observational studies (cohort and case-control designs), and any other comparative design, carried out in people of all ages and provided that some attempt had been made to control for confounding. We included any intervention to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses from animal to human or from human to human (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, or hygiene) compared with no intervention ("do nothing") or another intervention. We excluded vaccines and antivirals.

Outcome measures were mortality, numbers of cases of viral illness, the severity of viral illness, or proxies for any of these, and other measures of disease burden (such as admissions to hospital).

Search strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2), Medline (1966 to May week 1 2009), OldMedline (1950 to 1965), Embase (1990 to Week 18, 2009), and CINAHL (1982 to May week 1 2009); see the web extra on bmj.com for the search terms used for Medline and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (modified for OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL). No language restrictions were applied. Filters for study design included trials, cohort, case-control and crossover studies, before and after, and time series. We scanned the references of included studies for other potentially relevant studies. When necessary we corresponded with the first authors of studies to elicit further information.

We scanned the titles and abstracts of the studies identified by our search. When a study seemed to meet our eligibility criteria or information was insufficient to exclude it, we obtained the full text articles. We used a standardised form to assess the eligibility of each study, on the basis of the full article.

Quality assessment

We analysed randomised and non-randomised studies separately. Risk of bias in the randomised studies was assessed for the method of randomisation, generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. Non-randomised studies were assessed for the presence of potential confounders using the appropriate Newcastle-Ottawa scalesfor case-control and cohort studies, and a three point checklist for controlled before and after and ecological studies.

We assigned categories for risk of bias on the basis of the number of items judged inadequate in each study: up to one inadequate item represented a low risk of bias, up to three items a medium risk, and more than three items a high risk.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention — summary of the evidence notes that no direct comparative data from RCTs was identified; however, the search identified direct evidence from observational comparative cohort and case-control studies, and excluded non-comparative studies, case reports or summary of series case reports with which a denominator could not be identified, as well as studies in which authors were unable to ascertain a reliable COVID-19 diagnosis or studies done in community settings.

### Research protocol design and implementation of a hybrid no-touch and low-touch prospective observational study during the COVID-19 public health emergency: the VISION study [^113SPt8U]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Overall, the hybrid online/in-person study design is a cost-effective, safe and rapid method to gain large amounts of data during an infectious disease outbreak. Synthesising the online cohort with a subset of biospecimen collection provides rich and complementary data to the questionnaires and the creation of a biorepository of samples for planned and future analyses. This and similar study designs, plus integrating the lessons learnt during the implementation of the VISION study, can inform the development of future clinical health research investigations under the challenges of an infectious disease emergency.

### Cohort studies: marching towards outcomes [^117KPuTg]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

A cohort study tracks two or more groups forward from exposure to outcome. This type of study can be done by going ahead in time from the present (prospective cohort study) or, alternatively, by going back in time to comprise the cohorts and following them up to the present (retrospective cohort study). A cohort study is the best way to identify incidence and natural history of a disease, and can be used to examine multiple outcomes after a single exposure. However, this type of study is less useful for examination of rare events or those that take a long time to develop. A cohort study should provide specific definitions of exposures and outcomes: determination of both should be as objective as possible. The control group (unexposed) should be similar in all important respects to the exposed, with the exception of not having the exposure. Observational studies, however, rarely achieve such a degree of similarity, so investigators need to measure and control for confounding factors. Reduction of loss to follow-up over time is a challenge, since differential losses to follow-up introduce bias. Variations on the cohort theme include the before-after study and nested case-control study (within a cohort study). Strengths of a cohort study include the ability to calculate incidence rates, relative risks, and 95% CIs. This format is the preferred way of presenting study results, rather that with p values.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between water, sanitation, and hygiene exposures and cholera in case-control studies [^112dAtqs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

A limitation of the Yates review is that case–control studies were not included, as the methodology to assess case–control studies is different from that of other study types that were included, which were population-based. Case–control studies are observational studies in which individuals with a disease (cases) are recruited along with individuals who have not had the disease (controls). Exposures are retrospectively compared to determine how frequently various exposures are present in each group. Case–control studies are completed because they are inexpensive, rapid, cross-sectional, and provide evidence on whether exposures are protective factors or risk factors. Although they cannot determine causality, case–control studies provide some of the best evidence on health in emergencies and outbreaks because they are relatively easy to conduct even in a crisis and can yield information about the sources of the outbreak that can then be used to develop response activities.

To our knowledge, the evidence on the association between WASH exposures and cholera transmission has not been summarized from case–control studies. To fill this evidence gap, we performed a systematic review of cholera case–control studies to summarize the association between WASH exposures and cholera transmission.

### The value of medical registries and observational studies early in pandemics: the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience [^116ydgSP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Whereas randomized clinical trials remain the gold standard for evaluating new therapies for infections, we argue that registries and observational studies early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic provided invaluable understanding of the natural history and preliminary data on risk factors and possible treatments. We review the data from the current pandemic, the history of registries in general, and their value in public health emergencies. Lessons from these experiences should be incorporated into rigorous planning for the next pandemic.

### Case / control studies with follow-up: constructing the source population to estimate effects of risk factors on development, disease, and survival [^112xqbVZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A well-designed CCF study should be planned with the intent of estimating the association between antecedent exposures and outcomes during follow-up of the 2 cohorts. To enable the necessary weighting, such studies will ensure that appropriate estimates of case disease incidence, and thereby sampling weight, is captured. This poses particular challenges for CCF studies of infectious diseases, of which the GEMS — to our knowledge — is a conspicuous first. Because the incidence of infectious diseases, such as diarrhea, varies over time and often between relatively closely situated locales, this risk in GEMS is estimated using HUAS rounds undertaken periodically during the study, and not as a one-time snapshot. The HUAS-based sampling weights are thereby likely to approach a "real-time" representation of the exposures, case disease, and outcomes, thus increasing the validity of the weighted regression analyses. An estimate of incidence risk derived from such survey data pooled over the duration of the study might be used, if estimates for individual survey rounds seem sufficiently similar. When incidence risk estimates from sequential surveys differ substantially and pooling over time accordingly is questionable, our advice is to first estimate the composite estimates, which describe the effect of E on O for each survey round. This may be of particular relevance for studies that describe microbial agents' contribution to infectious disease, where microepidemics can cause substantial monthly, seasonal, and year-to-year variations. When relevant and appropriate, one can thereafter pool the composite effect sizes, thereby ensuring transparency and epidemiological clarity.

### Evidence for human-to-human transmission of hantavirus: a systematic review [^116KBmjA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The RoB in included studies is a particular concern when trying to determine whether human-to-human transmission of hantavirus is the best explanation for infection in other human contacts. A randomized controlled trial, where subjects are randomized to exposure to another human with hantavirus or to a nonexposure control group, in theory, would constitute the ideal study design. However, ethical and feasibility concerns make this kind of study impractical at this stage of our understanding of the problem. The next best study designs fall in the observational design category but also require the use of a control (or comparison) group, such as in a cohort or case-control design — which are commonly used designs for outbreak investigations. These would need to include the conduct of a multivariate analysis to control for potential confounders, especially environmental exposure to the excreta/secreta of infected rodents and the correct and consistent use of personal protective equipment (for studies of healthcare workers). The possibility of confounding due to co-exposure of the contact to the excreta/secreta of rodents with hantavirus and bias due to measurement of the exposure (interpersonal contact with a person with hantavirus infection) require particular attention for this research question. Furthermore, all but 1 of the comparative studies had serious risk of differential misclassification of the exposure due to limited information about the duration, type or time of contact with the infected person, and environmental co-exposure to the excreta/secreta of infected rodents. Thus, the investigation of cases and contacts should include the characterization of the type of activity during the interpersonal contact (including the possibility of exposure to bodily fluids or aerosolized virus particles) and the duration and frequency of the interpersonal contact. In addition, environmental investigation of all places frequented by each case and contact (workplace, home, leisure) should be undertaken.

### Six persistent research misconceptions [^114YpTzi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Similarly, discrepancies between cohort studies and case–control studies should not be explained away superficially by a presumed validity advantage for cohort studies over case–control studies. Properly designed case–control studies will produce the same results as properly designed cohort studies. When conflicts arise, they could stem from problems in either or both types of study. Although case–control studies have long been disparaged as being backwards versions of cohort studies, starting from disease and tracing back to possible causes, epidemiologists today understand case–control studies to be conceptually identical to cohort studies, apart from an efficiency gain that comes from sampling the denominators rather than conducting a complete census. Indeed, the efficiency gain may allow more resources for exposure assessment or case validation in case–control studies, resulting in less bias than in corresponding cohort studies of the same relation.

Those who view case–control studies as backwards versions of cohort studies sometimes make the false analogy that the controls should closely resemble the cases, except that they lack the case-defining disease. In fact, the control group in a case–control study is intended to be a sample of the population denominator that gives rise to the cases, a substitute for the full denominators obtained in a cohort study. Thus, the control group should resemble the entire study population, rather than the cases. When properly designed, case–control studies can achieve the same excellent validity as properly designed cohort studies, whereas a poorly designed trial can be unreliable. The type of study should not be taken as a guide to a study's validity.

Misconception 2. An essential element of making valid generalizations from a study is that the study subjects constitute a representative sample of a target population.

### Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies [^111WRJNR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the systematic review, and PRISMA 2020 for the reporting.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

We will adhere to the eligibility criteria set forth in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the PRISMA 2020 guidelines.

Types of studies

We will consider the following comparative study designs.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) – where participants are randomly assigned to either the testing strategy or a control group (or another testing strategy).
Non‐randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) – where participants are allocated to different testing strategy groups using a non‐random method.
Controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs) – where the allocation of participants to comparison groups is not determined by the investigators. The outcomes of interest are measured in both the testing strategy group and the control/alternate testing strategy group before and after the testing strategy is implemented. These studies carry a higher risk of bias due to the potential presence of unrecognised differences between the intervention and control groups (such as allocation at the level of cluster), which could influence changes in the outcome measure. For CBAs, we will assess clustering effects and baseline comparability between groups. Studies with single clusters per arm or substantial baseline imbalances will be analysed separately with appropriate caution in interpretation.
Matched cohort studies of interventions – observational studies in which participants with and without the testing strategy will be matched on key confounding variables relevant to the outcomes, such as age, sex, comorbidities, and exposure risk, and their outcomes will be compared.

Studies of the designs mentioned above must meet at least one of the following criteria.

Collected quantitative data on at least one outcome relevant to this review at least once after the intervention
Estimated the effects of the intervention on the same or different individuals by comparing outcomes at multiple timepoints before and after the intervention
Estimated the differences between groups receiving the intervention of interest and a comparator

We have considered this wide range of study designs because randomised trials are often not suitable for addressing questions about the effectiveness of health system interventions and implementation strategies. Specifically, testing strategies are often implemented at the system level, and randomisation may not be feasible or ethical.

We will include all settings.

Exclusion criteria

Single‐arm studies, including case reports and case series
Review articles
Theses, editorials, letters, and commentaries
Results reported only in abstract form (due to limited information on study methods)
Laboratory and animal studies
Mathematical modelling studies

### Risk factors and protective measures for healthcare worker infection during highly infectious viral respiratory epidemics: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113mHPEt]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

The study was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelinesand was guided by specifications outlined in the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies (MOOSE) recommendations. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020176232) on April 6, 2020.

The search strategy was developed in consultation with a medical librarian and was conducted according to recommendations in the Cochrane Rapid Review guide. The searches were conducted in electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL from database conception until July 6, 2020 (Appendixonline). We excluded case reports, case series, editorials, narrative reviews, consensus opinions, news articles, and letters to the editor. Searches were restricted to articles written in English and studies involving human subjects only.

Titles and abstracts were screened to identify potentially eligible studies, which subsequently underwent full-text review for study inclusion using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Literature screening and eligibility assessment was performed independently by 2 reviewers (C.T. O.L.) at all stages. Reasons for exclusion were documented at each stage. Data extraction was conducted independently by 2 authors (C.T. O.L.) using a standardized data extraction form. Opinions from senior authors were solicited to resolve any conflicts.

Studies were included if the study population was comprised of HCWs in a healthcare setting with pandemic respiratory disease with a similar outbreak and transmission dynamics (droplet size) to COVID-19, including MERS, SARS, H1N1, and H5N1. Studies describing nonrespiratory infectious diseases, infectious diseases not defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as epidemic or pandemic (eg, seasonal influenza), and diseases occurring in nonhealthcare settings were excluded. HCWs were defined as all staff in a healthcare facility involved in the provision of care to patients, not only those directly providing patient care. Only comparative studies with a valid infected HCW (cases) group and a noninfected HCW (control) group were included. Therefore, studies that reported the prevalence of risk factors (described below) in both case and control groups were eligible for inclusion. We included observational studies (eg, cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control studies) and experimental studies (eg, randomized control trials [RCTs]).

### Observational studies [^112ABYFd]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Studies can be observational or experimental. With an observational study, the investigator does not determine the assignment of subjects, and there might not be a control group. If there is a control group, assignment of the independent variable (exposure or intervention) is not under the control of the investigator. Observational studies can be rigorously conducted, but the lack of random assignment of the exposure/intervention introduces confounding and bias. Thus, the quality of evidence resulting from observational studies is lower than that of experimental randomized controlled trials (RCTs). An observational study might be performed if an RCT is unethical, impractical, or outside the control of the investigator. There are many types of prospective and retrospective observational study designs. However, an observational study design should be avoided if an experimental study is possible. Sophisticated statistical approaches can be used, but this does not elevate an observational study to the level of an RCT. Regardless of quality, an observational study cannot establish causality.

### Characteristics of vaccine safety observational studies and authors' attitudes: a systematic review [^111tM74q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postlicensure observational studies are the mainstay of vaccine safety evaluation. However, these studies have well-known methodological limitations, rendering them particularly vulnerable to unmeasured confounding. We sought to describe high-impact observational studies of vaccine safety, investigate the authors' attitudes toward their study's findings and limitations, and report on spin practices.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed systematic review of comparative observational studies of vaccine safety published in the 6 top medical journals from inception to March 2024.

Results

Thirty-seven studies were included, spanning publications from 1995 to 2024. Most studies focused on COVID-19 and influenza vaccines (n = 11, 30%, and n = 10, 27%, respectively). Study designs and methodologies varied. Electronic health records (54%), passive surveillance databases (32%), and national registries (27%) were the most common data sources. Negative control outcomes were used in a single study. Residual confounding was conceded in 54% of studies, and an additional 24% did so implicitly. Spin was noted in 48.6% of the studies. This systematic review found that authors of observational vaccine safety studies in high-impact medical journals often acknowledge residual confounding, but rarely use methods like negative control outcomes to better detect unmeasured confounding. Furthermore, spin is common, occurring in approximately 50% of the studies.

Conclusions

Although our findings are somewhat limited by subjectivity in study assessments, they suggest that editors and reviewers of high-impact journals should ensure that the language used in reporting observational studies accurately reflects the findings and their limitations.

### Risk of death following chikungunya virus disease in the 100 million Brazilian cohort, 2015–18: a matched cohort study and self-controlled case series [^116v2F3d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Chikungunya virus outbreaks have been associated with excess deaths at the ecological level. Previous studies have assessed the risk factors for severe versus mild chikungunya virus disease. However, the risk of death following chikungunya virus disease compared with the risk of death in individuals without the disease remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate the risk of death in the 2 years following chikungunya virus disease.

Methods

We used a population-based cohort study and a self-controlled case series to estimate mortality risks associated with chikungunya virus disease between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, in Brazil. The dataset was created by linking national databases for social programmes, notifiable diseases, and mortality. For the matched cohort design, individuals with chikungunya virus disease recorded between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2018, were considered as exposed and those who were arbovirus disease-free and alive during the study period were considered as unexposed. For the self-controlled case series, we included all deaths from individuals with a chikungunya virus disease record, and each individual acted as their own control according to different study periods relative to the date of disease. The primary outcome was all-cause natural mortality up to 728 days after onset of chikungunya virus disease symptoms, and secondary outcomes were cause-specific deaths, including ischaemic heart diseases, diabetes, and cerebrovascular diseases.

Findings

In the matched cohort study, we included 143787 individuals with chikungunya virus disease who were matched, at the day of symptom onset, to unexposed individuals using sociodemographic factors. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of death within 7 days of chikungunya symptom onset was 8.40 (95% CI 4.83–20.09) as compared with the unexposed group and decreased to 2.26 (1.50–3.77) at 57–84 days and 1.05 (0.82–1.35) at 85–168 days, with IRR close to 1 and wide CI in the subsequent periods. For the secondary outcomes, the IRR of deaths within 28 days after disease onset were: 1.80 (0.58–7.00) for cerebrovascular diseases, 3.75 (1.33–17.00) for diabetes, and 3.67 (1.25–14.00) for ischaemic heart disease, and there was no evidence of increased risk in the subsequent periods. For the self-controlled case series study, 1933 individuals died after having had chikungunya virus disease and were included in the analysis. The IRR of all-cause natural death within 7 days of symptom onset of chikungunya virus disease was 8.75 (7.18–10.66) and decreased to 1.59 (1.26–2.00) at 57–84 days and 1.09 (0.92–1.29) at 85–168 days. For the secondary outcomes, the IRRs of deaths within 28 days after disease onset were: 2.73 (1.50–4.96) for cerebrovascular diseases, 8.43 (5.00–14.21) for diabetes, and 2.38 (1.33–4.26) for ischaemic heart disease, and there was no evidence of increased risk at 85–168 days.

Interpretation

Chikungunya virus disease is associated with an increased risk of death for up to 84 days after symptom onset, including deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, and diabetes. This study highlights the need for equitable access to approved vaccines and effective anti-chikungunya virus therapeutics and reinforces the importance of robust vector-control efforts to reduce viral transmission.

### Case / control studies with follow-up: constructing the source population to estimate effects of risk factors on development, disease, and survival [^114GqPVw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

If individuals in a case/control study are subsequently observed as a cohort of cases and a cohort of controls, weighted regression analyses can be used to estimate the association between the exposures initially recorded and events occurring during the follow-up of the 2 cohorts. Such analyses can be conceptualized as being undertaken on a reconstructed source population from which cases and controls stem. To simulate this population, the cohort of cases is added to the cohort of controls expanded with the reciprocal of the case disease incidence odds (the sampling weight) to include all individuals in the source population who did not develop the case disease. We use a simulated dataset to illustrate how weighted generalized linear model regression can be used to estimate the association between an exposure captured during the case/control study component and an outcome that occurs during follow-up.

### Effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112diVQh]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Study characteristics

Studies assessing individual measures

Thirty five studies provided estimates on the effectiveness of an individual public health measures. The studies were conducted in Asia (n = 11), the United States (n = 9), Europe (n = 7), the Middle East (n = 3), Africa (n = 3), South America (n = 1), and Australia (n = 1). Thirty four of the studies were observational and one was a randomised controlled trial. The study designs of the observational studies comprised natural experiments (n = 11), quasi-experiments (n = 3), a prospective cohort (n = 1), retrospective cohorts (n = 8), case-control (n = 2), and cross sectional (n = 9). Twenty six studies assessed social measures,12 studies assessed personal protective measures, three studies assessed travel related measures, and one study assessed environmental measures(some interventions overlapped across studies). The most commonly measured outcome was incidence of covid-19 (n = 18), followed by SARS-CoV-2 transmission, measured as reproductive number, growth number, or epidemic doubling time (n = 13), and covid-19 mortality (n = 8). Table 1 in supplementary material 3 provides detailed information on each study.

Effects of interventions

Personal protective measures

Handwashing and covid-19 incidence — Three studies with a total of 292 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 10 345 participants were included in the analysis of the effect of handwashing on incidence of covid-19. Overall pooled analysis suggested an estimated 53% non-statistically significant reduction in covid-19 incidence (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I² = 12%) (fig 3). A sensitivity analysis without adjustment showed a significant reduction in covid-19 incidence (0.49, 0.33 to 0.72, I² = 12%) (fig 4). Risk of bias across the three studies ranged from moderateto serious or critical(fig 2).

### SARS-CoV-2 infection following booster vaccination: illness and symptom profile in a prospective, observational community-based case-control study [^116anB89]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Ongoing surveillance of predominant COVID-19 variants and effectiveness of current vaccines against emerging variants remain vital components of the coordinated international response to the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19. Future research should consider effects of further booster vaccinations (such as the seasonal spring and autumn booster programmes) using bivalent vaccines approved in the UK and other comparator settings, on risk of infection, indicators of disease severity, and symptom profile.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^111fkzSC]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines — evidence grading and development describe that for each major disease condition, recommendations for the process of care, including the history, physical exam and ancillary tests, are summarized, and that for each PPP, a detailed literature search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library is conducted, with results reviewed by an expert panel and given a rating that shows the strength of evidence when sufficient evidence exists. To rate individual studies, a scale based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) is used with levels: I++ high-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias; I+ well-conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a low risk of bias; I- meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of bias; II++ high-quality systematic reviews of case-control or cohort studies; high-quality case-control or cohort studies with a very low risk of confounding or bias and a high probability that the relationship is causal; II+ well-conducted case-control or cohort studies with a low risk of confounding or bias and a moderate probability that the relationship is causal; II- case-control or cohort studies with a high risk of confounding or bias and a significant risk that the relationship is not causal; and III nonanalytic studies (e.g., case reports, case series).

### Evaluating agreement between bodies of evidence from randomized controlled trials and cohort studies in medical research: a meta-epidemiological study [^117RHRjd]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Data extraction was performed by two reviewers independently (NB, LH). The following data were extracted for each BoE: effect estimates, type of effect measure, 95% confidence interval (CI), number of studies, number of participants, number of events, and certainty of the evidence. Further, we extracted information on study characteristics of primary studies for each BoE: description of the study population, intervention/exposure, comparator, design of the primary study, intervention duration, and follow-up and risk of bias/study quality.

If RCTs were pooled with other types of studies (e.g. quasi-experimental RCTs), we performed a meta-analysis excluding these other study types. The rationale for this approach was the suggestion in the new Cochrane handbook to classify quasi-experimental RCTs as non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI). This was the case for three BoE from RCTs. Accordingly, meta-analyses of cohort studies were recalculated if they included other study types (e.g. case-control studies); this was the case for 35 BoE from cohort studies. If RCTs and cohort studies were pooled without subgroup analysis by study type, we performed separate meta-analyses; this was the case for nine BoE-pairs. Upon request, authors from one systematic review provided data to perform separate meta-analyses. In two BoE-pairs from one systematic review evaluating infection outcomes of influenza vaccines RCTs with different populations (community-dwelling and institutionalized) were combined in a single meta-analysis; we pooled respective cohort studies that were initially not combined. For ten BoE pairs, we pooled different types of cohort studies (e.g. clinical cohorts, population-based cohorts) that were not pooled in the corresponding systematic review. If there was a meta-analysis for the BoE from one study type (e.g. RCTs) and a corresponding BoE from the other study type (e.g. cohort studies) was not pooled but relevant data were available, we pooled the respective primary studies: cohort studies for nine BoE pairs and primary RCTs for one BoE pair.

### Investigation of outbreaks complicated by universal exposure [^116ME8P4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Outbreaks in which most or all persons were exposed to the same suspected source of infection, so-called universal exposure, are common. They represent a challenge for public health specialists because conducting analytical studies in such investigations is complicated by the absence of a nonexposed group. We describe different strategies that can support investigations of outbreaks with universal exposure. The value of descriptive epidemiology, extensive environmental investigation, and the hypothesis-generation phase cannot be overemphasized. An exposure that seems universal may in fact not be universal when additional aspects of the exposure are taken into account. Each exposure has unique characteristics that may not be captured when investigators rely on the tools readily at hand, such as standard questionnaires. We therefore encourage field epidemiologists to be creative and consider the use of alternative data sources or original techniques in their investigations of outbreaks with universal exposure.

### Investigation of outbreaks complicated by universal exposure [^114MEc4G]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Optimizing Dose-Response Analysis

Assessing a dose-response relationship is a well-known analytical tool for identifying the source of an outbreak. An increased risk for disease or increased severity of symptoms with increased exposure dose indicates such a dose-response relation between the suspected source and the illness. Normally, the reference category in a dose-response analysis is the unexposed group, but in outbreaks with universal exposure, the lowest exposure category can be used as a reference group instead.

Exposure levels should be considered in the design phase of the analytical study to ensure that dose response can be evaluated in the analysis stage. Questions about quantities can aim at either the exact quantity (e.g. the number of glasses tap water per day, the number of canapés eaten at a wedding reception) or at more qualitative levels of exposure (e.g. a bite, half a portion, 1 portion, > 1 portion). How best to assess dose depends on the type of food investigated and the circumstances under which it was consumed.

In cohort studies, attack rates and relative risks can be calculated for each level of exposure. In case-control studies, the proportion of persons exposed to each level of exposure can be calculated for case-patients and controls and odds ratios calculated for each level of exposure. The group with the lowest exposure will serve as reference group. An increase in attack rate (cohort study) and effect size (risk ratio or odds ratio) with increasing dose, supported by a statistical test for trend, implicates a dose-response relation.

Two examples illustrate investigations of outbreaks linked to tap water in which the reference group consisted of those with the lowest exposure rather than an unexposed group. An outbreak of campylobacteriosis in Norway was associated with consumption of tap water. A cohort study showed that the attack rate increased from 40% for those who had drunk 1–3 glasses per day (the reference group) to ≈65% for those who had drunk > 6 glasses of tap water per day. In the previously mentioned outbreak of giardiasis in Bergen, Norway, a case–control study showed that persons who drank the largest quantity of water had the highest risk for illness; the strength of the association (odds ratio) increased with increased water consumption. Assessing a dose-response relationship may be more complicated if the exposure cannot be readily quantified or if the vehicle is heavily contaminated.

### Distinguishing case series from cohort studies [^114n42BZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Case series are a commonly reported study design, but the label "case series" is used inconsistently and sometimes incorrectly. Mislabeling impairs the appropriate indexing and sorting of evidence. This article tries to clarify the concept of case series and proposes a way to distinguish them from cohort studies. In a cohort study, patients are sampled on the basis of exposure and are followed over time, and the occurrence of outcomes is assessed. A cohort study may include a comparison group, although this is not a necessary feature. A case series may be a study that samples patients with both a specific outcome and a specific exposure, or one that samples patients with a specific outcome and includes patients regardless of whether they have specific exposures. Whereas a cohort study, in principle, enables the calculation of an absolute risk or a rate for the outcome, such a calculation is not possible in a case series.

### Case-control studies: research in reverse [^116SZwLt]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Epidemiologists benefit greatly from having case-control study designs in their research armamentarium. Case-control studies can yield important scientific findings with relatively little time, money, and effort compared with other study designs. This seemingly quick road to research results entices many newly trained epidemiologists. Indeed, investigators implement case-control studies more frequently than any other analytical epidemiological study. Unfortunately, case-control designs also tend to be more susceptible to biases than other comparative studies. Although easier to do, they are also easier to do wrong. Five main notions guide investigators who do, or readers who assess, case-control studies. First, investigators must explicitly define the criteria for diagnosis of a case and any eligibility criteria used for selection. Second, controls should come from the same population as the cases, and their selection should be independent of the exposures of interest. Third, investigators should blind the data gatherers to the case or control status of participants or, if impossible, at least blind them to the main hypothesis of the study. Fourth, data gatherers need to be thoroughly trained to elicit exposure in a similar manner from cases and controls; they should use memory aids to facilitate and balance recall between cases and controls. Finally, investigators should address confounding in case-control studies, either in the design stage or with analytical techniques. Devotion of meticulous attention to these points enhances the validity of the results and bolsters the reader's confidence in the findings.

### Seroepidemiologic study designs for determining SARS-COV-2 transmission and immunity [^115onvX3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Cohort Studies

In cohort studies, the same persons are followed over time and samples collected periodically (Figure 2, panel D). During the intervening period, or at the point of sample collection, information might be collected on symptoms, healthcare use, and potential risk factors for infection. Cohort studies provide rich information but are expensive and labor-intensive to conduct. These studies might be conducted in communities, among specific populations (e.g. healthcare workers or pregnant women), or for biobanking. Cohorts can suffer from attrition, which causes issues in analyzing and interpreting the results. Therefore, during the pandemic, assessing whether cohorts should be collecting samples from, or information on, cohort participants who have died might be warranted.

Long-standing cohort studies might have historic serum samples to determine preepidemic non–SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus serologic profiles. In the short term, cohort studies can determine the incidence of infection. Concurrent symptom surveillance and acute illness sampling within cohorts can add considerable information and help determine the ratio of asymptomatic to clinically apparent infections. However, because of limits in cohort size, the number of severe cases might be insufficient to precisely estimate ratios of infection to severe illness and death.

Cohort studies might be useful to determine correlates of protection and the duration and waning of immunity. Depending on the size, demographics, and geographic distribution of the cohort, these studies might provide information on the serologic profile in different population subgroups. However, in some cases, these cohorts might be geographically or demographically restricted, so extrapolation to the whole population might not be possible.

Using existing cohorts, after making adjustments to ensure the cohorts capture information relevant to COVID-19, obviates the need to set up new cohorts. However, ongoing cohort studies might face restrictions on data and sample collection during the outbreak, and innovation might be needed.

### Learning from post-COVID-19 condition for epidemic preparedness: a variable catalogue for future post-acute infection syndromes [^113E2E33]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Scope

The emergence of post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) after SARS-CoV-2 infection underscores the critical need for preparedness in addressing future post-acute infection syndromes (PAIS), particularly those linked to epidemic outbreaks. The lack of standardized clinical and epidemiological data during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hindered timely diagnosis and effective treatment of PCC, highlighting the necessity of pre-emptively standardizing data collection in clinical studies to better define and manage future PAIS. In response, the Cohort Coordination Board, a consortium of European-funded COVID-19 research projects, has reviewed data from PCC studies conducted by its members. This paper leverages the Cohort Coordination Board's expertise to propose a standardized catalogue of variables, informed by the lessons learned during the pandemic, intended for immediate use in the design of future observational studies and clinical trials for emerging infections of epidemic potential.

Recommendations

The early implementation of standardized data collection, facilitated by the PAIS data catalogue, is essential for accelerating the identification and management of PAIS in future epidemics. This approach will enable more precise syndrome definitions, expedite diagnostic processes, and optimize treatment strategies, while also supporting long-term follow-up of affected individuals. The availability of harmonized data collection protocols will enhance preparedness across European and international cohort studies, and trials enabling a prompt and coordinated response, as well as more efficient resource allocation, in the event of emerging infections and associated PAIS.

### Lessons from the European mpox outbreak: strengthening cohort research for future pandemic preparedness [^115YPbAs]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Well-designed cohort studies are crucial for pandemic preparedness informing evidence-based infection prevention and treatment strategies.

Objectives

Following the 2022 mpox outbreak in Europe, this scoping review critically evaluates the design, implementation, and characteristics of cohort studies focusing on mpox. The aim is to inform recommendations for the Cohort Coordination Board and CoMeCT to enhance cohort study research and improve preparedness.

Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the ECRIN metadata repository up to December 2024.

Content

Forty-nine cohorts were identified, encompassing 10,728 individuals with primary or breakthrough mpox and 34,010 individuals without mpox (vaccinated and unvaccinated). The majority of cohorts collected data prospectively (30, 63%) and were multicentre (25, 52%). The primary aims were natural history of mpox (31, 65%); effectiveness of vaccination (15, 31%); and treatment (2, 4%). The most frequent target population was individuals at increased risk of sexually transmitted infection (18, 38%). Follow up of participants varied widely among cohorts. Significant data heterogeneity, stemming from the inconsistent use of standardised data dictionaries, impeded data sharing and meta-analyses. Under-representation of vulnerable populations and limited biobanking further compounded these challenges.

Implications

This review underscores critical gaps in the research response during the mpox outbreak. Based on these findings, we propose the following recommendations: (1) Establishing and maintaining "ever-warm" cohorts of high-risk individuals during inter-epidemic periods to enable rapid data collection during future outbreaks; (2) Promoting data interoperability through the development and adoption of standardised data collection tools, and ontologies; (3) Improving the quality of study reporting through strict adherence to relevant guidelines; and (4) Strengthening European and global coordination through the establishment of collaborative research networks. Sustained investment in research infrastructure is essential for a more effective, equitable, and timely public health response to future outbreaks.

### Comparability of control and comparison groups in studies assessing long COVID [^114CwqSF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Awareness of long coronavirus disease (COVID) began primarily through media and social media sources, which eventually led to the development of various definitions based on methodologies of varying quality. We sought to characterize comparison groups in long COVID studies and evaluate comparability of the different groups.

Methods

We searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed for original research articles published in high-impact journals. We included studies on human patients with long COVID outcomes, and we abstracted study-related characteristics, as well as long COVID characteristics.

Results

Of the 83 studies, 3 were randomized controlled trials testing interventions for long COVID, and 80 (96.4%) were observational studies. Among the 80 observational studies, 76 (95%) were trying to understand the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors for long COVID, 2 (2.5%) examined prevention strategies, and 2 (2.5%) examined treatment strategies. Among those 80 studies, 45 (56.2%) utilized a control or comparison group and 35 (43.8%) did not. Compared with 95% of observational studies that documented symptoms or assessed risk factors, all randomized studies assessed treatment strategies. We found 48.8% of observational studies did any adjustment for covariates, including demographics or health status. Of those that did adjust for covariates, 15 (38.5%) adjusted for 4 or fewer variables. We found that 26.5% of all studies and 45.8% of studies with a control/comparator group matched participants on at least 1 variable.

Conclusion

Long COVID studies in high-impact journals primarily examine symptoms and risk factors of long COVID; often lack an adequate comparison group and often do not control for potential confounders. Our results suggest that standardized definitions for long COVID, which are often based on data from uncontrolled and potentially biased studies, should be reviewed to ensure that they are based on objective data.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection following booster vaccination: illness and symptom profile in a prospective, observational community-based case-control study [^111FnP8c]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. The mobile application data collection method facilitates collection of daily prospective information on a comprehensive set of symptoms, permitting analysis of both individual symptoms and overall illness duration (although note that necessary data censoring could have underestimated symptom duration for both cases and controls, as some individuals only had 2 weeks of logging after their positive test result). The matching of cases and controls on time since vaccination and timing of the post-vaccination test reduced the potential for bias, although small differences between the groups remained on matched variables. We acknowledge potential differences in logging by vaccinated individuals or those undertaking regular COVID-19 testing during the study period (for example, if required for work). Access to testing is a potential source of bias, although this was mitigated by only including reported infections up until April 1st, 2022, after which free tests were no longer universally available in the UK.

Our study has some limitations. We were unable to include an unvaccinated control group for comparison, as there were very few unvaccinated individuals enrolled at the time of the study. Our findings might not apply at all timepoints post-vaccination, to countries with different recommended vaccination types and schedules, or settings with different proportions of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Additionally, the data were self-reported; recording of comorbidities, test results, and vaccination status might not have been completely accurate and there might have been temporal gaps in reporting. We cannot exclude potential bias in self-reporting due to vaccination status – boosted individuals may have been less likely to report severe symptoms if they felt "protected" from the booster vaccination. Users of the COVID Symptom Study app are asked to log daily; therefore, if a participant reports on alternate days, the proportion of missing daily entries is 50%. However, given the typical duration of COVID-19 symptoms, the sampling frequencies in the COVID Symptom Study should have allowed good characterisation of infections. Only participants with at least 12 weeks of symptom reporting following the positive test were included; individuals with ongoing symptoms ≥ 12 weeks may have been affected by the long period of reporting required, and the size of the affected population underestimated. We only looked at waning of the protective effects of vaccination up to 6months, as there was limited data on participants after this date.

### Implementation of the 7–1–7 target for detection, notification, and response to public health threats in five countries: a retrospective, observational study [^115abDTV]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Data collection

Countries conducted desk reviews of selected events to complete structured templates and supplemented existing outbreak, situation, and intra-action and after-action reviews with inputs from subnational and national-level responders. Government officials responsible for the detection and response to these events identified milestone dates (date of emergence [t 0], date of detection [t d], date of notification [t n], and dates of each of seven early response actions [t r1–7]), as well as bottlenecks (conditions that delayed actions) and enablers (conditions that facilitated prompt actions). Definitions of timeliness milestones are provided in the panel and appendix (p 2).

Panel
7–1–7 timeliness milestones and definitions

Date of emergence

- For endemic diseases, date on which a predetermined increase in case incidence over baseline rates occurred
- For non-endemic diseases, date on which the index case or first epidemiologically linked case first experienced symptoms
- For other public health events, date the threat first met criteria as a reportable event based on country reporting standards

Date of detection

- Date the event is first recorded by any source or in any system

Date of notification

- Date the event is first reported to a public health authority responsible for action

Date of completion of early response actions

- **Date on which all applicable early response actions were completed**:

- Initiate investigation or deploy investigation or response team
- Conduct epidemiological analysis of burden, severity, and risk factors, and perform initial risk assessment
- Obtain laboratory confirmation of the outbreak aetiology
- Initiate appropriate case management and infection prevention and control measures in health facilities
- Initiate appropriate public health countermeasures in affected communities
- Initiate appropriate risk communication and community engagement activities
- Establish a coordination mechanism

During 2021–22, government officials responsible for detection and response to health events in each country convened for a 1-day workshop to validate findings from the desk reviews and build consensus on priority bottleneck areas that would benefit from performance improvement. Because data were collected from existing response documentation and did not include personally identifiable information, the Resolve to Save Lives ethical review committee determined that this activity did not constitute human subject research. In addition, the ministry of health, national public health institutes, health department, or appropriate ethical bodies or institutional review boards in each country reviewed the protocols, made a non-human subject research determination, and gave permission to publish aggregate data.

ASSUMPTION 4: THE APPROPRIATE EPIDEMIOLOGIC DESIGN FOR IDENTIFYING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PATHOGENS ASSOCIATED WITH MSD IS A MATCHED CASE/CONTROL STUDY

Whereas diarrheal illness among children in developing countries is common, cases of a severity that meet the definition of MSD constitute only a fraction of all pediatric diarrhea cases. Thus, utilizing a prospective cohort design with active household-based surveillance would require a very large cohort. Moreover, active household surveillance would likely modify the true incidence of MSD, since milder forms of diarrhea (when detected) would be treated and the evolution of the illness might be interrupted; that is, without having been detected by household visits, some of those diarrhea cases would have progressed to MSD and would have been detected when care was sought at a fixed healthcare facility. By contrast, a properly designed and executed prospective case/control study can accomplish the objective in a more practical, economical, and cost-effective way. An age-, sex- and village or neighborhood-matched control selection strategy was selected to limit potential confounding by factors that may not be easily controlled for in statistical analysis, thus ensuring the integrity of the results. The advantages and caveats of case/control studies have been reviewed. This type of study must be meticulously designed both with respect to identification of the MSD cases and selection of matched controls. A Steering Committee on Epidemiologic and Clinical Issues replete with individuals with expertise in case/control study design and in the performance of such studies in developing countries (Table 1) was instrumental in influencing the design of GEMS-1 and in attention to details of both case and control selection.

### A cross-sectional community-based observational study of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the greater Indianapolis area [^117BDfWd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The World Health Organization first declared a pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) on 11 March 2020. As of 18 May 2020, over 4.7 million people have confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection worldwide and over 315 000 deaths. Important for understanding the nature of the pandemic, and efforts for slowing its spread, is to assess the number of persons affected across the disease spectrum. Repeated studies have confirmed a high proportion of asymptomatic cases, with current estimates indicating between 18% and 50% of SARS‐CoV‐2 cases in local or contained outbreaks are asymptomatic. Most testing efforts for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the early months of the pandemic have focused on symptomatic people, persons at high risk due to occupational exposure, or persons at high risk for adverse outcomes. Further, the transmission of the virus has been documented from asymptomatic persons. As such, studies to understand the extent of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection among asymptomatic populations are of specific interest.

The Asymptomatic novel CORonavirus iNfection (ACORN) study was designed to investigate the prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the asymptomatic adult population of the Indianapolis (Indiana) metropolitan area, and to follow individuals testing positive for the development of symptoms and to understand the duration of positive test results. Prevalence data from the ACORN study are presented here, along with interim follow‐up data.

### Long-term risks of respiratory diseases in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2: a longitudinal, population-based cohort study [^114FL3ji]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cohorts

COVID-19 infection was defined as the first positive result on COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or patients being initially diagnosed with COVID-19 (U07.1 and U07.2) in medical records between January 30th, 2020 and October 30th, 2022. Then, we focused on individuals who survived for over 30 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis (n = 112,311) to investigate outcomes during the post-acute phase, which constituted the COVID-19 group. Further details about the cohorts can be found in Supplementary Notes.

To explore the impact of COVID-19 on respiratory disease, two control groups were constructed to examine the associations — a contemporary control group and a historical control group. The contemporary control group was constituted by individuals who were alive by January 30th, 2020 and but not included in the COVID-19 group. To further compare the impact of COVID-19 with a control group unaffected by the pandemic, the historical control group was comprising by individuals who were started from January 31st, 2017 (3 years prior to the pandemic) after being excluded in the COVID-19 group. Participants who died before January 30th, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak (n = 28,980) and those who were lost to follow-up (n = 1298) were omitted.

To ensure comparable follow-up time distributions, the start time of follow-up for the contemporary control group was randomly assigned based on the start time of follow-up for the COVID-19 group. Simultaneously, for the historical control group, the start time of follow-up was assigned randomly, using a similar distribution as the start of follow-up minus three years in the COVID-19 group.

For each patient, the follow-up deadline was until the first date of outcome, mortality, or October 30th, 2022 for contemporary cohort and October 30th, 2019 for historical cohort, whichever occurred first.

### Recovery and symptom trajectories up to two years after SARS-CoV-2 infection: population based, longitudinal cohort study [^111McMMt]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Post-covid-19 condition affects 20–30% of unvaccinated individuals three to six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To adequately inform patients, healthcare providers, and policy makers, not only is determining prevalence important but also its natural course over time. As evidence on the substantial public health burden of post-covid-19 condition accumulates, clinical trials are necessary to establish interventions that accelerate recovery or provide relief for associated symptoms. A solid understanding of trajectories and relevant outcome measures of post-covid-19 condition is required to effectively design and adequately interpret such trials.

Several studies assessed long term outcomes related to post-covid-19 condition and found that 22–75% of individuals had symptoms for more than a year after infection. Most of these studies included specific populations, such as patients in hospital, focused on a specific dimension of post-covid-19 condition, did not have a prospective follow-up, or suffered from relevant attrition rates. Thus, these studies might not reflect the variability of symptoms and recovery over time, and their generalisability across the severity spectrum of acute covid-19 might be limited. Additionally, most studies assessing post-covid-19 condition did not have a comparator group, and their findings were often questioned because many reported symptoms were non-specific and common in the general population without an infection. Limited knowledge and no consensus on core outcomes regarding post-covid-19 condition has led to the use of various outcome measures across observational studies affecting their comparability. These issues also impair the interpretation of trials of interventions targeting post-covid-19 condition and their translation into healthcare policy and clinical practice.

In this study, we aimed to address some of the limitations of the existing evidence by comprehensively characterising the course of post-covid-19 condition within a population based, longitudinal cohort of individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to describe patterns of recovery and symptom persistence over 24 months and to determine the attributable risk of related symptoms by comparing their prevalence in individuals who were individuals with a general population cohort with no evidence of past infection.

### How outbreaks can contribute to prevention of nosocomial infection: analysis of 1, 022 outbreaks [^1178xLnT]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the epidemiology of nosocomial outbreaks published in the scientific literature.

Design

Descriptive information was obtained from a sample of 1,022 published nosocomial outbreaks from 1966 to 2002.

Methods

Published nosocomial outbreaks of the most important nosocomial pathogens were included in the database. A structured questionnaire was devised to extract information in a systematic manner on nosocomial outbreaks published in the literature. The following items were used: the reference, type of study (case reports or studies applying epidemiologic or fingerprinting methods), type of microorganism, setting, patients and personnel involved, type of infection, source of infection, mode of transmission, risk factors identified, and preventive measures applied.

Results

Bloodstream infection was the most frequently identified type of infection (37.0%), followed by gastrointestinal infection (28.5%) and pneumonia (22.9%). In 37% of the outbreaks, the authors were not able to identify the sources. The most frequent sources were patients (25.7%), followed by medical equipment or devices (11.9%), the environment (11.6%), and the staff (10.9%). The mode of transmission remained unclear in 28.3% of the outbreaks. Transmission was by contact in 45.3%, by invasive technique in 16.1%, and through the air in 15.0%. The percentage of outbreaks investigated by case-control studies or cohort studies over the years was small (21% and 9%, respectively, for the whole time period).

Conclusion

Outbreak reports in the literature are a valuable resource and should be used for educational purposes as well as for preparing outbreak investigations.

### Research methods in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship-quasi-experimental designs [^115zQSEz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Quasi-experimental studies evaluate the association between an intervention and an outcome using experiments in which the intervention is not randomly assigned. Quasi-experimental studies are often used to evaluate rapid responses to outbreaks or other patient safety problems requiring prompt, nonrandomized interventions. Quasi-experimental studies can be categorized into 3 major types: interrupted time-series designs, designs with control groups, and designs without control groups. This methods paper highlights key considerations for quasi-experimental studies in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship, including study design and analytic approaches to avoid selection bias and other common pitfalls of quasi-experimental studies.

### Genes, environment and the value of prospective cohort studies [^116Nhphu]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2006). Medium credibility.

Case-control studies have many advantages for identifying disease-related genes, but are limited in their ability to detect gene-environment interactions. The prospective cohort design provides a valuable complement to case-control studies. Although it has disadvantages in duration and cost, it has important strengths in characterizing exposures and risk factors before disease onset, which reduces important biases that are common in case-control studies. This and other strengths of prospective cohort studies make them invaluable for understanding gene-environment interactions in complex human disease.

### Case / control studies with follow-up: constructing the source population to estimate effects of risk factors on development, disease, and survival [^112ZqjRn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

This paper deals with single-population CCF studies that do not recruit controls matched to their corresponding cases, when sampling weights may need to be estimated differently (manuscript in preparation). Further, in a pooled analysis across populations (strata), the weights should be based on the relative stratum sizes and the incidence of D within each stratum.

In most CCF studies relatively few children will be enrolled more than once. Even in a cohort study in Guinea-Bissau, where children were followed with weekly stool specimen examination to identify infections with enteropathogens from birth up to 2 years of age, generalized estimating equations or frailty correction to account for between-child differences did not substantially alter point estimates or precision. We suggest that if such correction yields no or little effect on point estimates and their precision, it need not be incorporated in the bootstrapping approaches that capture the sampling error of the sampling weight estimates. It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe in further detail how to take into account between-individual differences in the occurrence of exposures and/or outcomes.

### Quantifying the long-term effects of measles infection-a retrospective cohort study [^113yW2ZL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess whether measles infection has an impact on the rate of non-measles infectious diseases over an extended period.

Methods

This retrospective matched cohort study included 532 measles-diagnosed patients who were exactly matched with 2128 individuals without a previous measles diagnosis. Adjusted OR for any all-cause infectious diagnosis and any viral infection diagnosis ≤ 2 years after measles diagnosis between the measles and control groups was obtained from a conditional logistic regression model. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio.

Results

Previous measles virus (MeV) exposure was associated with an increased risk for all-cause non-measles infectious disease diagnosis (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.26–2.64, p 0.001), with 492 diagnoses in the MeV-exposed group and 1868 diagnoses in the control group. Additionally, previous MeV exposure was linked to a higher risk of viral infection diagnosis (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01–1.59, p < 0.05), with 302 viral infection diagnoses in the MeV-exposed group and 1107 diagnoses in the control group. The hazard ratio for viral diagnosis in the MeV-exposed group compared with the control group was 1.54 (95% CI: 1.18–2.02, p < 0.001).

Discussion

Individuals diagnosed with measles had a moderately increased risk of being diagnosed with all-cause non-measles infectious disease or viral infection. This observational individual-level study supports previous ecological and individual population-level studies.

### Quality of early evidence on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of COVID-19 [^114sTHf7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Since the initial description of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and its declaration as a worldwide pandemic, the number of publications on the novel virus has increased rapidly. We studied the trends and quality of evidence in early SARS-CoV-2 publications. A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed for papers published between 1 January 2020 and 21 April 2020. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts for eligibility in this systematic review. The search yielded 2504 citations published between January and February 2020 or an unspecified date, 109 of which remained for extraction after screening. Data extracted included study design, year of publication, country of basis, journal of publication, impact factor of publishing journal, study sample size, number of citations and topic of investigation. Study design-specific critical appraisal tools were used to evaluate the scientific rigour of all included papers: the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist was used for case series, Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles scale for narrative reviews, Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies and AMSTAR 2 for systematic reviews. The overall quality of the literature was low-moderate. Of 541 papers that reported clinical characteristics, 295 were commentaries/expert opinions and 36 were case reports. There were no randomised clinical trials, 45 case series studies, 58 narrative reviews, 1 cohort study and 5 systematic reviews. We encourage clinicians to be attentive to these findings when utilising early SARS-CoV-2 evidence in their practices.

### A case-control and cohort study to determine the relationship between ethnic background and severe COVID-19 [^115WEPCt]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

People of minority ethnic backgrounds may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19. Whether this relates to increased infection risk, more severe disease progression, or worse in-hospital survival is unknown. The contribution of comorbidities or socioeconomic deprivation to ethnic patterning of outcomes is also unclear.

Methods

We conducted a case-control and a cohort study in an inner city primary and secondary care setting to examine whether ethnic background affects the risk of hospital admission with severe COVID-19 and/or in-hospital mortality. Inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 872 cases) were compared with 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people residing in the same region. For the cohort study, we studied 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical variables.

Findings

The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63–3.71] and 2.97 [2.30–3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.24 [1.83–2.74] for Black, 2.70 [2.03–3.59] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (adjusted OR 1.01 [0.70–1.46]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4–16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 1.06 [0.82–1.37]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.72 [0.47–1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality but with a large confidence interval (adjusted HR 1.71 [1.15–2.56]).

Interpretation

Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease, but do not affect in-hospital mortality risk. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.

### Prevalence and risk factors for long COVID among adults in scotland using electronic health records: a national, retrospective, observational cohort study [^115Ls5CS]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Validity of the operational definition

Individual indicators included in the operational definition

The analysis underpinning the operational definition identified 17 indicators (four symptoms, six types of investigations, and seven types of management strategy) that occurred at a significantly higher rate among individuals with a positive RT-PCR test (relative to negative controls) in the 4–12 or > 12–26 weeks after testing, shown in Fig. 2. Results from individual regressions are presented in Figures S3 and S4.

Each of the 17 indicators were observed at a higher rate among people identified by the other outcome measures as having long COVID, relative to all confirmed patients with COVID-19 (Table S10).

Case-crossover analysis

Of all patients identified by the operational definition as having long COVID, 98.4% (n = 63,189) had sufficient history to allow for a case-crossover analysis. Of those patients, 16.4% (n = 10,336) had information recorded in their EHRs in the lead-up to testing positive that was consistent with the criteria of the operational definition (minus the requirement to have a positive COVID-19 test result). Within this subset, 70.8% (n = 7319) had one or more existing health conditions, compared with 55.6% of all patients identified by the operational definition, and 36.0% of the full cohort. 7.8% (n = 818) of those identified based on data recorded in the lead up to testing positive were separately identified as having long COVID by one or more of the other outcome measures.

Identification of long COVID among matched controls

Within the matched sample, patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 were significantly (p < 0.0001) more likely to be identified as having long COVID by the operational definition, relative to negative controls (minus the operational definition's requirement to have a positive COVID-19 test result) (OR: 1.15, 95% CI 1.13–1.17).

Assessing the possibility of overfitting

The proportion of patients identified by the operational definition and included in the matched sample was similar to the proportion of patients identified by the operational definition, who had a positive RT-PCR test, but were not included in the matched sample (4.5% and 4.8%, respectively). This provides reassurance that the operational definition is unlikely to be overly influenced by the subset of patients with a positive RT-PCR test included in the matched sample.

### Characteristics of foodborne disease outbreak investigations conducted by foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodNet) sites, 2003–2008 [^114bN3s5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A mean of ≥ 1000 foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs) causing ≥ 20,000 illnesses are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annually. We evaluated characteristics of successful outbreak investigations (ie, those that identified an etiologic agent or food vehicle) in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet).

Methods

FBDOs were defined as the occurrence of ≥ 2 cases of a similar illness resulting from ingestion of a common food. FBDOs reported to CDC Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System during 2003–2008 with FoodNet supplemental data available were included in the analyses.

Results

Data regarding 1200 FBDOs were available. An etiologic agent was confirmed in 715 (60%); a food vehicle was identified in 387 (32%). At least 4 fecal specimens were collected in 425 of 639 outbreaks (67%) with a confirmed etiologic agent and 48 of 232 (21%) without a confirmed etiologic agent (odds ratio [OR], 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 5.3–10.9). A food vehicle was identified in 314 (47%) of 671 outbreaks investigated using a case-control or cohort study, compared with only 73 (14%) of 529 outbreaks investigated by using other methods (OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.1–7.3). At least 1 barrier affecting the success of the investigation was reported for 655 outbreaks, including too few patients (n = 172; 26%), too few stool specimens (n = 167; 25%), and too few control subjects (n = 152; 23%).

Conclusions

Etiologic agent and vehicle are frequently undetermined in FBDOs. Greater emphasis on fecal specimen collection and overcoming barriers to pursuing analytic epidemiologic studies can improve ascertainment of these factors.

### Drivers of tuberculosis transmission [^116gB4Qn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING TUBERCULOSIS OUTBREAKS

Tuberculosis outbreaks typically present the clearest evidence of tuberculosis transmission, as they are often spatiotemporally restricted and involve shared epidemiological attributes. A first question is whether an unexpected number of tuberculosis cases, clustered by space and time, is indeed an outbreak. Epidemiologic studies have shown that tuberculosis does not afflict all susceptible individuals equally; therefore, an aggregation of individuals with risk factors for tuberculosis, such as in a hospital or prison, may actually represent a pseudo-outbreak. To establish that there has been M. tuberculosis spread from a source patient to multiple secondary cases, investigators can use molecular or genomic typing methods to demonstrate clonal dissemination.

By studying tuberculosis outbreaks defined by strain typing methods, it is possible to ask whether there are host, pathogen, and environmental factors significantly associated with recently transmitted disease. A caveat is that the study duration should account for M. tuberculosis latency (eg, a 1-year study cannot define risk factors for becoming infected and developing disease in 18 months). As such, molecular epidemiologic investigations of tuberculosis outbreaks do not measure transmission completely. Instead, they identify risk factors for the subset of new infections that rapidly progress to culture-confirmed tuberculosis. For defining a preventive intervention, this may be valuable information. However, such findings may be insufficient for understanding all of the determinants contributing to the original transmission events.

### Incidence and transmission associated with respiratory viruses in an acute care facility: an observational study [^11647eKN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

While the rate of hospital-associated respiratory virus infections has been infrequently described, the transmission patterns of these viruses outside of isolated outbreaks is not well described. – The aims of this study were to describe the extent of respiratory virus transmission in the acute care setting and characterize the virus-specific frequency and potential pathways of respiratory virus transmission.

### Continuing development of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies against zika virus [^111619Sm]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering the limited ZIKV cases, data from multiple cohort studies may need to be pooled or shared to reach sufficient case numbers for endpoints which will require harmonized or comparable testing algorithms. In preparation for future outbreaks, universal or master protocols should be put into place where possible, including standard definitions for key outcomes and terms such as 'exposed pregnancy'. A master protocol is a single protocol that is designed to address multiple questions and could be used to directly compare multiple interventions as was done during the Ebola outbreak.

Decision-makers will need to remain blinded in cohort studies is needed to facilitate flexibility and adaptability without bias. Questions that are still to be addressed include which testing strategy or algorithm is most efficient to detect ZIKV infection reliably with high confidence, what the role of seroconversion should have in surveillance studies, and how best to determine a baseline frequency for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The field should continue to pursue these research questions and elements in order to be prepared for future outbreaks.

### Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review [^112amsEf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In late 2019, first cases of coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were reported in Wuhan, China. Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.

Selection Criteria

We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings.

Main Results

We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19 Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on infection prevention for health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 [^116bNTVp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 infection prevention — evidence review methods indicate that evidence from experimental or laboratory studies were included as sources of indirect evidence and public health websites, such as the CDC and WHO, were also reviewed for additional literature; pairs of reviewers extracted relevant information into a standardized data extraction form, existing systematic reviews also were reviewed for methodologic rigor, and when appropriate, specific subgroup analyses were conducted using Review Manager. Reviewers assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the Risk of Bias Instrument for Non-randomized Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS-I). The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; evidence from RCTs start as high-certainty evidence and observational studies start out as low-certainty of evidence. Factors that may reduce one's certainty include risk of bias (study limitations), inconsistency (unexplained heterogeneity across study findings), indirectness (applicability or generalizability to the research question), imprecision (the confidence in the estimate of an effect to support a particular decision), or publication bias (selective publication of studies), whereas certainty may be strengthened by large or very large magnitude of effect, evidence of a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding. The certainty of evidence is categorized into four levels ranging from very low to high, and for each recommendation an overall judgment of certainty of evidence is made based on critical outcomes; evidence profiles were used to display summary estimates and judgments, and GRADE evidence profiles and summary of findings tables were developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool.

### Investigation of outbreaks complicated by universal exposure [^114hn2aQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Infectious disease outbreaks in which most or all persons are exposed to the same potential source of infection, so-called universal exposure, are common. They can occur in a range of settings (e.g. healthcare, community) and involve various organisms and vehicles. When outbreaks with universal exposure are investigated, it is difficult to explore the possible association between illness and that specific exposure by using conventional epidemiologic and environmental approaches.

Universal exposure complicates the analysis of epidemiologic studies because of the absence of a nonexposed group, which makes it difficult to test the hypotheses under investigation. This article provides an overview of options for outbreak investigations in which the exposure to the suspected source of infection is universal. We conducted a thorough literature search to collect articles on outbreak investigations in which analytical techniques were used that could be helpful in a situation of universal exposure. In addition, the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) network and the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training Alumni Network were asked to provide published or unpublished outbreak reports of outbreaks with universal exposure

### The case for a US prospective cohort study of genes and environment [^114sZ8kb]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Information from the Human Genome Project will be vital for defining the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to health and disease. Well-designed case-control studies of people with and without a particular disease are essential for this, but rigorous and unbiased conclusions about the causes of diseases and their population-wide impact will require a representative population to be monitored over time (a prospective cohort study). The time is right for the United States to consider such a project.

### Pragmatic recommendations for infection prevention and control practices for healthcare facilities in low-and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic [^113NEvDa]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence.

Evidence regarding the efficacy of cohorting patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in reducing the risk of nosocomial transmission is limited. However, cohorting strategies have previously been studied for other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and SARS coronavirus. A 2011 Cochrane review evaluated the use of various physical interventions to minimize the transmission of respiratory viruses. In this review, four studies were identified that reported cohorting as an effective measure in reducing virus spread. One controlled before and after study showed a reduction in nosocomial transmission of respiratory syncytial virus using cohorting with a decrease from 5.33 to 1.23 infections per 1,000/patient days of care. Experience from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore also suggests that cohorting on an open ward may be effective in an outbreak setting. In this observational study, 70 patients exposed to SARS were cohorted for monitoring. Patients who developed symptoms concerning SARS infection were removed from the cohort and isolated. The authors reported that within the cohort, there was no observed secondary transmission.

A similar approach has been used in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic with the creation of "respiratory surveillance wards", which were designated for any patients with respiratory symptoms. When cases of SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed, patients were moved to a separate isolation ward. Among staff and patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2, only one patient developed COVID-19 after exposure. Another strategy described for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom relies on the use of a triage tool to assign patients to single-room isolation versus cohorting based on the likelihood of COVID-19 infection and the risk of a poor outcome. In a study of 93 patients that describes this approach, no cases of symptomatic hospital-acquired infections were found among cohorted patients. Few studies from LMICs have been published discussing approaches and challenges to cohorting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

Efficacy against susceptibility had the largest influence on the magnitude of bias in VE estimates, with a more pronounced effect on estimates from the cohort design. Other studies have also found that efficacy against susceptibility can moderate the magnitude of bias produced by other mechanisms of bias, such as heterogeneity in contact levels by vaccination statusand confounding bias due to correlated case and control vaccination behaviours. The key implication from these findings is that as a virus undergoes genetic adaptations leading to immune escape, and/or waning against susceptibility occurs, the risk of larger biases in VE estimates increases. This is likely why several studies found estimates of negative VE (suggesting that the vaccine was increasing symptomatic infection) during the emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g.) — a variant known to have higher immune escape.

There are three important implications stemming from the influence of the study's selected sampling period, efficacy against infectiousness, and the epidemic potential (probability of transmission) — all of which were more pronounced with the test-negative design than with the cohort design. First, in the context of an emerging and evolving outbreak, VE studies are routinely conducted over successive time periods. Thus, it becomes increasingly important in the context of unequal testing to repeat VE studies and consider the timing of sampling for interpretation of VE estimates. Early in the epidemic, a test-negative design offers a large advantage in terms of minimising the magnitude of bias due to unequal testing, but it calls for greater attention as the epidemic progresses. Even with equal testing, continued caution may still be warranted, as VE estimates can become overestimated when the epidemic is large and the study's selected sampling period is longer and includes later epidemic stages. This overestimation occurs because, as the epidemic progresses, the pool of individuals who have never been infected with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 shrinks — especially among the unvaccinated — leading to a control group that no longer accurately reflects the population's vaccination distribution.

### COVID-19 and risk of subsequent life-threatening secondary infections: a matched cohort study in UK biobank [^1139VqQ4]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings of an increased risk of developing life-threatening secondary infections among COVID-19 patients who have been discharged from hospital (i.e. recovering cases) and never required hospitalization (relatively mild cases) are novel, with no comparable data from other large-scale longitudinal investigations. Nevertheless, our results are corroborated by two recent prospective studies suggesting an association between COVID-19 and sepsis, and cross-sectional studies suggesting a high incidence (> 50%) of sepsis among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Besides methodological shortcomings such as lack of comparable control group and no control for multiple important confounders, previous research has mainly focused on sepsis diagnosed during COVID-19 hospital treatment, with little effort to differentiate sepsis caused by COVID-19 from secondary sepsis induced by other pathogens. However, recent studies have revealed a general increase in the risk of secondary infections among COVID-19 patients. A recent meta-analysis summarized findings from retrospective case series studies, revealing a 14.3% prevalence of secondary bacterial infections among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This seemed comparable with a 12% reported prevalence of general secondary infections among affected patients during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

### A meta-analysis of clinical studies conducted during the west Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak confirms the need for randomized control groups [^113NxwAn]. Science Translational Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent Ebola virus disease outbreaks affirm the dire need for treatments with proven efficacy. Randomized controlled clinical trials remain the gold standard but, during disease outbreaks, may be difficult to conduct due to ethical concerns and challenging field conditions. In the absence of a randomized control group, statistical modeling to create a control group could be a possibility. Such a model-based reference control would only be credible if it had the same mortality risk as that of the experimental group in the absence of treatment. One way to test this counterfactual assumption is to evaluate whether reasonable similarity exists across nonrandomized control groups from different clinical studies, which might suggest that a future control group would be similarly homogeneous. We evaluated similarity across six clinical studies conducted during the 2013–2016 West Africa outbreak of Ebola virus disease. These studies evaluated favipiravir, the biologic ZMapp, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine, or administration of convalescent plasma or convalescent whole blood. We compared the nonrandomized control groups of these six studies comprising 1147 individuals infected with Ebola virus. We found considerable heterogeneity, which did not disappear after statistical modeling to adjust for prognostic variables. Mortality risk varied widely (31 to 66%) across the nonrandomized control arms of these six studies. Models adjusting for baseline covariates (age, sex, and cycle threshold, a proxy for viral load) failed to sufficiently recalibrate these studies and showed that heterogeneity remained. Our findings highlight concerns about making invalid conclusions when comparing nonrandomized control groups to cohorts receiving experimental treatments.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: a rapid review [^1138k5mA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice

Despite the limited evidence on quarantine to control COVID‐19, studies consistently concluded that quarantine is an important public health measure to reduce the number of people infected and the number of deaths. For both effectiveness and costs, early and efficient implementation of quarantine seems to be key. The combination of quarantine with other prevention and control measures showed the greatest effect in reducing transmissions, incident cases, and mortality. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented.

Implications for research

Further research on important disease dynamics of COVID‐19, such as prevalence, or case‐fatality rate are crucial. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, which would greatly reduce uncertainty of model simulations. Consequently, modelling studies simulating the effectiveness of control measures to contain COVID‐19 could be updated as soon as new knowledge on important parameters is available. More non‐randomized studies of interventions that assess the effectiveness of quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID‐19 are also needed. Comparing the effectiveness of diverse strategies will help us gain more evidence for future pandemics. Essential for future research is to disentangle the effects of diverse prevention and control measures to know which interventions or combinations work best and cost less in terms of the economic and health burden on society. Therefore non‐randomized studies with robust quasi‐experimental designs are preferred to observational studies, since the former (but not the latter) can in principle enable causal inferences to be drawn about effects of quarantine measures and other prevention and control measures (Rockers 2015).

### Evaluating the effect of an injury prevention intervention in a population [^117A2oRS]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation of injury prevention interventions is important before the widespread dissemination of these interventions. One level of evaluation is at the population level, to determine the effect of the intervention on the incidence of injury. The size and nature of the study population depend on the study design, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures of interest. Possible designs are randomized controlled trials; nonrandomized controlled trials; and observational studies, including cohort, case-control, and ecologic designs. These strategies have been successfully applied to evaluate a wide variety of interventions for intentional and unintentional injury prevention, the results of which have been used to guide public policy. These same strategies can be successfully used to evaluate methods for the prevention of injury due to child abuse.

### Event rates and incidence of post-COVID-19 condition in hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 positive children and young people and controls across different pandemic waves: exposure-stratified prospective cohort study in moscow (stopCOVID) [^113P9RAu]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Another limitation pertains to the broad outcome definition employed by most of the observational studies examining the consequences of COVID-19. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has provided a definition for the post-COVID-19 Condition, a disappointingly small number of studies have chosen to incorporate this definition into their research methodology.

This prospective exposure-stratified cohort study aimed to investigate the incidence of post-COVID-19 condition among hospitalised CYP with COVID-19 infection compared with post-infection sequalae in a reference cohort of previously hospitalised CYP with non-COVID-19 infectious diseases. The study used standardised follow-up data collection protocols developed by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) Global Paediatric COVID-19 follow-up working group. The study included assessment of post-COVID-19 condition corresponding to different waves of the pandemic in Moscow, Russia, as a proxy for infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants.

### Learning from the COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities: a systematic review [^115feZuP]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The observational design of the bibliographic sample had weak robustness, raising doubts about the generalization of the results. Many infection and control measures integrate complex interventions and are applied in a bundle. In the absence of confounding variable control, it is prudent that these results are seen as suggestive.

The recommendation for applying a multisectoral intervention of combined measures comes from a single study and integrates case and contact management, proactive case identification, strict infection control procedures, resource prioritization and stewardship (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Combined measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in LTCFs experiencing outbreaks

The application of combined measures is consistent with most available guidance that focus on a set of interventions. However, further research on this matter is needed, with more robust study designs, to elucidate better the implications of the measures in reducing the risk of transmission of covid-19 in LTCF during outbreaks, avoiding measures that might spread COVID-19 and threaten residents, staff, and relatives.

In each category (strategic, tactic, operational), we can find measures for outbreak containment of two natures: those that are taken in each situation (which result from an adjustment of practices) and those that result from accommodating existing conditions (which point to measures whose implementation are structural and require unique resources, namely financial) (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6
Specific measures for COVID-19 outbreak containment

Our results show that outbreak control measures, such as admissions precautions, infection control surveillance, staff training and audits, mask use, signalling, and social distancing, overlap with measures to prevent virus entry within the LTCF. This evidence highlights the importance of maintaining an ongoing risk assessment and adjusting infection prevention measures in LTCF.

Another noteworthy aspect of our study is that the sample of reports included evaluates interventions, which are consistently implemented in combination. This evidence highlights the importance of investigating outbreak containment measures in LTCF as complex interventions. Previous revisions on infection and control measures for LTCF suggested that combining several infection-control strategies may lower COVID-19 infection and mortality rates.

### Population-based matched cohort study of COVID-19 healthcare costs, Ontario, Canada [^1165sSFF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, and Population

Our study followed the RECORD statement for observational studies. We conducted an incidence-based matched cohort study to measure the COVID-19–attributable healthcare costs among persons registered in the publicly funded Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). Ontario is Canada's most populous province, containing 40% of Canada's population, and OHIP covers most residents. We used population-based health administrative datasets with information on all healthcare encounters covered by OHIP. We linked the datasets (Appendix Table 1) by using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed them at ICES (Toronto, ON, Canada).

We identified persons as exposed if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR during January 1, 2020–December 31, 2020, enabling 1 year of follow-up, and limiting potential biases because of variant emergence and vaccination beginning in December 2020. We defined the index date as the first occurrence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on the basis of the earliest of symptom onset date recorded in Ontario's Case and Contact Management (CCM) system, specimen collection date, observation date or reporting date in the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS), or case report date in CCM. We excluded patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as testing positive > 8 days after admission or up to 2 days after discharge, given a length of stay of > 8 days, or readmission with a positive test within 8 days after discharge from the hospital.

We identified unexposed persons by using a 50% random sample of the OHIP-registered population from January 1, 2016–December 31, 2018. We chose a historical unexposed cohort because health service use declined by 27%–43% during the pandemic compared with prepandemic years because of system, structural, and behavioral factors and to avoid potential contamination bias because not all persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a PCR test for a variety of reasons, including being ineligible for PCR testing, lacking access to or desire for testing, or being asymptomatic, which ranged from 20%–62% of persons (P. Jha, unpub. data. Unexposed persons were assigned a pseudo–index date at random. We excluded persons with death dates before their pseudo–index dates from the study and excluded persons assigned to the historical unexposed cohort from the exposed cohort.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^115ywJvo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Influenza — corticosteroid therapy: While current evidence is limited, corticosteroid treatment of influenza patients should be avoided unless clinically indicated for other reasons (eg, exacerbation of asthma, COPD, low-dose hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency or refractory septic shock), as the risks of corticosteroid treatment are not balanced by a documented clinical benefit in the treatment of influenza. Data from randomized controlled clinical trials of corticosteroid treatment of influenza patients are not available. An additional meta-analysis of published observational studies suggested that not only was mortality increased, but also nosocomial bacterial infection, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay were greater in corticosteroid-treated patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. Early corticosteroid treatment (within 72 hours of illness onset) of patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was associated with increased mortality, and in critically ill children with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection those who received high-dose corticosteroids had an elevated risk of death compared to those not treated with high-dose corticosteroids. A large retrospective observational study reported 607 adults hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 51 Canadian ICUs, where further analyses using propensity scoring matching and adjusting for time-dependent between-group differences did not demonstrate significant differences in mortality between patients treated with and without corticosteroids. In a propensity score–matched case-control analysis among hospitalized influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viral pneumonia, low- to moderate-dose (25–150 mg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent), but not higher-dose, corticosteroid treatment was associated with lower 30-day mortality compared with no treatment (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.64; 95% CI, .43–.96; p = 0.033). In patients with mild or worse hypoxemia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FIO2] < 300 mm Hg), low- to moderate-dose, but not high-dose, corticosteroid treatment significantly reduced 30-day and 60-day mortality; however, in patients with mild disease (PaO2/FIO2 ≥ 300 mm Hg), corticosteroid treatment was not associated with survival benefit, and was associated with higher 60-day mortality. In avian influenza A(H7N9), a subgroup analysis found that patients who received high doses (> 150 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) had much higher 30-day and 60-day mortality than those who received no steroid therapy (P = 0.031 and P = 0.002, respectively). Multiple observational studies have reported that corticosteroid treatment was associated with prolonged influenza viral shedding, including A(H7N9) viral shedding and emergence of antiviral resistance, and secondary bacterial and invasive fungal coinfections.

### Association of age with likelihood of developing symptoms and critical disease among close contacts exposed to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy [^1167YH8J]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The role of asymptomatic infections in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still an important missing piece in the puzzle of the ongoing pandemic. The second coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic wave experienced in many industrialized countrieshas highlighted the challenges of containing COVID-19 outbreaks via contact tracing strategies alone, the effectiveness of which is limited by the ability of asymptomatic carriers to spread infection. Quantifying the age-specific proportion of SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals who do not develop recognizable symptoms is, thus, key to understanding COVID-19 epidemic trajectories and identifying the settings and age segments of the population in which silent transmission is more likely to occur. Robust estimates of the age-specific risk of requiring critical care upon infection are also needed to assess and project the health care burden of COVID-19 and to guide the allocation of resources when planning for new surges of cases.

In this cohort study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical observations of quarantined close contacts of confirmed cases identified during surveillance activities conducted in Lombardy, Italy, between February and April 2020. The analyzed sample was obtained by combining different sources of information on the same set of individuals and applying strict exclusion criteria. The resulting set of study participants was previously analyzed to estimate age-specific infection fatality ratios. In this study, instead of infection fatality ratios, we leveraged the continuous monitoring of clinical manifestations and outcomes among case contacts to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of symptoms and/or critical disease. In particular, we investigated whether a participant developed (1) respiratory symptoms or fever of 37.5 °C or higher or (2) critical disease, defined as disease requiring admission to an intensive care unit or disease leading to death with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study is to identify the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — studies assessing natural infection found no direct evidence to correlate serologic testing with improved outcomes, but cohorts showed lower reinfection among those seropositive. The guideline identified 6 studies, 5 cohort and 1 case control, that evaluated relationships between antibody level and decreased SARS-CoV-2 reinfection; 5 studies assessed binding antibodies and 1 assessed neutralizing antibodies. Across the cohort studies, subjects with a seropositive result after infection appeared to have a lower likelihood of developing reinfection, and in the case control study, doubling of the antibody level was associated with reduced odds of reinfection, though study definitions, timing, tests used, and comparison groups varied.

### Access to personal protective equipment in exposed healthcare workers and COVID-19 illness, severity, symptoms and duration: a population-based case-control study in six countries [^117B2cE9]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

The study has several strengths, such as large sample size, inclusion of HCWs from multiple countries, and careful adjustment of potential confounders. Our study is also unique in that we were able to capture the period when many countries faced shortages of PPEs. At the time, healthcare system was ill prepared to meet the high PPE demands due to lack of inventories, leading to a gradient of access to PPE among HCWs.

This study has limitations that must be noted. Case-control studies have various limitations including recall bias regarding exposures. Additional factors that may be associated with COVID-19 illness could not be assessed such as local prevalence of COVID-19 and hospital infection control practices, including patient screening and testing practices. Like other observational studies, results herein represent statistical associations and cannot prove causality. Since randomised trials of PPE and COVID-19 among HCWs may not be ethical, data from prospective cohort studies should ideally be used to replicate our findings. We may have not included HCWs who may be considered high risk. However, our study focused on inpatient settings to have comparable cases and controls, and data on medical specialties at high risk of COVID-19 infection were not available at the time of study design. Furthermore, this study relied on participants' self-report of diagnosis, symptoms and test results as opposed to chart review. To restrict the study population to exposed HCWs, we used > 5% of time with patients with COVID-19. However, this cut-off may be considered arbitrary and there is a possibility that HCWs may not be able to recall the time they had contact with patients with COVID-19 in the workplace. One study in medical students in UK in the setting of COVID-19 pandemic found that their self-reported level of PPE was not consistent with PPE supply. However, the consistent associations between access to PPE and COVID-19 across multiple countries lends credibility to our results. Future studies should validate self-reported level of PPE and PPE supply in HCWs. Next, we used ORs to estimate the associations between workplace risk factors and COVID-19. However, given how common COVID-19 is as of December 2020, our estimates based on ORs may overestimate the associations. Lastly, our study population mainly comprised middle-aged male physicians. Thus, our findings may not be generalisable to community settings or other groups of individuals, highlighting the need to build more evidence on PPE and COVID-19 in this area.

### The case-case-control study design: addressing the limitations of risk factor studies for antimicrobial resistance [^111fTyLW]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

There are significant limitations of the standard case-control study design for identifying risk factors for resistant organisms. The objective of this study was to develop a study design to overcome these limitations.

Design

Theoretical analysis of different types of study designs that can be used in risk factor studies for resistant organisms.

Results

We developed the case-case-control study design, which uses two separate case-control analyses within a single study. The first analysis compares patients infected with resistant bacteria (resistant cases) with control-patients without infection caused by the target organism, who are therefore representative of the source population; and the second analysis compares patients infected with the susceptible phenotype of the target organism (susceptible cases) with the same control-patients without infection caused by the target organism. These two analyses provide risk models for (1) isolation of the resistant phenotype of the target organism as compared with the source population and (2) isolation of the susceptible phenotype of the organism as compared with the source population. When these two risk models are compared and contrasted, risk factors specifically associated with isolation of the resistant phenotype can be identified.

Conclusions

The case-case-control study design is an effective method for identifying risk factors for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Although the case-case-control study design has limitations, it is, in our opinion, more informative and less flawed than the standard case-control study design.

### Designing and conducting analytic studies in the field… [^114xJPKs]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Generating a Hypothesis in a Listeriosis Outbreak Linked to Caramel Apples). Study Designs for Testing Hypotheses. As evident in public health and clinical guidelines, randomized controlled trials are the reference standard for epidemiology, providing the highest level of evidence. However, such studies are not possible in certain situations, including outbreak investigations. Instead, investigators must rely on observational studies, which can provide sufficient evidence for public health action. In observational studies, the epidemiologist documents rather than determines the exposures, quantifying the statistical association between exposure and disease. Here again, the key when designing such studies is to obtain a relevant comparison group for the patients.

Observational Study Type 2: Case–Control In a case–control study, the investigator must identify a comparison group of control persons who have had similar opportunities for exposure as the case-patients. Case–control studies are commonly performed in field epidemiology when a cohort study is impractical. Most field case–control studies use control-to-case-patient ratios of 1: 1, 2: 1, or 3:

1. Enrolling more than one control per case-patient can increase study power, which might be needed to detect a statistically significant difference in exposure between case-patients and controls, particularly when an outbreak involves a limited number of cases. Cohort studies are also appropriate when well-defined groups can be enrolled by exposure status. Case–control studies, in contrast, are useful when the population is less clearly defined.

Case–control studies, oriented from disease to exposure, identify persons with disease and a comparable group of persons without disease. Then the exposure experiences of the two groups are compared. Case–case studies are similar to case–control studies, except that controls have an illness not linked to the outbreak. Case–control studies are probably the type most often appropriate for field investigations. Although conceptually straightforward, the design of an effective epidemiologic study requires many careful decisions. Taking the time needed to develop good hypotheses can result in a questionnaire that is useful for identifying risk factors. The choice of an appropriate comparison group, how many controls per case-patient to enroll, whether to match, and how best to avoid potential biases are all crucial decisions for a successful study.

### Test hypotheses using epidemiologic and environmental investigation… [^115PDQfw]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Error processing SSI file 4. Test Hypotheses Using Epidemiologic and Environmental Investigation Once a hypothesis is generated, it should be tested to determine if the source has been correctly identified. Investigators use several methods to test their hypotheses. Epidemiologic Investigation Case-control studies and cohort studies are the most common type of analytic studies conducted to assist investigators in determining statistical association of exposures to ill persons. These types of studies compare information collected from ill persons with comparable well persons. Cohort studies use well-defined groups and compare the risk of developing of illness among people who were exposed to a source with the risk of developing illness among the unexposed. In a cohort study, you are determining the risk of developing illness among the exposed. Case-control studies compare the exposures between ill persons with exposures among well persons.

Controls for a case-control study should have the same risk of exposure as the cases. In a case-control study, the comparison is the odds of illness among those exposed with those not exposed. Using statistical tests, the investigators can determine the strength of the association to the implicated water source instead of how likely it is to have occurred by chance alone. Investigators look at many factors when interpreting results from these studies:

- Frequencies of exposure
- Strength of the statistical association
- Dose-response relationships
- Biologic /toxicological plausibility For more information and examples on designing and conducting analytic studies in the field, please see The CDC Field Epidemiology Manual. Information on the clinical course of illness and results of clinical laboratory testing are very important for outbreak investigations. Evaluating symptoms and sequelae across patients can guide formulation of a clinical diagnosis.

Results of advance molecular diagnostics can be evaluated to compare isolates from patient and the outbreak sources. Environmental Investigation Investigating an implicated water source with an onsite environmental investigation is often important for determining the outbreak's cause and for pinpointing which factors at the water source were responsible. This requires understanding the implicated water system, potential contamination sources, the environmental controls in effect, and the ways that people interact with the water source. The factors considered in this investigation will differ depending on the type of implicated water source. Environmental investigation tools for different settings and venues are available.

### Principles of epidemiology | Lesson 1-section 7 archive… [^115WkXMA]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic studies fall into two categories: experimental and observational. Experimental studies. Observational studies In an observational study, the epidemiologist simply observes the exposure and disease status of each study participant. John Snow's studies of cholera in London were observational studies. The two most common types of observational studies are cohort studies and case-control studies; a third type is cross-sectional studies. A cohort study is similar in concept to the experimental study. In a cohort study the epidemiologist records whether each study participant is exposed or not, and then tracks the participants to see if they develop the disease of interest. Note that this differs from an experimental study because, in a cohort study, the investigator observes rather than determines the participants' exposure status.

After a period of time, the investigator compares the disease rate in the exposed group with the disease rate in the unexposed group. The unexposed group serves as the comparison group, providing an estimate of the baseline or expected amount of disease occurrence in the community. If the disease rate is substantively different in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group, the exposure is said to be associated with illness. Cohort study. The control group provides an estimate of the baseline or expected amount of exposure in that population. If the amount of exposure among the case group is substantially higher than the amount you would expect based on the control group, then illness is said to be associated with that exposure. The study of hepatitis A traced to green onions, described above, is an example of a case-control study.

The key in a case-control study is to identify an appropriate control group, comparable to the case group in most respects, in order to provide a reasonable estimate of the baseline or expected exposure. Case-control study. *. In an observational cohort study, subjects are enrolled or grouped on the basis of their exposure, then are followed to document occurrence of disease. Differences in disease rates between the exposed and unexposed groups lead investigators to conclude that exposure is associated with disease. In an observational case-control study, subjects are enrolled according to whether they have the disease or not, then are questioned or tested to determine their prior exposure. Differences in exposure prevalence between the case and control groups allow investigators to conclude that the exposure is associated with the disease. Cross-sectional studies measure exposure and disease status at the same time, and are better suited to descriptive epidemiology than causation.

### Step 4: test hypotheses… [^113g1QzZ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 4: Test Hypotheses Once investigators have narrowed down the likely source of the outbreak to a few possible foods, they test the hypotheses. Investigators can use many different methods to test their hypotheses, but most methods entail studies that compare how often sick people in the outbreak ate certain foods to how often people not part of the outbreak ate those foods. Conducting epidemiologic studies within illness cluster locations can be an effective way to identify foods that are associated with illness. Case-control and cohort studies can both be used in illness cluster investigations and are especially useful when they assess associations between illness and specific food ingredients. In some multistate outbreaks, investigators identify numerous illness clusters. In those situations, looking for common ingredients that people ate across all the illness clusters can help investigators test hypotheses, even in the absence of an epidemiologic study.

Surveys of healthy people Investigators often compare the frequency of foods reported by sick people in a multistate outbreak to data that already exist about healthy people. The most common source for data about how often healthy people eat certain foods is the FoodNet Population Survey, a periodic survey of randomly selected residents in the FoodNet surveillance area. The most recent FoodNet Population Survey was conducted during 2018–2019 and included interviews from 38, 743 adults and children. In addition to information on food exposures, the survey also includes questions on demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Investigators use statistical tests to determine if people in an outbreak report eating any of the suspected foods significantly more often than people in the survey. Comparing the frequency of foods reported by sick people to existing data is often faster than conducting a formal epidemiologic study.

Case-control studies: Investigators collect information from sick people and people who are not sick to see if cases were more likely to eat certain foods significantly more often than controls. Case-case studies: Investigators compare sick people in the outbreak to other sick people who are not part of the outbreak. Cohort studies: Investigators gather data from all the people that attended an event or ate at the same restaurant and compare the frequency of illness between people who did and did not eat specific foods. When people who ate a certain food got sick significantly more often than people who did not eat the food, it provides evidence that the food is the source of the outbreak.
