## Question

is blood 90% water

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether blood is 90% water. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly "blood" includes and whether the question refers to whole blood or to plasma. Then, I should verify the water content of plasma and the water content of whole blood. Next, I will check how hematocrit influences the overall water percentage. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting statements and state the correct answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misstate the answer. Blood is composed of plasma, the liquid portion, and formed elements, primarily red blood cells, along with white cells and platelets; plasma typically accounts for about 55% of whole blood volume, while red cells comprise most of the remaining 45%, a relationship captured by the hematocrit, which is roughly 40–45% in healthy adults [^e5bda63b] [^8d4fa19d].

> Now, I should verify the water content of plasma itself. Multiple authoritative sources state that plasma is about 90% water, which aligns with standard teaching and pathophysiology references; for example, a high-quality review notes that blood plasma consists of about 90% water, and this figure is echoed in discussions of dehydration physiology and exercise-related hemoconcentration, where plasma water content is central to viscosity and volume changes [^8b50dc5e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about whole blood being 90% water just because plasma is 90% water. I need to check the water content of whole blood, which includes the cellular fraction that is not predominantly water. The same high-quality review clarifies that whole blood is approximately 60% water, reflecting the dilution of plasma's high water content by the formed elements that contain less water per unit volume [^8b50dc5e].

> Wait, let me verify the math so I don't overgeneralize. If plasma is ~90% water and comprises ~55% of blood volume, while red cells and other solids comprise ~45% and contain less water, the weighted average for whole-blood water content falls around 60%, which matches the statement above; this also aligns with clinical physiology texts that describe whole-blood water content in the 55–65% range depending on hematocrit and measurement method [^8b50dc5e].

> I should double-check for any conflicting claims. Some lay summaries or non-peer-reviewed sources occasionally assert that blood is 90% water, but that conflates plasma with whole blood; the peer-reviewed and authoritative sources consistently distinguish that plasma is ~90% water, whereas whole blood is ~60% water, so the 90% figure applies to plasma, not to whole blood [^8b50dc5e].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is precise. Blood is not 90% water; plasma, the liquid portion of blood, is about 90% water, while whole blood is approximately 60% water, with the exact percentage varying with hematocrit and individual factors [^8b50dc5e].

---

Blood is **not 90% water**; whole blood is about **60% water** by volume, while plasma (the liquid portion) is about **90% water**. The 90% figure applies to plasma, not whole blood, because red blood cells and other solid components reduce the overall water content. This distinction is important for clinical interpretations of blood tests and fluid therapy decisions.

---

## Composition of whole blood

Whole blood consists of **plasma and formed elements** (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Plasma accounts for approximately 55% of total blood volume, while formed elements account for the remaining 45% [^e5bda63b].

| **Component** | **Percentage of total blood volume** |
|-|-|
| Plasma | ~55% |
| Formed elements (RBCs, WBCs, platelets) | ~45% |

---

## Water content in plasma

Plasma is the liquid portion of blood and is **approximately 90% water** [^8b50dc5e]. The remaining 10% consists of proteins, electrolytes, hormones, vitamins, and other dissolved substances. This high water content is essential for transporting nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body.

---

## Water content in whole blood

Whole blood, which includes both plasma and formed elements, has a **lower water content** than plasma alone. The formed elements, particularly red blood cells, contain less water than plasma. Therefore, the overall water content of whole blood is approximately 60% by volume [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding the water content of blood is clinically significant for several reasons:

- **Hydration assessment**: Clinicians use blood tests, such as hematocrit and plasma osmolality, to assess hydration status. Changes in plasma water content can indicate dehydration or overhydration [^0700d5fb].

- **Fluid therapy**: Knowledge of blood water content is essential for calculating fluid requirements in patients, particularly in critical care settings [^d62870a3].

- **Medication dosing**: Drug distribution and dosing calculations often consider plasma volume and water content to ensure accurate therapeutic levels.

---

## Conclusion

Blood is **not 90% water**; whole blood is approximately 60% water, while plasma alone is about 90% water. This distinction is crucial for clinical practice, including hydration assessment, fluid therapy, and medication dosing.

### Blood lead concentrations of children in the United States: a comparison of States using two very large databases [^af4a3b32]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether there are substantial differences by state between 2 large datasets in the proportion of children with elevated blood lead levels (BLLs); to identify states in which the percentage of elevated BLLs is high in either or both datasets; and to compare the percentage of elevated BLLs in individual states with those of children living in Flint, Michigan, during the months when these children were exposed to lead-contaminated drinking water.

Study Design

Tables of BLLs for individual states from the Quest Diagnostics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention datasets for 2014–2015, containing more than 3 million BLLs of young children? < ?6 years old, were constructed to compare the Quest Diagnostics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data with one another and with BLLs available for Flint children for 2014–2015.

Results

For some states, the percentages of BLLs ?5.0?µg/dL are similar in the 2 datasets, whereas for other states, the datasets differ substantially in the percentage of BLLs ?5.0?µg/dL. The percentage of BLLs ?5.0?µg/dL is greater in some states in both datasets than observed in Flint when children were exposed to contaminated water.

Conclusion

The data presented in this study can be a resource for pediatricians and public health professionals involved in the design of state programs to reduce lead exposure (primary prevention) and identify children with elevated BLLs (secondary prevention).

Drinking water lead exposure — water is an important but often overlooked source for children, especially for infants who are formula fed; water typically contributes to approximately 20% of a child's blood lead concentrations if the water lead concentration exceeds 5 ppb, and the contribution can be much higher for some children, especially for infants who ingest large quantities of tap water; children who reside in communities with lead service lines and inadequate anticorrosion control are also at increased risk for elevated blood lead concentrations.

Daily Water, Sodium, Chloride input, and source

Data regarding water refer to milliliters per kg per day, while data on sodium and chloride refer to milliequivalents per kg per day. Data are expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) according to their distribution

Fluids administered as a vehicle for intravenous drugs constituted 76 ± 12% of fluid creep, while fluids administered to provide patency of catheters and for flushes constituted the remaining 24 ± 12% of fluid creep. Among intravenously administered drugs, sedatives and antibiotics where the two major sources of fluid creep (44 ± 22% and 18 ± 18%, respectively).

The daily dose of sodium was 97 ± 42 mEq (14.4 ± 4.8 mEq/kg/day). Fluid creep represented the major source of sodium (7.9 ± 3.6 mEq/kg/day, 55.7% of total sodium input), followed by maintenance fluids (32.8%), enteral feed (6.9%), fluid resuscitation (2.3%) and blood components (2.2%) (Table 3).

The daily dose of chloride was 92 ± 40 mEq (13.6 ± 4.7 mEq/kg/day), slightly lower than sodium. Fluid creep represented the major source of chloride (7.9 ± 3.6, 58.2% of total chloride input), followed by maintenance fluids (29.9%), enteral feed (8%), fluid resuscitation (2.1%) and blood components (1.7%). Figure 2 represents the pie charts summarizing the percentage contribution of different fluid categories to water, sodium and chloride load.

### Physiologic basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment [^a9cba35c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Dehydration (body water deficit) is a physiologic state that can have profound implications for human health and performance. Unfortunately, dehydration can be difficult to assess, and there is no single, universal gold standard for decision making. In this article, we review the physiologic basis for understanding quantitative dehydration assessment. We highlight how phenomenologic interpretations of dehydration depend critically on the type (dehydration compared with volume depletion) and magnitude (moderate compared with severe) of dehydration, which in turn influence the osmotic (plasma osmolality) and blood volume-dependent compensatory thresholds for antidiuretic and thirst responses. In particular, we review new findings regarding the biological variation in osmotic responses to dehydration and discuss how this variation can help provide a quantitative and clinically relevant link between the physiology and phenomenology of dehydration. Practical measures with empirical thresholds are provided as a starting point for improving the practice of dehydration assessment.

Flint water contamination crisis — after officials changed Flint, Michigan's water supply without corrosion control, pediatric data showed increased lead exposure: the number of children < 5 years old with blood lead concentrations of > 5 μg/dL increased, and the percentage of Flint children with blood lead concentrations of > 5 μg/dL increased from 2.4% to 4.9%; in areas with higher water-lead content, it increased from 4% to 10.6%. The > 5 μg/dL threshold corresponds to the concentration, based on the US population, of children ages 1–5 years who are in the top 2.5% when tested for blood lead. In January 2016, both the state and federal governments declared a state of emergency and authorized aid to address the crisis and its effects on child development.

### Evaluation and review of body fluids saliva, sweat and tear compared to biochemical hydration assessment markers within blood and urine [^77c04769]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Human health and performance can be reduced when the body is dehydrated, and no gold standard for hydration assessment exists. Dehydration is a result of excess total body water (TBW) loss and is often accompanied by abnormalities in electrolyte balance. Heat, exercise-induced sweating or reduced thirst (often found in the elderly population) cause more water than sodium loss from the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment, that is, hypertonic dehydration. Hypotonic dehydration shows more sodium than water loss and can be induced by diuretics or severely burned skin. Isotonic dehydration is caused by water and sodium loss in equivalent proportions such as during diarrhoea. When people exercise for longer periods without fluid replacement, whole-body dehydration is associated with reductions in plasma, interstitial and intracellular volume, that is, hypovolemia.

Changes in body mass (BMc) are often used as measures of (de)hydration. This measurement is simple, inexpensive and noninvasive. Poorer memory and attention is observed with a BMc of < 1%, diminished physiological performance with a BMc of > 1–2%, and impaired endurance exercise performance with a dehydration threshold of ⩾2%. Measured fasting morning body mass is a reliable index of euhydration when assessed during 3–9 consecutive days, but the measurement of BMc has also some limitations. Measurements across the required 3–9 days are not always feasible (for example, availability) and for people participating in an exercise programme, body mass can change over time as a consequence of muscle hypertrophy independently of changes in body water or body fat loss. Thus, where it is not practical or possible to use repetitive measurements of body mass over time (monitoring), biochemical indices of hydration status based on concentration and composition of body fluids (that is, blood and urine) become a necessary alternative to evaluate body fluid balance.

Fluid requirements — body water composition indicates that water makes up ~ 60% of human body weight, equating to 42 l in a 70-kg man; two-thirds (28 l) is intracellular and one-third (14 l) is extracellular, with extracellular water comprising 10 l of interstitial fluid (including lymph), 3 l of plasma, and 1 l of "transcellular" fluid; homeostatic mechanisms normally maintain relatively constant levels of body water (± 0.2% body weight during a 24-h period).

### Dehydration is how you define it: comparison of 318 blood and urine athlete spot checks [^0700d5fb]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dehydration is a term that generally reflects any loss of body water and linked to poor athlete performance, heat illness, skeletal muscle cramps and acute renal failure in athletes.

Given the potential for unfavourable health and performance consequences, a number of definitions have been used to define dehydration with an end goal of prevention. The American College of Sports Medicine uses non-invasive measures to define dehydration as a urine specific gravity (USG) ≥ 1.020 and/or urine osmolality (UOsm) ≥ 700 mOsmol/kgH 2 O. The advantage of using non-invasive measures is that they are quick, simple and easy to use in both laboratory and field settings. Studies using body weight and urine indices as outcome measures support the conclusion that athletes must drink beyond the physiological dictates of thirst to maintain adequate hydration levels.

In contrast to non-invasive measures of hydration status, clinical medicine is reliant on blood (serum or plasma) chemistry measurements to define and subdivide dehydration into two (often related) categories: intracellular and extracellular dehydration. Intracellular dehydration is defined by any loss of intracellular water that induces cellular desiccation and hypertonicity (ie, increases in blood sodium concentration ([Na +]) or osmolality). Extracellular dehydration, which is also referred to as hypovolaemia or volume depletion, alternatively reflects any loss of sodium from the extracellular space that compromises plasma volume. The distinction between intracellular and extracellular dehydration is diagnostically important when choosing the best therapeutic strategies for water lack (intracellular dehydration) and/or sodium lack (extracellular dehydration). This clinical definition also reflects the physiological tenets of fluid homeostasis, which strive to protect tonicity and tissue perfusion. Accordingly, the US Institute of Medicine states that the primary indicator of hydration status is plasma or serum osmolalitywith the maintenance of normonatremia (blood [Na +] between 135 mmol/L and 145 mmol/L) central to this evolutionary tenet. Accordingly, studies using plasma osmolalityor plasma volumeas indicators of hydration status support the conclusion that thirst is an adequate stimulus to prevent intracellular and extracellular dehydration.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^c7146ef4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Weight Loss

Four studies (22%), evaluated the effect of water on weight change in participants with overweight and obesity. In 3 parallel group RCTs, adults with overweight and obesity randomized to consume 1500 mL of water per day before meals for a period of 12 weeks to 12 months had greater weight loss compared with those in the control groups (approximately 100%, 87%, and 44% more weight vs control groups).

In a fourth studyincluding 38 participants who reported drinking less than 1000 mL/d, drinking 2000 mL/d was not associated with weight over a 6-month period (effect estimate, 0.0 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0.1]; P = 0.88). The study recruited only 63% of its target, and at 6 months, the intervention group reported drinking 1135 (95% CI, 900 to 1400) mL/d. Compared with the other 3 studies assessing weight change, this study was distinct because it included adolescents aged 17 years or younger, whereas the other studies included adults only, and the water intervention in this study was not premeal intake.

Fasting Blood Glucose

Two studies (11%), assessed the effect of a water intervention on fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Sedaghat et alrandomized 40 patients with recently diagnosed (< 5 years) type 2 diabetes into a water intervention or control group that received no water recommendation. The water intervention consisted of drinking 250 mL before breakfast, 500 mL before lunch, and 250 mL before dinner for a total of 8 weeks. There was a significant between-group difference in mean change in FBG in the intervention (−32.6 mg/dL) vs the control group (5.3 mg/dL) (P = 0.003) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). On the other hand, Nakamura et altested a water intervention consisting of drinking 550 mL within 2 hours of waking and 550 mL before bedtime and found that FBG increased by approximately 0.6 mg/dL after 12 weeks in both groups. This RCT consisted of 60 adults with baseline FBG between 90 and 126 mg/dL and excluded participants receiving medication and/or lifestyle modification for diabetes. Baseline FBG of study participants was approximately 97 mg/dL, substantially lower than that in Sedaghat et al, which was approximately 225.7 mg/dL in the intervention group and 221.7 mg/dL in the control group.

### Quantitative theory for the longitudinal relaxation time of blood water [^3595958b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To propose and evaluate a model for the blood water T1 that takes into account the effects of hematocrit fraction, oxygenation fraction, erythrocyte hemoglobin concentration, methemoglobin fraction, and plasma albumin concentration.

Methods

Whole blood and lysed blood T1 data were acquired at magnetic fields of 3 Tesla (T), 7T, 9.4T, and 11.7T using inversion-recovery measurements and a home-built blood circulation system for maintaining physiological conditions. A quantitative model was derived based on multivariable fitting of this data.

Results

Fitting of the model to the data allowed determination of the different parameters describing the blood water T1 such as those for the diamagnetic and paramagnetic effects of albumin and hemoglobin, and the contribution of methemoglobin. The model correctly predicts blood T1 at multiple fields, as verified by comparison with existing literature.

Conclusion

The model provides physical and physiological parameters describing the effects of hematocrit fraction, oxygenation, hemoglobin concentration, methemoglobin fraction, and albumin concentration on blood water T1. It can be used to predict blood T1 at multiple fields. Magn Reson Med 76:270–281, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Analysis of blood lead levels of young children in flint, Michigan before and during the 18-month switch to flint river water [^681dcd09]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: The toxicity of lead, like any xenobiotic, is directly linked to the duration of exposure and toxin concentration in the body. The elevation in blood lead levels (BLLs) in young Flint, Michigan children noted in time-periods before, and during the 18-month exposure to Flint River water (FRW) from 25 April 2014 to 15 October 2015 is well-known internationally. The length of time BLLs were elevated is unknown, yet key in understanding the potential health impact of the event. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether BLLs in Flint children were increased during the entire 18-month FRW exposure compared to similar earlier time periods. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study analyzing BLLs from Flint children aged 5 years and under. The geometric mean (GM) BLLs and percentages of BLLs ≥ 5.0μg/dL in Period I: 25 April 2006 to 15 October 2007 (earliest timeframe available for study) and Period II: 25 April 2012 to 15 October 2013 (timeframe immediately before the water switch), were compared to Period III, 25 April 2014 to 15 October 2015 (FRW exposure). Results: There were 5663 BLLs available for study. GM ± SE BLLs decreased from 2.19 ± 0.03μg/dL in Period I to 1.47 ± 0.02μg/dL in Period II [95% CI, 0.64, 0.79]; p < .001 and decreased further to 1.32 ± 0.02 µg/dL during the FRW Period III [95% CI, 0.79, 0.95]; p < .001. The percentage of BLLs ≥ 5.0μg/dL decreased from Period I (10.6%) to Period II (3.3%) [95% CI, 5.7, 8.8]; p < .001 and from Period I to Period III (3.9%) [95% CI, 5.0, 8.2]; p = .002. The 0.6% increase from Period II to Period III was not statistically significant [95% CI, -1.9, 0.57]; p = .30. Conclusion: Analyses of GM and percentages ≥ 5.0μg/dL of BLLs do not support the occurrence of a global increase in BLLs in young children of Flint during the entire 18-month period of FRW exposure.

### IOC consensus statement on recommendations and regulations for sport events in the heat [^df80ce43]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydration principles

Healthy humans are generally well hydratedwith a day-to-day variation in total body water of 0.2%–0.7% of body mass. However, the rise in sweat rate when exercising in the heat can dramatically change this fluid balance. A reduction in total body water is associated with a decrease in plasma volume and an increase in plasma osmolalitythat will increase the core temperature threshold for vasodilation and sweating, reduces the sweat rate for any given core temperatureand decreases cardiac filling and challenges blood pressure regulation. Dehydration will therefore exacerbate the rate of heat storage and cardiovascular strain imposed by exercising in the heat, thus reducing exercise heat tolerance. Given the potential limit in accessing and ingesting fluid during the competition (see further), the general principle of hydration should be to avoid hypohydration (less than 2% body mass) during the periods of training in the heat, especially immediately before and during intense training and competition exercise in the heat. Any increase in fluid consumption should be progressive and not limited to competition day as an acute increase in fluid absorption may first increase the urine production. The fluid needs for an athlete training in the heat are highly individual but consistent within the individual when influencing variables are consistent. Fluid needs should be adapted based on changes in body mass and/or plasma osmolality and/or urine specific gravity. Hydration measures should be obtained in the morning to avoid confounding effects of recent diet and exercise. The following examples can also be used as a general guide at first before individualised data are ascertained: 6 mL of fluid per kg of body mass every 2–3 hour, or 2 L per day plus 1–2 L per hour of exercise plus 1 L for each 5°C increase in ambient temperature above 21.5°C.

Recommendations

Hydration capacity during exercise itself is limited; therefore, athletes should ascertain sufficient fluid intake "out of exercise", from the days before and throughout the period of training/competing in the heat.
A simple way to monitor hydration status during a period of training/competing in the heat is to follow the weight–urine–thirst principle with daily monitoring of body mass (changes should remain < 1–2%), urine specific gravity (should remain < 1.020) or colour and thirst. If available to the team, plasma osmolality (< 290 mmol/kg) can be included in cases of suspected chronic dehydration.

### Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking [^9e8f3c3b]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

Thirst motivates animals to drink in order to maintain fluid balance. Thirst has conventionally been viewed as a homeostatic response to changes in blood volume or tonicity. However, most drinking behaviour is regulated too rapidly to be controlled by blood composition directly, and instead seems to anticipate homeostatic imbalances before they arise. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the subfornical organ (SFO) in the anticipatory regulation of thirst in mice. By monitoring deep-brain calcium dynamics, we show that thirst-promoting SFO neurons respond to inputs from the oral cavity during eating and drinking and then integrate these inputs with information about the composition of the blood. This integration allows SFO neurons to predict how ongoing food and water consumption will alter fluid balance in the future and then to adjust behaviour pre-emptively. Complementary optogenetic manipulations show that this anticipatory modulation is necessary for drinking in several contexts. These findings provide a neural mechanism to explain longstanding behavioural observations, including the prevalence of drinking during meals, the rapid satiation of thirst, and the fact that oral cooling is thirst-quenching.

### Water injection (sterile water) [^3b69d421]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water for distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

The small volume of fluid provided by Sterile Water for Injection, USP when used only as a pharmaceutic aid for diluting or dissolving drugs for parenteral injection, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid balance except possibly in neonates or very small infants.

### Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration [^1b42cdd1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

How much water we really need depends on water functions and the mechanisms of daily water balance regulation. The aim of this review is to describe the physiology of water balance and consequently to highlight the new recommendations with regard to water requirements. Water has numerous roles in the human body. It acts as a building material; as a solvent, reaction medium and reactant; as a carrier for nutrients and waste products; in thermoregulation; and as a lubricant and shock absorber. The regulation of water balance is very precise, as a loss of 1% of body water is usually compensated within 24 h. Both water intake and water losses are controlled to reach water balance. Minute changes in plasma osmolarity are the main factors that trigger these homeostatic mechanisms. Healthy adults regulate water balance with precision, but young infants and elderly people are at greater risk of dehydration. Dehydration can affect consciousness and can induce speech incoherence, extremity weakness, hypotonia of ocular globes, orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. Human water requirements are not based on a minimal intake because it might lead to a water deficit due to numerous factors that modify water needs (climate, physical activity, diet and so on). Water needs are based on experimentally derived intake levels that are expected to meet the nutritional adequacy of a healthy population. The regulation of water balance is essential for the maintenance of health and life. On an average, a sedentary adult should drink 1.5 l of water per day, as water is the only liquid nutrient that is really essential for body hydration.

### Hypernatremia [^05a765fe]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia" for hypernatremia.

The Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia calculator estimates the amount of free water (in liters) needed to correct hypernatremia based on the patient's sodium levels, weight, and total body water (TBW) percentage

The calculator assesses the free water deficit in individuals with hypernatremia by integrating five particular inputs: gender, age group, weight, current serum sodium level, and desired serum sodium level. This metric is invaluable for determining how much free water is necessary to adjust serum sodium levels back to normal.

The calculation process unfolds through these steps:

- **Weight Conversion**: The individual's weight can be entered in either kilograms or pounds. If pounds are used, the calculator converts this to kilograms:
Weight in kg = Weight in lbs / 2.20462.

- **Total Body Water (TBW) Fraction**: This fraction represents the portion of body weight that comprises water. Its determination hinges on both the individual's gender and age group:

- The TBW fraction is 0.6 for children, adult males, and non-elderly males.
- For adult females, the TBW fraction adapts to 0.5.
- In the elderly, it decreases to 0.5 for males and further to 0.45 for females.

- **Sodium Levels**: Input for serum sodium levels is accepted in mEq/L or mmol/L, given the equivalence of these units, no conversion is needed.

- **Computation of Free Water Deficit**: This quantity is calculated with the formula:
Free Water Deficit (L) = TBW fraction × Weight (kg) × [(Current Serum Sodium / Desired Serum Sodium) - 1].

- **Outcome**: The free water deficit is calculated and then rounded to one decimal place, delivered in liters.

This calculator offers a tailored analysis essential for the customized management of hypernatremia. This consideration of individual parameters facilitates personalized fluid replacement therapy, ensuring serum sodium levels are safely normalized.

### New compartment model for hepatic blood flow quantification in humans from 15O-water PET images [^a74225be]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we introduced a new compartment model for HBF quantification from dynamicO-water PET images. According to earlier research on this topic, our results from all the three dual-input models meant for HBF quantification seem realistic: We obtained a mean total HBFs varying from 1.236 ± 0.422 to 1.229 ± 0.612 mL/min/mL with these three models. In comparision, Taniguchi et al. obtained a mean total HBF of 1.208–1.293 mL/min/g for their 88 patients depending on the liver segment and Rijzewijk et al. a mean total HBF of 0.850 ± 0.047 mL/min/mL for 18 healthy controls. In other study, Taniguchi et al. reported a mean total HBF of 1.00 mL/min/g for five human patients with normal liver. Additionally, the mean percentage of the portal HBF from the total HBF was 74.3 ± 11.5% for our new model, which is very close to the estimate of 75% reported in Sureka et al. for instance. The partition coefficient of water in these three models varied around 0.75–0.90, resembling spleen-blood partition coefficient of water in Taniguchi et al. for instance.

### Bacteriostatic water [^e2fc4edb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

The small volume of fluid provided by Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP when used only as a pharmaceutic aid for diluting or dissolving drugs for parenteral injection, is unlikely to exert a significant effect on fluid balance except possibly in very small infants.

Introduction

Water is essential for a wide variety of physiological functions, and water intake must be sufficient to compensate for daily losses. Low daily water intake and low urine output increase long-term risk of kidney dysfunction, and insufficient intake may also have a role in the development of hyperglycemia. Guidelines for adequate total water intake for the general adult population have been proposed by several international governing bodies. Yet, these recommendations are based on population median water intakes, with limited consideration of links between water intake and hydration status and without links between water intake and health. Moreover, the recommendations do not provide a method for individuals to ensure they are consuming enough water to meet their specific hydration needs.

Establishing the adequacy of fluid intake based on physiological indicators of hydration is challenging, because there are multiple biological indicators of hydration in average adults in free-living conditions, each sensitive to a different aspect of hydration. The accurate measurement of hydration status is complicated because body water turnover occurs constantly and water moves between intracellular and extracellular compartments. Proposed biomarkers of hydration include the direct measurement of blood, urine, saliva and tears, as well as estimates of body water via bioelectrical impedance or spectroscopy. No single method appears to be ideal for all situations. Serum osmolality is considered a good marker for acute or critical dehydration situations, but is tightly regulated and insensitive to mild hydration deficits in healthy sedentary individuals with ad libitum access to fluids. In contrast, urinary hydration biomarkers do vary according to fluid intake, and are biologically significant in terms of predicting health outcomes such as chronic kidney disease.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^d9dc2f69]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Water is a major constituent of the human body and is considered an essential nutrient that cannot be sufficiently produced by metabolism. The National Academy of Medicine suggests a daily fluid intake of approximately 13 eight-ounce cups for men and 9 for women, respectively. A common public health-related recommendation is to drink 8 cups of water per day, yet the supporting evidence is not clear. Given the wide variability of body weight, activity level, and health status at the population level and the numerous mechanisms that regulate water balance, a single optimal amount of daily water consumption is a challenging concept.

Behavioral factors and hydration status have been widely studied in relation to health conditions owing to the known detrimental effects of dehydration. To our knowledge, there has been no study to compile reports of the benefits of water interventions on clinical outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) pertaining to the impact of increased daily water consumption on health-related outcomes.

### Mapping human brain capillary water lifetime: high-resolution metabolic neuroimaging [^f61b21fc]. NMR in Biomedicine (2015). Low credibility.

Mean brain intra‐capillary blood water molecule lifetime (τ b)

The average erythrocyte speed through cerebral cortical capillaries is 2 mm s −1 or less 38, 39, 40: this measures blood velocity. In a common (1 mm) 3 high‐resolution human 1 H 2 O MRI voxel, a conservatively small estimate of the average, tortuous capillary path‐length is 2 mm 40, 41. Thus, the mean voxel transit time for a blood water molecule is at least 1 s. Many things happen to the molecule during this period. The mean lifetime inside an erythrocyte (τ i) is 10 ms 42, 43, 44, 45. By equilibrium mass action, for a 40% hematocrit the mean plasma lifetime before entering a red cell (τ p) is 15 ms. Thus, any given water molecule enters and leaves erythrocytes about 40 times during its voxel passage (also, the entire red cell water content is exchanged ~100 times). The 3D Einstein diffusion equation, ⟨ r 2 ⟩ = 6 Dt D 46, allows estimation of H 2 O molecule capillary wall encounter frequency: r is the capillary radius, D the water diffusion coefficient, and t D the average time to diffuse a distance r. Inserting the mean feline r value, 2.6 µm 40, and a conservatively small D value (1.5 µm 2 ms −1, half the pure water D), we obtain t D = 0.8 ms. Even an H 2 O molecule in the center of the capillary lumen would encounter the capillary wall more than 1000 times during its voxel passage. It is a very good approximation that capillary blood water is "well mixed". Thus, we can estimate the probability of a water molecule escaping the capillary. The τ b inverse, τ b −1, is the unidirectional first‐order rate constant, k po, for water extravasation 47. For a well‐mixed lumen, this is τ b −1 = P W † [A ca / V ca], where P W † is the transendothelial water permeability coefficient, A ca the individual capillary surface area, and V ca the individual capillary lumen volume 48. For a cylindrical microvessel: τ b −1 = 2 [P W † /r]. Some time ago 49, we noted that an r = 2.6 µm and a primate P W † value of 2 µm s −1 50, 51 predict 650 ms for τ b. The k po (τ b −1) value (1.5 s −1) corresponds to about 78% probability (= 100[1 − exp(− k po t)]: t is the capillary transit time (~1 s)) that any given water molecule will exchange out of the blood space (to be replaced by an extravascular H 2 O molecule) during its capillary passage. Because blood velocity causes no net change in the number of (indistinguishable) capillary H 2 O molecules, the τ b quantity is not influenced by the blood flow (F; CBF) magnitude. This contrasts with the situation for the extraction of labeled water 50, which is surely "perfusion limited".

Additional Applications of Blood Flow and 18 F-FDG Kinetic Analysis

The ability of both 18 F-FDG K 1 and blood flow, as estimated by 15 O-water, motivated studying 18 F-FDG K 1 as a proxy for flow, recognizing the difficulties and inherent challenges in regularly using 15 O-water given its 2-min half-life. 18 F-FDG K 1, as discussed in part I, represents the delivery of radiotracer to tissue, inclusive of blood flow and transport across membranes. As such, this rate constant is not synonymous with blood flow. By the Fick principle, K 1 can be approximated by blood flow multiplied by the first-pass extraction fraction of the tracer. For 15 O-water, the extraction fraction is assumed to equal 1 so that 15 O-water K 1 equals blood flow. For tracers with lower first-pass extraction (e.g. 18 F-FDG), the extraction fraction is less than 1, and K 1 consequently does not equal blood flow. Nevertheless, there is a moderately strong correlation between blood flow as measured by 15 O-water and 18 F-FDG K 1. In a follow-on related approach, tumor blood flow has been estimated from the first pass of 18 F-FDG using a 1-tissue-compartment model with data obtained during the first 2 min after injection. By analyzing such a short period after injection, the metabolic extraction fraction from 18 F-FDG phosphorylation can be separated from the first-pass extraction fraction of 18 F-FDG, which in turn can better estimate blood flow. In a study that included various tumor types, a correlation coefficient of 0.86 was found between measures of blood flow by the first pass of 18 F-FDG and blood flow as estimated by 15 O-water. Humbert et al. applied these methods and reported that blood flow changes were capable of stratifying patient groups with different overall survival percentages in women whose triple-negative breast cancer did not have a complete pathologic response. This approach could be implemented as a short flow-phase 18 F-FDG PET scan early after injection, which could be practical in the clinic, akin to a 3-phase bone scan.

Chapter 1: Diagnosis of hypovolaemia

Referenced literature: –

Box 3
no caption available

Background to recommendation 1–1

One of the most basic decisions for maintenance of the homeostasis of the human body is the choice of delivering external solutions. The objectives at the heart of such decision-making are the goals of volume substitution (intravascular) and fluid substitution (interstitial). In the majority of studies, the terms (intracellular) dehydration and (extracellular) volume depletion are used interchangeably, although defining two quite different entities. In addition, posture-related syncope or reflex tachycardia while standing (by over 30 beats min −1) is frequently indicative of a fluid volume deficit (hypovolaemia). In 1999, McGee et al. demonstrated that a dry axilla, in contrast to moist mucous membranes, would also increase the sensitivity for a diagnosis of hypovolaemia. Interestingly, capillary refill time and skin turgidity showed only very poor sensitivity, whereas presence of tachycardia when lying down had only a high specificity.

As every substance delivered to the body interacts with the body's own fluids in accordance with its composition, stability and mode of delivery, predictions as to inertness or the exchange of substances (down to the level of the cell) are virtually impossible.

Total body water is held enclosed in various fluid spaces (compartments): two-thirds are found in cells (intracellular compartment), whereas the remaining water is held in the extracellular compartment and comprises interstitial fluid (31%), blood plasma (7%) and other transcellular fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). The body's own regulation of fluid balance is achieved by osmoregulation and volume regulation, and the thirst reflex. The goal is to maintain body water at a volume of approximately 42 l. As the volume of the intracellular space is generally co-controlled by the extracellular space (cell walls are water-permeable), any fluid delivered to the body can cause water displacement, down to the level of the cell. As the interstitial fluid forms part of the extracellular space and can be determined only indirectly as the difference between overall extracellular space and plasma volume, investigations of interstitial fluid deficit are virtually impossible – at least without additional instrument-based diagnostics. Accordingly, the substance-based substitution of the interstitial space is certainly neither advisable nor necessary. In the event of isotonic hyperhydration, for example extended intravascular volume delivery would result in an expansion of the extracellular space with an increased incidence of interstitial oedema because of diffusion.

### A neuroradiologist's guide to arterial spin labeling MRI in clinical practice [^16cca6fc]. Neuroradiology (2015). Low credibility.

Arterial labeling efficiency is the first key aspect to a good ASL acquisition. How effectively we invert the longitudinal magnetisation directly affects the eventually acquired signal. Efficiencies, designated with α, can range from 80 to 98% with currently available pulse sequences, which need to be taken into account when quantifying CBF.

Both blood transit time and T1 relaxation are in the order of seconds, meaning that about two thirds of the label will have decayed by the time the blood reaches the capillary bed. The optimal PLD is thus almost invariably a compromise between the arterial blood T1 and transit time. Arterial T1 and feeding arteries transit times both need to be taken into account to get a proper absolute quantification by physiological modelling. Ideally, the arterial blood relaxation time (T1 Blood) is measured on an individual basis. In the capillary bed, the arterial blood water will exchange with the surrounding tissue. The ratio of tissue water versus intravascular water in the brain is in the order of 20:1, meaning that only a very small proportion of the measured water signal is affected by the magnetic label. When the labeled water enters the tissue, over 90–95% exchanges with the tissue water instantaneously. For this reason, it is impossible to measure any labeled venous blood flowing out of the tissue, due to the very short T1 relaxation time compared with the equilibrium time (1–2 s versus 10–15 min for a nominal CBF of 50 ml/min/100 g, respectively).

One of the major confounds when using ASL comes from magnetisation transfer effects. The application of off-resonance RF pulses to label the arterial blood proximal to the tissue of interest will induce a reduction of MR signal that mimics the signal decrease induced by the labeled blood water exchange. This is due to the fact that protons in macromolecules have a very short T2 and thus a very broad frequency spectrum. As such, the off-resonance RF pulses used in any asymmetrical ASL sequence will inadvertently not only saturate the arterial blood but also protons in these macromolecules. This saturation will then be transferred to tissue water molecules reducing the MR signal.

Three main categories of ASL pulse sequences have been developed, each aiming to take these factors into account with variable success: continuous ASL (CASL), pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL), and pulsed ASL (PASL). PCASL is at present the sequence of choice, due to its high labeling efficiency combined with its ease of implementation and hardware specifications for clinical scanners.

### 50% dextrose [^35f8e8d5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered intravenously this solution restores blood glucose levels in hypoglycemia and provides a source of carbohydrate calories.

Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing action. Dextrose injection undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^04b060a0]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

SHEA IPC in pediatric residential facilities — environmental disinfection and bleach use provides specific product selection, dilution, and contact-time instructions. For areas that require disinfection, such as toilet and diapering areas and food preparation areas, use hospital-grade germicides, and follow manufacturers' instructions for use when mixing liquids for disinfecting floors and surfaces. Use regular, unscented household bleach containing 5%–9% sodium hypochlorite, and do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or if it is not specified on the label; if bottle directions are absent, a bleach solution can be made by mixing 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) of bleach per gallon of room temperature water. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for keeping the surface wet for at least 1 minute before removing or wiping the surface, and make a new diluted bleach solution daily. For blood or other potentially infectious body fluid spills, disinfect the surface with an EPA-registered disinfectant labeled to kill tuberculosis ("tuberculocidal") or a bleach solution; a more concentrated bleach solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water is used with large blood spills and when disinfecting the room of a guest with recent C. difficile infection (CDI). When using EPA-registered products, adhere to contact or "dwell" time and keep surfaces wet during the entire contact time, and note that the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that employers provide their workers with the Safety Data Sheet for any cleaning products employees should use.

### Protective role of aquaporin-4 water channels after contusion spinal cord injury [^8e1a6634]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is accompanied by disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier and subsequent extravasation of fluid and proteins, which results in edema (increased water content) at the site of injury. However, the mechanisms that control edema and the extent to which edema impacts outcome after SCI are not well elucidated.

Methods

Here, we examined the role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels after experimental contusion injury in mice, a clinically relevant animal model of SCI.

Results

Mice lacking AQP4 (AQP4(-/-) mice) exhibited significantly impaired locomotor function and prolonged bladder dysfunction compared with wild-type (WT) littermates after contusion SCI. Consistent with a greater extent of functional deterioration, AQP4(-/-) mice showed greater neuronal loss and demyelination, with prominent cyst formation, which is generally absent in mouse SCI. The extent of spinal cord edema, as expressed by percentage water content, was persistently increased above control levels in AQP4(-/-) mice but not WT mice at 14 and 28 days after injury. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that blood vessels in the vicinity of the lesion core had incomplete barrier function because of sparse tight junctions.

Interpretation

These results suggest that AQP4 plays a protective role after contusion SCI by facilitating the clearance of excess water, and that targeting edema after SCI may be a novel therapeutic strategy.

### Non-invasive MRI of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function [^9f3277f5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In the context of this work, it is important to consider the difference between water exchange and net secretion. Our quantitative estimates of the rate of labelled water delivery by the BCSFB to ventricular CSF do not represent a measure of CSF secretion, but primarily reflects the exchange of labelled blood water across the BCSFB. Thus, our measure reflects the rate of perfusion of the CP convolved with its permeability to labelled blood water. Given the huge CSF-facing surface area of the CP and its high vascular density, and based on the high extraction fraction of blood water in the brain tissue (~90%,–), we surmise that 100% of labelled blood water crosses from the CP to ventricular CSF. There is wide ranging evidence to suggest that the rate of CSF secretion is coupled to perfusion of the choroid plexus. Thus, it is likely that the BCSFB-ASL measures in this work represent a correlate of CSF secretion. Indeed the observed correlations between our estimates of BCSFB function and ventricular volume suggest that this is the case (given wide ranging evidence that CSF secretion plays a role in determining ventricle size). However, further studies that more fully explore this relationship using invasive measures of CSF secretion (e.g. Masserman or Papenheimer technique) would be valuable. Taking the average rate of BCSFB-mediated labelled water delivery to the lateral ventricles and incorporating the total size of the functional voxels (11.25 mm 3) returns a total BCSFB-labelled water delivery rate to the lateral ventricles of 2.7 µl/min. Unsurprisingly, this is markedly greater than previous estimates of CSF secretion in the mouse brain (~0.3 µl/min) which reflects higher rates of water exchange/flux vs. net secretion across blood vessels (see Hladky et al.for detailed discussion). However, it is also important to consider that the previous estimates of CSF secretion will include contribution from CP tissue in the third and fourth ventricle as well as possible extra-choroidal sources such as the BBBmaking it difficult to directly relate previous estimates of CSF secretion to rates of BCSFB-mediated labelled blood water delivery from the lateral ventricles that is estimated in this work.

### Long-term health outcomes associated with hydration status [^89aa43b8]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Body water balance is determined by fundamental homeostatic mechanisms that maintain stable volume, osmolality and the composition of extracellular and intracellular fluids. Water balance is maintained by multiple mechanisms that continuously match water losses through urine, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract and respiration with water gains achieved through drinking, eating and metabolic water production. Hydration status is determined by the state of the water balance. Underhydration occurs when a decrease in body water availability, due to high losses or low gains, stimulates adaptive responses within the water balance network that are aimed at decreasing losses and increasing gains. This stimulation is also accompanied by cardiovascular adjustments. Epidemiological and experimental studies have linked markers of low fluid intake and underhydration - such as increased plasma concentration of vasopressin and sodium, as well as elevated urine osmolality - with an increased risk of new-onset chronic diseases, accelerated aging and premature mortality, suggesting that persistent activation of adaptive responses may be detrimental to long-term health outcomes. The causative nature of these associations is currently being tested in interventional trials. Understanding of the physiological responses to underhydration may help to identify possible mechanisms that underlie potential adverse, long-term effects of underhydration and inform future research to develop preventative and treatment approaches to the optimization of hydration status.

### Shortwave-infrared meso-patterned imaging enables label-free mapping of tissue water and lipid content [^23309d4e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Phantom validation studies

Figure 1b demonstrates the ability of SWIR-MPI to extract a complex spatial mosaic of chromophores in an optical phantom. In this example, a liquid phantom was fabricated from intralipid (an emulsified water/lipid solution), bovine blood, and soybean oil, with hyperspectral optical absorption data cubes generated for both NIR and SWIR wavelength regions. Areas containing hemoglobin show distinct absorption features at NIR wavelengths, whereas the areas with soybean oil show absorption features in the SWIR. Absorption spectra from single pixel locations highlight distinct features for blood, oil, and intralipid. The contribution of oxyhemoglobin absorption is clearly visible in the NIR region, whereas the 1210 nm absorption peak of lipid is clearly visible in the SWIR. The spectrum from the thin layer of blood also exhibits this lipid absorption feature, demonstrating a partial volume effect owing to the nature of diffusive photons, in which absorption from different tissue regions within the optical probing volume are effectively averaged. Figure 1c shows measured concentration maps of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, water, and lipids in the optical phantom. Following common practice observed in the diffuse optical spectroscopy field, water and lipid concentrations are reported as percentages. The water content is reported as the concentration of measured water divided by pure water concentration (55.6 M). The lipid concentration is reported as relative to an assumed "pure" lipid density of 0.9 g/ml.

A series of homogenous phantoms with varying water and lipid content were measured with SWIR-MPI to validate the accuracy of chromophore content extraction. Absorption (µ a) and reduced scattering spectra were measured from 910 nm to 1290 nm (Fig. 1d for µ a spectra and Supplementary Fig. 3a forspectra), followed by extraction of water and lipid concentrations (Supplementary Table 3). The average error for water content estimation was −0.2 ± 2.5%, and the average error for lipid was 0.3 ± 1.6% over a wide physiologic range (5–20% for lipids, 80–95% for water). These results demonstrate that SWIR-MPI can extract water and lipid concentrations with high accuracy. We note that this accuracy was obtained in spatially homogenous samples, and it is expected that spatially complex tissues will induce a partial volume measurement effect, as demonstrated above in the phantom study (Fig. 1b, c). In addition, a drift test was conducted over 5 h to demonstrate measurement robustness (Supplementary Note 3).

### Blood lead levels of children in flint, Michigan: 2006–2016 [^e0639b92]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated the increases in blood lead levels (BLLs) observed in young children in Flint, Michigan, during their exposure to corrosive Flint River water during the years 2014 and 2015 and compared their BLLs to those of Flint children measured during the years 2006–2013 and 2016.

Study Design

This was a retrospective study design using BLLs extracted from databases from 2006 to 2016. We analyzed a population sample of 15 817 BLLs from children aged ≤ 5 years with potential exposure to contaminated Flint River water. Percentages of BLLs ≥ 5.0µg/dL and geometric mean (GM) BLLs were analyzed over time.

Results

A significant decline in the percentages of BLLs ≥ 5.0µg/dL from 11.8% in 2006 to 3.2% in 2016 was observed (P < .001). GM ± SE BLLs decreased from 2.33 ± 0.04µg/dL in 2006 to 1.15 ± 0.02µg/dL in 2016 (P < .001). GM BLLs increased twice: from 1.75 ± 0.03µg/dL to 1.87 ± 0.03µg/dL (2010–2011) and from 1.19 ± 0.02µg/dL to 1.30 ± 0.02µg/dL (2014–2015). Overall, from 2006 to 2016, there was a 72.9% decrease in the percentage of children with BLLs ≥ 5.0µg/dL and a 50.6% decrease in GM BLLs.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that the 11 year trend of annual decreases in BLLs in children in Flint, Michigan, reversed to a degree consistent with random variation from 2010 to 2011, and again during the exposure to Flint River water in 2014–2015. Historically, public health efforts to reduce BLLs of young children in Flint have been effective over the 11-year period studied.

### Atlas of plasma NMR biomarkers for health and disease in 118, 461 individuals from the UK biobank [^bffdfe16]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Plasma sample dilution issue

All UK Biobank blood samples are known to suffer from unintended dilution during the initial sample storage process at UK Biobank facilities. Prior reports have suggested that samples from aliquot 3, used for the NMR measurements, suffer from 5–10% dilution. The dilution is believed to come from mixing of participant samples with water due to seals that failed to hold a system vacuum in the automated liquid handling systems. While this issue is likely to have an impact on some of the absolute biomarker concentration values, it is expected to have limited impact on most epidemiological analyses. However, we recommend that this aspect is considered when conducting analyses that rely on absolute concentrations, such as stratification based on biomarker concentration cutpoints. This may also cause challenges to compare distributions of biomarker concentrations with those observed in other cohort studies. We, therefore, caution against using the concentrations observed in UK Biobank as reference levels for translational applications.

### Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (Ringer's) [^01ce2879]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

Tips for quantification of blood loss during cesarean births — begin the process of quantification of blood loss when the amniotic membranes are ruptured or after the infant is born; after delivery of the placenta, measure the amount of blood loss in the suction canister and drapes, notify the team, and document the amount of blood loss in milliliters; before adding irrigation fluid, ensure that the scrub team communicates when irrigation is beginning and note that some normal saline will be absorbed into tissues; one of two methods can be used to suction the irrigation fluid: continue to suction into the same canister and measure the amount of irrigation fluid or provide another suction tube to collect the irrigation separately into another canister; weigh all blood-soaked materials and clots, calculate the weight and convert to milliliters; at the end of the surgery, add the volume of quantified blood calculated by weight with the volume of quantified blood in the suction canister to determine total quantification of blood loss; note that lap pads dampened with normal saline contain minimal fluid and when saturated with blood, weigh them as you would a dry lap pad.

### Drinking water: the saltier the better? [^f7079299]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The network of minerals (sodium [Na +], calcium [Ca 2+], magnesium [Mg 2+], and potassium [K +]) infiltrating the drinking groundwater supply, potential sources of water and mineral intake through diet, potential water and mineral excretion through physical activity, and their incompletely understood role in blood pressure and cardiovascular health.

Because this study assessed water samples and blood pressure at a single time point, future research should explore the long‐term effects of drinking water salinity on blood pressure, incident hypertension, and cardiovascular health. It is also important to note that while the association between salinity and blood pressure was in the opposite direction of what was hypothesized, the statistically significant difference was clinically small (moderate‐salinity water drinkers had a −1.58 [95% CI: −3.13, −0.03] mm Hg difference in systolic blood pressure). One possible explanation for the unexpected finding that higher drinking water salinity was associated with lower blood pressure is the small number of subjects consuming very high‐salinity water. The distribution may have skewed towards samples in the mild‐salinity and lower end of the moderate‐salinity categories. However, the data presented in restricted cubic spline plots suggest a J‐shape curve, 6 demonstrating a trend of higher systolic blood pressure with higher water EC. An interesting follow‐up study could assess blood pressure with more participants consuming higher‐salinity water.

### Drinking water: the saltier the better? [^273831a5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite some key limitations, this study offers interesting insights. With almost 40% of the world's population living within 100 km of an ocean or sea, 16 there is a high demand for fresh groundwater extraction. In fact, half a billion people in the world face severe freshwater scarcity year‐round. 17 Sea level rise associated with global climate change, coupled with increased demand for groundwater, may increase water salinity via saltwater intrusion in coastal regions. 2 The severity of such saltwater intrusion may compromise groundwater supply, increasing the need for consideration of water desalination. Managed aquifer recharge is a valuable technique to manage groundwater quantity and quality, including preventing some of the negative consequences of saltwater intrusion. 18 Managed aquifer recharge is likely a key solution for managing salinity in the drinking water in southwest coastal Bangladesh, but effectiveness can vary by season, as well as management of the process. 19 Another factor impacting groundwater supply is the location and depth of the well. The degree to which seawater infiltrates the groundwater can depend on the porosity or clay‐like conditions of the surrounding soil. Shallow wells may be more susceptible to seawater intrusion than deeper‐drilled wells. 19 There can also be seasonal differences affecting the drinking water supply, which may be exacerbated by climate change. These are all important considerations, not only for future clinical research on this topic, but for geologists, hydrologists, and public health officials alike.

This study highlights an important public health issue. If more people will be consuming water with a higher salinity globally, the long‐term impact of water salinity on blood pressure and cardiovascular health must be determined. Future studies, including randomized controlled trials, are needed to elucidate the blood pressure effects of each mineral in higher‐salinity water. These studies should also assess the impact of potential confounding factors, including disease status, diet, and physical activity. It is still unclear how increased sodium content in the groundwater drinking supply may be offset by other mineral content, including calcium and magnesium. As such, the contribution of each individual mineral to overall health should be further examined. These questions represent an exciting area of future research with a potentially large impact on global health.

### Perioperative water and electrolyte balance and water homeostasis regulation in children with acute surgery [^0b838e1a]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we observed that the use of moderately hypotonic fluid therapy after correction of extracellular fluid deficit is not necessarily associated with post-operative hyponatremia. All participants except one received electrolyte-free water. The latter, in the presence of high circulating plasma-AVP levels on admission, might have had a clinically meaningful impact on P Na levels at the end of surgery. Of note, almost all of the patients were able to excrete net free water, which is essential in preventing clinically important changes in P Na concentrations. This is also reflected in the assessment of water and electrolyte balance (Table 1), which shows that the amount of water and sodium retained was rather isotonic, thus preventing the appearance of hyponatremia.

Of equal importance to mention is that when the patients were admitted to the Emergency Department, all were assumed to be mildly dehydrated. Our study design precluded us from asserting the precise percentage of extracellular fluid deficit at admission, since we did not have the differences between ill weights and well weights, which is the most reliable clinical method to assess the percentage of fluid loss. However, even with this limitation, medical history of poor fluid intake before admission, low FE Na values and increased urine osmolality on admission, positive water balance in addition to a marked dilution of plasma albumin and hemoglobin levels observed over the study period, sodium retention as well as a negative balance for potassium, accompanied by increased circulating levels of aldosterone together with increased plasma-AVP levels on admission all suggest that a state of dehydration was present when participants entered hospital. In parallel to the aforementioned, we observed a significant decrease in blood bicarbonate levels at the end of surgery (Table 2). This observation, in the presence of no significant changes in plasma chloride, indicates a diluted bicarbonate due to volume expansion.

### Quantitative theory for the transverse relaxation time of blood water [^ea0b5db2]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

An integrative model is proposed to describe the dependence of the transverse relaxation rate of blood water protons (R 2blood = 1/T 2blood) on hematocrit fraction and oxygenation fraction (Y). This unified model takes into account (a) the diamagnetic effects of albumin, hemoglobin and the cell membrane; (b) the paramagnetic effect of hemoglobin; (c) the effect of compartmental exchange between plasma and erythrocytes under both fast and slow exchange conditions that vary depending on field strength and compartmental relaxation rates and (d) the effect of diffusion through field gradients near the erythrocyte membrane. To validate the model, whole-blood and lysed-blood R 2 data acquired previously using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill measurements as a function of inter-echo spacing τ cp at magnetic fields of 3.0, 7.0, 9.4 and 11.7 T were fitted to determine the lifetimes (field-independent physiological constants) for water diffusion and exchange, as well as several physical constants, some of which are field-independent (magnetic susceptibilities) and some are field-dependent (relaxation rates for water protons in solutions of albumin and oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, ie, blood plasma and erythrocytes, respectively). This combined exchange-diffusion model allowed excellent fitting of the curve of the τ cp -dependent relaxation rate dispersion at all four fields using a single average erythrocyte water lifetime, τ ery = 9.1 ± 1.4 ms, and an averaged diffusional correlation time, τ D = 3.15 ± 0.43 ms. Using this model and the determined physiological time constants and relaxation parameters, blood T 2 values published by multiple groups based on measurements at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 T and higher could be predicted correctly within error. Establishment of this theory is a fundamental step for quantitative modeling of the BOLD effect underlying functional MRI.

### Best practices for the design, laboratory analysis, and reporting of trials involving fatty acids [^e91df883]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

REPORTING

Relative versus absolute concentrations

Fatty acids are reported in 2 formats: relative and absolute.

Relative

Known as fatty acid profiling, the units are expressed as percentage by weight of total fatty acids, also known as weight-for-weight and abbreviated variously as "%, wt:wt" or "g/100 g". Profile reporting is the most common means of expressing fatty acid data. Weight is the natural unit for a GC-FID analysis because the FID responds to the total C and H burned rather than the moles of each analyte eluting from the column. Importantly, this method is also natural for studies focused on competition between various fatty acids for access to metabolism such as transport proteins, esterification, and interconversion from one fatty acid to another.

Profile percentages tend to exhibit lower variability than absolute concentration (discussed below) and tend to be distributed normally, a statistical advantage. As a result, proposed blood biomarkers of n–3 PUFA status are typically relative percentages or ratios; concentrations of n–3 PUFAs without context are difficult to interpret because high concentrations could be a result of general lipemia rather than a specific increase in n–3 PUFAs. A recent systematic review of the blood fatty acid data of healthy adults across the globe revealed that 78% of the data were reported as weight percentage overall, with higher reporting percentages in the erythrocyte (91%), whole blood (92%), and plasma PL (83%) blood fractions.

Absolute

Expressing fatty acid concentrations in terms of concentration in a fluid (e.g. plasma) or tissue, for instance, as mg fatty acids/mL plasma, is appropriate when the goal is to establish the total available fatty acids. Importantly, in most biological systems, lipids are not dissolved but are maintained in suspension in various ways, as cells (e.g. RBCs), lipoproteins, or bound to transport proteins. Dissolution in aqueous solution implies a molecular dispersion, useful as a proxy for collision frequency, which enters into the reaction rate definition. Lipids in suspension are not molecular dispersions, and in their native environment where biology occurs (e.g. a membrane or the core of a lipoprotein particle) they are at a far higher concentration than in the bulk fluid or tissue. The concept of absolute concentration must therefore be understood as defining an average mass per unit fluid or tissue. Methods for measuring concentration do not inherently depend on measurement of a range of fatty acids; rather, they can be restricted to a single fatty acid.

### Blood concentration and its treatment… [^419775b2]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The universal necessity of water for biologic processes is generally recognized; the consequences of deprivation of this medium in which the chemical changes of metabolism occur are not so clearly appreciated. In discussing the water balance of the body, Rowntree1 has pointed out that for the maintenance of health the intake must be sufficient to maintain the amount of water in the body tissues necessary for maximal efficiency in metabolism and in the execution of other physiologic processes. This involves the removal of waste products and the dissipation of heat. A certain degree of desiccation of various organs, tissues and fluids ensues when the amount of water eliminated from the body exceeds the amount ingested, plus that produced through metabolic processes. The untoward consequences of such situations have only begun in recent years to receive the serious consideration they deserve. The blood tends to maintain its integrity of composition BLOOD CONCENTRATION AND ITS TREATMENT.

### Dehydration is how you define it: comparison of 318 blood and urine athlete spot checks [^5110d332]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Another commonly used definition to assess 'dehydration' is USG, which takes into account both urine solute mass as well as concentration. Using the threshold of any USG value ≥ 1.020 to define dehydration,27% of our athletes were classified as 'dehydrated' at the time of measurement (table 4). This incidence is much lower than previous rates demonstrated in other athletic cohorts such as 90% of 107 male adolescent soccer players measured before practiceand 66% of 263 (138 male, 125 female) NCAA D1 athletes who provided random urine samples. Similar to the UOsm findings, there were no mathematical or clinically relevant differences in either serum markers ([Na +], [K +] and osmolality) or thirst rating, since blood tonicity is a physiologically regulated variable.

The previous literature has been consistent with our blood versus urine findings, demonstrating significant relationships between urine markers (such as USG vs UOsm)but not between urine versus blood markers of hydration status ([Na +] and osmolality). The confounding effects of diet, the timing of fluid intake and the renal response to exercise likely contribute to the poor prognostic utility of using urine indices as surrogate markers for water and sodium homeostasis (plasma tonicity or volume status). In contrast to osmoregulatory thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulation, urine concentration is not a regulated physiological variable associated with fluid homeostasis. Urine volume and solute concentration are renal effector responses that are largely subservient to circulating plasma AVP levels. Copious urinary free water excretion is reflective of either: (1) AVP suppression, which largely occurs when fluid intake is in excess of osmoregulatory need, or (2) AVP antagonism at the V2 receptor, triggering dilute urine with cellular dehydration. Clinically speaking, AVP suppression and antagonism characterise central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, both of which are successfully compensated by osmotically driven thirst stimulation to maintain tonicity balance.

### Estimated childhood lead exposure from drinking water in Chicago [^8b691fcf]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Disparities in Screening Rates and Lead Exposure

Racial disparities in screening rates and lead exposure were present. Ten-percentage-point increases in block-level Black and Hispanic populations were associated with 3% (95% CI, 2%-3%) and 6% (95% CI, 5%-7%) decreases in screening odds, respectively; a 10% increase in White population was associated with a 24% (95% CI, 23%-25%) increase in screening odds. Concurrently, 10-percentage-point increases in Black and Hispanic populations were associated with 4% (95% CI, 3%-6%) and 11% (95% CI, 10%-13%) increases in lead exposure, respectively; a 10-percentage-point increase in block-level White population was associated with a 5% (95% CI, 4%-6%) decrease (Table 3; eFigure 4 and eTable 5 in Supplement 1). Black and Hispanic survey respondents reported the lowest rates of unfiltered tap water use (weighted percentages, 14% and 12%, respectively), and White respondents reported the highest (weighted percentage, 32%) (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

CDC Yellow Book 2026 — dehydration and sweat losses in heat-related illness: Apart from environmental conditions and intensity of exercise, dehydration is the most important predisposing factor in heat-related illness. Dehydration reduces exercise performance, decreases time to exhaustion, and increases internal heat load, and temperature and heart rate increase in direct proportion to the level of dehydration. Sweat is a fluid containing sodium and chloride; although it is hypotonic (contains lower concentration of sodium than blood), sweat rates may reach 1 liter per hour, resulting in substantial fluid and sodium loss.

### Drugs for preventing red blood cell dehydration in people with sickle cell disease [^5bc18bfd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder of hemoglobin, resulting in abnormal red blood cells. These are rigid and may block blood vessels leading to acute painful crises and other complications. Recent research has focused on therapies to rehydrate the sickled cells by reducing the loss of water and ions from them. Little is known about the effectiveness and safety of such drugs. This is an updated version of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the relative risks and benefits of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register. We also searched online trials registries for any ongoing trials (01 July 2018). Last search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 08 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of drugs to rehydrate sickled red blood cells compared to placebo or an alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Of the 51 studies identified, three met the inclusion criteria, including 524 people with sickle cell disease aged between 12 and 65 years of age. One study tested the effectiveness of zinc sulphate as compared to placebo and the remaining two assessed senicapoc versus placebo. No deaths were seen in any of the studies (low-quality evidence). The zinc sulphate study showed a significant reduction in painful crises (in a total of 145 participants) over one and a half years, mean difference -2.83 (95% confidence interval -3.51 to -2.15) (moderate-quality evidence). However, analysis was restricted due to limited statistical data. Changes to red blood cell parameters and blood counts were inconsistent (very low-quality evidence). No serious adverse events were noted in the study. The Phase II dose-finding study of senicapoc (a Gardos channel blocker) compared to placebo showed that the high dose senicapoc showed significant improvement in change in hemoglobin level, the number and proportion of dense red blood cells, red blood cell count and indices and hematocrit value (very low-quality evidence). The results with low-dose senicapoc were similar to the high-dose senicapoc group but of lesser magnitude. There was no difference in the frequency of painful crises between the three groups (low-quality evidence). A subsequent Phase III study of senicapoc was terminated early since there was no difference observed between the treatment and control groups in the primary end point of painful crises.

Authors' Conclusions

While the results of zinc for reducing sickle-related crises are encouraging, larger and longer-term multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy for people with sickle cell disease. While the Phase II and the prematurely terminated phase III studies of senicapoc showed that the drug improved red blood cell survival (depending on dose), this did not lead to fewer painful crises. Given this is no longer an active area of research, this review will no longer be regularly updated.

### Effect of inflow of fresh blood on vascular-space-occupancy (VASO) contrast [^0b2f7b61]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In vascular-space-occupancy (VASO)-MRI, cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted contrast is generated by applying a nonselective inversion pulse followed by imaging when blood water magnetization is zero. An uncertainty in VASO relates to the completeness of blood water nulling. Specifically, radio frequency (RF) coils produce a finite inversion volume, rendering the possibility of fresh, non-nulled blood. Here, VASO-functional MRI (fMRI) was performed for varying inversion volume and TR using body coil RF transmission. For thin inversion volume thickness (delta(tot) < 10 mm), VASO signal changes were positive (DeltaS/S = 2.1–2.6%). Signal changes were negative and varied in magnitude for intermediate inversion volumes (delta(tot) = 100–300 mm), yet did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) for delta(tot) > 300 mm. These data suggest that blood water is in steady state for delta(tot) > 300 mm. In this appropriate range, long-TR VASO data converged to a less negative value (DeltaS/S = -1.4% ± 0.2%) than short-TR data (DeltaS/S = -2.2% ± 0.2%), implying that cerebral blood flow or transit-state effects may influence VASO contrast at short TR.

### Sodium chloride (Alfa 0.9% sodium chloride) [^231b7605]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered intravenously, the solution provides a source of water and electrolytes.

Solutions that provide combinations of hypotonic or isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements.

Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss. Hypotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suited for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when only small quantities of salt are desired. A hypertonic concentration of sodium chloride may be used to repair severe salt depletion syndrome.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl-) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney, which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments, and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Comparison of clinical and biochemical markers of dehydration with the clinical dehydration scale in children: a case comparison trial [^e1dc4480]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In total, six biochemical and two clinical parameters distinguished dehydrated patients from the comparison group. As expected, these included: diastolic blood pressure z-score, heart rate z-score, urine Na/K ratio, urine Na, FeNA, blood urea and serum bicarbonate and creatinine. It should be noted that the urea differences, albeit significant, were not clinically relevant. Unforeseen, however, were the categories that did not identify children with dehydration. These included percent dehydration and urine osmolality. Numerous studies have used percent dehydration as a gold standard to quantify the degree of dehydration in a child, Unfortunately, despite the assistance of trained and dedicated research nurses to perform and ensure adequate and consistent weight measurement prior to and following treatment, the difference in percent dehydration did not reach statistical significance. This further supports the subjectivity of this parameter despite employing specific training. Furthermore, other factors that contribute to weight gain or loss during an acute illness episode may have influenced these findings, including the amount of rehydration, decreased intake, ongoing oral/rectal and urinary losses, increased insensible losses and an increased catabolic rate. Additionally, intravascular volume may be the most important factor in complications associated with dehydration such as hypo-volemic shock or acute kidney injury. Severe dehydration requires prompt restoration of intravascular volume through intravenous administration of fluids followed by oral rehydration therapy. Body water movement from compartment to compartment during any time period can be attributed to forces active within and upon each space. These forces lead to water transfer between intravascular and extravascular compartments and shifts between extracellular and intracellular spaces, and may be independent of body weight.

### Exertional heat stroke: pathophysiology and risk factors [^8b50dc5e]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Risk factors

No sound evidence indicates which risk factors increase EHS predisposition, but several factors have been implicated. In figure 3, we highlight the risk factors discussed in this review.

Figure 3
Potential risk factors affecting exertional heat stroke. Arrow colours represent level of evidence for each risk factor: green = strong; yellow = moderate; red = anecdotal

Dehydration

No direct evidence indicates that dehydration has a causative role in EHS. But to hypothesise that it will be a risk factor is logical, given the known impact of dehydration on human physiology. Blood plasma consists of about 90% water. During exercise, because of increased metabolic demand and sweat production, plasma volume decreases, which increases plasma osmolality and blood viscosity, which are associated with increased reactive oxygen species production. The increased osmolality induces a pull of water from intracellular stores to extracellular stores to overcome the impact from exercise. The greater viscosity from decreased plasma volume causes cardiac drift, leading to greater cardiac strain. When decreases in plasma volume are drastic enough to decrease blood pressure, it can diminish cerebral blood flow and cause syncope. By exercising in the heat, sweat rates escalate to increase evaporative heat loss from the paired metabolic heat produced from exercise and the external environmental heat. The detriments of dehydration are exacerbated when individuals begin exercise in a hypohydrated state, which is frequent in athletes. In a crossover study of 17 male soldiers, Sawka et al compared heat strain between euhydrated and hypohydrated individuals with about 8% dehydration after walking for 180 minutes at 49°C and 20% humidity. The hypohydrated state was more responsible for heat intolerance than aerobic fitness. In the hypohydrated condition, the heart rate was higher, sweat rate was lower, and participants showed lower tolerance for temperature change (observed through exhaustion occurring at lower rectal temperature) even after heat acclimation. Therefore, dehydration could potentially enhance the risk of EHS via hyperthermia. While the role of dehydration in increased intestinal permeability has been hypothesised, more studies are needed to support this idea with EHS.

### Central regulation of drinking water in divergently selected high-water-efficient young broiler chickens: a minireview [^7972444b]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although it is not typically categorized as food, water is an essential nutrient and vital for various animal bodily functions, yet its role is often underestimated and underappreciated. Water constitutes one‐half to two‐thirds of the body mass (BM) of adult animals and more than 90% of BM of newborn animals. It is the major molecule in cells, accounting for 70% or more of total cell mass, with approximately 55%–75% in the intracellular compartment and the rest in the extracellular compartment and an intravascular/extravascular space ratio of 1:3. As a universal solvent, water is necessary for all cellular metabolic processes, including digestion, absorption, transport, lubrication, chemical reactions, thermoregulation, and waste elimination, to mention a few.

The animal body procures water from various sources, including drinking water, feedstuff moistures (a major source for marine animals), and metabolic water (the sole source for desert and hibernating animals). The first two sources are of major concern in the management of livestock, because the animal continuously loses water through saliva, urine, feces, milk, sweating, evaporation from the body surface and the respiratory tract, and continuously needs to replenish and restore water. Both water input and output are influenced by the physiological state (age, growth, ability to conserve water), health and the activity of the animal, respiratory rate, diet (energy level, fiber content, salt, etc.), stress levels, management conditions (drinker system, water quality, density, photoperiod, etc.), air temperature, and humidity.

### Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride irrigant (Ringer's irrigation) [^fec73dc1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^0fe6a0ff]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Physiological regulation of water homeostasis

Serum sodium levels are physiologically maintained within a narrow range, despite wide variations in water and salt intake. Serum osmolality is tightly regulated by the interaction between the secretion and action of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP), which is synthesised in neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland, and the sensation of thirst to promote water intake from the thirst centre in the hypothalamus. In a healthy adult, the average oral intake of approximately 1–3 L/day of water is required to maintain normal fluid balance and eunatraemia. Serum osmolality (ratio of solutes to water in the blood plasma) is the principal stimulus for AVP secretion. Osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus are the major contributors of water regulation, as they are exquisitely sensitive to changes in serum osmolality. Baroreceptors located in the carotid arteries and aortic arch can also affect AVP secretion in response to decreases in blood volume or arterial pressure. After secretion, AVP binds to the V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, stimulating an intracellular cascade that leads to migration of vesicle-bound aquaporin-2 to the luminal membrane of the collecting duct. This process renders the cells of the collecting duct permeable to water, allowing for passive water reabsorption from the kidney into the blood, such that decreased urine volume can occur, resulting in increased urine concentration. Simultaneously, the thirst centre in the lamina terminalis of the third ventricle is stimulated to promote water consumption. Thus, AVP-mediated restriction of water excretion combined with thirst-driven water intake leads to an increase in plasma water and normalisation of serum osmolality. Regulation of this homeostatic process is very intricate and efficient, resulting in serum osmolality that rarely strays by more than 2% when access to water is unrestricted. The mechanisms regulating sodium and water homeostasis are summarised in figure 1.

### Drinking water: the saltier the better? [^ff481db4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world. 1 Freshwater from rain, lakes, and rivers absorbs into the ground by a process referred to as infiltration. The geological formations through which the water infiltrates can have varying mineral content, thereby impacting the groundwater salinity. However, global climate change likely has impacts on mineral composition of groundwater. Particularly in coastal regions at risk of rising sea levels, more frequent cyclones, and reduced upstream river flow, 2 changes in drinking water salinity should be expected. The varying mineral content that contributes to water salinity may also impact health. It is generally well accepted that increased dietary sodium intake is associated with hypertension in the general population. 3 Higher drinking water salinity is also associated with elevated blood pressure. 4, 5 However, most published research has only measured sodium content as a proxy to water salinity, so it is unclear what effect the other minerals in groundwater may have on blood pressure.

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Nasser et al explore the association between drinking water salinity and hypertension in the Southwest coastal population of Bangladesh. 6 Using data from 2 cohorts (an observational study during pre‐monsoon and monsoon seasons [when water salinity is low], and a stepped‐wedge randomized trial during the dry season [when water salinity is high]), the investigators evaluated the association of 3 categories of drinking water salinity (fresh, mild, and moderate) with blood pressure in 1574 adults with a median age of 40 years. Using household drinking water samples, salinity was measured by electrical conductivity (EC), which considers all dissolved ions as conductors. 6 The major cations contributing to water EC are sodium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Contrary to their hypothesis, a negative association between salinity by EC and blood pressure was observed. Twenty‐four‐hour urinary excretion concentrations of contributing cations were also measured, to reflect intake of these minerals. As might be hypothesized, higher urinary sodium excretion was associated with slightly higher systolic blood pressure; however, higher urinary calcium and magnesium were associated with lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Also contradictory to their hypothesis, mild‐salinity water consumption was associated with lower risk of stage 1 and 2 hypertension as compared with the freshwater category. The authors concluded that this somewhat unexpected finding was because of protective effects of higher calcium and magnesium concentrations in mild‐ and moderate‐salinity water.

### Plasma and serum volume remain unchanged following a 12-h fast from food and drink despite changes in blood and urinary hydration markers [^5e88fe53]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydration status has been shown to affect exercise performance, cognitive performance, and laboratory test results. It is likely the effect of hydration on these factors is a result of changes in plasma volume (P V). The effect hydration status and exercise have on P V is well understood. However, less research has investigated how mild dehydration, in the absence of exercise affects both P V and serum volume (S V). Understanding the effects of hydration status on P V and S V may be important clinically, as the concentration of plasma and serum biomarkers are used to diagnose disease. Concentration of these biomarkers may vary based on hydration status, ultimately affecting diagnoses. For example, body mass index as an estimate of P V has been shown to effect biomarkers used to assess Alzheimer's disease. Hydration status may also affect the bioavailability of water-soluble drugs. Previous research has found changes in P V due to hydration status which is likely to affect S V, as serum is simply plasma without clotting factors. Yet, we were unable to find research specifically assessing the effect of hydration status on S V.

While many studies use body weight as a means of assessing hydration status, dehydration may occur with no significant changes in body weight. Additionally, it may be difficult to determine changes in body weight as a result of hydration status in the clinic, where patients are wearing different clothing from previous visits or may have experienced weight losses or gains due to changes in lean and fat mass. Therefore, urinary or blood measurements may be better alternatives for assessing hydration status clinically.

This study was conducted for two primary purposes: 1. To determine if dehydration causes P V or S V changes at rest; and 2. To determine which urinary and blood markers of hydration are able to detect dehydration in subjects adhering to protocols causing modest changes in hydration status.

### Markers of hydration status [^4151a784]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Many indices have been investigated to establish their potential as markers of hydration status. Body mass changes, blood indices, urine indices and bioelectrical impedance analysis have been the most widely investigated. The current evidence and opinion tend to favour urine indices, and in particular urine osmolality, as the most promising marker available.

### Characterization of the diffusion coefficient of blood [^809a9b6d]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Measured ADCs are plotted against diffusion time T in Figure 2 for blood samples (Figs. 2 a and 2 b). Data from simultaneously acquired water reference tubes are provided as. Monopolar ADCs are displayed on the left (Fig. 2 a), whereas FC ADCs are displayed on the right (Fig. 2 b). Different markers and colors are used to distinguish blood samples (HCT is displayed in the legend), where unfilled markers depict samples from female volunteers. Errors for individual ADC measurements based on the analysis of 95% confidence intervals were in the range of ± (0.03–0.07) µm 2 /ms for MP gradients and in the range of ± (0.06–0.11) µm 2 /ms for FC measurements, in which samples with faster T 2 relaxation exhibit lower SNR, resulting in higher variance.

Figure 2
No characteristic dependence of measured ADC on diffusion time T is visible in the blood samples. Blood ADCs are larger for FC gradients (b) than for MP gradients (a). Samples with lower HCT exhibit a tendency toward higher ADC. The ADCs concurrently measured in water samples are provided as.

Although ADCs measured in the water reference agree within error margins across all measurements and are in accordance with literature 31, blood ADCs from different samples differ strongly for both MP and FC diffusion gradients. Because the uncertainty in temperature adjustment is only of the order of 1°C, ADC differences between blood samples must be attributed to different blood composition. Flow‐compensated diffusion weighting yields higher ADC values compared with MP gradients for blood (P < 10 ‐14), whereas ADCs measured in the water reference are independent of the gradient profile (P = 0.083). Considering all measurements, no characteristic dependence of the ADC on T is apparent.

### Sodium chloride [^f79de7af]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered intravenously, this solution provides a source of water and electrolytes.

Solutions which provide combinations of hypotonic or isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements.

Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principle cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl-) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### A simplified empirical model to estimate oxygen relaxivity at different magnetic fields [^fd77c3c3]. NMR in Biomedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, for the fitting of this model, we have combined values from water, saline, plasma, and vitreous fluids. In reality, there are factors that would cause the relaxivity in these solutions to differ, even amongst saline solutions with different compositions and concentrations. The decision to combine them was due to a lack of sufficient data points at a range of field strengths and temperatures in each solution; however, this is a considerable limitation, as it seems to fit more accurately to the water samples (R 2 = 0.94) than saline samples (R 2 = 0.73) alone (Supplementary Figure S3). Most importantly, values from the vitreous fluid and plasma would ideally be fit with separate models, as there are extra proteins in the plasma and vitreous fluid that have been shown to decrease the relaxivity slightly. However, this simply was not possible due to a lack of available data points in the literature. As above, we very much hope that this issue will be addressed as new data are acquired by future researchers.

Finally, this model does not represent the r 1Ox in blood and tissues, where the addition of proteins, lipids, and deoxyhemoglobin will affect the R 1 ‐pO 2 relationship; however, we have created a separate general model to calculate the R 1 of blood, accounting for hematocrit, oxygen saturation, oxygen partial pressure, and magnetic field strength under hyperoxic conditions. For convenience, however, we have listed the reported literature values found in tissue and blood in Supplementary Table S4 — nine values from blood and three from tissues. For the purpose of this model, only the 28 r 1Ox values in water, saline, vitreous fluid, and plasma were used.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^f116eea0]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Lead paint hazards by housing age and regulatory context — hazard prevalence rises in older homes and current standards are insufficient. "Age of the housing is a major determinant of lead paint hazards". "For housing built from 1978 to 1998, 2.7% contained one or more lead paint hazards, whereas the prevalence of residential hazards increased to 11.4% of housing built from 1960 to 1977, 39% of housing built from 1940 to 1959, and 67% of housing units built before 1940". Although "Federal agencies have set environmental lead standards to protect children from having a blood lead concentration ≥ 10 μg/dL (≥ 100 ppb)", the report states "it is now recognized that there is no safe level of lead exposure" and "because the current standards for lead in house dust, water, and soil remain too high to protect children,31,38 the percentage of housing that contains one or more lead paint hazards described above is an underestimate".

### Quantification of myocardial blood flow with 82Rb positron emission tomography: clinical validation with 15O-water [^f49828e3]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

82 Rb-derived MBF quantification has not yet been compared directly with the gold standard for measuring MBF in humans, 15 O-water, a radiotracer 100% of which can be extracted from the circulation, even at very high flow rates. Therefore, validation of 82 Rb-derived MBF against MBF measured using 15 O-water is an important step, as quantification using 82 Rb is ready to enter daily clinical practice. Whether MBF quantification with 82 Rb is accurate enough even at high flow rates as compared to quantification with 15 O-water has not been determined in humans in a clinical setting with modern PET/CT. To this aim, we wanted to derive an appropriate 82 Rb extraction function as compared to the 100%-extractible 15 O-water and determine whether a one-tissue compartment model could provide adequate MBF quantification in a group of healthy control subjects and patients with mild, stable CAD.

### Measuring water distribution in the heart: preventing edema reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury [^c3aa8c53]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Measurement of Total Water Content

Once the hearts were removed from the perfusion system or, in the case of in situ experiments, washed in cold physiologic serum to remove excess blood, the surrounding excess water was carefully removed with the aid of a nylon membrane. Hearts were cut in 3 parts excluding the valve plane (apex and 2 symmetric sections of the basal portion, both containing similar amounts of right and left ventricle mass). Each portion was weighed and then freeze‐dried overnight. After freeze‐drying, samples were weighed again in order to obtain the dry mass. The difference between the fresh and the dry mass provided total water content (TWC) of each sample. Freeze‐dried samples were stored at −20°C until Gd extraction.

### The half-life of infusion fluids: an educational review [^d00d0ddb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Measuring half-life

Although urine elimination half-life is simple, it is not a very precise measure because it typically provides just one point of measurement. The time to first void is even worse, as the bladder size differs between individuals, making it no more than a rough estimate. The information it provides is largely to do with elimination, which is important in relation to overload, rather than distribution, which is related to circulating volume. However, if the urinary excretion is related to haemodilution over time, the measure is much improved.

A variety of techniques have been used to measure plasma volume. Typically, a radioactive tracer would be injected and its dilution measured. Such a technique is unsuitable for following the kinetics of an infused fluid because it requires a volumetric steady state, which is not a feature of a dynamic physiology (Fig. 2). For example, a labelled protein such as albumin would require a steady state for 30 to 40 min, making capture of the distribution process impossible. Although such tracers distribute too slowly to make an assessment of the kinetics of a crystalloid fluid a feasible proposition, they are probably useful for colloids. As with urine volume, there is one point of measurement but based on two analyses – one before the injection and one following dilution in the plasma.

Measurement of haemodilution, provided by the blood haemoglobin concentration, overcomes these problems, permitting multiple sampling, generally providing one measurement every 5 min for as long as sampling is possible and there is still some infused fluid left in the body. A favoured technique is to take triplicate samples at baseline and then measure haemoglobin concentration once every 5 to 10 min for 3 to 4 h. This provides a very detailed picture of the haemodilution process, allowing distribution to be mathematically separated from elimination. The additional measurement of urinary excretion makes it even more precise.

An alternative to measuring haemoglobin concentration is desiccation. A tube is filled with about 1 mL of blood and it is weighed precisely to several decimal places before being placed in an open heater at 100°C overnight. The following day the tube is weighed again when all water has evaporated and the water content of the original sample can then be calculated. Similar results are obtained from data using haemoglobin concentration or water because they move in a reciprocal fashion. Measuring haemoglobin is the simpler and cheaper marker to measure, while desiccation is labour intensive and requires several measurements before the water concentration can be inferred.

### Evaluation and review of body fluids saliva, sweat and tear compared to biochemical hydration assessment markers within blood and urine [^9e8f4beb]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Blood plasma osmolality (BP osm — concentration of plasma, milliosmoles of solute particles per kilogram of water), plasma sodium concentration BP[Na +] or blood serum osmolality (BS osm) are regularly used blood markers for evaluating hydration status. In this regard, when body fluids are steady and balanced, BP osm combined with the TBW (fluid in intracellular and extracellular areas; approximately 0.6 l/kg≈63.3% of body mass) value describe the most accurate and exact hydration assessment values. But these hydration assessment techniques, such as stable isotope dilution and neutron activation analysis for TBW and BP osm, are time-consuming, expensive and invasive. Fluid concentrations are regulated in complex and dynamic processes. The intracellular fluid is measured indirectly by means of the assumption that the isotope distributes equally throughout intracellular fluid and ECFand that the hydration status is changed by volume and timing of water, sodium and osmolyte consumption.

As blood sampling is often difficult to execute in the field, evaluating hydration status in these settings include determination of urine osmolality (UR osm), urine-specific gravity (UR sg) and urine colour (UR col). UR sg seems to be the most valid marker in the setting of dynamic (monitoring over time) dehydration assessment among these urinary markers.

To be of practical use, measuring and evaluating hydration status should have the possibility to be used on a daily or even hourly basis. The ability to monitor hydration status has become increasingly studied within the rehabilitation, sport, military and performance-related activities. Besides BMc, BP osm and UR sg seem to be the most effective markers to monitor hydration status among the aforementioned markers.

There might be other potential biochemical markers present within saliva, sweat and tears being noninvasive 'freely accessible' body fluids. These markers can offer further in-depth knowledge of an individual's hydration status. On this basis, the interest of this review is to evaluate 'freely accessible' body fluids (saliva, sweat and tear) as hydration assessment markers compared to the aforementioned body fluids (blood: BP osm, BP[Na +], BS osm; urine: UR osm, UR sg, UR col) during a well-described (de)hydration procedure influenced by fluid restriction and/or physical activity.

### Composition of the blood-SEER training modules… [^e5bda63b]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Composition of the Blood When a sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge, the cells and cell fragments are separated from the liquid intercellular matrix. Because the formed elements are heavier than the liquid matrix, they are packed in the bottom of the tube by the centrifugal force. The light yellow colored liquid on the top is the plasma, which accounts for about 55 percent of the blood volume and red blood cells is called the hematocrit, or packed cell volume. The white blood cells and platelets form a thin white layer, called the "buffy coat", between plasma and red blood cells. Plasma The watery fluid portion of blood in which the corpuscular elements are suspended. It transports nutrients as well as wastes throughout the body. Various compounds, including proteins, electrolytes, carbohydrates, minerals, and fats, are dissolved in it. Formed Elements The formed elements are cells and cell fragments suspended in the plasma.

The three classes of formed elements are the erythrocytes, leukocytes, and the thrombocytes. Erythrocytes Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are the most numerous of the formed elements. Erythrocytes are tiny biconcave disks, thin in the middle and thicker around the periphery. The shape provides a combination of flexibility for moving through tiny capillaries with a maximum surface area for the diffusion of gases. The primary function of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide. There are two main groups of leukocytes in the blood. The cells that develop granules in the cytoplasm are called granulocytes and those that do not have granules are called agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes. Monocytes and lymphocytes are agranulocytes. Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes, are phagocytic and have light-colored granules.

Eosinophils have granules and help counteract the effects of histamine. Basophils secrete histomine and heparin and have blue granules. In the tissues, they are called mast cells. Lymphocytes are agranulocytes that have a special role in immune processes. Some attack bacteria directly; others produce antibodies.

### Sodium as an important regulator of immunometabolism [^cef8fcb1]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

WHITHER SODIUM?

Earlier, all was clear. The intracellular composition (muscle for instance) exhibited a sodium concentration of ± 10 mmol/L, potassium concentration of ± 160 mmol/L, magnesium concentration of ± 35 mmol/L, etc. Anions were protein and phosphate. In the extracellular plasma water, the corresponding concentrations were sodium, ± 151 mmol/L and potassium, ± 4.3 mmol/L. In humans, the electrolytes were distributed within the (about 40 L) total body water; two-thirds were inside cells and one-third outside cells. Sodium was mostly exchangeable and extracellular although some was deposited in bone, the fate of which was largely unclear but not so exchangeable. By the 1970s, the regulation of these constituents had been well worked out and balance concepts were sufficiently accepted to support pressure natriuresis of blood pressure regulation and our understanding of salt and water balance. These ideas, and the supportive body of evidence, served us clinically well and were convincing. A veritable clinical tool was the knowledge generated by Edelman et aland Birkenfeld et al. They studied the relationship between plasma sodium, exchangeable sodium, exchangeable potassium, and total body water. Their insights showed us that by calculating effective free water clearance, we clinicians could always predict whose plasma sodium was going up or down and even at what rate the changes would occur. As a result, we had a fairly clear understanding of total body water, electrolyte contents, plasma concentrations, and subsequent speculations on blood pressure regulation. Osmotic forces, being what they are, would dictate that gain of exchangeable components would increase water and vice versa. That these ideas (a standard model if you will) could have immunologic implications never occurred to us, and we did not need anything else.

### Best practices for the design, laboratory analysis, and reporting of trials involving fatty acids [^850d580c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Blood sample collection conditions

Biochemistry parameters are generally derived from measurements of serum or plasma. Blood collection parameters, such as participant posture, season of blood collection, and the duration of the tourniquet application, can cause shifts in cholesterol and TG pools. Plasma samples have several advantages over serum samples, including obtaining the samples faster since there is no waiting for the blood to clot, and shorter centrifugation time since the centrifugation speed can be higher for plasma samples compared with serum samples. Plasma samples have been shown to have slightly lower concentrations of cholesterol than serum because of an osmotic effect of the anticoagulants extracting water from cellular contents. However, the fatty acid composition of serum and plasma has been shown to be remarkably similar when expressed as relative percentages of total fatty acids. The most popular vessels for collecting plasma are tubes loaded with EDTA, heparin, and citrate, and for collecting serum the most popular tubes are those coated with silica. Between blood sample collection and centrifugation, blood samples to be used for separating plasma from red cells should be kept on ice to avoid fatty acid hydrolysis from glycerolipids, a process that can result in artifactual change in the concentrations of NEFAs, and possibly PLs and TGs, in the plasma.

Sample storage

Appropriate storage of plasma or blood samples collected during an RCT, a cross-sectional study, or a prospective study is critical to preserve sample quality and to ensure an accurate measure of the fatty acid profile. Inappropriate storage conditions can lead to peroxidation of the fatty acids and the hydrolysis of fatty acids from PLs. In general, the presence of RBCs in a sample can increase the risk of oxidation. The stability of blood fatty acids during storage and possible mechanisms of fatty acid degradation have been reviewed recently. In general, PUFAs are susceptible to peroxidation because of the attack of free radicals. Free radical generation is increased with exposure to oxygen and the presence of iron (hemoglobin complex) in the samples. Peroxidation can be prevented or reduced through the addition of antioxidants or chelating and/or cryopreserving agents, as well as the presence of other oxidizable compounds in the sample that may act as alternative targets, such as vitamin E and various proteins.

### Randomised clinical study comparing the effectiveness and physiological effects of hypertonic and isotonic polyethylene glycol solutions for bowel cleansing [^03ad3b81]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

The percentage changes (in absolute values) of blood urea nitrogen from baseline to the end of dosing in the PEG-ES group were significantly greater than that in the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups, and the difference between the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups was not significant. The cleansing almost completely evacuates stools from the bowel, which results in a decrease in blood urea nitrogen, possibly with the same degree of decrease in all three groups. Dehydration during the cleansing would increase blood urea nitrogen, with larger increases in the PEG-Asc-S and PEG-Asc-M groups compared with the PEG-ES group. These defecation and dehydration effects may explain the trend of the percentage changes in blood urea nitrogen at the end of dosing in the three groups.

In conclusion, the use of lower volume 1.5 L PEG-Asc with one-spilt and four-split dosing and 2.25 L PEG-ES with no-split dosing resulted in very high success rates in bowel cleansing with no serious adverse effects. The new regimen of 1.5 L PEG-Asc with four-split dosing significantly shortened bowel cleansing time compared with one-split dosing. The Ht, red blood cell and haemoglobin values are sensitive dehydration indicators. The physiological dehydration associated with PEG-Asc was significantly greater than that with PEG-ES at the end of dosing and even patients cleansed with isotonic PEG-ES showed significant physiological dehydration at the end of dosing. Patients treated with PEG-Asc are suggested to intake additional water after colonoscopy.

### Sodium and water disorders [^6e9798b2]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The balancing of fluids and electrolytes is a core function of the kidneys. There are redundant mechanisms within the body to sense the adequacy of organ perfusion and the composition of body fluids aimed at maintaining hemodynamics and protecting an environment for optimal cellular function. Sodium and water are key components of extracellular fluid and are regulated in response to end-organ perfusion and serum tonicity. Baroreceptors activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide to adjust sodium handling to alter extracellular volume. Osmoreceptors affect anti-diuretic hormone release and aquaporin activity in the medullary collecting duct to modify the handling of water. Disordered handling of sodium and/or water may be adaptive or maladaptive, and understanding the stimuli and responses to clinical scenarios assists clinicians in developing appropriate treatment strategies.

### VinCRIStine sulfate injection, USP… [^56f0214f]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

The molecular formula for Vincristine Sulfate, USP is C46H56N4O10∙H2SO4. It has a molecular weight of 923.
04. The structural formula is as follows: Vincristine Sulfate, USP is a white to off–white powder. It is soluble in methanol, freely soluble in water, but only slightly soluble in 95% ethanol. In 98% ethanol, Vincristine Sulfate, USP has an ultraviolet spectrum with maxima at 221 nm. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with cancer have shown a triphasic serum decay pattern following rapid intravenous injection. The initial, middle and terminal half–lives are 5 minutes, 2. 3 hours, and 85 hours respectively; however, the range of the terminal half–life in humans is from 19 to 155 hours. About 80% of an injected dose of vincristine sulfate appears in the feces and 10% to 20% can be found in the urine. Within 15 to 30 minutes after injection, over 90% of the drug is distributed from the blood into tissue, where it remains tightly, but not irreversibly, bound.

See PRECAUTIONS section. Acute respiratory distress syndrome has been reported. Rare occurrences of a syndrome attributable to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion have been observed in patients treated with vincristine sulfate. This syndrome is characterized by high urinary sodium excretion in the presence of hyponatremia; renal or adrenal disease, hypotension, dehydration, azotemia, and clinical edema are absent. With fluid deprivation, improvement occurs in the hyponatremia and in the renal loss of sodium. The concentration of Vincristine Sulfate Injection, USP is 1 mg/mL. Do not add extra fluid to the vial prior to removal of the dose. Withdraw the solution of Vincristine Sulfate Injection, USP into an accurate dry syringe, measuring the dose carefully. Do not add extra fluid to the vial in an attempt to empty it completely. Vincristine Sulfate Injection, USP when diluted with 0. 9% Sodium Chloride Injection in concentrations from
0. 0015 mg/mL to 0.

08 mg/mL is stable for up to 24 hours when protected from light or 8 hours under normal light at 25°C.

Dietary water restriction counseling — Attempts at water restriction commonly are futile if sodium limitation is not observed simultaneously, and reducing a patient's water intake alone is not prudent most of the time because excessive sodium ingestion increases ECF osmolality and stimulates thirst; advising water limitation without curtailing sodium intake will cause suffering from unnecessary thirst.

### Topiramate is more effective than acetazolamide at lowering intracranial pressure [^dfa64b12]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral dosing and effect on ICP

Oral administration of topiramate lowered ICP, reaching a maximum after 1 hour (1.0 ± 0.4 mmHg reduction in ICP) and returning to baseline at 11 hours (0.1 ± 0.3 mmHg reduction in ICP) (Figure 2(a)). Over the first two hours, topiramate significantly reduced ICP to 77.8 ± 6.0% of baseline AUC (22% reduction, p < 0.05), compared to placebo. Acetazolamide did not significantly lower ICP over this period (95.0 ± 3.5% of baseline AUC, 5% reduction) (Figure 2(a) –(c), and Table 2).

Figure 2.
Effect of oral dosing of acetazolamide or topiramate on ICP, CSF pH, blood pH and water intake.

Oral dosing and effect on blood pH, water intake and CSF pH

Acetazolamide significantly lowered blood pH (7.08 ± 0.04 pH, p < 0.01), and led to increased water intake (19.0 ± 3.7 g, p < 0.05), but had no effect on CSF pH (7.40 ± 0.04 pH) compared to placebo (7.36 ± 0.02 pH, 4.2 ± 1.7 g, 7.33 ± 0.08 pH respectively). Topiramate had no significant effect on blood pH (7.25 ± 0.03 pH), water intake (6.6 ± 2.1 g) or CSF pH (7.45 ± 0.08 pH) (Figure 2(d) –(f)).

### The effects of 6 months of increased water intake on blood sodium, glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, and quality of life in elderly (aged 55–75) men [^534606d4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study whether there are any negative or positive effects of 6 months of increased fluid intake in reasonably healthy elderly men.

Design

Randomized trial.

Setting

Community-based.

Participants

One hundred forty-one healthy participants aged 55 to 75.

Intervention

One group was given the advice to increase their daily fluid intake by 1.5 L of water; the other group was given placebo medication (8 mL inactive syrup per day).

Measurements

At 6 months blood sodium, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure, and quality of life (QOL) were measured. The changes in water turnover were measured using deuterium.

Results

Most subjects did not manage to increase their fluid intake by 1.5 L. The average increase in the intervention group was approximately 1 L. Twenty-four-hour water turnover in the water group was 359 mL (95% confidence interval = 171–548) higher than that of the control group at 6-month follow-up. Blood pressure, sodium level, GFR, and QOL did not change significantly in either group during the intervention period. In addition, the cases reporting a worsening on the effect measures were equally distributed over the two study groups.

Conclusion

The advice to increase fluid intake by 1.5 L had no negative effects in reasonably healthy men aged 55 to 75.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^b3dcf576]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Classification of hyponatremia according to tonicity. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the most common cause of hypotonic hyponatremia. Adapted from Sahay 2014 with permission, with reference to Spasovski 2014.

Pseudohyponatremia can occur in the presence of excess of lipids or proteins in the serum. This may be endogenous (eg, hypertriglyceridemia, monoclonal gammopathy) or exogenous (eg, following administration of IV immunoglobulin). Pseudohyponatremia is due to the electrolyte-exclusion effect, whereby an elevated proportion of blood volume is taken up by "solid" components (fats and protein) that typically constitute 7% of plasma volume, which reduces the relative fraction of plasma water. When plasma sodium concentration (pNa) is calculated using common indirect methods that involve dilution of the sample before measurement of sodium ions, an assumed fraction of plasma water is used in deriving the sodium concentration in the original undiluted sample. Where the true plasma water fraction is much lower, this assumption becomes incorrect, and the measured sodium ions are incorrectly assumed to be diluted over a larger plasma water volume than is really present. This pitfall can be avoided by direct measurement of an undiluted sample (eg, by using a blood gas analyzer).

In translocational hyponatremia, the presence of excess osmotically active solute in the plasma (most commonly glucose) draws water from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular fluid (ECF), reducing pNa, in the presence of normal or raised plasma osmolality. Exogenous agents other than glucose that can cause this effect include mannitol, glycine, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (used during cardiac surgery and organ transplantation), maltose, and hypertonic radiocontrast media. In contrast to pseudohyponatremia, translocational hyponatremia is not a laboratory artifact, and both direct and indirect sodium measurement is affected. Correction of serum sodium for increased glucose is discussed in "Confirming a Diagnosis of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis" (see Fig. 2).

### Hematocrit and oxygenation dependence of blood (1) H (2) O T (1) at 7 tesla [^6ae4e230]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Knowledge of blood (1)H2O T1 is critical for perfusion-based quantification experiments such as arterial spin labeling and cerebral blood volume-weighted MRI using vascular space occupancy. The dependence of blood (1)H2O T1 on hematocrit fraction (Hct) and oxygen saturation fraction (Y) was determined at 7 T using in vitro bovine blood in a circulating system under physiological conditions. Blood (1)H2O R1 values for different conditions could be readily fitted using a two-compartment (erythrocyte and plasma) model, which are described by a monoexponential longitudinal relaxation rate constant dependence. It was found that T1 = 2171 ± 39 ms for Y = 1 (arterial blood) and 2010 ± 41 ms for Y = 0.6 (venous blood), for a typical Hct of 0.42. The blood (1)H2O T1 values in the normal physiological range (Hct from 0.35 to 0.45, and Y from 0.6 to 1.0) were determined to range from 1900 to 2300 ms. The influence of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and the effect of plasma osmolality for different anticoagulants were also investigated. It is discussed why blood (1)H2O T1 values measured in vivo for human blood may be about 10–20% larger than found in vitro for bovine blood at the same field strength.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Composition of the blood… [^8d4fa19d]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Composition of the Blood When a sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge, the cells and cell fragments are separated from the liquid intercellular matrix. Because the formed elements are heavier than the liquid matrix, they are packed in the bottom of the tube by the centrifugal force. The light yellow colored liquid on the top is the plasma, which accounts for about 55 percent of the blood volume and red blood cells is called the hematocrit, or packed cell volume. The white blood cells and platelets form a thin white layer, called the "buffy coat", between plasma and red blood cells. Plasma The watery fluid portion of blood in which the corpuscular elements are suspended. It transports nutrients as well as wastes throughout the body. Various compounds, including proteins, electrolytes, carbohydrates, minerals, and fats, are dissolved in it. Formed Elements The formed elements are cells and cell fragments suspended in the plasma.

The three classes of formed elements are the erythrocytes, leukocytes, and the thrombocytes. Erythrocytes Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are the most numerous of the formed elements. Erythrocytes are tiny biconcave disks, thin in the middle and thicker around the periphery. The shape provides a combination of flexibility for moving through tiny capillaries with a maximum surface area for the diffusion of gases. The primary function of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide. There are two main groups of leukocytes in the blood. The cells that develop granules in the cytoplasm are called granulocytes and those that do not have granules are called agranulocytes. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes. Monocytes and lymphocytes are agranulocytes. Neutrophils, the most numerous leukocytes, are phagocytic and have light-colored granules.

Eosinophils have granules and help counteract the effects of histamine. Basophils secrete histomine and heparin and have blue granules. In the tissues, they are called mast cells. Lymphocytes are agranulocytes that have a special role in immune processes. Some attack bacteria directly; others produce antibodies.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^18f1beb2]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Table 8 — Approaches to reduce arginine vasopressin (AVP) activity in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) compares increased water intake with the V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan, noting administration as drinking water during waking hours versus a split-dose tablet (1 tablet upon waking and 1 tablet 8 h later), water intake as voluntary increase ≥ 2 l/d versus involuntary increase ≥ 3–7 l/d, and indications as all people with eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 versus selected high-risk groups due to cost and side effects. Efficacy entries show no effect on TKV or long-term eGFR decline for increased water intake, versus yes for tolvaptan including Yes (TEMPO 3:4) for TKV and Yes (~1 ml/min per 1.73 m2) for long-term eGFR decline. Adherence is ~50% over 3 yr for increased water intake versus real-world adherence declines over time and ~75% after 3 yr for tolvaptan. Monitoring and harms include environmental issues for water versus blood tests every 1–3 mo, hypernatremia, hyperuricemia, and risk of hepatotoxicity for tolvaptan.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^b46f9e5c]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sodium

Sodium (Na +) plays a crucial role as the primary extracellular cation, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, regulation of ion and water metabolism, and the control of blood pressure. Plasma sodium concentration is maintained within narrow limits despite variable dietary intake and physical activity. Sodium and water balance are tightly linked. Children have higher total body water content compared to adults. In premature newborns, water makes up to 80% of body weight. Total body weight (TBW) decreases to 70% in term newborns, however, once children reach the age of 1 they have 60% of TBW which is similar to adults. About two-thirds of TBW is in the intracellular compartment and the remaining one-third is extracellular fluid, which consists of interstitial, intravascular, and transcellular fluid (cerebrospinal, ocular, synovial, and peritoneal fluid). These various fluid compartments are depicted in Fig. 1.

Abnormalities of plasma sodium are one of the most common electrolyte disorders. Complex neurohumoral mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining sodium and water balance. Renin is released from juxtaglomerular cells in response to hypovolemia, sympathetic nerve activation, or decreased renal perfusion or delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule. Renin functions to enhance reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The synthesis of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is conducted within the hypothalamus. ADH is secreted from the neurohypophysis and plays a role in water regulation. ADH acts on V2 receptors in the distal nephron to facilitate water reabsorption. Increased effective plasma osmolality stimulates cerebral osmoreceptors, leading to ADH release and inducing thirst. Hypotension is associated with a significant reduction of effective intravascular volume and is a strong stimulus for ADH release that may even supersede osmotic stimuli. Additionally, hypotension decreases the baroreceptor firing rate leading to an increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) along with decreased production of natriuretic peptides. Collectively, these changes can enhance tubular sodium and water reabsorption. Additionally, fluid and water intake can impact sodium concentration, therefore managing fluid intake is important in maintaining sodium balance.

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^0670bea4]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Prevention of childhood lead toxicity — government recommendations emphasize resource expansion and regulatory revisions, stating that the federal government should expand the resources currently offered by the HUD and should provide both financial and nonfinancial resources and technical guidance through the CDC, the EPA, and the HUD. The US EPA and HUD should revise downward allowable levels of lead in house dust, soil, paint, and water to conform with the recognition that there are no safe levels of lead. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should expeditiously revise allowable laboratory error in blood lead proficiency testing programs from ± 4 μg/dL (± 40 ppb) to ± 2 μg/dL (± 20 ppb) for blood lead concentrations ≤ 20 μg/dL (≤ 200 ppb), with future reduction, when feasible, to ± 1 μg/dL (± 10 ppb) for blood lead concentrations ≤ 20 μg/dL (≤ 200 ppb). State and local governments should collect, analyze, and publish blood lead test results and should regularly publish reports of age of housing and other risk factors for children having blood lead concentrations ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb); federal, state, and local governments should provide resources for environmental evaluations and case management of children who have blood lead concentrations ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb); and state and local governments should take steps to ensure that water fountains in schools do not exceed water lead concentrations of 1 ppb.

### Effect of ultrafiltration during hemodialysis on hepatic and total-body water: an observational study [^0db90e9c]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

In health, in response to a reduction in circulating volume, there is immediate contraction of liver volume and expulsion of pooled blood. In this study, not only did we observe that liver water content reduced to a lesser extent than peripheral fluid, actually in many patients it increased. The changes in liver water content in our subjects were larger than expected by the confidence interval alone. Our observations suggest this physiological reaction does not occur in all patients undergoing HD. This response is not associated with comorbidities, drugs (such as antiplatelet, antihypertensive and erythropoietin agents) and blood hematocrit, although our study may be underpowered to really study this. This may be due to differing levels of circulatory stress endured, with some subjects not meeting the requirements for activation of hepatic venoconstriction. Another explanation is that some subjects exhibited an abnormal hepatic response to the circulatory stress of dialysis, with a diversion of blood flow into the hepatic circulation. This is supported by the observation that liver water concentration increased significantly more in patients who sustained a considerable fall in their blood pressure during HD. The negative impacts of ultrafiltration on myocardial perfusion have been well described. The presence of both cardiac and baseline autonomic dysfunction is also variable in HD patients and this may additionally explain the heterogeneity observed.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^4d746d42]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Glucose can be measured in whole blood, serum, or plasma, but plasma is recommended for diagnosis [note that although both the ADA and WHO recommend venous plasma, the WHO also accepts measurement of glucose in capillary blood]. The molality of glucose (i.e. the amount of glucose per unit water mass) in whole blood is identical to that in plasma. Although erythrocytes are essentially freely permeable to glucose (glucose is taken up by facilitated transport), the concentration of water (in kilograms per liter) in plasma is approximately 11% higher than in whole blood. Therefore, glucose concentrations are approximately 11% higher in plasma than in whole blood if the hematocrit is normal. Glucose concentrations in heparinized plasma were reported in 1974 to be 5% lower than in serum. The reasons for the difference are not apparent but have been attributed to the shift in fluid from erythrocytes to plasma caused by anticoagulants. In contrast, some more recent studies found that glucose concentrations are slightly higher in plasma than in serum. The observed differences were approximately 0.2 mmol/L (3.6 mg/dL), or approximately 2%, or 0.9%. Other studies have found that glucose values measured in serum and plasma are essentially the same. Given these findings, it is unlikely that values for plasma and serum glucose will be substantially different when glucose is assayed with current instruments, and any differences will be small compared with the day-to-day biological variation of glucose. Clinical organizations do not recommend the measurement of glucose in serum (rather than plasma) for the diagnosis of diabetes. Use of plasma allows samples to be centrifuged promptly to prevent glycolysis without waiting for the blood to clot. The glucose concentrations in capillary blood obtained during an OGTT are significantly higher than those in venous blood [mean, 1.7 mmol/L (30 mg/dL), which is equivalent to 20%–25% higher], probably owing to glucose consumption in the tissues. In contrast, the mean difference in fasting samples is only 0.1 mmol/L (2 mg/dL).

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^faf991e8]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies with ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% have been conducted.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Albumin is responsible for 75–80% of the colloid osmotic pressure of normal plasma. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins. [3]

Albumin is a protein with a total extravascular mass of approximately 160 g and an intravascular mass of about 120 g. [3]

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The colloid osmotic effect of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 20% and 25% is approximately 5 times the volume administered. When injected intravenously, it will increase circulating plasma volume by approximately 3.5 times the volume infused within 15 minutes if the patient is adequately hydrated. This extra fluid reduces hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. The degree and duration of volume expansion depends upon the initial blood volume. When treating patients with diminished blood volume, the effect of infused albumin may persist for many hours. The hemodilution lasts for a shorter time when albumin is administered to individuals with normal blood volume. [4]

### Prevention of childhood lead toxicity [^a4a7b5c6]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Prevention of childhood lead toxicity — evidence and policy emphasize that commonly encountered blood lead concentrations, even those below 5 μg/dL (50 ppb), impair cognition and there is no identified threshold or safe level of lead in blood. From 2007 to 2010, approximately 2.6% of preschool children in the United States had a blood lead concentration ≥ 5 μg/dL (≥ 50 ppb), which represents about 535 000 US children 1 to 5 years of age. Very high blood lead concentrations (eg, > 100 μg/dL) can cause significant overt symptoms, such as protracted vomiting and encephalopathy, and even death. Low-level lead exposure, even at blood lead concentrations below 5 μg/dL (50 ppb), is a causal risk factor for diminished intellectual and academic abilities, higher rates of neurobehavioral disorders such as hyperactivity and attention deficits, and lower birth weight in children. No effective treatments ameliorate the permanent developmental effects of lead toxicity, so primary prevention, reducing or eliminating the myriad sources of lead in the environment of children before exposure occurs, is the most reliable and cost-effective measure to protect children. Reducing sources of lead in the environment, including lead in housing, soil, water, and consumer products, has been shown to be cost-beneficial, and lead poisoning prevention education directed at hand-washing or dust control fails to reduce children's blood lead concentrations. Primary prevention should be the focus of policy on childhood lead toxicity.

### Water (sterile water) [^ac421f0a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Hypotonic and hemolytic. Do not inject until made approximately isotonic by addition of an appropriate solute, due to the possibility of hemolysis.

The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration.

WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

Individual factors — hydration and cooling strategies: The most readily modifiable physiologic risk factor is hydration status, with endurance athletes comfortably tolerating weight losses of 3–4% during events but fluid losses causing a 2–3% decrease in body weight correlating with greater core temperatures; dehydration increases physiologic strain, decreases sweat rates, increases perceived exertion, and increases core temperatures; maintaining euhydration is done via a "drink-to-thirst" approach or a scheduled regimen, but scheduled regimens risk accidental over or underconsumption; an increase in plasma osmolality by 2% triggers thirst and renal water retention, and thirst during activity indicates avid renal free water retention, a key step toward exercise-associated hyponatremia; adequate hydration cannot prevent heat accumulation in all circumstances; some hyperhydration methods decrease physiologic strain but have not reliably been proven protective from heat illness; precooling may help for short exertion in hot environments but is unlikely to benefit longer activity.
