## Question

How should a foreign body be removed from a child's ear?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to remove a foreign body from a child's ear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about triaging urgency and risk by object type and child factors. Then, I should verify the optimal examination setup and whether any imaging is warranted. Next, I will decide on the removal setting and level of anesthesia. After that, I need to select the safest instrument and technique tailored to the object. Finally, I should plan limits on attempts, when to refer, and how to handle aftercare and complications [^111Kfw2Z] [^1136yeor].

> Let me first confirm risk stratification because that drives everything. Button batteries or paired magnets in the ear are true emergencies due to rapid tissue injury and must prompt immediate ENT involvement with no irrigation, whereas sharp objects, deep impaction, and superabsorbent polymer (SAP) balls are high-risk and demand heightened caution and early referral; spherical, hard objects (beads, beans) are mechanically difficult and have higher failure with forceps, especially in uncooperative children who may require sedation rather than repeated awake attempts [^1136yeor] [^111Epync] [^111uNZVB].

> Wait, let me verify the child factors. Younger age alone did not increase failure or complications in a pediatric ED series, but cooperation is pivotal; multiple attempts and multiple instruments independently increased failure and complications, so I need to limit attempts and choose the best first technique under optimal conditions with a trained head-holder to stabilize the child's head [^111Epync] [^116xHqUG].

> I will now examine the ear under the best visualization I can secure, ideally an operating microscope or high-quality otoscope, and document exact location, canal trauma, and tympanic membrane (TM) integrity; experiences across large series show higher success under otomicroscopy and lower success with direct visualization for spherical objects or those abutting the TM, which should nudge me toward ENT referral if visualization is suboptimal or risk is high [^113jRvTQ] [^116xHqUG].

> Next, I should review whether imaging is actually needed. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: routine imaging is usually unnecessary for straightforward external canal foreign bodies, but if I suspect a retained or penetrating object, middle-ear extension, chronic polyp/granuloma concealing an FB, or iatrogenic impression material complications, then temporal bone CT can be decisive before attempting removal or planning surgery [^113fNL5p] [^114AWWmy] [^112DaswZ].

> Now I need to choose the setting and level of anesthesia. Procedural sedation (often ketamine) in the ED notably improves success and reduces repeated attempts in anxious or uncooperative children, while the OR under general anesthesia is appropriate for batteries, sharp or deep objects, failed office/ED attempts, and children with neurodevelopmental disorders who cannot cooperate; a strict "first attempt best attempt" mindset is crucial because success drops and complications rise with repeated manipulations [^117E3rtF] [^116xHqUG] [^111Epync].

> Let me think about the technique and the "one-instrument, one-attempt" rule. Data link multiple instruments and attempts to harm, so I should plan a single, deliberate attempt using the optimal tool based on object shape and surface: graspable soft/irregular items favor alligator forceps or suction, while smooth spheres are better addressed with a right-angle hook, loop, or suction rather than forceps that tend to push the object deeper; I should stop early if the plan is not working and escalate to sedation or ENT rather than improvising multiple tools [^111Epync] [^1158ffk6].

> But wait, what if the object is special-risk? For a live insect, I should first kill/immobilize it with mineral oil or viscous lidocaine and then remove it with suction or gentle instrumentation, because movement is painful and can drive it deeper; SAP balls must not be irrigated because they expand and fragment, so I should use blunt curettes or suction and refer early if they break; button batteries mandate urgent ENT extraction without irrigation given caustic injury risk; these nuances materially change the plan and should be recognized up front [^115KvA3H] [^111uNZVB] [^1136yeor] [^111Kfw2Z].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about irrigation in general? At first glance, simple ear syringing seems convenient and an in vitro model suggests low TM rupture pressures, but I need to ensure the TM is intact, avoid irrigation for batteries, SAPs, or suspected penetrating objects, and be wary in children with prior ear surgery or known perforation; guidelines on cerumen management also caution to withhold irrigation when perforation is suspected, so if I cannot confirm an intact TM or the object is high-risk, I should choose instrumentation or refer rather than irrigate [^112k4QBX] [^1138LKxF] [^1136yeor] [^111uNZVB].

> I should double-check the stopping rules and referral thresholds. If the first well-planned attempt fails, or if visualization is inadequate, or if I find myself reaching for a second instrument, I should stop and either add procedural sedation or refer to ENT; outcomes are best when ENT is involved early for difficult objects, and ENT success is highest when they see patients before repeated failed attempts elsewhere, so restraint is safety here [^111Epync] [^116Mnbq4] [^111Kfw2Z].

> After removal, I need to ensure complications are addressed and provide aftercare. If there is canal laceration or significant manipulation near a possibly nonintact TM, a non-ototoxic topical fluoroquinolone such as ofloxacin can be considered, keeping in mind age-related labeling and precise indications; instruct caregivers on dry ear precautions, analgesia, and return precautions for otorrhea, worsening pain, vertigo, or hearing changes, and consider aural toilet or follow-up if discharge persists or if underlying chronic disease is suspected [^115XPMFE] [^1155AYug] [^112foxMy].

> Hold on, I should verify longer-term risks if the presentation was delayed or atypical. Retained foreign bodies can induce granulomatous tissue or masquerade as polyps, warranting imaging and surgical exploration if conservative measures fail, and overly forceful attempts can rarely cause TM perforation or even ossicular trauma requiring tympanoplasty and ossicular reconstruction, which reinforces the principle of minimal, well-planned manipulation and timely referral [^113fNL5p] [^116m9QkP] [^113jRvTQ].

To remove a foreign body from a child's ear, first **assess the object** and the child's cooperation [^111Kfw2Z]. Use **alligator forceps or a right-angle hook** for graspable objects, and gentle irrigation for smooth, non-organic objects if the tympanic membrane is intact [^1136yeor] [^112k4QBX]. Immobilize the child, limit attempts to **one or two**, and refer to **ENT** if the object is a button battery, magnet, sharp, deeply impacted, or if the child is uncooperative [^111Epync] [^1136yeor]. Avoid irrigation for organic materials, batteries, or if tympanic membrane perforation is suspected [^1136yeor] [^111uNZVB]. After removal, inspect the ear for injury and provide follow-up care.

---

## Initial assessment and preparation

Obtain a **brief history** covering the object type, duration, and symptoms such as pain, hearing loss, discharge, or bleeding. Perform **otoscopy** to identify the object, determine its location, and assess the canal and tympanic membrane for injury [^111Kfw2Z]. Assess **cooperation**; sedation or general anesthesia may be required for uncooperative children or deeply impacted objects [^117E3rtF].

---

## Removal techniques

### Manual instrumentation

- **Alligator forceps**: Effective for graspable objects (e.g. paper, cotton, insects) [^113bwveH].

- **Right-angle hook**: Useful for smooth, round objects (e.g. beads, small toys) [^115iXUdv].

- **Suction catheter**: Effective for small, lightweight objects [^1136yeor].

---

### Irrigation

Irrigation is appropriate for **smooth, non-organic objects** such as beads or plastic when the tympanic membrane is intact [^112k4QBX], but it is contraindicated for organic materials (e.g. beans, seeds), batteries, or suspected tympanic membrane perforation [^1136yeor]. Use body-temperature saline and gentle pressure to minimize the risk of tympanic membrane injury.

---

### Adhesive methods

For adhesive techniques, apply **cyanoacrylate glue** to a cotton-tipped applicator, allow it to adhere to the object, then gently withdraw; this method is useful for smooth, round objects [^115iXUdv].

---

### Insect removal

For insect removal, **immobilize** the insect by instilling mineral oil or lidocaine before removal [^115KvA3H].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Button batteries**: Immediate ENT referral due to rapid tissue damage risk [^1136yeor].

- **Magnets**: ENT referral due to potential tissue necrosis from magnetic attraction [^111Kfw2Z].

- **Sharp or deeply impacted objects**: ENT referral to prevent canal or tympanic membrane injury [^113bwveH].

- **Uncooperative children**: ENT referral if sedation or general anesthesia is required [^117E3rtF].

- **Failed attempts**: ENT referral after unsuccessful initial attempts [^111Epync].

---

## Potential complications

- **Canal laceration**: Most common complication, especially in children under 10 years [^117Hnr3W].

- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: Risk increases with multiple attempts or improper technique [^113jRvTQ].

- **Infection**: Otitis externa or media may occur after removal [^112foxMy].

- **Hearing loss**: Rare but possible, especially with traumatic removal [^116m9QkP].

---

## Post-removal care

After removal, re-examine the ear canal and tympanic membrane for injury. Prescribe topical antibiotics if canal trauma or infection is present, and **arrange follow-up** to confirm healing and symptom resolution [^1136yeor].

---

## Prevention strategies

Educate **parents and caregivers** about risks and the need for supervision. Keep small objects, batteries, and magnets out of children's reach, and seek immediate medical evaluation if a foreign body is suspected [^115wtKU9].

---

Removing a foreign body from a child's ear requires careful assessment, appropriate technique, and consideration of the child's cooperation. Referral to **ENT** is essential for high-risk objects or uncooperative children to minimize complications [^116Mnbq4].

### Foreign bodies of the ear, nose, and throat [^111Kfw2Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat can often be managed in the emergency department, especially if the patient provides a history consistent with a foreign body and is calm and compliant during the examination and removal attempts. Success tips include providing analgesia, ensuring adequate visualization, immobilizing the patient's head, relying on the provider's dexterity and experience level, and minimizing removal attempts. It is critical to recognize the risks associated with certain retained objects, such as button batteries or sharp objects, and to know when to involve a consultant to facilitate the safe and successful removal of objects from the ear, nose, and throat.

### Foreign body removal from the external auditory canal in a pediatric emergency department [^111Epync]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to describe the experience with external auditory canal foreign body removal in a pediatric emergency department and to identify factors associated with procedural complications and/or failed removal.

- **Methods**: This study involved a retrospective case series of patients treated in the emergency department over a 5-year period. Primary outcomes included success and complication rates, while secondary outcomes measured removal rates in the otolaryngology clinic and operating room.

- **Results**: Physicians in our pediatric emergency department successfully removed 204 (80%) of 254 foreign bodies. Complications occurred in 30 cases (12%). Multiple attempts at removal were linked to failure (relative risk [RR], 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0–12.0) and complications (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5–6.3). The use of multiple instruments was also associated with failure (RR, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.7–10.8) and complications (RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.0–7.6). Of the 244 patients in whom emergency department attempts at removal were made, 26 were successfully removed in the otolaryngology clinic, and 14 were removed in the operating room. Foreign bodies present in the canal for more than 24 hours did not show a higher risk of failed removal or complications. Patients younger than 4 years were also not at increased risk of failed removal or complications.

In conclusion, physicians in a pediatric emergency department can successfully remove most foreign bodies from the external auditory canal with minimal complications and need for operative removal. These data suggest that referral to otolaryngology should be considered if more than one attempt is required.

### Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat [^1136yeor]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies in the ear, nose, and throat are common in young children but can also occur in other populations. Patients with foreign bodies in the ear, such as the external auditory canal, are usually asymptomatic but can present with otalgia, a sensation of fullness, hypoacusis, pruritus, and otorrhea, which is usually bleeding. Removal in the office may be attempted in cooperative or appropriately restrained patients using irrigation or instrumentation, depending on the type of object and degree of impaction.

Similarly, nasal foreign bodies can often be removed safely in the office with positive pressure techniques followed by instrumentation when the object is visible. A wide range of tools and methods have been described, yet evidence is lacking to recommend specific instruments or techniques. Referral is indicated for patients with external auditory canal or nasal foreign bodies that are more difficult or dangerous to remove, such as when the patient cannot be safely immobilized, the object is penetrating or a button battery, or removal attempts have failed.

Foreign bodies of the throat pose significant and immediate risks to the airway and require urgent emergency management. All patients with airway foreign bodies should be referred to the emergency department for sedation, direct visualization of the object via flexible or rigid endoscope, and removal.

### Interventions for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion [^115g7mra]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Ear discharge (otorrhoea) is common in children with grommets (ventilation/tympanostomy tubes); the proportion of children developing discharge ranges from 25% to 75%. The most common treatment strategies include oral broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotic eardrops, or those containing a combination of antibiotic(s) and a corticosteroid, and initial observation. Important drivers for one strategy over the other are concerns over the side effects of oral antibiotics and the potential ototoxicity of antibiotic eardrops.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of treatment strategies for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register, CENTRAL (2016, Issue 5), multiple databases, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date: 23 June 2016).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing at least two of the following: oral antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid), corticosteroid eardrops, microsuction cleaning of the ear canal, saline rinsing of the ear canal, placebo, or no treatment. The main comparison of interest was antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibiotics.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (less than two weeks) and adverse effects.

### Removing a misplaced retropubic midurethral sling from the urethra and bladder neck using ear, nose, and throat instruments [^115NK9oT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The retropubic tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedure is a common procedure with complications attributed to voiding dysfunction, bladder perforation, and bleeding. We present a case of successful removal of a retropubic midurethral sling from the urethra using a headlamp and a combination of ear, nose, and throat instruments.

- **Case**: A 63-year-old woman presented to our clinic with the symptom of gross hematuria after having undergone a TVT procedure. On office cystoscopy, the sling was noted to be placed within the urethral mucosa. Removal of the mesh was performed using a nasal speculum, left and right ethmoid scissors, left and right Blakesley graspers, and a headlamp to dissect the mesh directly out of the urethra.

- **Conclusion**: The utilization of ear, nose, and throat tools allowed us to resect the intraurethral mesh without necessitating incision of the urethral sphincter.

### An unusual method for the removal of a foreign body from a child's airway [^115Sxmpr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

This case involves a 6-year-old child with a laryngeal foreign body obstructing his airway. The object was large and dense, making traditional removal methods unsuccessful. By lifting the child upside down by his feet, practitioners were able to remove the heavy object using a laryngoscope and finger sweep. Foreign body removal can be challenging, and this method offers a simple solution a practitioner may use in difficult cases.

### Hearing aid silicone impression material as a foreign body in the middle ear [^114AWWmy]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2016). Low credibility.

We report an extremely rare case of hearing aid silicone impression material as a foreign body in the middle ear. The patient exhibited symptoms of otorrhea and vertigo following the taking of a mold impression in their only hearing ear, with symptoms mimicking chronic otitis media. A temporal bone CT scan revealed foreign body material in the middle ear and Eustachian tube. To remove the silicone impression material, an intact canal wall mastoidectomy with a facial recess approach and type IV tympanoplasty was performed. In addition to the case report, we review the literature regarding impression material foreign bodies.

### Intriguing aural foreign body and algorithm of management of foreign body [^117CG4bW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Foreign body (FB) in the external auditory canal is more common among the paediatric age group compared with adult patients and it may be deposited in various ways. An accidental animate aural FB is reported to be commonly encountered in adults whereas inanimate FBs are likely to be found among adult patients with learning disabilities. An elderly man presented with accidental penetration of a rattan tree stem into his ear while gardening. Removal of a FB from the external auditory canal requires expertise as deep penetration of a FB into the middle and inner ear may lead to grave complications, especially when overzealous removal is attempted by non-ear, nose, and throat (ENT) personnel. This case emphasises the importance of awareness of meticulous removal of a FB under proper visualisation to avoid unnecessary complications. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for proper removal of aural FB in an acute care setting.

### Has the cat got your tongue, or is something obstructing your throat? A review of imaging of ingested and aspirated foreign bodies in the paediatric population [^111MTL2H]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The specific procedure may vary, but most hospitals perform chest radiographs. In older children, frontal posteroanterior radiographs are used, while anteroposterior radiographs are preferred for younger children, taken during full inspiration and forced expiration. Some centers also include lateral decubitus views for children who do not comply with instructions (Fig. 1). The decubitus views are particularly useful if the child is uncooperative during radiographs in full inspiration and forced expiration.

As most foreign bodies are radiolucent, aspirated foreign bodies often manifest through indirect radiographic findings. Key findings to look for include hyperinflation or obstructive emphysema, mediastinal shift, pneumonia, atelectasis, and complete lung opacification. These radiographic findings depend on the size and location of the aspirated foreign body. The size determines the extent of its effect and the type of biomechanical impact it has on the lungs and airways (Fig. 2).

The most common variant of a foreign body is the "ball-valve mechanism". This mechanism allows air to pass by the foreign body during inspiration but traps it in the distal lung on expiration. This air trapping leads to hyperlucent lung parenchyma on a chest radiograph (Fig. 3). A mediastinal shift is a secondary indicator that occurs when the hyperinflated lung expands sufficiently to displace the mediastinum to the opposite side. Occasionally, a foreign body may occlude the entire bronchus, resulting in atelectasis.

### Modified Valente technique for cauliflower ear: Outcomes in children at two-year follow-up: New surgical technique for cauliflower ear [^116MEDKW]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

None of the children experienced complications or negative outcomes, supporting the safety and low morbidity of this approach. Specifically, there was no excess bleeding during the operation, nor was there a need to reopen the suture due to postoperative bleeding or hematoma. An accurate preparation of the operative site using 1:20000 adrenaline injected in the correct areas of the ear helps limit bleeding during surgery; injecting both the anterior and posterior ear — the areas requiring manipulation for surgery — not only avoids bleeding but also simplifies tissue dissection.

- **Distinctive aspects of the technique**: We dissected both the anterior and the posterior parts of the ear and removed malformed cartilage from the anterior portion, unlike the posterior excision described by Vogelin.

During this dissection, two different instruments were used; the posterior portion of the ear was dissected using a monopolar bistoury, and the anterior portion was dissected using forceps for blunt dissection. This approach limited bleeding in the posterior area of the ear and allowed adequate dissection of the cauliflower area. Once the anterior malformed portion of the ear was removed by scalpel, the remaining cartilage was thinned and softened with sharp excision and a diamond burr, followed by the use of resorbable mattress sutures. Fragilization of the cartilage is necessary to destroy its memory and reduce the risk of recurrence with resorbable sutures, in contrast to the more common use of non-resorbable sutures.

### Foreign body granuloma of the external auditory canal [^113fNL5p]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

External auditory canal polyps are most commonly inflammatory in nature but may also signify more severe disease. Prolonged conservative therapy can delay correct diagnosis and appropriate intervention. A case is presented of a child with chronic otorrhea treated for four months with topical drops and antibiotics. Upon referral, a large external auditory canal polyp was determined to be a foreign body granuloma covering a large electrical cap, with erosion approaching the facial nerve. External auditory canal polyps that do not respond promptly to conservative medical therapy warrant a computed tomography scan and surgical exploration with biopsy.

### Indications for and risks associated with implant removal after pediatric trauma [^116iVLdY]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The indications for implant removal after pediatric trauma can be relative or absolute. Each clinical scenario is unique, requiring assessment in the context of remaining growth, fracture healing, and the risks of removal. Typical indications that may warrant removal include implant migration, infection, exposed implants, symptomatic implants, notable remaining growth, concern for future complications, or elective removal at the patient's request.

### Bronchoscopy for removal of foreign body: What's the big deal [^111gut4G]. Pediatric pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies in the airway are common occurrences in the pediatric population and require careful management. Children needing anesthesia for the removal of airway foreign bodies can present numerous challenges. In this case, the patient required urgent removal of a foreign body while experiencing both upper and lower respiratory symptoms. These circumstances can lead to increased intraoperative and postoperative complications.

This presentation describes the clinical decision-making process involved, as well as the discussion of common modalities for diagnosis, treatment, and anesthetic management.

### Barotrauma: a complication of positive pressure for nasal foreign body removal in a pediatric patient [^114E5gYu]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians are frequently called upon to remove impacted nasal foreign bodies in children. Multiple positive pressure techniques for the removal of nasal foreign bodies have been described. This case report details a previously unreported complication of barotrauma after using a published positive pressure technique that utilizes unmodulated piped hospital oxygen (wall oxygen) in the emergency department setting. We caution against the use of sustained, unmodulated positive pressure to dislodge a retained nasal foreign body.

### Foreign body granuloma originating from the lateral process of malleus: A case series of 19 children [^113ye4i4]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). High credibility.

Granuloma formation can be induced by infectious agents, foreign bodies, and many inflammatory diseases with unknown etiologies. In the ear, a granuloma in the external auditory canal (EAC) commonly forms due to inflammation of the outer or middle ear, cholesteatoma, and foreign bodies. These granulomas may manifest as benign or malignant tumors. Once a granuloma is found in the EAC, timely imaging is necessary to define the location and extent of the lesion. If necessary, surgical removal with biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis and avoid further complications caused by EAC blockage. Identifying the origin of the granuloma can help otorhinolaryngologists clarify its etiology, implement precautions, and develop appropriate therapy plans.

In this study, we noticed a particular presentation of foreign body granuloma originating from the lateral process of the malleus (FBGLP) in children who lacked a visible foreign body in the EAC. The characteristics of 19 such patients were retrospectively analyzed. By comparing their clinical features and pathologic morphologic characteristics, the pathogenic causes were further evaluated to help explore the etiology, optimal treatment, and prognosis for FBGLP.

### Cortifoam [^114EBoqg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Directions for use**: Shake the foam container vigorously for 5–10 seconds before each use. Do not remove the container cap during product use. Hold the container upright on a level surface and gently place the tip of the applicator onto the nose of the container cap. The container must be held upright to obtain the proper flow of medication.

Pull the plunger past the fill line on the applicator barrel. To fill the applicator barrel, press down firmly on the cap flanges, hold for 1–2 seconds, and release. Pause for 5–10 seconds to allow the foam to expand in the applicator barrel. Repeat until the foam reaches the fill line. Remove the applicator from the container cap, allowing some foam to remain on the applicator tip. A burst of air may come out of the container with the first pump. Hold the applicator firmly by the barrel, ensuring that the thumb and middle finger are positioned securely underneath and resting against the barrel wings. Place your index finger over the plunger. Gently insert the tip into the anus. Once in place, push the plunger to expel the foam, then withdraw the applicator.

Caution: Do not insert any part of the aerosol container directly into the anus. Apply to the anus only with the enclosed applicator.

After each use, applicator parts should be pulled apart for thorough cleaning with warm water. The container cap and underlying tip should also be pulled apart and rinsed to help prevent the build-up of foam and possible blockage.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1165pq5f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both.

Changes from the prior guideline include the addition of a consumer to the development group, new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials), enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and expanded action statement profiles that explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion. Additionally, there is an enhanced external review process that includes public comment and journal peer review, as well as 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction focusing on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options for special populations or patients with modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, applicable in any setting where cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed.

### Indications for and risks associated with implant removal after pediatric trauma [^116MEWAo]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

In summary, there are many indications for implant removal in pediatric patients. When retention is an option, the decision to retain or remove the implant is often a shared decision between the patient and the surgeon. If patients request elective implant removal, the risks of removal must be discussed and understood. In addition, the cost of elective implant removal is not always covered by insurance, and the family should have an understanding of the cost before the surgery.

### Preference matters: New aspects on how foreign bodies should and could be removed from a child's airway [^113SZDrp]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Low credibility.

Foreign body aspiration in children is a potentially life-threatening event that can be diagnosed and treated by airway endoscopy. We aimed to analyze the influence of the examiner's experience and preference on the choice of the technique and the resulting complication rate.

- **Methods**: In this international study, experts in the field documented their preferred and applied technique as well as the outcome of each case of foreign body removal. Personal data of the bronchoscopists and their medical center were collected via an online questionnaire separately from the case specifics.

- **Results**: A total of 399 foreign body removals were performed by 64 examiners. A total of 279 removals were performed using rigid endoscopy, and 120 procedures were performed with flexible endoscopy. When difficulty was expected, flexible endoscopy was used significantly more often (χ²(1) = 11.06, p < 0.001). Complications occurred significantly less often when the bronchoscopist used their preferred technique (χ²(1) = 6.41, p = 0.011), had more than 5 years of experience (χ²(1) = 5.13, p = 0.023), or performed more than 100 removals (χ²(2) = 11.51, p = 0.003). In medical centers, complication rates significantly decreased if more than 200 bronchoscopies were performed in children compared to the centers that perform 50–200 bronchoscopies per year (χ²(1) = 24.56, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Preference and experience of a bronchoscopist and their medical center with flexible or rigid foreign body removal distinctively affect the outcome of the procedure and cannot be neglected in the discourse on the appropriate approach.

### Radiological features of ingested metallic mesh earphone pieces [^114CrUGe]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Foreign body ingestion remains a frequent cause of morbidity in infants and children. Symptoms vary with the size, shape, location, and composition of the foreign body. Flat objects tend to rotate to the greatest diameter of the esophageal lumen and become oriented in the coronal plane. We report two cases of ingested metallic mesh earphone pieces found in the upper esophagus. The foreign bodies were difficult to identify on posteroanterior images but were more easily visualized on the lateral images. The presentation of this clinical entity and the recognition of its distinctive radiological findings may prevent a delayed diagnosis in the future and avoid potential complications.

### Superabsorbent polymer balls as foreign bodies in the nasal cavities of children: Our clinical experience [^111dwsea]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with such nasal foreign bodies usually experience nasal mucosal injury to varying degrees, and it takes time for the mucosa to recover after the operation. Patients should clean their nasal cavity with normal saline on a regular basis. General and local anti-inflammatory and anti-infection therapies should be administered. Within 1–2 months after the operation, abnormalities such as dry crust and granulation may be expected, which should be detected and removed promptly.

### Complication of ear impression: Foreign body in the Eustachian tube eroding the carotid canal [^112DaswZ]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Low credibility.

The realization of customized earplugs and earmolds for hearing aids requires an impression of the external auditory canal to obtain a siliconized mold. Silicone used for ear impressions is known to be safe and inert, but deposition of silicone in the middle ear can cause damage to both the middle and inner ear. We present a case of accidental injection of silicone in the middle ear and the Eustachian tube, resulting in erosion of the carotid canal.

The appropriate time for screw and plate removal is not well established. The literature reports removal any time from 8 to 14 months; however, some authors electively remove implants up to 3 years from the index surgery. When the decision is made to remove the implant instead of retaining it, our clinical consensus is to remove it at 12 months.

Ear mold impression middle ear foreign bodies are a rare complication of hearing aid fitting. Only a small number of cases have been reported; however, the actual incidence is unknown and likely much higher than expected. We present the case of a 77-year-old man with a history of preexisting tympanic membrane perforations who presented with an ear mold impression middle ear foreign body that required surgical removal. We explore the state and federal laws that guide the interaction between patients, hearing aid sellers, and otolaryngologists. We highlight steps that can be taken to reduce the incidence of this complication.

### Superabsorbent polymer balls as foreign bodies in the nasal cavities of children: Our clinical experience [^1155MUjs]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

- **General data**: Clinical data concerning 12 cases of superabsorbent polymer balls as nasal foreign bodies were retrospectively collected from patients admitted to the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, over 5 years from January 2015 to December 2019. Among these patients, 7 were male and 5 were female. The ages ranged from 1 year and 10 months to 6 years and 9 months, with a median age of 3 years and 5 months. Eight patients had foreign bodies in the right nasal cavity, whereas 4 had them in the left nasal cavity.

- **Diagnosis and treatment**: Patients suspected of having nasal foreign bodies underwent transnasal endoscopic examination or nasal CT for confirmation when necessary. Once detected, nasal foreign bodies were removed under local anaesthesia in the outpatient setting if possible; otherwise, patients were hospitalized and underwent foreign body removal through transnasal endoscopy under general anaesthesia. After the operation, symptomatic treatment was administered along with regular follow-up visits until complete recovery was achieved.

- **Research methods**: This paper analyses the clinical symptoms, methods of diagnosis and treatment, and postoperative nasal cavity recovery of the involved patients.

### Management of cerebrospinal fluid leaks after acoustic tumor removal [^1144Q6Je]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

To present a logical algorithm for management of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak that occurs after acoustic tumor removal, and to describe a method for eustachian tube resection, we introduce an algorithm in the form of a flow chart. We discuss the procedure of middle fossa craniotomy for eustachian tube resection and present three cases in which this technique was utilized.

- **Technique**: For a CSF leak, pressure dressing at the wound site and bed rest for the patient are advised. A lumbar drain is indicated if the leak does not resolve. Occasionally, wound exploration is required. CSF rhinorrhea is initially treated with a lumbar drain. If this approach proves unsuccessful, the choice of treatment depends on the patient's hearing status. In patients with no hearing, we perform a blind sac closure of the ear canal and pack the eustachian tube. If hearing is intact, wound reexploration and lumbar drainage are advised. When conservative and initial surgical procedures for resolving CSF leak fail, we perform a middle fossa craniotomy to identify, divide, and remove a segmental portion of the cartilaginous eustachian tube, followed by cauterization and occlusion of both ends.

At centers where surgical removal of acoustic tumors is frequently conducted, a logical protocol should be established for the treatment of postoperative CSF leak. The location of the leak and the patient's hearing status are critical factors in determining the appropriate treatment method. Middle fossa craniotomy for resection of the eustachian tube emerges as a safe, definitive management option for the treatment of recalcitrant CSF leaks.

### Risk factors for otolaryngological foreign bodies in Eastern Poland [^115wtKU9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To identify the sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors associated with suspected foreign bodies in the ear, nose, throat, airway, and esophagus among Polish children, a retrospective analysis was performed.

- **Study design**: A case series with chart review was conducted at a tertiary care medical center.

- **Subjects and methods**: A retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients hospitalized for a suspected foreign body (FB) between 1998 and 2008 was conducted. Data regarding place of residence, presence of siblings, parents' educational status, seasonality, psychomotor development, age, and sex were collected and statistically analyzed.

- **Results**: Of the 1011 patients with suspected foreign body insertion, 849 (84%) had a positive diagnosis. Of the confirmed foreign bodies, 96 were found in the tracheobronchial tree, 142 were found in the esophagus, and 611 were located in the external auditory canals, nasopharyngeal passage, tonsils, auricles, or lips. Sociodemographically, 596 of the children came from urban areas, with a preponderance of males (55%). Objects were removed more frequently in summer and autumn (60%). Children with siblings (53%) predominated. The majority of patients (52%) had parents with an elementary education. Food was the most frequent foreign body in children under 3 years of age. Patients with delayed psychomotor development constituted 1.6% of the analyzed population.

- **Conclusions**: Being male, 1 to 3 years of age, belonging to an urban family with siblings, and having parents with an elementary education increased the risk of foreign body insertion. Training caregivers about proper prevention and response strategies is important.

### External auditory canal foreign body removal: Management practices and outcomes [^113bwveH]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of external auditory canal foreign body removal attempts by health care practitioners and to explore outcomes of patients with unsuccessful initial removal attempts.

A retrospective case series of patients presenting with an external auditory canal foreign body to the emergency department of Strong Memorial Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, over a 3-year period was studied. Medical records were reviewed, and information including age at presentation, type of foreign body, side of presentation, length of time in place, signs and symptoms at presentation, management practices, and outcomes was recorded.

A total of 162 patients with a diagnosis of external auditory canal foreign body were identified. Emergency personnel successfully managed 67% of patients using direct visualization techniques, while 33% required otolaryngological consultation. Otolaryngologists primarily used otomicroscopy with standard otological instruments for management. Analysis of successfully managed emergency department cases revealed that 82% of foreign bodies were irregularly shaped objects with soft, graspable parts. Conversely, 72% of foreign bodies in otolaryngology referrals were firm, rounded objects such as beads and beans. Among referred patients, 19% required removal under anesthesia.

### Safety and efficacy of a protocol for in-office pediatric aural foreign body removal [^116xHqUG]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

To examine the safety and efficacy of a step-by-step protocol for the office removal of aural foreign bodies (FB) in a pediatric population, all children presenting to an academic pediatric outpatient department were identified from a computerized collection of office notes and operative reports. FB removal was performed in a standard fashion, which included pre-procedure discussion with shared decision making, restraint in a supine position with a trained second person holding the head, and FB removal using an operative microscope and instrumentation. A case was considered a failure if subsequent removal under sedation or general anesthesia was required.

A total of 447 cases (ears) were identified in 428 children, with 19 having bilateral FBs. Of these, 201 children (47%) had previous attempts at FB removal elsewhere. The office successfully extracted 431 out of 447 (96.4%) FBs. Sixteen out of 447 (3.6%) FBs were removed in the operating room. Out of the 431 successful removals, two patients experienced minor complications such as ear canal lacerations. No child suffered more severe complications. The failed removal group was more likely to have a documented neurodevelopmental disorder (4/21 vs. 12/407, p = 0.0001).

In conclusion, this protocol resulted in a high rate of successful FB removal, even in children with prior failed attempts. There were no significant ear injuries in this 22-year experience, which included children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder. This approach should be considered by otolaryngologists who care for pediatric patients.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. *Aural toileting* refers to various methods for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge, but compared to irrigation or microsuction, it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be employed alone or alongside other CSOM treatments, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search was conducted on 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM.

### Cerumen impaction: Diagnosis and management [^113EoJWW]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Cerumen production is a normal and protective process for the ear canal. However, cerumen should be removed when it causes symptoms (e.g. hearing loss, itching, pain, tinnitus) or prevents assessment of the external auditory canal, the tympanic membrane, or the audiovestibular system. Cerumen should also be removed when it limits examination in patients who cannot communicate their symptoms, such as those with dementia, developmental delay, nonverbal patients with behavioral changes, and young children with fever, speech delay, or parental concerns.

Patients with coagulopathies, hepatic failure, thrombocytopenia, or hemophilia, and those taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications should be counseled about the increased risk of bleeding in the external auditory canal when cerumen is removed. Effective treatment options include cerumenolytic agents, irrigation with or without cerumenolytic pretreatment, and manual removal. Home irrigation with a bulb syringe may be appropriate for selected adults. Cotton-tipped swabs, ear candling, and olive oil drops or sprays should be avoided. If multiple attempts to remove the impacted cerumen, including a combination of treatments, are ineffective, clinicians should refer the patient to an otolaryngologist. Persistent symptoms despite resolution of the impaction should also prompt further evaluation for an alternative diagnosis.

### Is the emergency department management of ENT foreign bodies successful? A tertiary care hospital experience in Australia [^115zqtvu]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

We evaluated the role of the emergency department (ED) in the management of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) foreign bodies in an Australian tertiary care hospital. We retrospectively reviewed all cases of ENT foreign-body presentations in the ED over a 2-year period. We identified 168 such cases, a large proportion of which involved pediatric patients. In addition to demographic factors, we also collected data on the nature of the foreign bodies, the specific sites involved, the rate of successful treatment by the ED staff, the seniority/rank of the treating clinician, and complications.

Foreign bodies in the ear accounted for 49% of all cases, the nose for 43%, and the throat for 8%. The ED staff attempted to remove the foreign body in 89% of cases, while the rest were referred to the ENT team. The rate of successful removal of all foreign bodies attempted by the ED team was fairly high at 78%. Success rates were 86% for nasal foreign bodies, 72% for aural objects, and 67% for those lodged in the throat. No major complications occurred; minor bleeding episodes after removal occurred in 8% of cases. Most ENT foreign-body presentations were managed safely and entirely by the ED team; most of the ENT referrals were to outpatient clinics.

### Pediatric ear foreign body retrieval: A comparison across specialties [^116Mnbq4]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to analyze the characteristics of patients and/or ear foreign bodies that should prompt referral to otolaryngology. This aims to maximize successful removal and minimize complications.

Methods involved a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who presented for ear foreign body removal from January to December 2016 at a tertiary hospital center. Data collection included the success of removal, major or minor complications, use of general or conscious sedation, use of otic or oral antibiotics, age of the patient, comorbid behavioral disorders, and foreign body characteristics. Major complications included tympanic membrane perforation or ossicular damage, while minor complications included injury of the canal wall. Patients with retained or extruded tympanostomy tubes were excluded.

Results indicated that of 275 patients aged 1–18 years, 16% presented initially to otolaryngology (ENT), 48.4% presented to the emergency department (ED), 21.8% presented to a pediatrician, and 13.8% presented to ENT after prior attempts at removal. The rate of successful retrieval by ENT was significantly higher than by primary care providers (PCP) (95.4% vs 75.0%) or by ENT after prior failed attempts (65.8%), but not when compared to removal in the ED (85.7%). Retrieval by ENT after prior failed attempts had the highest rate of minor complications (26.3% vs 2.3–6.0%). There were two tympanic membrane perforations noted by ENT after prior failed attempts. The rate of operative intervention was significantly higher in patients who presented to ENT after prior attempts compared to those who presented initially to ENT.

### Ear wax [^111566Kz]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Ear wax only becomes a problem if it causes a hearing impairment or other ear-related symptoms. Ear wax is more likely to accumulate and cause a hearing impairment when normal extrusion is prevented; for example, by the use of hearing aids or by the use of cotton buds to clean the ears. Ear wax can visually obscure the ear drum and may need to be removed for diagnostic purposes.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of methods to remove ear wax? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ear irrigation (syringing); manual removal (other than ear irrigation); wax softeners prior to irrigation; and wax softeners alone.

### Procedural sedation use in the ED: Management of pediatric ear and nose foreign bodies [^117E3rtF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This is the first report of which we are aware that describes the use of procedural sedation for the emergency department management of ear and nose foreign bodies in children under 18 years of age. During a 5.5-year period, we identified 312 cases of children with a foreign body in a single orifice (174 ear, 138 nose). Procedural sedation was performed in 23% of cases (43 ear, 28 nose), with ketamine being most commonly used (92%). Emergency physicians had a high rate of success in removing foreign bodies (84% ear, 95% nose) and a low complication rate. Procedural sedation positively affected the success rate, as more than half of the sedation cases involved prior failed removal attempts without sedation by the same physician. Emergency physicians should be familiar with this indication for procedural sedation.

### Comparative prospective study of foreign body removal from external auditory canals of cadavers with right angle hook or cyanoacrylate glue [^115iXUdv]. Emergency medicine journal (2002). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies in the external auditory canal are a relatively common problem in emergency departments. Repeated attempts at removal with standard instrumentation can lead to significant ear injury. Recent case reports suggest using cyanoacrylate-impregnated cotton buds may be less traumatic and well-tolerated by patients; however, no studies on this method have been performed. The objectives of this study were to identify significant differences in success rate, duration, and injury caused by extracting beads from the external auditory canals of adult cadaveric ears using two different methods. This is the first study in a planned series of anatomical and clinical studies related to foreign body extraction from the external auditory canal.

- **Methods**: In this study, the success rate, time taken, and injury rate were assessed for the removal of impacted spherical foreign bodies in the external auditory canals of cadavers using both a blunt right angle hook and cotton buds impregnated with cyanoacrylate glue. This procedure was performed by a specialist registrar in otolaryngology and repeated by a specialist registrar in emergency medicine.

- **Results**: It was shown that both methods had a statistically similar success rate (two-tailed binomial test p = 0.5) and no injury was identified for either method. Additionally, the median extraction time was 6 seconds for a right-angle hook and 42 seconds for cyanoacrylate. It was also noted that failed extraction was associated with a poor view of the foreign body in the external canal, often caused by hair.

### Image-guided soft-tissue foreign body extraction - success and pitfalls [^11177reP]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to outline the pitfalls of image-guided percutaneous removal of foreign bodies (FBs). Three hundred and fifty prospective patients were referred for ultrasound imaging for FB diagnosis and percutaneous removal during 2008–2010. Those patients with suitable FBs were offered guided percutaneous removal. The procedural methods and difficulties were recorded, and all outcomes were noted, including surgical success and complications.

- **Results**: Sixty-three patients had a negative ultrasound for FB, and they were discharged without subsequent attendances. Of the remaining 287 patients, 12 were deemed unsuitable for percutaneous removal, 15 attempted percutaneous removals failed, and 8 were not attempted due to a lack of symptoms. The remaining 252 patients underwent successful retrieval, and there were no procedural complications. The procedural limitations were mainly related to the anatomical site, type of FB, instrumentation, bubbles, ultrasound beam width, and mobility of the FB.

- **Conclusion**: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous removal of FBs is a safe and viable approach for the management of FBs, achieving at least 88% success overall. With attention to the pitfalls, the learning curve should improve the success rate.

### Pediatric external auditory canal foreign bodies: a review of 698 cases [^113jRvTQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The study goal was to determine the relationships between patient management factors and patient outcomes in pediatric patients with external auditory canal foreign bodies. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 698 consecutive cases of pediatric external auditory canal foreign bodies (n = 605 patients) who presented to a tertiary care pediatric referral center during a 6-year period.

Emergency physicians frequently removed foreign bodies under direct visualization while otolaryngologists primarily used otomicroscopy. Both methods had high success rates overall, at 77% and 86% respectively. However, attempts under direct visualization had lower success rates with removing spherical objects, objects touching the tympanic membrane, and objects in the canal for more than 24 hours. Failed removal attempts resulted in higher complication rates.

Certain foreign body and patient characteristics are associated with poor outcomes with removal attempts made under direct visualization. These cases should be referred directly to otolaryngologists for otomicroscopic removal.

### Clinical characteristics of external auditory canal foreign bodies in children and adolescents [^111RzKvR]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies (FBs) in the external auditory canal (EAC) can occur at any age but are especially common in children and adolescents. The aims of the study were to evaluate the clinical characteristics of EAC FBs in this demographic and to discuss their proper management.

- **Methods**: A retrospective medical chart review was performed on patients treated for EAC FBs in a tertiary referral center from January 2007 to December 2017. The study investigated the parameters of age, sex, type of FB, sedation method, complications, and removal strategy.

- **Results**: Of 284 patients, 176 (62.0%) were male. Peak incidences were noted at the ages of 3 to 6 years and 17 to 18 years. The frequently observed FBs were insects, followed by air-gun pellets, cotton balls, marbles, and earrings. Forty-one (14.4%) EAC FBs were removed with the naked eye, while 243 (85.6%) were removed under a microscope in the otolaryngology department. Of these patients, 23 (9.5%) were administered sedatives, and 1 (4.1%) required general anesthesia. During or after the removal procedure, 4 (15.5%) patients experienced complications, including EAC abrasion or laceration (42, 14.8%) and tympanic membrane perforation (2, 0.7%).

- **Conclusions**: External auditory canal FBs showed distinct characteristics of incidence regarding age, which related to removal strategies. The characteristics of FBs must be considered for safe removal.

### Osteotome technique for removal of symptomatic ear canal exostoses [^114NwoZz]. The Laryngoscope (2007). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken to assess a transcanal osteotome technique for removing symptomatic ear canal exostoses. The outcome measures included healing rates and the rate of complications.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective study conducted in a private practice.

- **Methods**: A straight 1-mm osteotome and a curved 1-mm osteotome were used through a transcanal approach to incrementally remove obstructive ear canal exostoses. If anterior or superior bone growths were closely approximating the tympanic membrane, they were partially removed with a 1.5 mm cylindrical end- and side-cutting burr. Healing rates were monitored with weekly postoperative visits.

- **Results**: Two hundred twenty-one ear canals (140 patients) were consecutively treated with this technique. Healing was achieved between 2 to 8 weeks, with an average of 3.5 weeks, and 90% healed by 4 weeks. There were 4 mobilizations of a full-thickness segment of the anterior bony canal wall; 3 exposures of periosteum anterior to the anterior bony wall; 1 tear of the tympanic membrane requiring tympanoplasty; 18 anterior and 11 posterior tympanic membrane tears that healed spontaneously; 3 instances of sensorineural hearing decrease; 3 cases of new-onset postoperative tinnitus; and 1 instance of postoperative positioning vertigo. There were no lacerations of the tympanic membrane by an osteotome, no facial nerve injuries, no soft tissue stenoses of an ear canal, and no skin grafting of an ear canal.

The described technique of using osteotomes transcanally for removal of symptomatic obstructive ear canal exostoses promoted rapid healing.

### Application of a double-balloon method to remove button battery at the entrance of esophagus in a 17-month-old child: a case report [^116bdNAf]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Children have a strong desire for exploration and poor safety awareness, making foreign body impaction in the digestive tract a common critical condition in this age group. With the increasing use of electronic products, incidents of button battery ingestion are also rising among children. Button battery impaction in the esophagus can quickly lead to serious complications, such as esophageal cauterization and perforation. Therefore, more aggressive treatment strategies should be employed immediately upon the occurrence of button battery ingestion. Surgical treatment can be traumatic and may cause various complications, so endoscopic removal of the foreign body from the esophagus is preferred.

We introduced a new method to remove a button battery retained in the esophagus of a 17-month-old child. Shortly after the patient arrived at the hospital, we promptly arranged for endoscopic surgery. Upon entering the esophageal inlet with the gastroscope, we first cleaned the esophageal residues, exposing the button battery. The surrounding esophageal mucosa showed slight cauterization-like damage. Initially, we attempted to remove the foreign body using foreign body forceps but failed after repeated attempts. Subsequently, we tried utilizing a disposable balloon to aid in dragging the foreign body. However, due to the patient's young age and narrower esophagus, combined with the abnormally large drag resistance of the foreign body, this method was ineffective. Violent dragging could potentially cause tearing and perforation of the esophagus. Hence, we used a columnar balloon to…

### Not 'just' a foreign body in the ear canal [^116kz1tn]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies are commonly encountered by the ear, nose, and throat emergency team, with cotton wool being the most prevalent aural foreign body observed in the adult population. Most complications from aural foreign bodies described in the literature are minor and rarely necessitate surgical intervention. Here, we present two cases involving impacted cotton wool as aural foreign bodies, which resulted in suppurative labyrinthitis and osteomyelitis, leading to profound sensorineural hearing loss. These cases underscore the importance of considering aural foreign bodies in the differential diagnosis for those presenting with unilateral symptoms, as significant complications, although rare, can occur, particularly with delayed diagnosis.

### To x-ray or not to x-ray? Discussing unknown nasal foreign bodies and button batteries [^111CVu8N]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The emergency of esophageal button batteries is recognized. However, foreign bodies in the ear or nose are treated as comparatively nonemergent. We present the case of a child who arrived with a suspected pen-nib in the nostril to highlight the importance of investigation and intervention in unwitnessed nasal foreign bodies and review the literature regarding X-rays in these situations. Fifteen papers were identified according to our search parameters; three of these papers recommend the use of plain radiographs for nasal foreign bodies.

We propose that in cases of unwitnessed pediatric nasal foreign body insertion, a facial X-ray should be considered, especially if a metallic foreign body is suspected.

### Extraction of aural foreign bodies in a rural setting: 10-year review and a novel method to remove magnetic stones [^115us34P]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The external auditory canal's unique anatomical characteristics make the presence of foreign bodies (FBs) a clinical challenge, particularly in rural settings without ready access to tertiary care and specialist intervention.

- **Aims**: Our study surveys the experience in aural FBs surgical management in a rural Australian tertiary center. It proposes a safe, easy, and affordable technique to remove stones from the ear canal.

- **Methods**: We completed a 10-year retrospective surgical chart review, including 474 patients (52 adults and 428 children) requiring surgical management to remove aural FBs at the Royal Darwin Hospital, Northern Territory, Australia. We surveyed patient demographics, foreign-body description, complications, location, and removal attempts. We identified factors that determine the need for surgical management and proposed a technique for the safe, uncomplicated, and affordable removal of stones from the ear canal after applying this method in a small subgroup.

- **Results**: The most common FBs requiring surgery in children were stones. A predominance in the Aboriginal population from remote communities was found, leading to a nasal bridle magnet technique to remove stones in rural settings. This method reduces the number of extraction attempts of the most frequent FB found in children's ears, aiming to minimize complications, negative experiences, and health costs.

- **Conclusion**: Contrary to international literature, stones were found to be the most common FBs in remote Aboriginal populations. The proposed technique reduces the number of extraction attempts.

### Pediatric nasal foreign body not visible on simple exam: Incidence and patient characteristics [^111omV7M]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of, and patient characteristics associated with, the presence of a pediatric nasal foreign body when one is reported but none is visible on simple exam.

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients presenting to a tertiary pediatric emergency department from October 1, 2013, to October 1, 2023, with a chief concern of nasal foreign body. We excluded patients for whom a foreign body was readily visible by direct visualization or with the aid of an otoscope. This left our population of interest: pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department with a chief concern of nasal foreign body but with none visible on simple exam. Within this population, we determined the proportion of patients ultimately found to have a foreign body and identified characteristics associated with foreign body presence.

We identified 190 patients in our population of interest. Seventeen percent were ultimately found to have a foreign body present. Patient characteristics associated with the presence of a foreign body included ongoing symptoms, objective exam findings, and remote insertion time. There was no association with foreign body material or the reported presence of foreign bodies in multiple locations.

These results demonstrate that pediatric nasal foreign bodies may be present even if not visible by direct visualization or otoscopic exam. The incidence and associated patient characteristics reported can help clinicians engage in more data-informed shared decision-making when determining the appropriate course of action.

### Management of aural foreign body: an evaluative study in 738 consecutive cases [^116tCryC]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2007). Low credibility.

Foreign body in the aural canal is a common ENT (ears, nose, and throat) emergency, although not always managed by an otolaryngologist. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of this emergent problem by medical personnel other than an otolaryngologist.

- **Materials and method**: A retrospective study in 738 consecutive cases with an internal control group was carried out at the Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, India, and the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, over a period of two years each. The methodology of removal and complications were tabulated and statistically analyzed using chi-squared tests.

- **Result**: A complication rate of 77% and general anesthesia (GA) induction for removal in 10% of cases was seen in patients treated by other healthcare personnel, whereas a minimum complication rate of 19.5% and GA induction in only 3.5% of cases were recorded in patients managed by an otolaryngologist.

- **Conclusion**: The collected data, when put to statistical examination, clearly indicate that patients manipulated by medical personnel other than an ENT surgeon have a much higher chance of complication and GA induction for removal of a foreign body. This underlines the importance of strict otolaryngologist management in all cases.

### Superabsorbent polymer balls as foreign bodies in the nasal cavities of children: Our clinical experience [^112qHzM1]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

All patients first received local anaesthesia in the outpatient department, and an attempt was made to remove the foreign bodies. If it was impossible to remove the foreign bodies in the outpatient setting, the patients were hospitalized and underwent nasal endoscopy under general anaesthesia. One patient (< 1 day) had the foreign bodies completely removed under local anaesthesia in the outpatient department. Two patients had the foreign bodies partly removed in the outpatient department under local anaesthesia but experienced nasal congestion, runny nose, and a high fever after being sent home and were found to have remaining foreign bodies on nasal endoscopy; thus, the remaining foreign bodies were removed under general anaesthesia.

The remaining patients could not be treated in the outpatient department, so they were hospitalized and underwent nasal endoscopy under general anaesthesia. During the operation, the foreign bodies were found to have expanded significantly. As they were highly brittle, they were prone to breaking into pieces when touched. Thus, it was impossible to remove them with hooks or forceps; instead, suctioning was performed multiple times. In patients with foreign bodies left in the nasal cavity for less than 3 days, the nasal mucosa showed local swelling and slight erosion. In those who retained the nasal foreign bodies for longer than 3 days, the nasal mucosa was significantly swollen, with congestion and erosion and a high chance of bleeding. In those patients, more structures were involved, including the inferior nasal concha and nasal septum.

### Nasal foreign body removal [^115gw8Se]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with nasal foreign bodies often present to the Emergency Department (ED) for removal. In most cases, successful removal can be performed by the Emergency Physician (EP) using a variety of simple techniques. The EP should be familiar with multiple procedural techniques, as a significant number of patients will require multiple attempts and techniques for removal of the nasal foreign body. This article reviews the more common techniques for removal and provides specific technical tips, indications, and contraindications for each technique.

### Management of incus dislocation from attempted foreign body removal with alligator forceps [^116m9QkP]. Ear, Nose & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Middle ear trauma from foreign body (FB) impaction or its removal can lead to tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and ossicular chain disruption. We present a case of a 29-year-old male who developed acute right-sided hearing loss, aural fullness, and tinnitus after an attempt at removing a cotton-tipped applicator (Q-tip) impaction in the ear canal. Physical examination revealed a dislocated incus protruding through the TM, and audiometry confirmed moderate conductive hearing loss. The patient underwent tympanoplasty with ossicular chain reconstruction with incus interposition, which resulted in significant hearing improvement and resolution of tinnitus. This case highlights the importance of proper diagnosis and intervention in trauma-related ossicular dislocation.

### Characteristics of pediatric nasal foreign body cases that required multiple removal procedures: A single tertiary medical center cross-sectional study [^115KM5aZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

The removal of nasal foreign bodies in children should be completed in as few attempts as possible to reduce the burden on the child. This study aimed to reveal the characteristics of pediatric nasal foreign body cases that required multiple removal procedures and to investigate the appropriate removal method for each shape of the foreign body.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed patients who visited a pediatric emergency department because of a nasal foreign body from November 1, 2018, to October 31, 2020. We compared the characteristics of patients, foreign bodies, and treatment between the success and failure groups in the first removal procedure. Moreover, we described the details of patients in the failure group. We also showed the final successful removal methods according to the shape of the foreign bodies.

- **Results**: We included 104 children in our analysis. Between the success and failure groups in the first removal procedure, there was no statistically significant difference in the characteristics of patients and foreign bodies, but a significant difference in the removal method (P < 0.001). In the failure group, the most frequent number of times required for removal was two, and the most common method in the first removal procedure was the parent's kiss, most of which were performed on spherical foreign bodies in younger children. Finally, only seven cases (6.7%) failed to remove the foreign body. According to the shape of the foreign bodies, the percentage of forceps and clamps used for successful removal was high in every shape.

- **Conclusions**: There was a significan

### Foreign body or hypersensitivity granuloma of the inner ear after cochlear implantation: One possible cause of a soft failure [^113N6RVk]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

A tissue response in the form of a foreign body or a hypersensitivity reaction to cochlear implantation is common and may be one possible cause of a soft failure of cochlear implantation.

- **Background**: After a successful cochlear implantation, delayed failure may occur. The causes of a "soft" failure, that is, one in which device malfunction cannot be proven, are unknown.

- **Methods**: The histopathology of the temporal bones of a patient who, in life, had experienced a soft failure after cochlear implantation was described. In addition, the temporal bones of 8 other subjects who, in life, had undergone cochlear implantation were studied for evidence of a foreign body or hypersensitivity reaction.

- **Results**: In the case report, a necrotizing granulomatous giant cell reaction surrounded the cochlear implant electrode track through the mastoid and the middle ear and into the cochlea in both ears. There was osteolysis of the cribrose area, otic capsule, and bone between the facial nerve and the cochlea and destruction of the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion. In the additional 8 cases studied, a similar, although less pronounced, foreign body or hypersensitivity reaction was seen in 6 (75%) of the cases.

- **Conclusion**: A foreign body or hypersensitivity reaction in the form of giant cells and lymphocytic cell infiltration is common after cochlear implantation and may be one possible cause of soft failure.

### Expansile superabsorbent polymer ball foreign body in the ear [^111uNZVB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are materials that can absorb large quantities of water. Small spherical SAPs are commonly marketed as toys for children.

- **Case report**: We report the case of a 4-year-old female who presented to a pediatric emergency department with a small, marble-sized SAP that was placed in her ear by herself during the course of play at daycare. On examination, the object was translucent and difficult to visualize. After multiple attempts at removal, the object was partially removed using an ear curette. The patient sustained a small tympanic membrane perforation. During a follow-up operative intervention by otorhinolaryngology, the remainder of the object was removed using a suction device and the tympanic membrane was repaired.

- **Emergency awareness**: While large SAPs associated with intestinal obstruction have been removed from the market, smaller SAPs can present a health risk when placed in orifices such as the ear or nose. Cases of foreign body SAPs have been misdiagnosed as ear infections and treated with topical antibiotics, which can lead to enlargement of the foreign body. Irrigation techniques and topical medications should not be used. SAPs are friable and can break into multiple pieces during removal attempts. Blunt tools, such as ear curettes, may be best suited for their removal. If the item breaks up during removal or if removal fails, urgent consultation with an otorhinolaryngologist is recommended.

### Maneuver for the recovery of a foreign body causing a complete airway obstruction: Illustrative case [^11479kUu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

This case involves a 12-month-old child with an upper respiratory tract foreign body completely obstructing the airway. Intubation or cricothyroidotomy equipment was unavailable, and traditional removal methods had been unsuccessful. The child was kept in a prone position, and a combination of mouth-to-mouth or nose aspiration and spitting out secretions transformed the complete blockade into a partial one. After continuing this maneuver for a few minutes to maintain an open airway, a soft, light plastic object was recovered. Foreign body removal is a life-threatening emergency, particularly when no trained medical personnel or equipment is available. This method provides a viable option for practitioners or parents in extreme circumstances when traditional methods fail.

### Insecticidal activity of common reagents for insect foreign bodies of the ear [^115KvA3H]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Insects commonly present as painful and distressing foreign bodies of the external ear canal. Removing live insects can be challenging, especially for primary care physicians who have limited equipment. The purpose of this study is to compare the insecticidal activity of commonly available preparations for insects that are most frequently recovered from ear canals: cockroaches (German and American), ticks, beetles, and honeybees.

- **Study design**: Prospective, blinded.

- **Methods**: One hundred seventy insects of each species were placed in test tubes and submerged in 17 test preparations (10 tubes per preparation, 1 insect per test tube). Insect activity was stimulated by agitation of the test tube. Responses were monitored, and the time until death was measured.

- **Results**: Most test preparations exhibited some insecticidal activity against most insect species. Ticks were completely resistant to all of the test reagents. Ethanol killed the American cockroaches (mean time, 32.6 s), German cockroaches (mean time, 29.6 s), and honeybees (mean time, 19.6 s) the most rapidly.

- **Conclusion**: Many commonly available reagents may be used to kill or immobilize insect foreign bodies of the ear.

### Postauricular feather foreign body in an infant [^116suvDr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A male infant presented with reduced oral intake, low-grade fever, and postauricular erythema. Clinical examination revealed a soft, tender swelling posteroinferior to the mastoid tip, with a dull tympanic membrane on otoscopy. Cross-sectional imaging did not show any evidence of middle ear infection or mastoiditis. However, there was minimal change in clinical status despite trialing various intravenous antibiotics. One week after admission, a thin, white foreign body self-extruded from the upper part of the postauricular skin, recognized by the child's parents as a feather from their sofa cushion.

The suspected mechanism was the penetration of the feather into the skin when the child was lying on the sofa. While incredibly rare, soft tissue foreign bodies should be considered in pediatric patients with postauricular swelling not responding to antibiotics.

### A metal ring that had been lodged in a child's nasopharynx for 4 years [^112RSWqt]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

A considerable number of articles on foreign-body ingestion and inhalation have been reported in the literature. Of these, nasopharyngeal foreign bodies are rare. Unless they cause total obstruction, symptoms typically appear late. Foreign bodies, especially metal ones, can lodge in soft tissue, and their removal can be rather complicated.

In this article, we describe the case of a 4-year-old girl who had a gold ring lodged in her nasopharynx. The history led us to determine that the ring had been there since the child was 3 months old. A flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngeal examination revealed that the ring was embedded in the nasal surface of the soft palate and was enclosed by a thin layer of mucosal membrane. With the patient under general anesthesia, we were able to remove the foreign body with a 0-degree endoscope.

### Superabsorbent polymer balls as foreign bodies in the nasal cavities of children: our clinical experience [^1144oHRs]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Nasal foreign bodies in children are commonly seen in clinical practice. Children cannot report their medical history, and their parents are often unaware of the precipitating incident; therefore, misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis are common. When foreign bodies remain in the nasal cavity for a prolonged period, they can cause chronic diseases such as rhinitis and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS). The occurrence of nasal foreign bodies becoming tracheal foreign bodies is very rare, but they may be accidentally sucked into the trachea, posing a severe threat to the life of the patient. Once the presence of nasal foreign bodies has been confirmed, they should be removed as soon as possible.

Children are increasingly exposed to a variety of objects, such as stationery, toys, and food, leading to a higher incidence of nasal foreign bodies. As the physicochemical properties of these foreign bodies become increasingly diversified and complicated, it has become even more challenging to remove them from the nasal cavity. In addition, multiple complications and sequelae may develop. Superabsorbent polymer balls have become common foreign bodies in recent years. They usually appear in the form of soft marbles that are the projectiles associated with toy guns, accessible to children. They strongly resemble candies, with their smooth and either transparent or colorful appearance, and they have become very popular among children. Superabsorbent polymer balls are now frequently reported as causing digestive tract obstruction after being accidentally eaten by children.

### Fluoroscopic localization of a retained intranasal ballistic foreign body in an unexpected location [^113J5dLZ]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Otolaryngologists are frequently asked to evaluate impacted nasal foreign bodies in children. Multiple techniques have been used for the removal of these objects. We describe what we believe is a previously unreported mechanism of nasal foreign-body impaction and the novel method we used to remove it. We also review the literature on retained ballistic nasal foreign bodies, including their management and complications.

### Foreign bodies in the ear: A simple technique for removal analysed in vitro [^112k4QBX]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies in the ear are mainly encountered in children and can often pose a problem, especially in an accident and emergency department where a microscope or expert help is not routinely available. This paper presents a simple, safe, and effective way of ear syringing. The ease and simplicity of the procedure, along with the equipment, are described.

- **Method and results**: The equipment consists of a "disposable" sterile kit, including a 20 mL syringe, saline at body temperature, and a 14 or 16 gauge cannula (without the needle). An in vitro experiment was conducted to calculate the pressure generated by the water jet on the eardrum. The pressure was well below the threshold required to burst a tympanic membrane, and hence this technique is safe to use.

- **Conclusions**: Ear syringing is an effective and easy way of removing most foreign bodies. A detailed history and an otoscopic examination must precede the procedure. The novel method of syringing described in this paper, with the usual safeguards, could be a useful adjunct in the management of this common condition.

### Clinical features and complications of external auditory canal foreign bodies in the ENT emergency unit [^117Hnr3W]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors for developing complications in patients undergoing removal procedures for foreign bodies (FBs) in the external auditory canal (EAC) in an otolaryngology (ENT) emergency unit. Cases involving patients with EAC FBs treated at the ENT emergency unit of a tertiary medical center were retrospectively recruited. Patients were classified into two age groups: those under 10 years and those 10 years and older. Univariate analyses of the complication rates were performed in all patients and the two age groups.

The results showed that the mean age of the 457 patients was 29.9 ± 19.9 years (ranging from 1.0 to 89.0 years). Of these, 42.7% (n = 195) were under 10 years of age, and 57.1% (n = 261) were male. Complications following FB removal occurred in 40 cases (8.8%), with EAC laceration being the most common complication (4.4%). Patients under 10 years of age had a higher risk of developing complications than those over 10 years (13.8% vs 5.0%, P = .001), with the younger group also showing an increased risk of EAC laceration (6.7% vs 2.7%, P = .039).

Patients under 10 years of age had a significantly higher rate of complications after EAC FB removal in the ENT emergency unit. It is recommended that sedation or surgical removal under general anesthesia be considered to minimize the risk of complications following a failed removal under direct vision in this patient group. Further studies are warranted to verify this implication for clinical practice.
