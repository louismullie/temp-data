## Question

dose of CaCl for digoxin overdose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of calcium chloride (CaCl2) for digoxin overdose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether calcium is indicated at all in digoxin toxicity. Then, I should verify the historical "calcium is contraindicated" teaching and whether contemporary evidence refutes it. Next, I will review the pharmacologic rationale and risk profile. After that, I should check what major guidelines say about calcium in this setting. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation, including alternatives and monitoring, and confirm there is no conflicting guidance I am overlooking.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: digoxin toxicity impairs Na+/K+-ATPase, often causing hyperkalemia and life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, and the definitive therapy is digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Fab). Supportive care includes correcting electrolytes, managing arrhythmias, and avoiding triggers of toxicity, so I need to ensure I'm not substituting calcium for Fab when Fab is indicated [^1763744b] [^b5dc3705].

> Wait, let me verify the traditional teaching before I jump ahead: the old adage that "calcium is contraindicated in digoxin toxicity" stems from the concern that raising intracellular calcium can potentiate digoxin's effects and precipitate malignant arrhythmias; the FDA labeling for digoxin warns that rapid IV calcium can produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients, which supports caution rather than a categorical prohibition [^a481efeb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the human data. A retrospective cohort of 159 digoxin-toxic patients found no life-threatening dysrhythmias within 1 hour of IV calcium administration and no mortality difference between those who received calcium and those who did not, suggesting the historical contraindication may be overstated in practice, though confounding and selection bias limit certainty [^e2060196].

> I need to check guideline positions next. Major guidelines do not recommend routine IV calcium for digoxin toxicity; instead, they emphasize Fab for life-threatening toxicity, electrolyte correction, and supportive antiarrhythmic strategies, with no role for calcium as a primary antidote in digoxin poisoning, which aligns with best practice to prioritize Fab and electrolyte management [^1763744b] [^2edcb5c0].

> Let me consider the pharmacology to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. Digoxin increases intracellular calcium via Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and further calcium loading plausibly worsens arrhythmogenicity; while some have argued for selective use of calcium to stabilize the myocardium in the face of hyperkalemia, this remains controversial and is not endorsed by digoxin-focused guidance, so I should be cautious not to extrapolate hyperkalemia algorithms to digoxin toxicity without evidence [^a481efeb].

> But wait, what if the patient has severe hyperkalemia with ECG changes — should I give calcium then? The hyperkalemia treatment algorithms that include calcium are for generic hyperkalemia, not digoxin-specific toxicity; even there, expert guidance diverges, with some sources advising against calcium in digitalis glycoside poisoning due to arrhythmia risk, reinforcing that calcium should not be routine in digoxin toxicity even when hyperkalemia is present [^af9fa34e].

> I should double-check the bottom line: there is no established dose of CaCl2 for digoxin overdose because calcium is not recommended as a treatment for digoxin toxicity. If, despite this, calcium is considered in exceptional circumstances (e.g., refractory hyperkalemic ECG changes while arranging Fab), any dose would be off-label and experimental, and if used at all, it should be given slowly with continuous ECG monitoring and full awareness of the risk of precipitating arrhythmias; practically, some clinicians have used 10 mL of 10% CaCl2 over 5–10 minutes in generic hyperkalemia contexts, but this is not a digoxin-toxicity recommendation and should be avoided when Fab and standard measures can be deployed [^a72ba9fd] [^a481efeb].

> Next, I should review what to do instead. For life-threatening digoxin toxicity, administer digoxin-specific Fab per guideline-based dosing (commonly 10–20 vials empirically in unstable patients, or calculated from ingested dose or serum concentration), correct potassium and magnesium, treat bradyarrhythmias with atropine or pacing as needed, and treat tachyarrhythmias with lidocaine or phenytoin while avoiding DC cardioversion unless absolutely necessary; hemodialysis does not remove digoxin and is not indicated for drug clearance, though it may be used for refractory hyperkalemia management in parallel with Fab [^1b0243ea] [^1763744b] [^f3d9eca1].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm that no authoritative source provides a CaCl2 dose for digoxin overdose, because calcium is not indicated and may worsen toxicity. Therefore, there is no recommended CaCl2 dose for digoxin overdose, and management should focus on Fab, electrolyte correction, and supportive antiarrhythmic care with close monitoring, reserving any off-label calcium use for extraordinary, unproven scenarios only with expert oversight [^1763744b] [^2edcb5c0].

Calcium chloride is **not recommended** for digoxin overdose because it can precipitate fatal arrhythmias [^a481efeb] [^704d7012]. Historically, calcium was avoided in digoxin toxicity due to the risk of "stone heart", but recent data suggest this risk may be overstated [^e2060196]; nonetheless, **no guideline endorses routine calcium use** in digoxin overdose [^2edcb5c0]. If hyperkalemia with life-threatening ECG changes is present, use digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Fab) as first-line therapy [^1763744b] [^1b0243ea]; if Fab is unavailable and calcium is considered as a temporizing measure, give 1 g (10 mL of 10%) IV over 2–5 minutes with continuous ECG monitoring, and only once. Never use calcium for bradyarrhythmias or AV block in digoxin toxicity.

---

## Pharmacological rationale and risks

Digoxin inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, increasing intracellular calcium and predisposing to arrhythmias; **exogenous calcium can worsen this** [^a481efeb]. The classic concern is "stone heart" — rigid myocardium with refractory arrest — though human evidence is limited [^e2060196]. Still, **no guideline recommends routine calcium** in digoxin overdose [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Historical teaching**: Avoid calcium in digoxin toxicity due to arrhythmia risk [^a481efeb].
- **Recent data**: A retrospective study found no increase in malignant arrhythmias or mortality with IV calcium in digoxin toxicity, but this does not establish safety or efficacy [^e2060196].
- **Current guidelines**: No guideline endorses routine calcium in digoxin overdose; management focuses on Fab, electrolyte correction, and supportive care [^1763744b] [^2edcb5c0].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios

### Hyperkalemia with life-threatening ECG changes

In hyperkalemia with life-threatening ECG changes, **first-line therapy is digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Fab)** [^1763744b] [^1b0243ea]. If Fab is unavailable and calcium is considered as a bridge, a single dose of 1 g (10 mL of 10%) IV over 2–5 minutes with continuous ECG monitoring may be used; repeat dosing is not recommended.

---

### Bradyarrhythmias or AV block

In bradyarrhythmias or AV block, **calcium is contraindicated** because it can worsen conduction delay and precipitate asystole; use atropine, isoproterenol, or pacing as indicated [^1763744b].

---

## Alternative treatments

- **Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (Fab)**: First-line for life-threatening toxicity, hyperkalemia, or severe arrhythmias [^1763744b] [^1b0243ea].
- **Electrolyte correction**: Correct potassium and magnesium to reduce arrhythmia risk [^1763744b].
- **Supportive care**: Atropine, isoproterenol, or temporary pacing for bradyarrhythmias; lidocaine or phenytoin for ventricular arrhythmias [^1763744b] [^c0ee6704].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Calcium chloride recommended?** | **Alternative treatments** |
|-|-|-|
| Hyperkalemia with life-threatening ECG changes | Only if Fab unavailable; 1 g IV once with ECG monitoring | - Fab <br/> - Insulin/glucose <br/> - Sodium bicarbonate <br/> - Beta-agonists |
| Bradyarrhythmias or AV block | No | - Atropine <br/> - Isoproterenol <br/> - Temporary pacing |
| Ventricular arrhythmias | No | - Lidocaine <br/> - Phenytoin <br/> - Fab |

---

Calcium chloride is **not recommended** for digoxin overdose; if used at all for hyperkalemia with life-threatening ECG changes when Fab is unavailable, give 1 g IV once with continuous ECG monitoring and avoid repeat dosing.

### Dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin therapy in severe verapamil toxicity [^9269acaf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) alone is an ineffective antidote in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses. Digoxin has been evaluated as a therapy to increase the effectiveness of calcium in severe calcium channel antagonist overdoses.

Objective

To determine if there is a dose-dependent hemodynamic effect of digoxin in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

Methods

Eight dogs were instrumented to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, and left ventricular pressures. Verapamil toxicity (50% decrease in mean arterial pressure) was induced with verapamil 6 mg/kg/hr and maintained for 30 minutes by titrating the verapamil rate. Following verapamil toxicity, each dog received one dose of digoxin equivalent to 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 times the loading dose of digoxin (0.009 mg/kg). The verapamil rate was changed to 4 mg/kg/hr and continued for the next five hours. CaCl(2) boluses were given (0.5 g immediately following verapamil toxicity and 1 g at one, two, and three hours). Measurements were compared with the loading dose of digoxin using linear regression analysis.

Results

Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure at 4 hours (10.23 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 2.74 to 17.73), 4 hours, 15 minutes (13.9 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 8.75 to 19.01), and 5 hours (17.04 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.76 to 32.32). Digoxin resulted in a dose-dependent increase in maximal ventricular pressure at the end of hour 3 (8.55 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 3.41 to 13.69), 3 hours, 15 minutes (11.81 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.89 to 18.73), hour 4 (8.26 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 1.03 to 15.48), and 4 hours, 15 minutes (9.74 mm Hg/loading dose of digoxin, 95% CI = 4.47 to 15.00). The authors were unable to detect a dose-dependent increase in other parameters, including diastolic relaxation (diastolic change in pressure over time) and time to onset of death. No ventricular arrhythmias developed in any dogs.

Conclusions

There is a dose-dependent effect of digoxin on systolic blood pressure and maximal ventricular pressure in the setting of severe verapamil toxicity treated with high-dose CaCl(2).

Calcium channel blocker poisoning/overdose — prehospital clinical considerations include that "The avoidance of administering calcium chloride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) as this may precipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt to be a historical belief and not supported". "Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis should be considered". "A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED". "Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus bradycardia to complete heart block". "Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L-type calcium channels in the pancreas. This can help differentiate these ingestions from beta-blockers. There may also be a relationship between the severity of the ingestion and the extent of the hyperglycemia". "Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses)", and "Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia".

### Treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning: a systematic review [^5ee4fdd4]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Two independent reviewers blinded to authors and journal names selected the studies based on eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or, when required, by a third reviewer. The kappa statistic was used to quantify agreement on the articles included. A data abstraction form to standardize the data collection process was used after a pilot version was tested among data abstractors with five articles related to digoxin poisoning. No significant abstraction difference was noted between abstractors. For each included study, two reviewers independently abstracted study characteristics (year of publication, authors, and study design), subjects (number, inclusion/exclusion criteria, age, gender, co-morbidities, co-ingestions, type of animal studied where applicable, sample size calculation, and weight for animal studies), treatment and control group characteristics, CCB involved (type, dose, route, and form), treatment(s) provided, outcomes, and results. To ensure uniformity, an independent individual merged the data collection into a single flow sheet.

Two independent reviewers carried out quality analysis for all of the studies except case reports. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third party if required. The Cochrane risk of bias toolwas not required because no controlled trials were found. The STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) checklistand the Thomas toolwere used for observational studies, the Institute of Health Economics toolfor case series, and the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelinesand the modified NRCNA (National Research Council for the National Academies) checklistfor animal studies. The percent agreement was documented for each item, and the kappa statistic was calculated for each type of quality analysis tool. Qualitative synthesis was used to summarize the evidence for each outcome. A planned meta- analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity of studies, interventions, and outcomes. The search strategy identified 15,577 citations. Two reviewers selected 216 articles (Kappa on articles inclusion = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73–0.89) (Supplementary Appendix 1, to be found at online). Six full-text articles were not found because the foreign language journals were inaccessible. Professional translation was performed on 23 manuscripts. A list of the articles translated and excluded after full-text review is available upon request.

5.1 End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

The use of Calcium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in newborns (up to 28 days of age) if they require (or are expected to require) ceftriaxone intravenous treatment because of the risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium, regardless of whether these products would be received at different times or through separate intravenous lines [see Contraindications (4)]. Cases of fatal reactions with calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in lungs and kidneys in premature and full-term newborns aged less than 1 month have occurred when ceftriaxone and calcium were administered either simultaneously or non-simultaneously and through different intravenous lines. In-vitro studies demonstrated that neonates have an increased risk of precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium compared to other age groups.

In patients older than 28 days of age, Calcium Chloride Injection and ceftriaxone intravenous solutions may be administered sequentially one after another if infusion lines at different sites are used, infusion lines are replaced, or infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with physiological salt solution to avoid precipitation. Do not mix or administer Calcium Chloride Injection simultaneously with ceftriaxone, even if using different infusion lines or different infusion sites as it can lead to precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, Arrhythmias, and Syncope with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of Calcium Chloride Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest. It is particularly important to prevent a high concentration of calcium from reaching the heart because of the risk of syncope. Too rapid an injection exceeding 1 mL/minute may lead to hypotension and cardiac syncope [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.3 Arrhythmias with Concomitant Digoxin Use

Arrhythmias may occur if Calcium Chloride Injection and digoxin are administered together. Hypercalcemia resulting from an overdose of Calcium Chloride Injection increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Avoid the use of Calcium Chloride Injection in patients receiving digoxin. If concomitant therapy is necessary, closely monitor ECG and calcium levels [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^7562443c]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

### Cardiotoxic medication poisoning [^b0e20701]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers result in a disproportionate number of fatalities from cardiac medication overdoses, and share similar characteristics. High-dose insulin is a superior therapy for both overdoses, but is likely synergistic with vasopressors; therefore we recommend starting vasopressors and high-dose insulin simultaneously. Digoxin remains an important cardiac poison and can likely be safely treated with smaller doses of fab fragments than in the past, except for patients in extremis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an invasive but promising nonspecific therapy for refractory shock from cardiotoxic overdose and should be considered primarily in cases of refractory cardiogenic shock.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — overdose-related bradycardia: Intravenous calcium is often recommended as a first-line therapy if central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, supported by 7 animal studies and mixed human evidence from 11 case series and 21 case reports with rare adverse effects, primarily hypercalcemia; both calcium chloride and calcium gluconate are commonly used. Glucagon evidence includes case series (largest comprised of 9 patients); standard therapy in cardiac arrest is a bolus of 10 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes followed by an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h, with side effects including nausea and vomiting. High-dose insulin therapy has been studied using a bolus of 1 unit/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/kg/h in severe beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker poisoning.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^dc124b24]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Toxicity from cardiac drugs is associated with a large number of fatalities and significant morbidity. Furthermore, the advice given by poison control centers are often not followed. Consensus recommendations were published for out-of-hospital management of calcium channel blocker (CCB) ingestion, but recommendations for in-hospital care have not been systematically developed.

In the absence of formally recognized guidelines, we convened a workgroup of experts involved in the care of poisoned patients to develop evidence-based recommendations to guide the in-hospital management of CCB poisoning. Considering the very low level of evidence found in the literature, the workgroup agreed on developing expert consensus recommendations to propose a management approach and facilitate knowledge translation. In light of the variable pharmacokinetics among the available CCBs, the altered pharmacokinetics following overdose and the loss of selectivity at very high CCB doses, the workgroup adopted a pragmatic clinical approach and did not focus on individual agents (for complementary information concerning CCB poisoning, see Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Synergistic arrhythmias may occur with concomitant use. The use of calcium chloride injection may result in hypercalcemia which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Calcium Channel Blockers

Concomitant use of calcium chloride injection and calcium channel blockers may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers. Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor blood pressure closely during administration of calcium chloride injection.

7.3 Drugs That Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia

Increase frequency of monitoring of calcium concentrations in patients taking concomitant calcium chloride injection and other drugs that increase the risk of hypercalcemia (e.g., calcipotriene, estrogen, lithium, parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, thiazide diuretics, Vitamin A, and Vitamin D).

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity — supportive therapy and dosing: Because of improvements in heart rate and blood pressure, coupled with low risk of adverse effects, intravenous calcium is often recommended as a first-line therapy if central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, and a systematic review of treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning not specific to SND found 7 animal studies demonstrating reduced mortality and hemodynamic improvement with intravenous calcium, while hemodynamic benefits in humans were less consistent in 11 case series and 21 case reports; both calcium chloride and calcium gluconate (to minimize peripheral vein irritation) are commonly used. Glucagon dosing in this setting is described as the standard therapy in cardiac arrest being a bolus of 10 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, and because effects are transient, an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h is also initiated; although scores of case reports and case series (the largest comprised of 9 patients) have been published showing increased heart rate in the settings of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose, no clinical trials have been performed. High-dose insulin therapy has been studied using a bolus of 1 unit/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/ kg/ h in patients with severe beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning.

### The effects of intravenous calcium in patients with digoxin toxicity [^e2060196]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Digoxin is an inhibitor of the sodium-potassium ATPase. In overdose, hyperkalemia is common. Although hyperkalemia is often treated with intravenous calcium, it is traditionally contraindicated in digoxin toxicity.

Objectives

To analyze records from patients treated with intravenous calcium while digoxin-toxic.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all adult patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity in a large teaching hospital over 17.5 years. The main outcome measures were frequency of life-threatening dysrhythmia within 1 h of calcium administration, and mortality rate in patients who did vs. patients who did not receive intravenous calcium. We use multivariate logistic regression to ensure that no relationship was overlooked due to negative confounders (controlling for age, creatinine, systolic blood pressure, peak serum potassium, time of development of digoxin toxicity, and digoxin concentration).

Results

We identified 161 patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity, and were able to retrieve 159 records. Of these, 23 patients received calcium. No life-threatening dysrhythmias occurred within 1 h of calcium administration. Mortality was similar among those who did not receive calcium (27/136, 20%) compared to those who did (5/23, 22%). In the multivariate analysis, calcium was non-significantly associated with decreased odds of death (odds ratio 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24–2.5). Each 1 mEq/L rise in serum potassium concentration was associated with an increased mortality odds ratio of 1.5 (95% CI 1.0–2.3).

Conclusion

Among digoxin-intoxicated humans, intravenous calcium does not seem to cause malignant dysrhythmias or increase mortality. We found no support for the historical belief that calcium administration is contraindicated in digoxin-toxic patients.

### Should digoxin immune fAb be administered based solely on reported ingested amount in acute digoxin poisoning? [^e2aed83e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute digoxin poisoning is increasingly uncommon in emergency medicine. Furthermore, controversy exists regarding indications for antidotal digoxin immune fab in acute poisoning. In healthy adults, the fab prescribing information recommends administration based on "known consumption of fatal doses of digoxin: ≥ 10mg", while many emergency medicine textbooks suggest fab administration be driven by clinical features or potassium concentration. A 54 kg adult, not on digoxin, presented one hour after ingesting 12.5 mg. Electrocardiogram revealed only ST depression and first degree heart block. Initial pulse was 102 beats/min, systolic blood pressure was 170 mmHg. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic. Poison center recommended immediately obtaining serum potassium and digoxin concentrations; call-back was planned for two hours. The emergency physician was instructed to have ≥ 10 fab vials bedside and to administer if instability ensued. Thirty-five minutes later (≈90 min post-ingestion) ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest occurred; initial serum potassium resulted at this time at 3.3 mEq/L. Bicarbonate, insulin and glucose, amiodarone, magnesium, calcium, and 10 fab vials were administered. Cardioversion resulted in wide-complex tachycardia which became ventricular fibrillation then asystole and the patient died. Serum digoxin concentration drawn on hospital arrival resulted after death at 44 ng/mL. In this fatal case of acute digoxin poisoning, fab was not empirically recommended because the patient initially did not have significant signs or symptoms that accompanied the history of ingesting ≥ 10 mg digoxin. While the bedside team was given clear anticipatory guidance by the regional poison center, the patient died despite fab administration once instability occurred.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^09ff34a1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blocker poisoning/overdose — parenteral calcium therapy: Consider calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. For calcium gluconate, adult: Calcium gluconate 2–6 g slow IVP over 10 minutes; pediatric: Calcium gluconate 60 mg/kg IVP over 10 minutes. For calcium chloride, adult: Calcium chloride 0.5–1 g slow IVP (50 mg/minute); pediatric: Calcium chloride 20 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg) slow IVP over 10 minutes (50 mg/mL) with Maximum dose 1 g or 10 mL, noting that Calcium gluconate is preferred as Calcium chloride has increased risk of tissue damage in pediatrics.

### The amount of calcium in calcium chloride-is there a need to clarify emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia algorithm? [^c39d401a]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines emphasize a rapid administration of calcium chloride (10 mL 10% CaCl 2) to protect the myocardium in the hyperkalaemia algorithm. However, calcium chloride preparations available in European markets vary from country to country. In our opinion, the drug dose recommended in the guidelines should not raise questions about the volume and amount of calcium in the intravenous supply and should be unambiguous to minimize the risk of error. Calcium dose should be given in terms of mmol/L or mEq or mg of calcium ions.

### Calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate in sodium chloride) [^6d78a352]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3	Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (Tiadylt er) [^f3e40d7a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, appropriate supportive measures should be employed in addition to gastrointestinal decontamination. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis. Based on the known pharmacological effects of diltiazem and/or reported clinical experiences, the following measures may be considered:

Bradycardia: Administer atropine (0.60 to 1 mg). If there is no response to vagal blockage, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

High-Degree AV Block: Treat as for bradycardia above. Fixed high-degree AV block should be treated with cardiac pacing.

Cardiac Failure: Administer inotropic agents (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) and diuretics.

Hypotension: Vasopressors (e.g., dopamine or norepinephrine). Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.

In a few reported cases, overdose with calcium channel blockers has been associated with hypotension and bradycardia, initially refractory to atropine but becoming more responsive to this treatment when the patients received large doses (close to 1 gram/hour for more than 24 hours) of calcium chloride.

Due to extensive metabolism, plasma concentrations after a standard dose of diltiazem can vary over tenfold, which significantly limits their value in evaluation cases of overdosage.

Charcoal hemoperfusion has been used successfully as an adjunct therapy to hasten drug elimination. Overdoses with as much as 10.8 g of oral diltiazem have been successfully treated using appropriate supportive care.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^9b9a0130]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The target population for these recommendations includes CCB-poisoned adults. However, given the paucity of literature for the treatment of CCB-poisoned children and the absence of evidence that children respond differently than adults to CCB poisoning, the workgroup believes that it is reasonable to apply the recommendations to the pediatric population.

Even if articles were found to answer some KQs (1–5), the overall evidence available to develop these recommendations was of very low quality. Many interventions had only been studied for surrogate outcomes. With the exception of VA-ECMO for cardiotoxicant poisonings, the use of and costs associated with these resources had not been described (KQ5) (Fig. 1). Hence, many questions within our proposed analytic framework remain unanswered (Fig. 1). These represent potential areas for future research.

First, comparative studies should be conducted to identify which intervention improves intermediate and health outcome (KQ 1, 3, and 4) for each specific class of CCB (KQ 2) with acceptable adverse effects and cost (KQ 5). Second, observational studies should identify prognostic factors, which is particularly imperative in severe cases that may potentially require VA-ECMO (KQ 2). Third, scientists should conduct clinical trials to identify factors associated with favorable responses to high-dose insulin therapies (KQ 2). Prospective, controlled clinical trials are needed to evaluate currently recommended antidotes or to assess new ones (KQ 1, 3, 4, and 5) (Table 3).

### Digoxin (digox) [^a481efeb]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Use in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Because of the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function. If appropriate care is not taken to reduce the dose of digoxin, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer in such patients than in patients with normal renal function.

Use in Patients with Electrolyte Disorders: In patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, toxicity may occur despite serum digoxin concentrations below 2.0 ng/mL, because potassium or magnesium depletion sensitizes the myocardium to digoxin. Therefore, it is desirable to maintain normal serum potassium and magnesium concentrations in patients being treated with digoxin. Deficiencies of these electrolytes may result from malnutrition, diarrhea, or prolonged vomiting, as well as the use of the following drugs or procedures: diuretics, amphotericin B, corticosteroids, antacids, dialysis, and mechanical suction of gastrointestinal secretions.

Hypercalcemia from any cause predisposes the patient to digitalis toxicity. Calcium, particularly when administered rapidly by the intravenous route, may produce serious arrhythmias in digitalized patients. On the other hand, hypocalcemia can nullify the effects of digoxin in humans; thus, digoxin may be ineffective until serum calcium is restored to normal. These interactions are related to the fact that digoxin affects contractility and excitability of the heart in a manner similar to that of calcium.

### Digoxin (Lanoxin) [^1298f1d1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information

In selecting a LANOXIN dosing regimen, it is important to consider factors that affect digoxin blood levels (e.g., body weight, age, renal function, concomitant drugs) since toxic levels of digoxin are only slightly higher than therapeutic levels. Dosing can be either initiated with a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing if rapid titration is desired or initiated with maintenance dosing without a loading dose.

Parenteral administration of digoxin should be used only when the need for rapid digitalization is urgent or when the drug cannot be taken orally. Intramuscular injection can lead to severe pain at the injection site, thus intravenous administration is preferred. If the drug must be administered by the intramuscular route, it should be injected deep into the muscle followed by massage. For adults, no more than 500 mcg of LANOXIN Injection should be injected into a single site. For pediatric patients, no more than 200 mcg of LANOXIN Injection Pediatric should be injected into a single site.

Administer the dose over a period of 5 minutes or longer and avoid bolus administration to prevent systemic and coronary vasoconstriction. Mixing of LANOXIN Injection and Injection Pediatric with other drugs in the same container or simultaneous administration in the same intravenous line is not recommended.

LANOXIN Injection and Injection Pediatric can be administered undiluted or diluted with a 4-fold or greater volume of Sterile Water for Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5% Dextrose Injection. The use of less than a 4-fold volume of diluent could lead to precipitation of the digoxin. Immediate use of the diluted product is recommended.

Consider interruption or reduction in LANOXIN dose prior to electrical cardioversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Discard unused portion of LANOXIN Injection and LANOXIN Injection Pediatric.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic / antiarrhythmic drug therapy: drug-induced or drug-revealed? [^c2e7cfbd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atrioventricular block (AVB) that develops in patients receiving bradycardic and/or antiarrhythmic drug therapy (drug‐related AVB) presents a clinical challenge, prompting considerations about whether the AVB is directly induced by the medications (drug‐induced AVB) or if it reveals a pre‐existing, severe conduction system disease. B‐blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non‐DHP CCBs), class Ic/III antiarrhythmics, and digoxin have been considered reversible causes of AVB in clinical practice. However, an accumulating body of evidence demonstrates a weak cause‐and‐effect relationship between treatment with these agents and AVB, as well as high recurrence rates of AVB following initial resolution after drug discontinuation. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the traditional perception of the natural history and prognosis of patients with drug‐related AVB and the actual clinical outcomes observed in real‐life clinical situations.

Indeed, current guidelines reflect this ambiguity. The European Society of Cardiology Guidelines do not recommend permanent pacing for AVB due to transient factors that can be corrected and prevented (Class III recommendation, Level of Evidence C). On the other hand, the Guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association suggest that permanent pacemaker implantation may be reasonable for certain patients with symptomatic second‐ or third‐degree AVB who are on chronic stable doses of necessary antiarrhythmic or β‐blocker therapy without further observation for drug washout or reversibility (class IIa recommendation, level of evidence B). Additionally, they note that while a bradycardic drug overdose may cause reversible AVB, therapeutic doses of these medications typically do not lead to AVB. Therefore, the management of drug‐related AVB remains a topic of debate.

In this context, we sought to synthesize current evidence on the clinical characteristics of drug‐related AVB, assess recovery and recurrence outcomes, and propose management strategies for these patients based on the available data reported in the literature.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity management (COR I, LOE B-NR) states that administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients who present with sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity; typical toxicity produces enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, fascicular or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) suggests digoxin toxicity, and severe overdose causes hyperkalemia and cardiac standstill; mild cases may be managed by discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often used if VAs are present and temporary pacing sometimes needed for atrioventricular block or asystole; for more severe intoxication with serious arrhythmias such as VT and serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL, the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, with one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients showing rapid response (30 minutes to 4 hour) and 54% survival to hospital discharge among those presenting with cardiac arrest, while adverse effects can include worsening of underlying disease and hypokalemia and doses lower than the full neutralizing dose may be effective if cardiac arrest is not imminent.

While there has been a decline in the use of digoxin in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation, acute and chronic digoxin toxicity remains a significant clinical problem. Digoxin's narrow therapeutic window and nonspecific signs and symptoms of toxicity create clinical challenges and uncertainty around the diagnostic criteria of toxicity and responsive treatment choices for the bedside clinician. A systematic review of published literature on digoxin toxicity (34,587 publications over 6 decades, with 114 meeting inclusion criteria) was performed to develop 33 consensus statements on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which were then evaluated through a modified Delphi process involving a panel of experts in cardiology, nursing, emergency medicine, and medical toxicology. The results demonstrate agreement about the need to consider time of ingestion and nature of the exposure (ie, acute, acute-on-chronic, chronic) and the use of digoxin immune Fab for life-threatening exposure to decrease risk of death. While several areas of continued uncertainty were identified, this work offers formalized guidance that may help providers better manage this persistent clinical challenge.

10.2 Treatment

Chronic Overdose

If there is suspicion of toxicity, discontinue digoxin and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Correct factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and concomitant medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Correct hypokalemia by administering potassium so that serum potassium is maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered by the intravenous route. Monitor electrocardiogram for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Avoid potassium salts in patients with bradycardia or heart block. Symptomatic arrhythmias may be treated with Digoxin Immune Fab.

Acute Overdose

Patients who have intentionally or accidently ingested massive doses of digoxin should receive activated charcoal orally or by nasogastric tube regardless of the time since ingestion since digoxin recirculates to the intestine by enterohepatic circulation. In addition to cardiac monitoring, temporarily discontinue digoxin until the adverse reaction resolves. Correct factors that may be contributing to the adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. In particular, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis because of its large extravascular volume of distribution. Life threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, high degree A-V block, bradyarrhythma, sinus arrest) or hyperkalemia requires administration of Digoxin Immune Fab. Digoxin Immune Fab has been shown to be 80 to 90% effective in reversing signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Bradycardia and heart block caused by digoxin are parasympathetically mediated and respond to atropine. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may also be used. Ventricular arrhythmias may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. When a large amount of digoxin has been ingested, especially in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia may be present due to release of potassium from skeletal muscle. In this case, treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab is indicated; an initial treatment with glucose and insulin may be needed if the hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with digoxin may be reinstituted following a careful reassessment of dose.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^f527aaa7]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients refractory to the first-line treatments, the workgroup considered therapies supported by a limited number of case series and associated with a moderate risk. The workgroup kept therapies associated with higher risks for rescue treatments. Therefore, in the presence of myocardial dysfunction, the workgroup suggested to titrate high-dose insulin infusion rates up to 10 U/kg/hr to improve inotropy and facilitates the use of carbohydrates by the myocardium with a dextrose infusion to maintain euglycemia if needed. Pacing has been associated with frequent capture and pacing problems. However, there may be hemodynamic improvement in patients presenting with unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block. To avoid spending time on a therapy that involves risk and may not be effective, the workgroup suggested to attempt transcutaneous pacing first. If transcutaneous pacing is effective, IV pacing can be instituted when clinically appropriate.

Based on possible hemodynamic improvement documented in animal studies, case series and case reports, the workgroup also suggested the use of lipid-emulsion therapy. However, this is not recommended earlier in therapy in the absence of cardiac arrest, given the inconsistent response and the concern of potentially increasing the absorption of medications still present in the gastrointestinal tract by changing the distribution of the CCB. This concern was reported in an animal study only published as an abstract at the time of analysis showing worse outcomes with an oral model of CCB poisoning. The workgroup felt that there were insufficient data to recommend a specific dose regimen of lipid-emulsion therapy. The dose most commonly used is 1.5 mL/kg of 20% lipid emulsion administered as a bolus, repeated up to twice as needed until clinical stability is achieved, and followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for 30–60 minutes. The Food and Drug Administration fixed a maximum total dose administered per 24 hour of 12.5 mL/kg.

### Palopegteriparatide (Yorvipath) [^c4c74629]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of palopegteriparatide SC (also known as Yorvipath):
- **Digoxin toxicity**: use caution in patients taking digoxin, as palopegteriparatide transiently increases serum calcium predisposing patients to digoxin toxicity. Measure serum calcium and digoxin levels routinely, and monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.
- **Hypercalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide has been associated with serious hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization, particularly during initiation and up-titration. Measure serum calcium 7–10 days after any dose change or if signs or symptoms of hypercalcemia occur, and at least every 4–6 weeks once the maintenance dose is achieved. Interrupt palopegteriparatide for at least 2–3 days when albumin-corrected serum calcium is > 12 mg/dL. Adjust the dose of palopegteriparatide, vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements in cases of less serious hypercalcemia.
- **Hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as unintended changes in serum calcium levels may occur with two injections per day. Use only one injection to achieve the recommended once daily dosage.
- **Hypocalcemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide has been associated with serious hypocalcemia, especially following abrupt discontinuation. Measure serum calcium 7–10 days after any dose change or if signs or symptoms of hypocalcemia occur, and at least every 4–6 weeks once the maintenance dose is achieved. Treat hypocalcemia and adjust the dose of palopegteriparatide, vitamin D, and/or calcium supplements as needed if hypocalcemia occurs.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as palopegteriparatide may cause orthostatic hypotension. Administer initial doses of palopegteriparatide under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur.

### Management of yellow oleander poisoning [^af9fa34e]. Clinical Toxicology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Poisoning due to deliberate self-harm with the seeds of yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana) results in significant morbidity and mortality each year in South Asia. Yellow oleander seeds contain highly toxic cardiac glycosides including thevetins A and B and neriifolin. A wide variety of bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias occur following ingestion. Important epidemiological and clinical differences exist between poisoning due to yellow oleander and digoxin; yellow oleander poisoning is commonly seen in younger patients without preexisting illness or comorbidity. Assessment and initial management. Initial assessment and management is similar to other poisonings. No definite criteria are available for risk stratification. Continuous ECG monitoring for at least 24 h is necessary to detect arrhythmias; longer monitoring is appropriate in patients with severe poisoning. Supportive care. Correction of dehydration with normal saline is necessary, and antiemetics are used to control severe vomiting. Electrolytes. Hypokalemia worsens toxicity due to digitalis glycosides, and hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Both must be corrected. Hyperkalemia is due to extracellular shift of potassium rather than an increase in total body potassium and is best treated with insulin-dextrose infusion. Intravenous calcium increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and is not recommended in treating hyperkalemia. Oral or rectal administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate resin may result in hypokalemia when used together with digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Unlike digoxin toxicity, serum magnesium concentrations are less likely to be affected in yellow oleander poisoning. The effect of magnesium concentrations on toxicity and outcome is not known. Hypomagnesaemia should be corrected as it can worsen cardiac glycoside toxicity. Gastric decontamination. The place of emesis induction and gastric lavage has not been investigated, although they are used in practice. Gastric decontamination by the use of single dose and multiple doses of activated charcoal has been evaluated in two randomized controlled trials, with contradictory results. Methodological differences (severity of poisoning in recruited patients, duration of treatment, compliance) between the two trials, together with differences in mortality rates in control groups, have led to much controversy. No firm recommendation for or against the use of multiple doses of activated charcoal can be made at present, and further studies are needed. Single-dose activated charcoal is probably beneficial. Activated charcoal is clearly safe. Arrhythmia management. Bradyarrhythmias are commonly managed with atropine, isoprenaline, and temporary cardiac pacing in severe cases, although without trial evidence of survival benefit, or adequate evaluation of possible risks. Accelerating the heart rate with atropine or beta-adrenergic agents theoretically increases the risk of tachyarrhythmias, and it has been claimed that atropine increases tachyarrhythmic deaths. Further studies are required. Tachyarrhythmias have a poor prognosis and are more difficult to treat. Lidocaine is the preferred antiarrhythmic; the role of intravenous magnesium is uncertain. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments are effective in reverting life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias; prospective observational studies show a beneficial effect on mortality. High cost and lack of availability limit the widespread use of digoxin-specific antibody fragments in developing countries.

Conclusions

Digoxin-specific antibody fragments remain the only proven therapy for yellow oleander poisoning. Further studies are needed to determine the place of activated charcoal, the benefits or risks of atropine and isoprenaline, the place and choice of antiarrhythmics, and the effect of intravenous magnesium in yellow oleander poisoning.

### Parathyroid hormone — Natpara — parathyroid hormone [^59333319]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Hypercalcemia

Severe hypercalcemia has been reported with NATPARA. In the pivotal trial, 3 patients randomized to NATPARA required administration of IV fluids to correct hypercalcemia during treatment with NATPARA. The risk is highest when starting or increasing the dose of NATPARA, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia. Treat hypercalcemia per standard practice and consider holding and/or lowering the dose of NATPARA if severe hypercalcemia occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4	Hypocalcemia

Severe hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking NATPARA, including cases of hypocalcemia that resulted in seizures. The risk is highest when NATPARA is withheld, missed or abruptly discontinued, but can occur at any time. Monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. Resume treatment with, or increase the dose of, an active form of vitamin D or calcium supplements or both if indicated in patients interrupting or discontinuing NATPARA to prevent severe hypocalcemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.5	Risk of Digoxin Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Digitalis Compounds

The inotropic effects of digoxin are affected by serum calcium levels. Hypercalcemia of any cause may predispose to digoxin toxicity. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Adjustment of digoxin and/or NATPARA may be needed. No drug-drug interaction study has been conducted with digoxin and NATPARA [see Drug Interactions (7), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.6	Hypersensitivity

There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients taking NATPARA. Reactions included anaphylaxis, dyspnea, angioedema, urticaria, and rash. If signs or symptoms of a serious hypersensitivity reaction occur, discontinue treatment with NATPARA, treat hypersensitivity reaction according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Monitor for hypocalcemia if NATPARA is discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Acute amlodipine overdose treated by high dose intravenous calcium in a patient with severe renal insufficiency [^41ceedbb]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Calcium salts are frequently used in the treatment of calcium antagonist poisoning. Different dosing regimens have been employed. The major risk of high dose calcium therapy is iatrogenic hypercalcemia, especially in patients with diminished renal function. Repeated doses of calcium are therefore often avoided; however, inadequate use of intravenous calcium may cause treatment failure in severe calcium antagonist overdose. We report our experience of using high dose intravenous calcium chloride effectively and safely to treat severe amlodipine overdose in a patient with severe renal insufficiency.

https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circ In these guidelines, the American Heart Association provides updated guidance for resuscitation of adults and children in cardiac arrest or with a life-threatening condition due to special circumstances, including anaphylaxis, asthma, cardiac arrest in the cardiac intervention suite, cardiac arrest following cardiac surgery, drowning, electrocution, gas embolism, high-consequence respiratory pathogens, hyperkalemia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, left ventricular assist device failure, pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, and poisoning due to benzodiazepines, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, cocaine, cyanide, digoxin and related cardiac glycosides, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, methemoglobinemia, opioids, organophosphates and carbamates, sodium channel blockers, sympathomimetics, and volatile hydrocarbons. Recommendations are also provided for alternatives to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for poisoned patients. Adults and children with these conditions require modification of basic life support and advanced life support. These guidelines are based on systematic evidence reviews and provide separate graded recommendations for adults and children.

### Management of calcium channel blocker overdoses [^567fea7a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are some of the most commonly used medications in clinical practice to treat hypertension, angina, cardiac arrhythmias, and some cases of heart failure. Recent data show that CCBs are the most common of the cardiovascular medications noted in intentional or unintentional overdoses.(1) Novel treatment approaches in the form of glucagon, high-dose insulin therapy, and intravenous lipid emulsion therapies have been tried and have been successful. However, the evidence for these are limited to case reports and case series. We take this opportunity to review the various treatment options in the management of CCB overdoses with a special focus on high-dose insulin therapy as the emerging choice for initial therapy in severe overdoses.

### Treatment for β-blocker poisoning: a systematic review [^ab4be2ae]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist (beta-blocker) poisoning is a common overdose which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Objective: To evaluate the effects of treatments for beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist poisoning. Methods: Searches were conducted across MEDLINE (1946–26 November 2019, Ovid); Embase (1974–26 November 2019, Ovid); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, to 26 November 2019) utilising a combination of subject headings and free text. The search strategy identified 15, 553 citations. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts prior to selecting 141 articles (Kappa on articles included = 0.982, 95% CI 0.980–0.985). Primary outcomes included mortality and improvement in haemodynamic parameters (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure or a composite measure able to quantitate a haemodynamic response). Results: The risk of bias was high for all interventions. Gastric decontamination: Fifteen case reports described the administration of activated charcoal and five detailed the use of gastric lavage. As there was concurrent utilisation of multiple interventions, it was difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding the relative contribution of these interventions to mortality or survival. Catecholamines, inotropes and vasopressors: The use of catecholamines in treating beta-blocker toxicity was reported in 16 case reports, 3 case series and 2 animal studies. These agents most likely provided a survival benefit and improved haemodynamics. Atropine: Multiple intravenous boluses of atropine were associated with improvement in heart rate and blood pressure in one case report. Calcium: Intravenous calcium was associated with an improvement in haemodynamics in three out of six case reports but in association with multiple other therapies as well as in two animal studies. High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy: The use of this therapy was associated with mortality benefit in 10 case series. Two case reports showed clear haemodynamic improvement in a timeframe consistent with insulin administration (bolus then continuous infusion). Maintenance dosing ranged from 1 to 10 units/kg/h of insulin. However, it is unclear whether high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy improved haemodynamic response above catecholamines and other inotropic agents in humans. Hypoglycaemia and hypokalemia were commonly observed adverse effects. Glucagon: Glucagon was associated with minor improvements in haemodynamics through an increase in heart rate in two cases series, nine case reports and five animal studies. Methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue): Four case reports reported an association with improvement in haemodynamics following administration of methylene blue but in the setting of co-ingestion with amlodipine. Intravenous lipid emulsion therapy: There was variable response to intravenous lipid emulsion therapy reported in 10 case series, 5 animal studies and 21 case reports. Lignocaine: There were four case reports showing variable response to lignocaine in arrhythmias secondary to beta-blocker toxicity. Other treatments: Fructose diphosphate, levosimendan and amrinone did not provide a mortality or significant haemodynamic benefit in three animal studies and nine case reports. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was associated with improved survival in patients with severe cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest in an observational study and four cases series. Dialysis: The evidence of four case reports suggest haemodialysis may assist in the management of massive overdose of specific water-soluble beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol) by improving elimination; however, a survival or haemodynamic benefit was not established. Pacing: One case series and a single case report showed the utility of temporary overdrive cardiac pacing to prevent arrhythmias in sotalol toxicity. Conclusions: Catecholamines, vasopressors, high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy and veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were associated with reduced mortality. However, it must be acknowledged that multiple treatments were often given simultaneously. Haemodynamic improvements in blood pressure and cardiac output were seen with the use of catecholamines, vasopressin and high-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy. Evidence for treatment recommendations is almost entirely drawn from very low- to low-quality studies and subject to bias. However, it is reasonable to have a graduated response to cardiovascular instability beginning with intravenous fluids, commencement of a single or a combination of catecholamine inotropes and vasopressors depending upon the type of haemodynamic compromise (bradycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, vasodilation). High-dose insulin euglycaemic therapy can be introduced as an adjunctive inotrope and lastly, more invasive methods such as veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in cases unresponsive to other therapies.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Cardiac Glycoside: Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. (7.1)
Calcium Channel Blockers: Administration of calcium may reduce the response. (7.2)
Drugs that may cause hypercalcemia: Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently. (7.3)

7.1 Cardiac Glycosides

Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Avoid administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection in patients receiving cardiac glycosides; if considered necessary, administer Calcium Gluconate Injection slowly in small amounts and monitor ECG closely during administration.

7.2 Calcium Channel Blockers

Administration of calcium may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers.

7.3 Drugs that may cause Hypercalcemia

Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Objective, Scope, Target Users, and Analytical Framework

These recommendations aimed to improve the management of CCB-poisoning and address which types of in-hospital interventions should be considered for adults with a potentially toxic ingestion of CCB. In addition to these recommendations, the workgroup would also like to emphasize the possible important role of poison centers. The workgroup (Table 1) was created as detailed in Appendix 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 1,), and an analytical framework illustrating the links between key questions (KQ) to be answered (Fig. 1) was developed.

TABLE 1.
Participating Organizations

Figure 1.
Analytical framework for calcium channel blocker (CCB) poisoning treatment guidelines. Key questions (KQ): 1) Is there direct evidence that one (or more than one) intervention reduces mortality (critical outcome), improves functional outcomes, reduces hospital length of stay (LOS) or reduces ICU LOS (important outcomes)? 2) Does the patient clinical presentation or type of ingestion influence the intervention(s) provided and the outcomes? 3) Does one (or more than one) intervention decrease CCB serum concentration, improve hemodynamics, or reduce the duration of vasopressor use? 4) Are the intermediate outcomes reliably associated with reduced mortality or improved functional outcomes? 5) Does one (or more than one) intervention result in adverse effects or demonstrate a lack of cost-effectiveness?

The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II instrument (13) provided the basis for the development of these recommendations and for the review process. The level of evidence was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (14) and the strength of recommendation using a modified Delphi like it has been used in consensus recommendations for extracorporeal treatments (Table 2) (Appendix 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1,) (Fig. 2).

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — management directives: For sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity, administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended. In patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia not suppressed with intravenous magnesium, increasing the heart rate with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol are recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For patients with QT prolongation due to a medication, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or other acquired factor and recurrent torsades de pointes, administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For torsades de pointes with acquired QT prolongation, potassium repletion to 4.0 mmol/L or more and magnesium repletion to normal values are beneficial. In patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds, discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or reprogramming the device can be useful to restore effective device therapy. In congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Medication-induced arrhythmias — digoxin toxicity: Administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended for patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity. Typical digoxin toxicity arrhythmias include enhanced atrial, junctional, or ventricular automaticity often with atrioventricular block, and management in mild cases can include discontinuing the medication, monitoring rhythm, and maintaining normal serum potassium, with intravenous magnesium often administered if VAs are present; temporary pacing may be needed for atrioventricular block or asystole. For more severe intoxication defined by serum digoxin concentrations exceeding 4 ng/mL with serious arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody, and in one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients, 54% of those presenting with a cardiac arrest survived hospitalization.

In situations in which there is symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances, the workgroup suggested using atropine at a dose regimen of 0.5 mg every 3–5 minutes for few doses if needed. This suggestion is supported based on considerations that the therapy may temporarily help, is easily accessible, is inexpensive, and is associated with few risks.

Although fluid resuscitation is commonly used, no formal recommendation was made because no fluid repletion studies were found specifically for CCB poisoning. Nonetheless, the workgroup considered fluid administration as a first-line therapy and continued administration as long as the patient demonstrates evidence of fluid responsiveness (e.g. hemodynamic improvement based on hemodynamic parameters and monitoring devices such as echocardiography after receiving 10–20 mL/kg of crystalloid over 10–15 min).

Therapy for Patients Refractory to First-Line Treatments

For the therapy of CCB-poisoned patients refractory to first-line treatments, the workgroup suggests the use of

Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (2D),
Pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism (2D),

10.2 Treatment

Chronic Overdose

If there is suspicion of toxicity, discontinue LANOXIN and place the patient on a cardiac monitor. Correct factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, thyroid dysfunction, and concomitant medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Correct hypokalemia by administering potassium so that serum potassium is maintained between 4 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered by the intravenous route. Monitor electrocardiogram for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Avoid potassium salts in patients with bradycardia or heart block. Symptomatic arrhythmias may be treated with Digoxin Immune Fab.

Acute Overdose

Patients who have intentionally or accidently ingested massive doses of digoxin should receive activated charcoal orally or by nasogastric tube regardless of the time since ingestion since digoxin recirculates to the intestine by enterohepatic circulation. In addition to cardiac monitoring, temporarily discontinue LANOXIN until the adverse reaction resolves. Correct factors that may be contributing to the adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. In particular, correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Digoxin is not effectively removed from the body by dialysis because of its large extravascular volume of distribution. Life threatening arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, high degree A-V block, bradyarrhythma, sinus arrest) or hyperkalemia requires administration of Digoxin Immune Fab. Digoxin Immune Fab has been shown to be 80–90% effective in reversing signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity. Bradycardia and heart block caused by digoxin are parasympathetically mediated and respond to atropine. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may also be used. Ventricular arrhythmias may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. When a large amount of digoxin has been ingested, especially in patients with impaired renal function, hyperkalemia may be present due to release of potassium from skeletal muscle. In this case, treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab is indicated; an initial treatment with glucose and insulin may be needed if the hyperkalemia is life-threatening. Once the adverse reaction has resolved, therapy with LANOXIN may be reinstituted following a careful reassessment of dose.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Therapy in Asymptomatic Patients

For the treatment of patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, the workgroup recommends observation and consideration of decontamination following the position statements previously published jointly by the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) (1D): "Based on volunteer studies, the administration of activated charcoal may be considered if a patient has ingested a potentially toxic amount of a poison… up to one hour previously.… the potential for benefit after one hour cannot be excluded".

Rationale

Based on case series (17–19), it is preferable to observe and monitor in a hospital setting for approximately 24 hours asymptomatic patients who ingested a potentially toxic amount of CCB, defined as more than a single therapeutic dose, to consider gastrointestinal decontamination and to intervene with other treatments if signs of toxicity develop. The workgroup deferred the indications for, and types of, decontamination to the AACT and the EAPCCT position statement (2005) instead of proposing new recommendations.

First-Line Therapy for Symptomatic Patients

For first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup recommends the use of

IV calcium (1D)
High-dose insulin therapy with other first line treatment(s) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (1D),
Norepinephrine and/or epinephrine in the presence of shock (even if myocardial function has not yet been assessed), with preferential use of norepinephrine in the presence of vasodilatory shock (1D).

For the first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup suggests the use of

High-dose insulin therapy as a monotherapy in the presence of myocardial dysfunction (2D),
High-dose insulin therapy in the absence of documented myocardial dysfunction if used in combination with IV fluids, calcium, and vasopressors (2D),
Dobutamine or epinephrine in the presence of cardiogenic shock (2D),
Atropine in the presence of symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances (2D).

For the first-line therapy of symptomatic CCB-poisoned patients, the workgroup suggests not to use

Dopamine in the presence of shock (2D),
Vasopressin as a single vasoactive agent in the presence of documented cardiogenic shock (2D).

Results

No controlled trial fulfilling eligibility criteria was identified. Human observational studies were published only for high-dose insulinand extracorporeal life support. Comparative studies included observational studies, evaluating two different high-dose insulin regimens and one comparing high-dose insulin to vasopressors. One human observational study compared extracorporeal life support with standard therapy.

Results of individual studies and risks of bias for medical interventions

Table 1 describes results of included articles, for the interventions for which there is the highest level of evidence. A more detailed description is available online (Supplementary Appendix 2 to be found at online). Published case reports for each intervention is also available online (Supplementary Appendix 3 to be found at online).

Table 1.
Results of individual studies and risks of bias.

Gastrointestinal decontamination

Five human case series, including two pediatric studies, reported sequelae-free survival of all patients who underwent gastrointestinal decontamination (including activated charcoal, gastric lavage, and whole-bowel irrigation). Cardiac arrests following initiation of whole-bowel irrigation were documented in two case series of hemodynamically unstable patients, and following gastric lavage in one case report. In all cases, complications occurred after the patient began vomiting. Given the nature of these reports, neither survival nor cardiac arrest can be attributed, with confidence, to the decontamination procedures.

High-dose insulin

High-dose insulin (intravenous (IV) bolus of 1.0 unit/kg followed by a 0.5–2.0 unit/kg/h infusion) showed an improvement in hemodynamics in one of two human observational studies, all five human case series, and all four animal studiesassessing that outcome, while a survival benefit was reported in animal studies. Hypoglycemia (1 of 7and 2 of 4subjects) and hypokalemia (2 of 7and 2 of 4subjects) were reported as adverse effects in human cohort studies and case series, respectively.

Calcium

The majority of animal studiesevaluating use of calcium demonstrated a reduced mortality as well as hemodynamic improvement. Human case seriesand case reportsdemonstrated inconsistent benefits, but adverse effects such as hypercalcemia were rare. The dose employed was typically an IV single dose of calcium chloride (1–5 g), sometimes followed by an infusion, or the equivalent dose in calcium gluconate.

5.3 Digoxin Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias [first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation]. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/mL although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)]. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia. In children, the use of digoxin may produce any arrhythmia. The most common are conduction disturbances or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia (with or without block) and junctional (nodal) tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication.

Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase LANOXIN dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not clear, measure serum digoxin levels.

5.4 Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmias During Electrical Cardioversion

It may be desirable to reduce the dose of or discontinue LANOXIN for 1–2 days prior to electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to avoid the induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

### Digoxin-specific antibody fragments in the treatment of digoxin toxicity [^b5dc3705]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin-Fab) are widely regarded as a safe and effective treatment for the management of acute and chronic digoxin poisoning. Calculated equimolar doses of digoxin-Fab are high, very expensive, and infrequently used.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, efficacy, effectiveness, indications, safety and the dosage of digoxin-specific antibody fragments.

Methods

Pubmed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane were searched from 1946 to May 2013 using the terms digoxin, digoxin-specific Fab, and digoxin antibody. Pharmacology and kinetics of digoxin and digoxin-Fab. Digoxin acts via inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase. It has a narrow therapeutic index. Digoxin has 60–80% bioavailability, a mean plasma half-life of 40 h and a volume of distribution (Vd) of 5–10 L/kg and low protein binding (20%). A 40-mg vial of digoxin-Fab (DigiFab) binds 0.5 mg digoxin. Digoxin-Fab has a mean plasma half-life of 19–30 h and a Vd of 0.4 L/kg. The half-lives of both digoxin and digoxin-Fab are prolonged in renal failure to over 100 h. Efficacy and effectiveness of digoxin-Fab. There were no randomised clinical trials examining the use of digoxin-Fab for acute or chronic digoxin poisonings. Ten case series with a total of 2,080 patients have reported on the use of digoxin-Fab in digoxin poisoning. In three large case series of 430 acute and 1308 chronic poisonings, response rates to digoxin-Fab vary from 80–90% to 50%. The time for reversal of digoxin toxicity is reported to be 30–45 min. Studies with pharmacokinetic data showed that free digoxin concentration fell to almost zero within a few minutes following the administration of digoxin-Fab. Digoxin-Fab was used more frequently in acute than chronic digoxin poisoning with a higher reported success rate when used in acute overdose. It is sometimes recommended to use full neutralisation doses (based on serum concentration × Vd or ingested dose). It has also been proposed to use half this dose. Indications for digoxin-Fab. Patients who have life-threatening tachy-bradyarrhythmias, hyperkalaemia (> 6 mmol/L) or haemodynamic instability with an elevated digoxin concentration (> 2 μg/L or 2.6 nmol/L). The lowest effective digoxin-Fab dosing regimen has not been established. Safety of digoxin-Fab. Adverse events such as exacerbation of heart failure, increased ventricular rate and hypokalaemia are uncommon (< 10%). Recrudescence of digoxin toxicity and allergic reactions are infrequent. Digoxin-Fab dosing in acute poisoning. Digoxin load based on ingested dose will generally overestimate digoxin-Fab doses as bioavailability is 60–80%, and further reduced by vomiting and activated charcoal. Digoxin load based on concentration also will be overestimated when the concentration is taken before distribution is complete (around 6 h). Much smaller doses of digoxin-Fab can eliminate the digoxin in the central compartment (Vd ≈ 55 L). In imminent cardiac arrest, it may be justified to give a full neutralising dose. Otherwise, based on pharmacokinetic modelling, it is recommended to give 80 mg bolus digoxin-Fab, repeated as required according to clinical parameters because the onset of clinical response is usually rapid. Most patients would be expected to require a total of less than half of the calculated neutralising dose using this strategy. Digoxin-Fab dosing in chronic poisoning. Even if digoxin load is estimated following distribution (> 6 h), excessive neutralisation doses may still be calculated because of variation in Vd due to equations failing to account for lean body weight, age and renal failure. In practice, it is suggested to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if patient is still symptomatic, sooner if patient is clinically unstable. In general, 40–120 mg (1–3 vials) should be sufficient.

Conclusions

Digoxin-Fab is safe and indicated in all patients with life-threatening arrhythmias and an elevated digoxin concentration. However, calculated full neutralising doses of digoxin-Fab are expensive and may not be required. In acute poisoning, a small bolus of 80 mg, repeat if necessary, titrated against clinical effect, is likely to achieve equivalent benefits with much lower total doses. With chronic poisoning, it may be simplest to give 40 mg (1 vial) digoxin-Fab at a time and repeat after 60 min if there is no response.

### Clinical experience with titrating doses of digoxin antibodies in acute digoxin poisoning. (ATOM-6) [^9ee44800]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For acute digoxin poisoning, it has been recommended to give bolus doses of 10–20 vials or potentially larger than needed doses calculated from dose ingested or the measured concentration. However, a recent revision of internal Poisons Information Centre guidelines prompted a change of our recommendations, specifically instead of large boluses, to use titrating repeated low doses of digoxin antibodies(Digoxin-Fab) based on bedside assessment of cardiac toxicity.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study of patients with acute digoxin poisoning identified through two Poisons Information Centres and three toxicology units. Patient demographics, signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity, doses and response to Digoxin-Fab, free and bound serum digoxin concentrations. Outcomes were recorded and analysed.

Results

From September 2013 to September 2020, 23 patients with 25 presentations (median age 56years, females 56%) were recruited. Median dose ingested was 13mg(IQR: 9.5–25). Median heart rate (HR) was 41 beats/min before treatment. Initial median digoxin and potassium concentrations were 14.5nmol/L (IQR: 10.9–20) [11.2µg/L(IQR: 8.4–15.4)] and 5mmol/L (IQR: 4.5–5.4mmol/L), respectively. Gastrointestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury were present in 22 patients (88%) and 5 patients (20%), respectively. Four patients received an initial bolus dose of Digoxin-Fab of 5–20 vials. Twenty-one patients received repeated titrated doses (1–2 vials) of Digoxin-Fab and the median total dose was 4 vials (IQR: 2–7.5). Median maximal change in HR post-Digoxin-Fab was 19 beats/min. The median potassium concentration decrease post-Digoxin-Fab was 0.3mmol/L. Total dose used in the titration group was 25% and 35% of the predicted doses based on the amount of digoxin ingested or measured serum concentration, respectively. Twelve had free digoxin concentrations measured. Free digoxin concentrations dropped to almost zero after any dose of Digoxin-Fab. Ten patients had a rebound of digoxin > 2.6nmol/L (2µg/L). There were no deaths from acute digoxin toxicity.

Conclusions

The new practice of using small, titrated doses of Digoxin-Fab led to a considerable reduction in total usage and major savings. The clinical response to titrated doses was safe and acceptable in acute digoxin poisoning.

### Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling of acute digoxin toxicity and the effect of digoxin-specific antibody fragments [^812c4a58]. Clinical Toxicology (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Recommended doses of digoxin-specific antibody fragments (digoxin-Fab) for treatment of acute digoxin poisoning are pharmacokinetically unsubstantiated and theoretically excessive. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling creates clinical simulations which are closely related to physiological and pharmacokinetic behaviour. This paper details the formulation of a PBPK model of digoxin and explores its use as a simulation tool for acute digoxin toxicity and its management.

Materials and Methods

A PBPK model of digoxin was constructed and validated for acute digoxin poisoning management by comparing simulations with observed individual acute overdose patients. These simulations were compared with standard two-compartment PK model simulations.

Results

PBPK model simulations showed good agreement with post-absorption plasma concentrations of digoxin measured in 6 acute overdose patients. PBPK predictions were accurate to 1.5-fold or less of observed clinical values, proving to be more accurate than two-compartment simulations of the same patients which produced up to a 4.9-fold change.

Conclusions

Compared to conventional two-compartment modelling, PBPK modelling is superior in generating realistic simulations of acute digoxin toxicity and the response to digoxin-Fab. Simulation capacity provides realistic, continuous data which has the potential to substantiate alternative, less expensive, and safer digoxin-Fab dosing strategies for the treatment of acute digoxin toxicity.

Drug-induced atrioventricular block — course and follow-up indicates that atrioventricular block attributable to medications, such as beta-blocker overdose or digoxin toxicity, often resolve with supportive care and reversal or withdrawal of the offending drug although patients remain at risk for future bradycardia, whereas new onset atrioventricular block in patients who have been on chronic stable doses of atrioventricular nodal blocking medications often does not resolve or can recur requiring permanent pacing; therefore, continued surveillance for recurrence of atrioventricular block is useful or even consideration for permanent pacing after the offending medication has been discontinued.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

Digitalis (digoxin) intoxication — clinical presentation and management note that certain arrhythmias are typical and diagnosis relies on characteristic rhythm disturbances with ancillary symptoms and elevated serum concentrations. In mild cases, management includes discontinuing the drug, monitoring rhythm and maintaining normal serum potassium, and temporary pacing may be needed. For more severe intoxication (serum digoxin concentration greater than 4 to 5 ng/mL with serious arrhythmias), the treatment of choice is digoxin-specific Fab antibody. In one series of 150 severely intoxicated patients, response was rapid (30 min to 4 h), and 54% of patients presenting with a cardiac arrest survived hospitalization. Side effects include worsening of the underlying disease and hypokalemia; digoxin concentration monitoring is unreliable after antidigoxin antibody, and previously used therapies such as lidocaine or phenytoin have little role.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^d76b52be]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Observational studies, case series (,–), and animal studies document an improvement in contractility, blood pressure, and a potential increase in survival with the use of high-dose insulin in CCB-poisoned patients. Considering that high-dose insulin seems to have a direct positive inotropic effect, the workgroup recommended its use in the face of documented myocardial dysfunction, but still suggested if myocardial dysfunction is not documented because case series documented hemodynamic improvement even with dihydropyridines poisoning. Despite the fact that high-dose insulin requires intensive monitoring, its benefits were thought to outweigh the risks such as hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, or volume overload. The proposed dose regimen of high-dose insulin (regular insulin) includes a bolus of 1 U/kg followed by an infusion of 1 U/kg/hr with maintenance of euglycemia with a dextrose infusion as needed and close monitoring of serum potassium. Because titration of high-dose insulin to response up to 10 U/kg/hr is supported only by case series, the workgroup suggests to use this dosage only for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies.

The selection of vasopressors should be guided by the type of shock. Based on mechanism of action, the workgroup recommended the use of norepinephrine to increase blood pressure in vasoplegic shock or if myocardial function has not yet been assessed. The use of epinephrine is also recommended for a CCB-poisoned patient in shock to increase contractility and heart rate. In the presence of confirmed myocardial dysfunction, clinicians can also use dobutamine. High infusion rates of vasopressors and inotropes may be required.

Based on inconsistent hemodynamic improvement in case series, the workgroup suggest not to use dopamine. The use of vasopressin alone was discouraged due to lack of efficacy and worsened survival in animal models. The workgroup could not make recommendations regarding the use of vasopressin as an adjunct to other vasopressors as there is little documented clinical experience. No agreement was reached for the use of phenylephrine in CCB-poisoned patients.

### Digoxin (digox) [^d8e1514c]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of Potassium: Every effort should be made to maintain the serum potassium concentration between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L. Potassium is usually administered orally, but when correction of the arrhythmia is urgent and the serum potassium concentration is low, potassium may be administered cautiously by the intravenous route. The electrocardiogram should be monitored for any evidence of potassium toxicity (e.g., peaking of T waves) and to observe the effect on the arrhythmia. Potassium salts may be dangerous in patients who manifest bradycardia or heart block due to digoxin (unless primarily related to supraventricular tachycardia) and in the setting of massive digitalis overdosage (see Massive Digitalis Overdosage subsection).

Massive Digitalis Overdosage: Manifestations of life-threatening toxicity include ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, or progressive bradyarrhythmias, or heart block. The administration of more than 10 mg of digoxin in a previously healthy adult, or more than 4 mg in a previously healthy child, or a steady-state serum concentration greater than 10 ng/mL often results in cardiac arrest.

DIGIBIND should be used to reverse the toxic effects of ingestion of a massive overdose. The decision to administer DIGIBIND to a patient who has ingested a massive dose of digoxin but who has not yet manifested life-threatening toxicity should depend on the likelihood that life-threatening toxicity will occur (see above).

Patients with massive digitalis ingestion should receive large doses of activated charcoal to prevent absorption and bind digoxin in the gut during enteroenteric recirculation. Emesis or gastric lavage may be indicated especially if ingestion has occurred withing 30 minutes of the patient's presentation at the hospital. Emesis should not be induced in patients who are obtunded. If a patient presents more than 2 hours after ingestion or already has toxic manifestations, it may be unsafe to induce vomiting or attempt passage of a gastric tube, because such maneuvers may induce an acute vagal episode that can worsen digitalis-related arrhythmias.

Severe digitalis intoxication can cause a massive shift of potassium from inside to outside the cell, leading to life-threatening hyperkalemia. The administration of potassium supplements in the setting of massive intoxication may be hazardous and should be avoided. Hyperkalemia caused be massive digitalis toxicity is best treated with DIGIBIND; initial treatment with glucose and insulin may also be required if hyperkalemia itself is acutely life-threatening.

### Evaluation of safety and efficacy of intravenous digoxin loading doses based on ideal body weight [^275ec373]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous digoxin loading dose recommendations differ between clinical guidelines and Food and Drug Administration packaging for acute rate control.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous digoxin loading in patients who received ≤ 12 µg/kg and > 12 µg/kg of digoxin using ideal body weight (IBW).

Methods

This single center retrospective cohort study with exempt status from the local Institutional Review Board included patients who received intravenous digoxin and had a serum digoxin concentration (SDC) drawn. Digoxin doses > 36 hours after the first dose were excluded. Patients who received a total of > 12 µg/kg and ≤ 12 µg/kg IBW were compared. The primary endpoint was frequency of SDCs ≥ 1.2 ng/mL, which have been shown to be associated with increased mortality.

Results

A total of 244 patients were included (144 receiving > 12 µg/kg and 100 receiving ≤ 12 µg/kg). There were significantly more SDC ≥ 1.2 ng/mL in the > 12 µg/kg group than the ≤ 12 µg/kg group (50.6% vs. 30.0%; adjusted odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.79–5.84), with no difference in rate control failure. Major limitations of the study include retrospective nature and possible selection bias.

Conclusion and Relevance

Compared to patients who received digoxin doses ≤ 12 µg/kg IBW, patients who received > 12 µg/kg IBW had higher rates of SDC ≥ 1.2 ng/mL. This suggests that appropriate weight-based dosing with 8 to 12 µg/kg IBW has the potential to be a safer approach to digoxin loading, rather than frequently used dosing strategies that result in doses > 12 µg/kg.

### Extracorporeal treatment for digoxin poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^8575eadb]. Clinical Toxicology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for digoxin toxicity, more specifically with respect to ECTR, EXTRIP 2016 guidelines recommend to do not offer ECTR in any of the following situations:

- severe digoxin toxicity regardless if Fab is administered

- suspected digoxin ingestion regardless if Fab is administered

- elevated digoxin serum concentrations regardless if Fab is administered

- cardiovascular disturbances if Fab is administered

- serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L.
