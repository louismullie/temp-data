Copd and asthma

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to distinguish asthma from COPD, how to recognize and manage the overlap, and how to navigate controversies and evidence gaps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental pathophysiology and clinical phenotypes that separate asthma from COPD. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and the role and limits of spirometry and bronchodilator responsiveness. Next, I will examine the overlap construct, its prevalence, and why it matters clinically. After that, I need to check current guideline positions and reconcile terminology. Then, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm and a safety-first treatment approach for overlap. Finally, I should review special populations, controversies, and future directions, making sure I double-check areas where evidence is weak or conflicting [^1162wkJw] [^1179AP9W].

> Let me first confirm the core distinctions in pathophysiology and phenotype, because that frames everything else. Asthma classically reflects variable airflow limitation driven by eosinophilic, type 2 inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling, whereas COPD reflects persistent, largely irreversible airflow limitation driven by neutrophilic inflammation, oxidative stress, and parenchymal destruction from noxious exposures, particularly smoking, with structural emphysema and small airway disease as hallmarks [^117PAayj] [^116yybYv] [^116kkJnD]. Hold on, I should verify the reversibility claim; while COPD obstruction is "not fully reversible", a substantial fraction of COPD patients show bronchodilator responsiveness, so reversibility alone cannot reliably distinguish asthma from COPD in an individual patient, which is a key pitfall in practice [^1167xjFL] [^1121hsaK].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and the role of spirometry, and I need to ensure I'm precise about thresholds and timing. COPD is defined by a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.70 or below the lower limit of normal, reflecting persistent airflow limitation, whereas asthma is supported by evidence of variable airflow obstruction with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 increase of at least 12% and 200 mL, or by bronchial hyperresponsiveness on methacholine testing [^114QXf45] [^114Ze2M6]. Wait, let me verify the role of reversibility testing; GOLD now advises that measuring the degree of reversibility does not reliably differentiate asthma from COPD or predict long-term treatment response, so it should not be used to guide therapy decisions, even though it may still be recorded for completeness [^113d5NE3] [^115TQgF8]. I should also confirm that pre- versus post-bronchodilator spirometry can be streamlined in practice; pre-bronchodilator testing can be used initially, with post-bronchodilator testing reserved for cases with high suspicion of obstruction or when confirming COPD, which aligns with contemporary guidance [^115TQgF8].

> Now, I will examine the overlap construct, but I need to be careful with terminology. Historically, "asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS)" implied a single disease entity, but current consensus prefers "asthma+COPD" or "asthma-COPD overlap" to reflect coexistence rather than a distinct syndrome, and GOLD 2025 explicitly notes we no longer refer to ACOS, emphasizing that asthma and COPD are different disorders that may coexist [^111tDRJq]. Let me consider prevalence; estimates vary widely depending on definitions and populations, with roughly 15–55% of COPD patients and 13–61% of asthma patients showing overlap features, underscoring heterogeneity and the impact of diagnostic criteria on case ascertainment [^114Z7Cki] [^112y7Eb6]. I should double-check the clinical burden; patients with overlap generally have worse symptoms, more frequent exacerbations, faster lung function decline, and higher healthcare utilization than those with either disease alone, which justifies a more aggressive, safety-first approach to therapy [^114UtSKC] [^115fx3bF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms; I need to check the pathophysiologic overlap. Both diseases involve chronic airway inflammation and remodeling, but the inflammatory cell profiles and structural changes differ, with eosinophils and mast cells more prominent in asthma and neutrophils and macrophages more prominent in COPD, while overlap patients may display mixed inflammatory signatures and shared features such as airway wall thickening or hyperresponsiveness, especially in smokers with asthma or in severe disease [^117PAayj] [^1142LJJL]. But wait, what if genetics link the two conditions; network analyses suggest shared molecular neighborhoods and mediator genes that could explain comorbidity and phenotypic overlap, supporting the concept of a spectrum rather than entirely discrete entities in some patients [^113iS2Hb].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my management advice aligns with high-credibility sources. GINA 2024 emphasizes that patients with features of both asthma and COPD carry increased risk if treated with LABA or LAMA alone without ICS, and therefore recommends that all such patients receive ICS as part of initial therapy, with treatment otherwise following asthma principles while layering COPD-specific measures as needed [^113Qv6Zb] [^115fx3bF]. GOLD 2025 similarly instructs that if COPD coexists with asthma, management should follow asthma guidelines and ICS use is mandatory, with rescue bronchodilators prescribed for symptom relief, and it de-emphasizes reversibility testing for therapeutic decision-making [^115fehXh] [^1121BNYP] [^113d5NE3]. I should confirm that both guidelines converge on education, smoking cessation, vaccination, and comorbidity management as universal pillars, which they do [^113Qv6Zb] [^111tDRJq].

> I will now translate this into a practical diagnostic approach, but I need to ensure it is safe and feasible in primary care. Let me first confirm the clinical features that raise suspicion for overlap: age over 40, smoking or biomass exposure, chronic productive cough, progressive dyspnea, and fixed airflow limitation alongside a history of asthma, atopy, or documented reversibility and variability of symptoms, which together increase the likelihood of coexisting asthma and COPD [^115RoZma] [^114Ze2M6]. Next, I should review spirometry strategy; start with pre-bronchodilator spirometry and proceed to post-bronchodilator testing if obstruction is present or suspicion remains high, documenting both the FEV1/FVC ratio and the absolute and relative change in FEV1 to capture both fixed and variable components [^115TQgF8] [^114QXf45]. Hold on, I should verify adjuncts; fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophils can support type 2 inflammation and an asthma component, while CT may reveal emphysema or airway wall thickening that inform phenotype, though imaging is not required for diagnosis [^116x9bSn] [^1176Gmbh]. Finally, I need to ensure inhaler technique and adherence are assessed at every visit because device errors and nonadherence are common and materially affect outcomes in overlap populations [^113Qv6Zb] [^111tDRJq].

> For initial treatment, I should confirm a safety-first principle and then tailor. If overlap is suspected or diagnosed, initiate ICS without delay, typically combined with a LABA, and add a LAMA if COPD features and symptoms persist, while ensuring a short-acting bronchodilator is available for rescue; this ICS-first approach mitigates the known risk of severe asthma exacerbations and death associated with LABA monotherapy in patients with unrecognized asthma features [^113Qv6Zb] [^115fx3bF] [^117NQGmX]. Wait, let me verify the role of triple therapy; escalation to LABA+LAMA+ICS is reasonable for persistent symptoms or exacerbations, guided by symptoms, exacerbation history, and biomarkers such as blood eosinophils, recognizing that eosinophil thresholds in COPD are debated and should be interpreted in clinical context [^11396TKY]. I should also confirm that nonpharmacologic measures are emphasized: structured smoking cessation, vaccination, pulmonary rehabilitation when indicated, and routine review of inhaler technique and adherence at each visit [^111tDRJq] [^113Qv6Zb].

> I need to check special populations and modifiers of risk and response. Women appear to have higher prevalence of asthma and overlap and may experience worse outcomes and readmissions, suggesting the need for vigilant follow-up and possibly sex-specific risk stratification in some settings, although evidence for sex-tailored pharmacotherapy remains limited [^115zPFxK] [^111bSg4B]. Never-smokers with COPD features, including those with asthma or biomass exposure, are underrecognized and may require tailored evaluation and management, and early COPD-like features can appear in some smokers with asthma even before fixed obstruction is established, warranting closer surveillance and risk modification [^111nPLnA] [^114THks2]. Let me reconsider the role of airway hyperresponsiveness; a history of asthma confers a markedly increased risk of developing COPD over time, and airway hyperresponsiveness itself is a strong independent risk factor for COPD and respiratory mortality, reinforcing the importance of identifying and actively managing asthma features in overlap patients [^114VgWvQ].

> But wait, what about controversies and evidence gaps; I should double-check where guidelines rely on consensus. The overlap construct lacks a unified definition and has been historically excluded from major RCTs, so much of the management advice is extrapolated and consensus-based, which explains variability in prevalence estimates and the absence of regulatory-approved "overlap" therapies [^1162wkJw] [^114YbnTi]. Some authors argue for abandoning the ACOS umbrella in favor of a treatable traits model that targets mechanisms like eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, or airway remodeling irrespective of dual labels, which may better align with heterogeneous biology but requires implementation support in primary care [^112ec7TN] [^115XWDNJ]. I should confirm that GOLD's move away from ACOS terminology and toward explicit coexistence with asthma-first pharmacotherapy is a pragmatic response to safety concerns and the paucity of overlap-specific trials, which it is [^111tDRJq] [^115fehXh].

> Next, I should review future directions and research priorities, and I need to ensure they reflect real-world needs. There is an urgent call for studies that include patients with overlapping features, develop validated biomarker panels to phenotype overlap, and test targeted biologics and other precision therapies in appropriately selected subgroups, moving beyond one-size-fits-all inhaled combinations [^1179AP9W] [^1145gv3J]. Let me verify that digital health and machine learning are being explored to identify high-risk phenotypes and predict exacerbations; indeed, EHR-based models and deep learning approaches are promising but remain largely translational rather than integrated into routine care, highlighting a need for validation and clinician-facing tools [^112PJthk]. Finally, I should confirm that guidelines emphasize longitudinal reassessment of symptoms, lung function, and exacerbations to enable de-escalation when appropriate, which they do, though overlap patients often require sustained ICS-containing regimens given their risk profile [^111tDRJq] [^113Qv6Zb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is clear and actionable. Asthma and COPD are distinct but overlapping diseases; when features of both coexist, prioritize safety by ensuring ICS use and follow asthma-guided pharmacotherapy while layering COPD-specific bronchodilation and nonpharmacologic care, avoid relying on reversibility to make treatment decisions, and maintain a high index of suspicion in smokers with asthma or older adults with fixed obstruction and variability, as this phenotype carries disproportionate morbidity and warrants proactive, guideline-concordant management [^113Qv6Zb] [^115fehXh] [^114UtSKC].

Asthma and COPD are **distinct diseases** with overlapping features [^116qREyg]; asthma is characterized by **reversible airflow limitation** and type 2 (eosinophilic) inflammation [^117PAayj], whereas COPD shows **fixed airflow limitation** with neutrophilic inflammation and structural remodeling [^116yybYv]. The **asthma-COPD overlap (ACO)** [^114YbnTi] is common and carries higher symptom burden, exacerbations, and healthcare use than either disease alone [^114UtSKC]. Diagnosis relies on spirometry [^114Ze2M6] with bronchodilator testing and clinical context; reversibility alone does not reliably distinguish the two [^113d5NE3]. Management combines inhaled corticosteroids for asthma control [^113Qv6Zb] with long-acting bronchodilators for COPD symptoms [^11396TKY], individualized by phenotype and exacerbation risk [^112ec7TN]. Prognosis is worse in ACO [^114UtSKC], emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis and tailored therapy [^114fRxCc].

## Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO)

ACO is defined by **coexisting features** of both diseases, including chronic airflow limitation with asthma-like reversibility and COPD-like fixed obstruction [^114Ze2M6]. Prevalence is approximately 20–30% among patients with either disease [^114UtSKC]. Clinical features include **higher symptom burden**, frequent exacerbations, poorer quality of life, and greater healthcare utilization than either disease alone [^114UtSKC] [^114fRxCc].

---

## Diagnostic challenges and biomarkers

- **Spirometry**: Essential for diagnosis; post-bronchodilator testing distinguishes fixed from reversible obstruction [^113d5NE3].
- **Bronchodilator responsiveness**: Present in both diseases; not a reliable discriminator [^1121hsaK] [^1167xjFL].
- **Biomarkers**: Blood eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and IgE may help identify asthma components, but no single biomarker definitively distinguishes asthma, COPD, or ACO [^115VFjYX].

---

## Management strategies

### Asthma

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: Cornerstone therapy; reduce symptoms and exacerbation risk [^111ZwhJx].
- **Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)**: Added to ICS for improved control [^113mAc9H].
- **Biologics**: For severe, refractory asthma with type 2 inflammation (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL4/13) [^116Wwuqs].

---

### COPD

- **Long-acting bronchodilators (LABA/LAMA)**: First-line therapy for symptom control and exacerbation prevention [^113Qv6Zb] [^113mAc9H].
- **ICS**: Reserved for frequent exacerbators with eosinophilic phenotype or concomitant asthma features [^1121BNYP] [^11396TKY].
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity and quality of life [^notfound].

---

### ACO

Management combines **ICS for asthma control** with **LABA/LAMA for COPD symptoms**, individualized by phenotype and exacerbation risk [^116s3yAp] [^113Qv6Zb]. A treatable traits approach targets specific inflammatory endotypes and comorbidities to personalize therapy [^112ec7TN] [^114YbnTi].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Prognosis is generally worse in ACO than in asthma or COPD alone, with **higher exacerbation frequency**, faster lung function decline, and increased mortality [^114UtSKC] [^115fx3bF]. Quality of life is significantly impaired due to persistent symptoms, frequent exacerbations, and comorbidities [^114UtSKC].

---

## Current research and future directions

- **Precision medicine**: Efforts to define endotypes and phenotypes for targeted therapies [^112Uyfwa].
- **Biologics**: Exploration of agents targeting specific inflammatory pathways in ACO [^116Wwuqs].
- **Digital health**: Development of tools for remote monitoring and personalized management [^notfound].

---

Asthma and COPD are distinct diseases with overlapping features; ACO is common and carries a heavier burden. Accurate diagnosis and individualized management — combining ICS and bronchodilators with a treatable traits approach — are essential to **optimize outcomes** [^114YbnTi].

### Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the overlap syndrome [^113sd9de]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic diseases in the general population. Both are characterized by heterogeneous chronic airway inflammation and airway obstruction. In both conditions, chronic inflammation affects the whole respiratory tract, from central to peripheral airways, with different inflammatory cells recruited, different mediators produced, and thus differing responses to therapy. Airway obstruction is typically intermittent and reversible in asthma but is progressive and largely irreversible in COPD. However, there is a considerable pathologic and functional overlap between these 2 heterogeneous disorders, particularly among the elderly, who may have components of both diseases (asthma-COPD overlap syndrome). The definitions for asthma and COPD recommended by current guidelines are useful but limited because they do not illustrate the full spectrum of obstructive airway diseases that is encountered in clinical practice. Defining asthma and COPD as separate entities neglects a considerable proportion of patients with overlapping features and is largely based on expert opinion rather than on the best current evidence. The presence of different phenotypes or components of obstructive airway diseases, therefore, needs to be addressed to individualize and optimize treatment to achieve the best effect with the fewest side effects for the patient. Although specific interventions vary by disease, the treatment goals of obstructive airway diseases are similar and driven primarily by the need to control symptoms, optimize health status, and prevent exacerbations.

### Are asthma and COPD a continuum of the same disease? [^113GgHa1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common heterogeneous diseases with significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. In most of the cases, the main features and pathophysiology differ substantially between both asthma and COPD, which allows differentiating both entities and providing appropriate treatment. The recognition of a subgroup of patients who present clinically with features of both conditions, asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome, has reignited the question of whether asthma and COPD are different manifestations of the same disease or unique processes, the so-called Dutch hypothesis versus British hypothesis controversy. There is enough heterogeneity in the clinical and mechanistic profiles of these 3 diseases, and subsets of these 3 diseases, to suggest that a new approach relying on the concept of endotypes of obstructive airways disease may be more useful. This characterization has provided the basis for opening new areas of research that may eventually lead to the development of new targeted drugs. This review focuses on the current knowledge of asthma, COPD, and asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome phenotypes with emphasis on mechanisms of disease and how these may define endotypes, providing a more rational approach to research and clinical care.

### Overlap of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116WniVX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both defined by the presence of airflow obstruction, but they present distinguishing differences in terms of both risk factors and clinical phenotypes. Yet it is quite common in the clinical setting to observe patients with asthma showing COPD-like phenotypes, and vice versa, making it a priority to search for optimal prevention, treatment, and management strategies for these cases of coexisting lung obstructive diseases.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have provided further evidence of strong epidemiologic and clinical links between asthma and COPD. Adult subjects with active asthma are as much as 12 times more likely to acquire COPD over time than subjects with no active asthma. Signs identifying patients with asthma predisposed to developing COPD may already be present at the early stages of the disease, a finding with potential implications for prevention of COPD. In addition to spirometry and other pulmonary function tests (such as measurements of residual volume and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide), recent evidence suggests that the assessment of type and degree of airway remodeling and the evaluation of inflammatory markers might prove useful in the future to characterize phenotypically patients with coexisting asthma and COPD.

Summary

The nature of the association between asthma and COPD remains unclear and open to discussion. Further research is required to develop effective management algorithms for patients with multiple obstructive lung diseases, determine to what extent early treatment and optimal management of asthma may protect against progression into COPD, and identify genetic markers of individual susceptibility to specific lung disease phenotypes and pharmacologic treatments.

### Clinical phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma: recent advances [^115EVnjx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prevalent obstructive lung diseases, both of which are characterized by airflow limitation. Although both represent distinct pathogenic entities, there can be significant clinical and physiologic overlap between the 2 disorders, creating potential management difficulties for clinicians. Although practice guidelines for both conditions outline diagnostic and management strategies, asthma and COPD are highly heterogeneous, and the symptoms of many patients remain poorly controlled despite adherence to current guidelines. Recent advances in phenotyping studies have elucidated heterogeneity in these airway diseases and might represent the best opportunity to enhance diagnosis, predict outcomes, and personalize treatments in patients with asthma and those with COPD. This review will focus on recent advances in describing phenotypic heterogeneity in asthma and COPD, including the evaluation of multiple clinical variables, molecular biomarkers, physiologic and radiologic data, and factors associated with disease progression and frequent exacerbations.

### Sex differences in adult asthma and COPD therapy: a systematic review [^113nSuDD]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current data indicate that asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect together more than 600 million people worldwide and caused more than 3.5 million deaths per year. The absolute number of patients suffering from asthma and COPD is increasing as the global population grows, and a relevant percentage of patients has been found to have suboptimal control of symptom burden.

Despite asthma is more prevalent in women and the prevalence of COPD is increasing in women, and considering that cumulating evidence has highlighted the key pivotal role of sex differences in non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the current international recommendations for the management and prevention of asthma and COPD do not provide any sex-related indication for the treatment of these diseases. Certainly, it may be also assumed that the lack of sex-specific recommendations for the treatment of asthma and COPD could be because no real difference in effectiveness exists but, unfortunately, to date it is not known whether this hypothesis is true. In any case, it seems that both sex, assessed as male or female according to biological attributes, and gender, referred to social roles, behaviours, and expressions of identity, may significantly modulate the pharmacological response to asthma and COPD treatments.

In this uncertain context, the aim of this article was to systematically review the evidence across literature on the sex-related effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of asthma and COPD.

Indeed, a large body of evidence suggests that integrating data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies in systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses regarding complex interventions, such as the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders according to the sex, may improve the prediction of patient responses to pharmacological therapies, resulting of high value and interest to patients, clinicians, policymakers, and other healthcare stakeholders. Moreover, including information also from observational studies may improve the inference based on RCTs. Interestingly, these advantages of adding observational studies to RCTs to bring complementary healthcare information seems to be independent from the quality of the studies included. Effectively, considering that it is unusual to find sufficient evidence from RCTs to answer all key questions in a systematic review, there is no a priori reason to exclude observational studies from a qualitative synthesis. After all, the greatest level in the new hierarchy of evidence is reached when both RCTs and observational studies exist with consistent findings.

Therefore, moving from this solid background and considering that the impact of sex differences in adult asthma and COPD therapy is a relevant but usually neglected topic, we carried out a systematic review by including both RCTs and observational studies.

### Treatment of overlapping asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can guidelines contribute in an evidence-free zone? [^1162wkJw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In their most typical forms, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are clearly distinguishable, but many patients with chronic airflow limitation demonstrate features of both conditions and have worse health outcomes than those with either disease alone. This has been called the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS), but as yet, it lacks a precise definition. However, given the different pathways by which a patient can come to demonstrate features of both asthma and COPD, ACOS is not thought to represent a single disease but to include several heterogeneous phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. These issues have important implications for guidelines because some existing treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD are in conflict, and patients with both asthma and COPD have specifically been excluded from major pharmacologic trials. As a result, there is little evidence at present to support specific treatment recommendations for ACOS on the basis of efficacy or effectiveness, yet these patients continue to present for diagnosis and management, mainly in primary care. This article highlights the need for clinical guidance about ACOS, summarizes recommendations about its diagnosis and treatment from a sample of national asthma and COPD guidelines, and proposes a way forward, as suggested in a collaborative Global Initiative for Asthma/Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report, to provide health professionals with interim recommendations about syndromic recognition and initial treatment based on both potential effectiveness and potential risk. Additional research in broad populations is urgently needed to develop a precise definition for ACOS, characterize its phenotypes, and identify opportunities for targeted treatment.

### Asthma-COPD overlap and chronic airflow obstruction: definitions, management, and unanswered questions [^114YbnTi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a common clinical presentation of chronic airways disease in which patients show some features usually associated with asthma, and some usually associated with COPD. There is ongoing debate over whether ACO is a discrete clinical entity, or if it is part of a continuum of airways disease. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among current definitions of ACO, which makes diagnosis potentially challenging for clinicians. Treating ACO may be equally challenging because ACO is an understudied population, and the evidence base for its management comes largely from asthma and COPD studies, the relevance of which deserves careful consideration. In this review, we synthesize the various approaches to ACO diagnosis and evaluate the role of currently available diagnostic tests. We describe the potential benefits of existing asthma and COPD therapies in treating patients with ACO, and the value of a "treatable traits" approach to ACO management. Throughout the review, we highlight some of the pressing, unanswered questions surrounding ACO that are relevant to the clinical community. Ultimately, addressing these questions is necessary if we are to improve clinical outcomes for this complex and heterogeneous patient population.

### Immunology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117PAayj]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both obstructive airway diseases that involve chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract, but the type of inflammation is markedly different between these diseases, with different patterns of inflammatory cells and mediators being involved. As described in this Review, these inflammatory profiles are largely determined by the involvement of different immune cells, which orchestrate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells that drive the distinct patterns of structural changes in these diseases. However, it is now becoming clear that the distinction between these diseases becomes blurred in patients with severe asthma, in asthmatic subjects who smoke and during acute exacerbations. This has important implications for the development of new therapies.

Diagnosis and Initial Treatment of Patients with Features of Both Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are umbrella labels for overlapping heterogeneous conditions. Symptoms may be similar, and the diagnostic criteria overlap. Some patients have features of both asthma and COPD (asthma + COPD), particularly smokers and older adults. This is not a single disease entity. It includes several clinical phenotypes that are likely caused by a range of underlying mechanisms.

There are important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations for asthma versus COPD, with treatment with long-acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. without ICS) recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma because of the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Until more discriminatory risk factors are identified, all patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD should receive ICS. COPD should be managed according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease recommendations. For all patients, provide education on inhaler technique and adherence and advice about smoking cessation, immunizations, physical activity, and management of comorbidities. Refer for specialist investigations and multidisciplinary care, where possible.

Rationale

The descriptive term "asthma + COPD" is preferred because "asthma–COPD overlap" was often assumed to represent a single disease. Patients with asthma + COPD have a greater burden of symptoms and exacerbations, more impaired quality of life, more rapid decline in lung function, greater need for healthcare use, and higher mortality than patients with asthma or COPD alone. The recommendation for ICS is because several studies have shown that patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD are at increased risk of hospitalization or death if they are treated with LABA compared with ICS–LABA.

### Inflammation in COPD: implications for management [^1134v7VS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recognized by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines as an inflammatory disease state, and treatment rationales are provided accordingly. However, not all physicians follow or are even aware of these guidelines. Research has shown that COPD inflammation involves multiple inflammatory cells and mediators and the underlying pathology differs from asthma inflammation. For these reasons, therapeutic agents that are effective in asthma patients may not be optimal in COPD patients. COPD exacerbations are intensified inflammatory events compared with stable COPD. The clinical and systemic consequences believed to result from the chronic inflammation observed in COPD suggest that inflammation intensity is a key factor in COPD and exacerbation severity and frequency. Although inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used and are essential in asthma management, their efficacy in COPD is limited, with only a modest effect at reducing exacerbations. The importance of inflammation in COPD needs to be better understood by clinicians, and the differences in inflammation in COPD versus asthma should be considered carefully to optimize the use of anti-inflammatory agents.

### Airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: comparisons with asthma [^1119Ha8n]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive syndrome of expiratory airflow limitation caused by chronic inflammation of the airways and lung parenchyma. The airway inflammatory response in COPD is initiated by smoking in the overwhelming majority of cases, and chronic exposure to cigarette smoke initiates a series of events that causes damage to central airways, peripheral airways, and terminal airspaces, leading to physiologic and clinical abnormalities. Although COPD shares some clinical features with asthma, another prevalent airway inflammatory disease, there are distinct differences in the phenotypic characteristics of airway inflammation between COPD and asthma. The eosinophil is the most prominent inflammatory cell in asthma, with mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages playing important but less prominent roles. In COPD the cellular composition of the airway inflammatory infiltrate differs, with neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes assuming prominence and the eosinophil playing a minor role, except in the setting of exacerbations. The contrasting inflammatory phenotypes of asthma and COPD have important implications for clinical and physiologic manifestations of disease, as well as for therapy.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Novel therapeutic strategies in asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^116Wwuqs]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The term asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap applies where there are features of asthma and COPD. Agents targeting eosinophilic inflammation have transformed asthma management and indicate promise across airways disease, whereas agents targeting neutrophilic inflammation have demonstrated limited efficacy. Successful treatment of airway dysbiosis, mucous hypersecretion, or airway remodeling may occur with better understanding of the impact of current agents on specific clinical end points or through novel approaches. Biomarkers indicating specific disease mechanisms are key to select appropriate populations for clinical trials and identify subgroups likely to benefit from targeted treatments.

### The physiology of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113cM9GU]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both characterized by airway obstruction and share similar clinical manifestations. However, they differ in many respects related to underlying cause, mechanism of airway obstruction, pattern and progression of symptoms, and response to therapy. It remains unclear whether there is a unique physiologic phenotype that characterizes asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). This review describes the common and distinct physiologic tests that help define asthma and COPD and potentially how they may contribute to understanding the underlying physiology of ACO.

### Do we really need asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome? [^115XWDNJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The association of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the same patient, which is designated as mixed asthma-COPD phenotype or overlap syndrome (ACOS), remains a controversial issue. This is primarily because many conflicting aspects in the definition of ACOS remain, and it is extremely difficult to summarize the distinctive features of this syndrome. Furthermore, we are realizing that asthma, COPD, and ACOS are not single diseases but rather syndromes consisting of several endotypes and phenotypes and, consequently, comprising a spectrum of diseases. The umbrella term ACOS blurs the lines between asthma and COPD and allows an approach that simplifies therapy. However, this approach contradicts the modern concept according to which we must move toward more targeted and personalized therapies to treat patients with these diseases. Therefore we argue that the term ACOS must be abandoned and ultimately replaced when new phenotypes and underlying endotypes are identified and a new taxonomy of airway diseases is generated.

### The many faces of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^114fRxCc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common diseases that often overlap. The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to define this entity but there remain several speculations on its exact definition, impact, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management. We reviewed recent publications on ACO to obtain more insight of current knowledge and outline future needs.

Recent Findings

Criteria for ACO vary from one publication to another and the many variable features of these patients underline the need to reconsider the evaluation and approach of patients with overlapping features based on clinical traits and underlying biological mechanisms. Epidemiological studies reveal that ACO patients have generally an increased burden of illness and healthcare use in addition to poorer quality of life (QoL) compared with asthma and higher or equal to COPD. However, their long-term outcome seems better than patients with COPD alone. Various methods have been proposed to evaluate these patients but their usefulness compared to 'classical' investigation of obstructive lung diseases remains speculative and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, there are no formal studies that examined and compared the different treatment strategies of well-characterized patients with ACO as such patients are usually excluded from clinical trials.

Summary

ACO is a common condition with variable features and a high burden of disease. There is no consensus on its definition, diagnostic, and clinical features and more research should be done on its optimal management and long-term outcomes.

### Understanding asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^114Z7Cki]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS) is a loosely-defined clinical entity referring to patients who exhibit characteristics of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical definitions and classifications for ACOS vary widely, which impacts our understanding of prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of the condition. This literature review was therefore conducted to characterize the prevalence of ACOS and the effect of different disease definitions on these estimates, as this has not previously been explored. From an analysis of English language literature published from 2000 to 2014, the estimated prevalence of ACOS ranges from 12.1% to 55.2% among patients with COPD and 13.3%-61.0% among patients with asthma alone. This variability is linked to differences in COPD and asthma diagnostic criteria, disease ascertainment methods (spirometry-based versus clinical or symptom-based diagnoses and claims data), and population characteristics including age, gender and smoking. Understanding the reasons for differences in prevalence estimates of ACOS across the literature may help guide decision making on the most appropriate criteria for defining ACOS and aid investigators in designing future ACOS clinical studies aimed at effective treatment.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^112xFViT]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The biology and importance of COPD exacerbations

Exacerbations are key events in COPD, defined by the presence of worsening symptoms but also often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and systemic inflammation. Exacerbations are caused by those insults that increase airway inflammation, principally episodes of bronchial infection, but also pollutants or stimuli that directly affect expiratory flow limitation.

Although it is generally true that exacerbations become more frequent as the severity of the underlying COPD increases, there are large differences in exacerbation incidence rates ('exacerbation frequency') between individual patients, and patients susceptible to more frequent exacerbations ('frequent exacerbators') appear to be a distinct phenotype susceptible to a more rapid decline in lung function, poorer quality of life and increased mortality. They are therefore a particularly important group to target for the exacerbation prevention strategies that are described below. There is emerging evidence to suggest that a proportion of patients with milder COPD may be susceptible to frequent exacerbations.

Exacerbations are very heterogeneous events ranging from no more than troublesome increases in respiratory symptoms to life-threatening episodes of respiratory failure. A typical community-treated exacerbation in a patient with moderately severe COPD has a short prodrome and a median symptom duration of 7 days, though some are considerably longer and a proportion of patients may never completely return to their pre-exacerbation baseline. Exacerbations in more severe disease commonly require hospitalisation, and they are a much more common cause of emergency hospital admission than, for example, exacerbations of asthma. Therefore, in addition to significant personal detriment to the patient, exacerbations of COPD demand a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, with an ageing population and relatively greater reductions in mortality from other prevalent diseases (notably cardiovascular disease) the burden of exacerbations continues to rise.

### The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: towards a revised taxonomy of chronic airways diseases? [^116i3pDP]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Most research of treatments for airways diseases has been restricted to patients who meet standard definitions of either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, yet to distinguish COPD from asthma in adult patients who have clinical features of both can be challenging. Treatment guidelines provide scant advice on how such patients should be managed. With increasing recognition that asthma and COPD are heterogeneous diseases, attention has been directed to the needs of a group of patients with what is now termed asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), particularly in view of the high morbidity in this population. This Review considers the epidemiology, mechanisms of disease, current attempts to define and diagnose ACOS, existing and potential treatment options, and new approaches to the phenotyping and taxonomy of airway diseases.

The debate about whether asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are distinct clinical syndromes is not new; there is heightened interest in understanding the group of individuals with obstructive lung disease who seem to have elements of both conditions because recent studies have demonstrated increased risk for respiratory events and exacerbations. We describe the clinical characteristics of this subtype of disease and suggest 4 working definitions of individuals who would fall into the asthma-COPD overlap category. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these subtypes will hopefully lead into a better understanding of therapeutic strategies that can target specific pathobiologic pathways.

### Defining asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113J1sKJ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Much interest has been given to the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) in the past 2 decades, but the condition is still ill-defined. There is general agreement that a patient with longstanding asthma who develops fixed airflow obstruction after years of smoking has ACO although defining asthma in the face of COPD can be challenging. Many features of asthma are also found in patients with COPD without indicating an overlap and no consensus exists on which characteristics should be included in the definition of ACO. Nevertheless, some guidance has been issued to help clinicians and researchers to make a diagnosis of ACO and these will be reviewed here.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) defines a subgroup of patients with asthma who have persistent airflow obstruction or patients with COPD who may exhibit variable airflow limitation and/or evidence of type 2 inflammation. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether ACO represents a distinct disorder with unique underlying pathophysiology, whether ACO patients should be managed differently from those with asthma or COPD, and whether the diagnosis affects long-term outcomes. This article presents the data about the clinical features of ACO, the current information regarding the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome, and current understanding of therapeutic options.

This article reviews the recent advances in clinical assessment of and the utility of biomarkers in ACO, as well as highlights a treatable trait approach to identify and manage these chronic airway diseases.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the two most common chronic pulmonary diseases worldwide. Health care expenses for asthma and COPD in 2020 were estimated to be $80 billion and $49 billion in the United States alone. Severe exacerbations that require hospitalization are linked to increased disease morbidity as well as increased healthcare cost. Rates of asthma exacerbation requiring emergency department visits or hospitalization range between 8.4% and 12.5%, and up to 20% for COPD. Novel tools are therefore needed to improve disease management and facilitate therapeutic interventions.

Although asthma and COPD are both classified as obstructive lung diseases and share some clinical characteristics, their pathogenesis and therapies are vastly different. A major difference in COPD is the strong association with cigarette smoke exposure, which accounts for approximately 90% of cases in the US. Efforts to improve asthma and COPD classifications have uncovered unique disease subtypes and endotypes. Endotypes are disease phenotypes characterized by similar biological mechanisms or responses to treatment. This improvement in disease classification has enabled identification of individuals at risk for frequent exacerbations and comorbidities. These disease classification breakthroughs have also led to improved targeted therapeutics for both asthma and COPD. Despite the importance of obstructive lung disease endotyping, systematic approaches that identify patients who are at high risk of recurrent adverse outcomes for both disorders are lacking. One of the reasons for the limited adoption of patient endotyping by physicians could be reproducibility issues.

Implementation of machine learning algorithms has been a key aspect of endotype identification in asthma and COPD. However, these developments have been primarily confined to research studies and have not been translated into clinical practice. One way of addressing this translation gap is to use electronic health records (EHRs). The widespread use of EHRs allows high-throughput collection of clinical variables at distinct stages of healthcare delivery. Through EHR queries, computable phenotypes can be employed to identify clinical conditions. These records are complex and difficult to analyze in large numbers by conventional approaches. However, machine and deep learning algorithms, can potentially use EHR analysis to support improved disease classification and clinical decision-making. Despite these potential benefits of EHR integration with machine and deep learning, understanding of the shared EHR-based features of severe asthma and COPD exacerbations is limited.

### Bronchodilator responsiveness in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: prevalence, significance, and clinical implications [^1121hsaK]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) is often considered a key feature distinguishing asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, recent evidence suggests that BDR alone may not be a reliable discriminator between these conditions. There is still no consensus on BDR definitions and testing protocols. Additionally, it remains unclear whether BDR is linked to a specific COPD phenotype or influences treatment responses. Our review of recent literature attempts to clarify some of these issues.

Recent Findings

A significant proportion of COPD patients demonstrate BDR, but the variability in testing procedures and definitions makes it challenging to draw any definite conclusion. There is no evident association between BDR and specific COPD characteristics. A few studies suggest that BDR may be associated with marginally better treatment response and disease outcomes in COPD. The impact of recent changes in BDR definitions on clinical practice remains to be fully understood.

Summary

There is still no clear, clinically relevant threshold to define BDR. BDR is an unreliable discriminator to differentiate asthma from COPD and is not consistently linked to any specific COPD phenotype, treatment response, or disease outcomes. Further research is needed to refine the definitions and implications of BDR in COPD.

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap: the role for allergy [^115fY5HX]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are 2 distinct diseases with different clinical presentations. Chronic inflammation and airway obstruction are key features of asthma and COPD. Increased morbidity and mortality rates seem to be an important characteristic associated with asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). Atopy is an important clinical characteristic of patients categorized as ACO. Herein, the authors review the recent advancements in basic research, clinical assessment, and defining characteristics of ACO and the role for allergy as well as highlight future potential for disease-specific therapeutics for this asthma subtype.

### Pathophysiology of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^114gFf3L]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a condition in which a person has clinical and biological features of both asthma and COPD. The pathophysiology behind the development of ACO is complex, with various inflammatory cells, cytokines, environmental factors, and architectural changes within the airways, all affecting a patient's clinical manifestation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in the development of ACO will help us to better identify potential drug targets and improve symptom burden and overall quality of life for patients living with ACO.

Implications of Strong and Conditional Recommendations: From the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group

The target audience for this guideline includes specialists in respiratory medicine. However, given that COPD is a common condition, primary care physicians, internists, other healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers may also find benefit from these recommendations.

Although the panel used a systematic approach and the best available evidence to develop this guideline, it is important to note that study participants in many clinical trials may not reflect all populations. Specifically, patients older than 80 years, those with multiple chronic conditions, and those with a codiagnosis of COPD and asthma are rarely represented in clinical trials. We recommend that for all clinical management decisions, the patient and the healthcare provider should engage in a shared decision-making process.

### Exacerbations and progression of disease in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114BViH3]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations, characterized by an increase in patients' symptoms above baseline, are characteristic of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Prevention of exacerbations and their expedient treatment are major goals for reducing the morbidity and cost of both conditions. Exacerbations, however, may also adversely affect the natural history of these disorders, perhaps by contributing to increased rates of lung function decline, systemic effects, and premature mortality. Although the available information is limited, the course of COPD is affected adversely by exacerbations in multiple ways. First, exacerbations likely lead to structural alterations in the lung and to permanently worsened airflow. Second, health status is adversely affected by exacerbations, and although the mechanisms are unclear, the effects are long lasting and may be irreversible. Less is known in asthma about the effect of exacerbations on natural history, but many of the same pathogenetic processes involved in COPD exacerbations likely play a role in some subjects with asthma as well. Future studies of how exacerbation affects the "natural history" of asthma and COPD will require a better understanding of the heterogeneity of exacerbations but promises to identify new therapeutic strategies to treat these disorders.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113Qv6Zb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis and initial treatment in adults with features of asthma, COPD or both — Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are described as heterogeneous and overlapping, with umbrella labels and with similar symptoms and overlapping diagnostic criteria, and distinguishing them can be difficult, particularly in smokers and older adults; the terms 'asthma-COPD overlap' or 'asthma+COPD' are simple descriptors that do not refer to a single disease entity, and safety of pharmacologic treatment is a high priority. The labels remain important because there are extremely important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations; specifically, treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. These risks are also seen in patients who have diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, and ICS reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with asthma, including in those with concomitant COPD.

### Similarities and differences in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [^113mAc9H]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

There is no generally accepted definition of an exacerbation either for asthma or for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is little consistency among the symptomatic or functional criteria used in different studies. The most consistent criterion is the introduction of systemic corticosteroids for the acute worsening of the disease. The time course of an exacerbation does not seem to differ very much between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The decrease in peak flow rate is more pronounced in asthma than in COPD. The frequency of exacerbations is linked to disease severity both in asthma and COPD. Common causes are viral infections and increased environmental air pollution, whereas allergen exposure and bacterial infections are more specific for asthma and COPD exacerbations, respectively. Few data are available about the airway pathology of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Eosinophilia and/or neutrophilia have been associated with exacerbations in both diseases. Avoidance of the causal factors decreases exacerbation rate in both diseases. Pharmacologic prevention of exacerbations in asthma has been shown for inhaled corticosteroids, combination therapy with long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, and monoclonal anti-IgE. Inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists, combination therapy with both, and the long-acting inhaled anticholinergic tiotropium decrease the exacerbation rate in COPD.

### The overlap syndrome of asthma and COPD: what are its features and how important is it? [^115ediPp]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

There is a need to re-evaluate the concept of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as separate conditions, and to consider situations when they may coexist, or when one condition may evolve into the other. Epidemiological studies show that in older people with obstructive airway disease, as many as half or more may have overlapping diagnoses of asthma and COPD (overlap syndrome). These people are typically excluded from current therapy trials, which limit the generalisability of these trials, and this presents a problem for evidence-based guidelines for obstructive airway diseases. Studying overlap syndrome may shed light on the mechanisms of COPD development. Overlap syndrome is recognised by the coexistence of increased variability of airflow in a patient with incompletely reversible airway obstruction. Patients typically have inflammatory features that resemble COPD, with increased airway neutrophilia, as well as features of airway wall remodelling. Overlap syndrome can develop when there is accelerated decline in lung function, or incomplete lung growth, or both. The risk factors for these events are shared, such that increasing age, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, tobacco smoke exposure, asthma and lower respiratory infections/exacerbations are significant risk factors for both incomplete lung growth and accelerated loss of lung function. Studying these events may offer new insights into the mechanisms and treatment of obstructive airway diseases.

### Phenotypes of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^117Wudej]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are considered unique diseases with distinct characteristics. Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap is a disorder in which the clinical characteristics of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease coexist. Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap is a heterogenous condition; patients can have varied clinical presentations. There are significant gender variations among different phenotypes overlap. Age of symptom onset is another important consideration. Severity of symptoms, spirometry findings, smoking history, and type of airway inflammation varies between the different phenotypes. Understanding disease pathophysiology and establishing phenotypic models will improve a precision approach.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1112fPxo]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: just old friends or relatives? [^116yhmnK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

From a pathobiological standpoint, inflammatory processes contribute to small airway obstruction in both asthma and COPD. The nature of these processes and the extent to which they overlap in both conditions or evolve into each other are not well understood. We have missed for years the opportunity to explore, especially by longitudinal imaging, the lungs from younger subjects before they develop any spirometric criteria for COPD and/or after they surpassed the critical age to be studied as patients with asthma.

Altogether, these studies aimed at profiling the causes and the evolution of airflow obstruction are slowly shifting the focus toward younger individuals who have been so far overlooked, as COPD was wrongly considered a disease of the elderly. These long-term (life-long?) cohorts are crucial to further understand the determinants of lung function from birth; how small airway obstruction shapes into asthma, COPD, or both; and the potential long-term implications of these factors for the development of COPD later in life.

Here and now, there is a brand new window of opportunity to tackle the multifaceted aspects of airflow limitation. Let's keep this window wide open to promote lung health starting from birth.

Key messages

Do different phenotypes of obstructive airway disease associate with increased risk of coronary heart disease and heart failure?
Several population-based studies have shown an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease, however, most studies lack adjustment for important clinical characteristics and prospective designs. Similarly, previously observed associations between asthma and cardiovascular disease are poorly understood, and recently it has been proposed that these associations could depend on age of asthma onset or presence of allergy. Furthermore, there are to date few studies investigating the association between asthma-COPD overlap and cardiovascular disease.
Obstructive airway disease phenotypes increase risk of cardiovascular disease, but could depend on allergy presence in individuals with asthma.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111tDRJq]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up and monitoring — Patients should be reviewed after a suitable interval (shorter in more severe patients and longer in less severe patients) with assessment of symptoms using either the CAT or mMRC scores and exacerbation frequency; the effect of treatment and possible adverse effects should be evaluated and comorbidities reassessed. Inhaler technique, adherence, smoking status and continued exposure to risk factors should be regularly checked; physical activity should be encouraged; referral for pulmonary rehabilitation considered in severe patients; and the need for oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilatory support, lung volume reduction and palliative approaches considered individually with the action plan updated. Spirometry should be repeated at least annually, and if the patient is already receiving bronchodilator treatment, the latter should not be interrupted for performing spirometry. The report states that we no longer refer to asthma and COPD overlap (ACO) and emphasizes that asthma and COPD are different disorders; asthma and COPD may coexist, and if a concurrent diagnosis of asthma is suspected, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines.

### Asthma-COPD overlap: review of diagnosis and management [^112qNXqg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are both commonly encountered respiratory conditions. The term asthma — COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to identify patients presenting with features of both conditions. Controversy exists regarding its definition, approach to diagnosis and management. In this publication, recent evidence has been reviewed that provides insight into diagnosis and management of this condition.

Recent Findings

Previously, multiple criteria were used to define Asthma — COPD overlap. In this publication, the most recent guidelines to identify this condition have been reviewed. This publication provides a summary of the recent evidence with regard to the role of various diagnostic modalities including the use of biomarkers, such as exhaled nitric oxide, serum IgE and provides updated evidence on available treatment choices for this condition.

Summary

ACO is a commonly encountered clinical condition with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations and resulting in increased healthcare resource utilization. Recent interest in ACO has led to development of a framework towards diagnosis and management of this condition. Therapeutic choices for ACO range from bronchodilator therapy to immunomodulatory therapy, highlighting the heterogeneity of this condition. Additional research is required to improve understanding of pathogenesis and improve outcomes in ACO.

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^1179v6oP]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overlap of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (ACO) in patients with obstructive lung disease is growing in recognition, though there is no consistent agreement on the diagnostic criteria for the disease process. Patients with ACO have distinct clinical characteristics and trajectories, which are representative of a heterogenous, multifactorial, and incompletely understood inflammatory pathophysiology. Current treatment strategies are focused on titration of inhaled therapies such as long-acting bronchodilators, with increasing interest in the use of targeted biologic therapies aimed at the underlying inflammatory mechanisms. Future directions for research will focus on elucidating the varied inflammatory signatures leading to ACO, the development of consistent diagnostic criteria and biomarkers of disease, and improving the clinical management with an eye toward targeted therapies.

### A comparison of diagnostic consistency for asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and clinical characteristics study [^112y7Eb6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is preventable, common, and treatable and is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease, characterised by variable symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, and by variable expiratory airflow limitation. In some patients, chronic asthma cannot be clearly distinguished from COPD using currently available tests and techniques, and in those patients, it is assumed that asthma and COPD coexist. Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome has been coined to acknowledge that this represents an overlap of common disorders causing chronic airflow limitation rather than being a distinct syndrome. To avoid the impression that this is a single disease, the term ACOS is no longer advised; the descriptive term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) may be more appropriate. The prevalence rates of ACO range from 15 to 55%, with variation depending on sex and age. The wide range may be due to the different criteria used by different investigators. The prognosis of ACO is often worse than that of asthma or COPD alone, but the evidence for ACO treatment is very limited as few pharmacotherapy studies have examined this population. The different diagnostic criteria used in various regions and by different investigators might also limit the progress of ACO clinical studies. The diagnostic criteria of ACO have not been unified. Previous studies have used their own respective standards, so there was a lack of evaluation among the ACO patients screened by each standard. Our study compared the consistency among seven different sets of ACO diagnostic criteria proposed by previous studies to examine the clinical characteristics of patients screened by different standards, aiming to provide more clinical evidence for ACO diagnosis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

### Pathologic similarities and differences between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1142LJJL]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Classically, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease present distinct clinical, physiologic and pathologic features. However, not infrequently, patients may present with overlapping clinical symptoms and physiological abnormalities: patients with severe asthma may present with fixed airway obstruction and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may have hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia. At pathological level, inflammatory and structural similarities also occur and may be related to the phenotypic overlaps.

Recent Findings

In patients with asthma overlaps at inflammatory level exist with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as increased neutrophilia in patients with severe asthma or an association of CD8+ T cells and lung-function decline. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, minimizing eosinophilia may be important to reduce exacerbations. Structural alterations occur in both diseases, but involving airway compartments differently. Airway epithelial changes, extracellular matrix deposition and mucus gland hypertrophy occur in both diseases. Asthmatics have thicker reticular basement membrane and more prominent smooth-muscle abnormalities, whereas emphysema is a distinct feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Summary

Recognizing the differences and similarities at pathological level in both diseases may lead to a better understanding of the overlapping clinical and physiological phenotypes, thereby helping to better plan specific treatment and long-term management.

### Clinical approach to the therapy of asthma-COPD overlap [^115VFjYX]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last few years, there has been a renewed interest in patients with characteristics of both asthma and COPD. Although the precise definition of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is still controversial, patients with overlapping features are frequently encountered in clinical practice, and may indeed have worse clinical outcomes and increased health-care utilization than those with asthma or COPD. Therefore, there is a critical need to set a framework for the therapeutic approach of such patients. There are key distinctions in the therapy between asthma and COPD, particularly regarding the initial choice of therapy. However, there is considerable overlap in the use of existing medications for both diseases. Furthermore, novel therapies approved for asthma, such as monoclonal antibodies, may have a role in patients with COPD and ACO. The use of biomarkers, such as peripheral blood eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, and serum IgE, may help in selecting appropriate therapies for ACO. In this review, we provide an overview of available treatments for both asthma and COPD and explore their potential role in the treatment of patients with ACO.

### Redefining the overlap of asthma and COPD [^111hz4Pf]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been suggested for people with chronic airflow obstruction that has features characteristic of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 1 People with clinical features of asthma and COPD tend to have worse outcomes than those with either asthma or COPD alone, yet their clinical management has remained unclear. UK guidelines currently do not specifically address this issue, 2,3 but the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) have published a consensus-based report on the diagnosis and treatment of people with asthma, COPD and ACO. 1 Although 'asthma-COPD overlap syndrome' (ACOS) was briefly used, some thought that it gave the unhelpful impression that it referred to a single disease entity. Here, we consider some of the challenges in managing this heterogeneous group of patients.

### Change is in the air: key questions on the 'treatable traits' model for chronic airway diseases in primary care [^112ec7TN]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two prevalent, complex and heterogeneous airway diseases with clinical features that may overlap. In recent years, a management paradigm based on the identification of so-called 'treatable traits' (TTs) has been proposed to personalise and improve patient care. The TTs strategy targets clinically relevant, measurable and modifiable characteristics (traits) in each patient in the pulmonary, extra-pulmonary and behavioural and psychosocial domains. The TTs approach is agnostic to traditional disease labels and applicable to all patients with chronic airway diseases. By recognising the complexity and variability in clinical and biological characteristics among individual patients with chronic airway diseases, treatment is more rational, precise and effective.

Although the concepts underpinning the TTs approach are now well established, some areas of uncertainty remain among healthcare professionals (HCPs), particularly in the primary care setting. Below, we discuss (1) the rationale for introducing a TTs approach in clinical practice; and, (2) the hurdles and challenges of its implementation.

### Distinguishing asthma and COPD in primary care: a case-based approach [^114Ze2M6]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect more than 40 million Americans, cost more than $100 billion annually, and together constitute the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. Distinguishing between asthma and COPD can be difficult; accurate diagnosis requires spirometry that demonstrates a characteristic pattern. Asthma is diagnosed if airway obstruction on spirometry is reversible (greater than 12% and greater than 200 mL improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) with administration of bronchodilators or through the observation of bronchoconstriction (reduction in FEV1 of 20% or greater) with a methacholine challenge. COPD is diagnosed if airway obstruction (FEV1/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] ratio less than 70%) on spirometry is not reversible with bronchodilators. Although not considered a separate diagnosis, asthma-COPD overlap can be a useful clinical descriptor for patients displaying diagnostic features of both diseases. In these cases, spirometry will show reversibility after administration of bronchodilators, which is consistent with asthma, and the persistent baseline airflow limitation that is more characteristic of COPD. Treatment should follow Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines. In patients with asthma-COPD overlap, pharmacotherapy should primarily follow asthma guidelines, but pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches specific to COPD may also be needed.

### Recognising the importance of chronic lung disease: a consensus statement from the global alliance for chronic diseases (lung diseases group) [^1147taem]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic respiratory diseases are disorders of the airways and other structures of the lung, and include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. Through this article we take a broad view of chronic lung disease while highlighting (1) the complex interactions of lung diseases with environmental factors (e.g. climate change, smoking and vaping) and multimorbidity and (2) proposed areas to strengthen for better global patient outcomes.

Conclusion

We suggest new directions for the research agenda in high-priority populations and those experiencing health disparities. We call for lung disease to be made a research priority with greater funding allocation globally.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114VgWvQ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Asthma and airway hyper-reactivity — adults with asthma had a 12-fold higher risk of acquiring COPD over time compared to those without asthma, after adjusting for smoking; in another longitudinal cohort, around 20% developed irreversible airflow obstruction and reduced diffusing lung capacity, and in children with asthma, 11% met lung function impairment consistent with the spirometric classification of COPD in early adulthood. In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, airway hyper-responsiveness was second only to cigarette smoking as a leading risk factor for COPD, responsible for 15% of the population attributable risk (smoking had a population attributable risk of 39%). Airway hyper-responsiveness can exist without a clinical diagnosis of asthma and has been shown to be an independent predictor of COPD and respiratory mortality in population studies, and the pathology of chronic airflow obstruction in asthmatic non-smokers and non-asthmatic smokers is markedly different.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) inflammation and oxidative stress — compared with asthma, the inflammatory cells and mediators differ in COPD, although some patients display increased eosinophils and ILC2 cells similar to asthma; oxidative stress contributes to COPD, with biomarkers such as hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostanes increased in exhaled breath condensate, sputum, and systemic circulation, further increasing during exacerbations; oxidants arise from cigarette smoke and other particulates and from activated inflammatory cells including macrophages and neutrophils.

### Corticosteroid therapy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114Ri8jT]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized in part by a chronic inflammatory state in the airways (largely from chronic noxious stimuli such as tobacco smoke), punctuated with acute inflammatory exacerbations, which are often infectious. Although pathologically and biochemically different from the inflammation of asthma, the chronic inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in subgroups with asthma-like features and especially during exacerbations, might be expected to respond to corticosteroid therapy, as does asthma. Complications from long-term corticosteroid use are important, but they appear less when the corticosteroid is given via the inhaled route. Clinical evidence is particularly strong supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids to prevent exacerbations and oral corticosteroids to reduce the duration and impact of exacerbations.

### The asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS): opportunities and challenges [^112izqGb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Some individuals share characteristics of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) has been defined as symptoms of increased variability of airflow in association with an incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. In this review, we present the latest findings in the diagnosis, characterization and management of ACOS.

Recent Findings

Around 15–20% of COPD patients may have an ACOS. Patients with ACOS are characterized by increased reversibility of airflow obstruction, eosinophilic bronchial and systemic inflammation, and increased response to inhaled corticosteroids, compared with the remaining patients with COPD. Patients with ACOS have more frequent exacerbations, more wheezing and dyspnoea, but similar cough and sputum production compared with COPD.

Summary

The relevance of the ACOS is to identify patients with COPD who may have underlying eosinophilic inflammation that responds to inhaled corticosteroids. So far, the previous diagnosis of asthma in a patient with COPD is the more reliable criterion for ACOS. Ongoing studies will clarify if concentrations of blood eosinophils may be useful to identify this subgroup of patients with COPD. If this is the case, the interest of ACOS may shift to that of eosinophilic COPD, which is easier to diagnose and has clear therapeutic implications.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^111ZwhJx]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent airflow obstruction may develop over time — so it is important to differentiate asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

The history and pattern of symptoms and past records can help to distinguish asthma with persistent airflow limitation from COPD. Asthma and COPD may co-exist in the same patient, particularly in smokers and the elderly.

It is important to recognize features of asthma in these patients because anti-inflammatory treatment with ICS is essential in asthma (whether or not there are also features of COPD such as persistent airflow limitation) to prevent severe flare-ups (severe exacerbations) and reduce the risk of asthma-related death. Figure 3 summarizes features that are useful in distinguishing asthma from COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease activity — Activity of a disease relates to the level of activation of the biological processes that drive disease progression and Disease activity is a different concept than disease severity. Disease progression in established COPD is heterogeneous, ranging from rapid progression to stable or even improved lung function, suggesting that disease activity is also variable. We recommend: Studies that relate potential biomarkers of disease activity to patient-centered outcomes to validate the biomarkers as clinically useful measures of disease activity. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the impact of disease activity on treatment response and, conversely, the effects of treatment on disease activity.

### Early features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with asthma: is there ACO before ACO? [^114THks2]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is considered when a patient presents features of both asthma and COPD, usually including a component of irreversible airway obstruction (IRAO). However, some patients with asthma, particularly smokers, may have various features typical of COPD in the absence of such component of IRAO. Features of early COPD can be found at a young age in such patients even with normal spirometry. More longitudinal studies should be conducted to determine steps needed to improve clinical outcomes of these patients including the early recognition of these changes and the application of preventative/therapeutic interventions.

### Clinical practice guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review and comparison of current resources [^1176u5nN]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the assessment and management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were published 30 years ago. These and subsequent CPGs issued by professional societies and other groups prior to 2000 were consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and available studies, and they have been criticized for being inconsistent and not explicitly evidence-based. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a joint project of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, released the first of a new generation of rigorous, evidence-based COPD guidelines in 2001. Since that time several other CPGs, notably those developed jointly by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), and by the British National Collaborating Center for Chronic Conditions and Institute for Clinical Excellence, have also become available. While previous COPD guidelines had different severity-grading systems and differed in their therapy recommendations, the new CPGs are remarkably consistent and have very few areas of clinically relevant discrepancy. All are available free via the Internet, provide for regular revision and updating, and include materials for patients and the public, as well as for health-care providers. Although the GOLD and ATS-ERS guidelines both have international authorship and are intended for worldwide use, implementation of many of their recommendations (such as the requirement for spirometry in diagnosis and staging, an escalating management scheme that includes expensive inhaled medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration for lung-volume reduction surgery) remains beyond the reach of many patients and health care systems.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^111NU66J]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Mechanisms of bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112siztx]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Bronchial hyperreactivity has long been recognized as a hallmark of chronic asthma. Less is known about the prevalence and mechanisms of hyperreactivity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently, it is unclear whether the role and mechanisms of hyperreactivity are similar in patients with asthma and COPD or whether the underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities are different for both diseases. The aim of this review is to present an overview of current knowledge of the mechanisms of bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma and COPD.

### Recent advances in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis: from disease mechanisms to precision medicine [^112Uyfwa]. The Journal of Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an often severely disabling chronic lung disease with a high prevalence of over 250 million cases worldwide. It is currently the fourth leading cause of death globally and is predicted to be the third by 2020 1. In the most recent definition of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), COPD is defined as 'a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory systems and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases' 2. This exposure can be quite variable, with smoking being the main risk factor in high‐income countries and indoor cooking and occupational exposures representing important risk factors in low‐income countries. The definition and staging by GOLD is rather uniform, as defined by lung function, symptoms and exacerbation history, despite COPD being a heterogeneous disease in its pathological manifestations in patients. It has long been recognized that inflammation is a central hallmark of COPD, playing a role in the pathological changes in all different lung compartments 3. Next to toxic exposures, genetic predisposition is an important risk factor for COPD and COPD represents a complex disease in which genetic abnormalities in combination with the type and duration of exposures determine the clinical phenotype 4. The development of novel 2D and 3D in vitro and ex vivo models, as well as animal models that accurately recapitulate the main features of COPD pathology, has been very important for the study of disease mechanisms in COPD and recent developments in this area have been amply reviewed elsewhere 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

In the present review we focus on recent developments related to the abnormal inflammatory response, ECM and age‐related changes, structural changes in the small airways and the role of sex‐related differences, which are relevant to explain the underlying individual differences in the disease pathology of COPD and are important to improve disease endotyping. Where possible, we will underpin the observed pathogenetic changes by their potential genetic drivers.

Finally, we will discuss the most recent developments of new treatment strategies using biologicals to target specific pathological features or disease endotypes (a specific group of patients who share a distinct pathobiological mechanism) of COPD.

### Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: pathogenesis, clinical features, and therapeutic targets [^114UtSKC]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) or asthma-COPD overlap captures the subset of patients with airways disease who have features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although definitions of ACOS vary, it is generally thought to encompass persistent airflow limitation in a patient older than 40 years of age with either a history of asthma or large bronchodilator reversibility. ACOS affects about a quarter of patients with COPD and almost a third of patients who previously had asthma. Compared with their counterparts with asthma or COPD alone, patients with ACOS have significantly worse respiratory symptoms, poorer quality of life, and increased risk of exacerbations and hospital admissions. Whether this condition emerges after gradual shifts in airway remodelling and inflammation in a patient with COPD, as the result of noxious exposures in a patient with asthma, or even as a de novo disease with its own pathology is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, using treatments developed for asthma or COPD that target eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or paucigranulocytic airway inflammation may be a helpful approach to these patients until further clinical trials can be performed.

### Discovering the genes mediating the interactions between chronic respiratory diseases in the human interactome [^113iS2Hb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Biological networks are powerful resources for discovering and understanding the mechanisms that underlie human complex diseases. Indeed, it is accepted that biological components such as genes and proteins do not act in isolation, but are connected through intricate networks of molecular interactions that allow perturbations to diffuse across the system and generate, enhance or alter the disease phenotype. Over the last decade it has been observed that protein-coding genes associated to a disease have a strong tendency to interact with each other and agglomerate in a specific network neighborhood called the disease module –. However, disease progression is strongly influenced by the biological context of the organism. Perturbations causing one disease might affect other diseases, especially when the involved genes lie in the same network neighborhood, producing complex phenotypes and comorbidities.

Finding the molecular commonalities between related diseases is crucial in understanding their heterogeneity as well as identifying common biomarkers and therapeutics. As a step in this direction, Menche et al.measured the network-based separation between 226 disease pairs, observing that overlapping disease modules display significant molecular similarity, elevated coexpression of their associated genes, similar symptoms and high comorbidity. However, while the introduced separation measure offers information on the similarity of two diseases, it does not help in identifying the genes encoding proteins that influence both diseases. Furthermore, mediator genes may not be part of either disease module, but they could mediate the interactions between the two diseases without participating in the core pathways of the individual diseases. In this work we propose a methodology to identify the mediators linking pairs of complex diseases, focusing on asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), two of the most widespread chronic respiratory diseases that have been estimated to be the cause of over 3 million deaths worldwide. Asthma and COPD are influenced by genetic and environmental factors and they often manifest through similar phenotypes, like airflow obstruction, inflammation, and shortness of breath. A widely-accepted definition of their differences is still lacking since many cases fall in-between the two classic descriptions of these conditions, and patients often show asthma-like and COPD-like features simultaneously. For example, airflow obstruction reversibility, considered one of the main hallmarks of asthma, can be present in many COPD patients. On the other hand, fixed airflow obstruction, a cardinal manifestation of COPD, can develop in asthmatics as well, particularly those with severe disease or persistent symptoms since childhood. Moreover, people affected by asthma since birth are more likely to develop COPD at later ages –. This phenotypic gray area has been the source of extensive debate on a possible common genetic origin of the two diseases, a hypothesis first proposed by Orie and Sluiter, and termed the "Dutch hypothesis". Despite the considerable effort in delineating and summarizing the richness of the clinical manifestations of asthma and COPD, there is still little understanding of the shared molecular mechanisms and the causal relationships between the two disorders. Next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allow to identify potential causal genes that can explain the development of these chronic respiratory diseases and possibly offer mechanistic insights into their shared causality. Although the presence of shared disease gene associations might be expected in the context of the asthma-COPD overlap, previous work has provided little genetic support for the Dutch hypothesis, finding little to no overlap between the major asthma and COPD genes identified via GWAS. Here we show that network-based statistical methods can provide additional avenues to explore this problem.

### Diagnostic differentiation between asthma and COPD in primary care using lung function testing [^116R1xQE]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both common chronic respiratory diseases affecting approximately 1 in 12 people worldwide. The two conditions are defined as different disease entities with unique pathophysiological mechanisms and characteristic clinical features. The underlying pathophysiology in COPD is characterized predominantly by neutrophilic inflammation, whereas in asthma the inflammatory pattern is mostly due to eosinophilic inflammation. Asthma typically presents with intermittent respiratory symptoms caused by airflow obstruction predominantly due to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Asthma is often presented at younger age as part of an atopic constitution, but can also be diagnosed in adulthood. In contrast, COPD is a slowly progressive lung disease with patients having persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction. In high-income countries like the Netherlands COPD usually presents in patients older than forty who are generally current or former smokers. Patients with asthma or COPD are mostly diagnosed and managed by primary care clinicians.

Looking at the classic pathophysiological and clinical presentations, the distinction between asthma and COPD seems clear, but in clinical practice patients often show features of both diseases. These similarities make it difficult for clinicians to distinguish between asthma and COPD, especially in older and more diverse patient populations encountered in primary care –. However, differentiating between the two respiratory conditions is important as they have different pharmacotherapeutic regimens. In patients with asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are highly effective in reducing symptoms and reducing the risk of asthma-related mortality. In contrast, patients with COPD respond poorly to ICS and are mainly treated with (long-acting) bronchodilators to relieve symptoms. In addition to this, misdiagnosing asthma for COPD could lead to serious health risks considering that monotherapy with long-acting bronchodilators is contra-indicated in asthmatics since it increases the risk of severe exacerbation –. On the other hand, (unnecessary) treatment with ICS may cause pneumonia and increased risk of osteoporosis –.

Thus, establishing a correct diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment of asthma and COPD, but this can be challenging for primary care clinicians. Supporting them in the diagnostic process seems therefore essential, but this also depends on the availability of diagnostic tools. Although quality spirometry has shown to be feasible in primary care settingsthere is substantial room for improvement of its use to accurately diagnose chronic respiratory diseases. Thus, the first aim of our current study was to establish which patient characteristics distinguish between patients diagnosed with asthma or COPD. The second and main aim was to establish the added value of spirometry and more advanced lung function measurements to differentiate between these two chronic airways diseases.

### Clinical characteristic of patients with COPD-A [^111nPLnA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum, and shortness of breath due to persistent airflow limitation caused by airway and alveoli abnormalities. COPD caused about 3.3 million deaths in 2019 and was the eighth leading cause of death worldwide. Many attempts have been made world widely to eradicate and prevent COPD, because a significant portion of the COPD burden is related to cigarette smoking, which is considered preventable. However, about half of all COPD cases were caused by conditions unrelated to smoking. Many risk factors for COPD have been revealed, including biomass smoke, air pollution, specific genes, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), and infections.

AHR is very common in asthma and plays an important role in disease progression. AHR increases the risk for COPD and is responsible for about 15% of COPD cases. A report from a longitudinal cohort study showed that people with a history of asthma had a 12-fold higher risk of developing COPD compared to those without asthma, after adjusting for the effect of cigarette smoking.

The 2023 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) proposed several subtypes of COPD that were categorized by etiology and COPD-A was introduced as a subtype describing patients with COPD and a history of asthma. This reflected the fact that asthma is a major risk factor for COPD and that COPD-A patients might have distinct clinical characteristics compared to those with other COPD subtypes. Furthermore, there are significant pathological differences in the airways between asthmatics who smoke and those who do not. Thus, it is worth examining if COPD-A patients have different clinical features based on their smoking history.

No previous study has described the characteristics of patients with COPD-A. Therefore, we designed a study by utilizing large COPD cohort to assess the characteristics of COPD-A patients and analyze them according to smoking history. We also examined the association between exacerbation risk in patients with COPD-A and the use of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), a general treatment for patients with asthma.

### Gender and asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^115zPFxK]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess relationships between obstructive lung diseases, respiratory symptoms, and comorbidities by gender.

Methods

Data from 12594 adult respondents to the 2012 South Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey were used. Five categories of chronic obstructive airway disease (OAD) were defined: former asthma only, current asthma only, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) only, asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), and none. Associations of these categories with respiratory symptoms (frequent productive cough, shortness of breath, and impaired physical activities due to breathing problems), overall health, and comorbidities were assessed using multivariable logistic regression for men and women.

Results

Overall, 16.2% of men and 18.7% of women reported a physician diagnosis of COPD and/or asthma. Former asthma only was higher among men than women (4.9% vs. 3.2%, t-test p = 0.008). Current asthma only was more prevalent among women than men (7.2% vs. 4.7%, p < 0.001), as was ACOS (4.0% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001). Having COPD only did not differ between women (4.3%) and men (4.4%). Adults with ACOS were most likely to report the 3 respiratory symptoms. COPD only and ACOS were associated with higher likelihoods of poor health and most comorbidities for men and women. Current asthma only was also associated with these outcomes among women, but not among men.

Conclusions

In this large population-based sample, women were more likely than men to report ACOS and current asthma, but not COPD alone. Gender differences were evident between the OAD groups in sociodemographic characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and comorbidities, as well as overall health.

### Physiologic similarities and differences between COPD and asthma [^115oAUre]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The structural and physiologic findings in asthma and COPD appear, on average, and in the extremes of presentation, to be easily distinguished. A closer inspection of the literature reveals that significant overlap exists in individual patients with respect to airway wall thickening and low-attenuation parenchymal regions on CT scans, and in reversibility, airway hyperresponsiveness, lung diffusion, resting and dynamic hyperinflation, lung elastic recoil, exercise response, and a "pharmaceutical volume reduction" effect following therapy with bronchodilators. In particular, the subgroup of COPD patients having an airway-dominant phenotype becomes indistinguishable from asthmatic subjects with reversible disease that evolves into an incompletely reversible pattern.

### Inhaled corticosteroid treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): boon or bane? [^11396TKY]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based therapy is often used for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, this approach is under scrutiny because of ICS overuse in patients for whom it is not recommended and because of concerns about adverse events, particularly pneumonia, with long-term ICS use. Evidence suggests ICS may be beneficial in specific patients, namely, those with high blood eosinophil counts (eg, ≥ 300 cells/µL) or who are at a high risk of exacerbations. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2020 ABCD assessment tool, these patients belong in group D. For these patients, recommended initial treatment includes ICS in combination with long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) when blood eosinophil counts are ≥ 300 cells/µL or LABA + long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) when patients are highly symptomatic, that is, with greater dyspnea and/or exercise limitation. Follow-up treatments for patients with persistent dyspnea and/or exacerbations may include LABA + ICS, LABA + LAMA, or LABA + LAMA + ICS, with use of ICS being guided by blood eosinophil counts. In this review, differences in the inflammatory mechanism underlying COPD and asthma and the role of ICS treatment in COPD are summarized. Furthermore, findings from recent clinical trials where use of ICS-based dual or triple therapy in COPD was compared with LABA + LAMA therapy and trials in which ICS withdrawal was evaluated in patients with COPD are reviewed. Finally, a step-by-step guide for ICS withdrawal in patients who are unlikely to benefit from this treatment is proposed.

### Diagnosis and outpatient management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review [^116yybYv]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:

- **Definition**: COPD is a chronic lung disease characterized by non-reversible airflow obstruction and persistent symptoms of dyspnea and productive cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: COPD is caused by airway inflammation and remodeling due to environmental exposures, primarily tobacco smoke. Inflammation and oxidative stress in the airway, alveoli, and pulmonary microvasculature causes destruction of lung parenchyma, and loss of elastic recoil in the lung tissue.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of the COPD is estimated at approximately 12,000 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: These pathologic changes lead to manifestations of irreversible airflow obstruction, as well as a progressive decline in lung function, which can progress to chronic respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The standardized mortality rate of patients with COPD is estimated at 2.7 (95% CI, 2.5–3.0) in men and 4.8 (95% CI, 4.2–5.4) in women, respectively.

### Guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment and issues of implementation [^115cUyw5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Treatment advances over the last decade, although limited, have precipitated the development of clinical practice guidelines, with the aim of improving the quality of care received by patients through fostering evidence-based decision making and accelerating the application of new advances to everyday practice. Of the COPD guidelines that have been developed, those developed through the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), initially a joint activity between the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom have both published their methods for evaluation of evidence. These comprehensive guidelines cover all aspects of the disease, with the aim of providing the basis for local care pathways. The guideline development process includes evaluation of the evidence, development of the guideline, and dissemination of the findings. Efforts to enhance guideline effectiveness have focused on improving the methods and approaches to implementation, which requires an appreciation of the issues that stop translation of guideline definitions of best practice into improved patient care. A variety of questions remain unanswered in the clinical management of COPD, including the definition of outcome measures that move beyond lung function, the potential application of multidimensional grading systems that assess respiratory and systemic expressions of COPD and that could possibly better categorize and predict outcome in these patients, and the impact of new clinical trial findings. Large ongoing outcome studies may also have an effect on defining best practice within future guideline recommendations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116vpCza]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — eosinophilia and asthma-COPD overlap to guide therapy: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of eosinophilia or suspicion of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome to guide choice of additional therapy (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence cited includes a systematic review in which five RCTs examined blood eosinophil counts with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) addition, maintenance, or withdrawal and the SR showed no difference between ICS containing and non-ICS containing treatments in the risk of moderate to severe exacerbations, with other secondary outcomes mixed; due to mixed results with significant heterogeneity, the Work Group did not recommend for or against using eosinophil counts to decide on ICS therapy, noted evidence for eosinophil counts to inform the decision to withdraw an ICS in stable COPD, and stated there was insufficient data to define asthma-COPD overlap syndrome.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^117NQGmX]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma and COPD — treatment differences and dual‑diagnosis risk: There are extremely important differences in treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD, and treatment with long‑acting bronchodilators alone (i.e., without ICS) is recommended for initial treatment in COPD but is contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. For patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, several studies have also shown that they are at increased risk of hospitalization or death if they are treated with LABA or LABA‑LAMA, compared with ICS‑LABA (or ICS‑LABA‑LAMA).

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QXf45]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and classification — recommendation and spirometric confirmation: We suggest post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut-offs in post-bronchodilator spirometry, and post-bronchodilator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Evidence suggests that a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma; however, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging, and using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as "obstructed" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increase the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short-acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated testing in COPD patients, the absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long-term pharmacotherapy, and thus, reversibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. The Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

### Sex differences in asthma and COPD hospital admission, readmission and mortality [^111bSg4B]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes vary by sex. We investigated whether males and females with asthma or COPD are managed differently in-hospital when admitted for an exacerbation.

Methods

Data from the National Asthma and COPD Audit Programme were used to determine three cohorts of people hospitalised for an exacerbation: (1) adults with asthma, (2) children and young people (CYP) with asthma, and (3) adults with COPD. Outcomes included the following in-hospital interventional measures: spirometry recording, respiratory specialist review, respiratory medication administration and discharge bundle recording. Linked hospital data were used to determine 30-day and 90-day readmissions and Office for National Statistics data for 90-day mortality. Random effects logistic regression was used to investigate the association between sex and in-hospital outcomes, readmission and mortality.

Results

16370 adults with asthma, 7156 CYP with asthma and 28354 adults with COPD were included. Female adults with asthma had higher odds of being seen by a respiratory specialist (a OR 0.1.13, 1.02–1.26) and higher odds of readmission within 30 and 90 days (a OR 1.22, 1.10–1.37, a OR 1.34, 1.23–1.46) compared with males. Female adults with COPD had higher odds of being seen by a respiratory specialist, (a OR 1.10,1.02–1.19), being administered non-invasive ventilation (a OR 1.18, 1.09–1.29), and receiving a discharge bundle (a OR 1.07, 1.00–1.14), and lower odds of readmission within 90 days (a OR 0.95, 0.90–1.01), or mortality within 90 days (a OR 0.88, 0.81–0.96). Lastly, female CYP had higher odds of steroids administered within 1hour (a OR 1.13, 1.00–1.28) and higher 30-day and 90-day readmission compared with males (a OR 1.21, 1.00–1.44 and 1.17, 1.03–1.34).

Interpretation

Sex differences in in-hospital care exist in adults COPD, which may impact readmissions and mortality; however, little to no sex differences in in-hospital care were seen in people with asthma yet females were more likely to be readmitted to hospital.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future [^1143PFw4]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

While rigorous methodologies such as the GRADE strategy offer robust and less biased treatment recommendations, solely relying on such strict methodologies can also compromise the conclusions and external validity of CPGs. Using high-level, formal methodology to develop guidelines may exclude clinically relevant study results. Evidence-based guidelines may reduce professional autonomy or clinical judgement. Furthermore, the evidence included in these grading processes is primarily collected from specific subsets of patients who meet strict inclusion criteria for participation in large clinical trials: specifically, registration randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruit patients in whom there is the highest chance to demonstrate the efficacy of tested agents. Consequently, often the results obtained do not allow determination of (i) the generalisability of results obtained in selected populations, or (ii) the most suitable target subgroups in terms of benefit-risk ratio. However, it is well-recognised that significant heterogeneity exists among patients with COPD. Older or very severe COPD patients, patients with a history of asthma and/or allergy, never smokers or patients with multiple comorbidities may not meet inclusion criteria and therefore may not be represented by the evidence used to support most recommendations within guidelines. A recent study by Halpin et al. reported that only 27% of COPD patients are eligible for RCTs. Under-representation of "challenging patients" (i.e. those who do not meet strict eligibility criteria, particularly the elderly, those with significant comorbidities and those requiring long-term oxygen therapy) in RCTs results in evidence-based CPGs that may not be fully adequate to ensure the optimal management of a significant number of patients.

### Treatment patterns in asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^1132JDWT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS) is a complex disease entity with limited guidance surrounding medication therapy.

Objective

To evaluate a patient population with possible ACOS and their medication regimen based on the Global Initiative for Asthma and Global Initiative for COPD joint statement for ACOS.

Methods

This was a retrospective study based at a large clinical practice within a school of medicine. The sample included adults 40 to 85 years old who had an active concurrent diagnosis of asthma and COPD. Patients were considered to have likely inconsistent therapy (only preventive, no rescue medication), inconsistent therapy (neither preventive nor rescue medication), and likely consistent therapy (both preventive and rescue medication or rescue medication alone).

Results

A total of 513 patients were included the study. The majority of the sample were female (75%) and white (87.1%), with an average age of 61 years. About 7% of patients had likely inconsistent therapy, whereas 7.7% had inconsistent therapy to control their airway disease. Never smokers were more likely than former smokers to have inconsistent therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 4.54; CI = 1.86–11.04). Adults 65 years and older were more likely than those aged 40 to 49 years to be in the likely inconsistent therapy group (adjusted OR = 4.01; CI = 1.04–15.34). Patients without any comorbid conditions were more likely than those with 2 or more comorbid conditions to be in the likely inconsistent group (adjusted OR = 3.50; CI = 1.39–8.77).

Conclusion

As the disease definition and treatment recommendations evolve, future studies should continue to monitor ACOS treatment patterns and outcomes.

### CAD-Q (COPD-asthma differentiation questionnaire): performance of a new diagnostic score to differentiate between COPD and asthma in adults [^111oHaDz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the two most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases with great impact on global public health; together they account for most of the worldwide burden of respiratory diseases. According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study update, chronic respiratory diseases were the third leading cause of mortality, accounting for 4 million deaths worldwide; COPD was responsible for 212 million prevalent cases and 16 million incident cases. However, asthma had 262 million prevalent cases and 37 million incident cases, the main contributor to the global age-adjusted rate of prevalence and incidence of chronic respiratory diseases.

Despite sharing some clinical characteristics, the pathophysiological mechanisms of COPD and asthma are unique and their management and prognosis differ in the adult population, making it necessary to make an effective differential diagnosis; COPD is a disease that typically progresses slowly, with persistent symptoms and fixed airflow obstruction, while in asthma, respiratory symptoms are intermittent with periods of air obstruction caused predominantly by bronchial hyperreactivity. The diagnosis of these diseases is based on a combination of clinical history, respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and wheezing, among others; functional tests and, sometimes, biomarkers. However, symptom overlap between COPD and asthma can lead to misdiagnoses and, therefore, inappropriate treatments, particularly in older adults in the primary care setting.

There are questionnaires designed to identify individuals at risk of developing COPD based on sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics and the presence of symptoms, such as the LFQ, CDQ, PUMA, Could it be COPD and COPD PS, questionnaires that, although they are aimed at identifying the presence of COPD, may be useful in identifying the distinguishing characteristics between COPD and asthma. The objective of this study is to develop a new clinical tool, the COPD-Asthma Differentiation Questionnaire (CAD-Q), designed to effectively distinguish between COPD and asthma in the adult population. The aim is to address existing gaps in accurately differentiating these two diseases. This new questionnaire is derived from the questionnaires used in clinical practice to identify COPD in primary care.

### The case for case-finding in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111ELrs2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Missed diagnosis and inadequate treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lead to preventable suffering, inequities, and increasing healthcare costs worldwide. Screening and case-finding are two strategies that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and, ultimately, improved health. Screening is a systematic approach to detect disease early or prevent disease altogether in otherwise healthy individuals. However, in 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is moderate certainty that screening for COPD in asymptomatic adults has no benefit. Case-finding targets at-risk populations or those who are already symptomatic. For example, in a previous clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of case-finding (vs. routine care) in ever-smokers aged 40–79 years without a previous diagnosis of COPD. Using a mailed screening questionnaire followed by spirometry, the case-finding strategy increased the identification of new cases of COPD in primary-care practices over a 12-month period from 2% (usual care group) to 5% (case-finding group). In the landmark UCAP (Undiagnosed COPD and Asthma Population) trial, Aaron and colleagues used a population-based case-finding method to identify adults with respiratory symptoms (e.g. chronic cough, dyspnea, wheeze, sputum production for ⩾6 mo) who lacked a prior diagnosis of lung disease in Canada. Eligible individuals underwent spirometry testing, and 508 adults with evidence of asthma or COPD were randomized to undergo evaluation and management by a pulmonologist and asthma–COPD educator (i.e. intervention group) or usual care by their primary care provider. Both groups received a printout of interpreted spirometry results and the study-directed diagnosis. Clinicians in the intervention arm were also instructed to follow guideline-based care, though no treatment algorithms were provided.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Difficulties in the interpretation of lung function tests in the diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111sXsQB]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To ascertain differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak flow measurement between primary care (several practioners and nurses) and specialists in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Design

A randomized, prospective cohort study of 98 patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of asthma or COPD. Two chest specialists independently interpreted the peak flow and spirometric data and they were also blinded to the primary care results.

Results

There was total agreement in interpretation of the data between general practitioners and specialists in only 20 (20.4%). Levels of diagnostic agreement were highest between the two chest specialists (55%) and lowest between the general practice records and the diagnosis assigned by general practitioners (16%). Disagreement between general practitioners and the two chest specialists was consistent (38%) indicating systematic differences in interpretation.

Conclusions

This study raises concerns about differences in the interpretation of spirometry and peak expiratory flow rates in general and hospital practice and the guidelines on which these interpretations are based.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115TQgF8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

This Executive Summary of the Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2017 report focuses primarily on the revised and novel parts of the document. The most significant changes include: (1) the assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been refined to separate the spirometric assessment from symptom evaluation. ABCD groups are now proposed to be derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbations; (2) for each of the groups A to D, escalation strategies for pharmacologic treatments are proposed; (3) the concept of deescalation of therapy is introduced in the treatment assessment scheme; (4) nonpharmacologic therapies are comprehensively presented; and (5) the importance of comorbid conditions in managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is reviewed.

### Airflow reversibility in patients with asthma… [^1167xjFL]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: The article by Zeller and colleagues discusses how to distinguish asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 1 This distinction is important because the treatments for the two diseases differ. The authors state, "Asthma is diagnosed if airway obstruction on spirometry is reversible with administration of bronchodilators. COPD is diagnosed if airway obstruction… on spirometry is not reversible with bronchodilators". However, studies have shown reversibility in a significant proportion of patients with COPD. In the UPLIFT trial of patients with COPD, 54% of patients had bronchodilator reversibility based on the American Thoracic Society criteria of FEV. 1 improvement of 12% or greater and 200 mL or greater, and 73% of patients had reversibility when using the sole criteria of 12% or greater improvement in FEV 1.

2 A comprehensive review of COPD reversibility in multiple studies concluded that "… many patients with COPD do indeed exhibit bronchodilator reversibility and that reversibility testing is not a reliable measure to differentiate between asthma and COPD. " 3. The 2023 GOLD report states, "… assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction… to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended… and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma, or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids. " 5. In Reply: We appreciate the opportunity to respond to this letter. Our article does not address therapy for asthma and COPD, but rather the diagnosis of the two disease entities and distinguishing between them. We agree that the critical difference between COPD and asthma is that COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible with bronchodilators.

In contrast, asthma is characterized by airflow limitation that is variable and reversible to near normal with bronchodilators. As briefly discussed in our article, robust literature has developed around the clinical reality of coexisting asthma and COPD. 1–4 The natural history of asthma is to progress to fixed obstruction over time. 5 Some have labeled the coexistence of the two disease entities "asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, " and for a time, it appeared that this might become a separate diagnosis. However, it is now standard clinical practice to diagnose both asthma and COPD if the patient meets spirometry criteria for both conditions.
