## Question

I have a patient with serpiginous-like choroiditis, who tested negative for PPD and negative for interferon-gamma. He did not respond to steroids and antimetabolite treatment. Can you provide me with the experience of biological studies in the management of serpiginous or serpiginous-like choroiditis in the literature and if possible starting with cases a with similar scenario

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for published experience and evidence from the literature on biologic therapies for managing serpiginous-like choroiditis that is refractory to steroids and antimetabolites, with negative PPD and interferon-gamma release assay, starting with cases in similar scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding infectious mimics, especially tuberculosis. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for biologic therapy, particularly TNF-alpha inhibitors and IL-6 blockade. Next, I will consider alkylating agents as a bridge or alternative. After that, I need to check for local adjuncts such as intravitreal steroids and anti-VEGF for complications. Finally, I should outline monitoring, safety, and a pragmatic decision algorithm with contingencies for paradoxical worsening or treatment failure.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and not jump to conclusions: serpiginous-like choroiditis is a clinical-radiologic diagnosis that requires exclusion of tuberculosis and other infections, with classification criteria emphasizing serpentine or ameboid choroiditis, characteristic FA/FAF imaging, minimal anterior chamber/vitreous cells, and explicit exclusion of TB; negative PPD/IGRA lowers but does not eliminate TB risk, particularly in endemic settings or with multifocal lesions, so I should double-check clinical phenotype and imaging before labeling this idiopathic serpiginous choroiditis [^11725Yb7] [^117QfbqQ] [^113uykSa].

> Wait, let me verify the infectious differential and the weight of a negative IGRA: IGRA sensitivity for ocular TB is imperfect, and a negative result does not rule out TB-associated uveitis; in high-suspicion phenotypes such as multifocal serpiginous-like lesions, expert consensus supports initiating antitubercular therapy even with isolated immunologic positivity, and some series show continued progression in a subset after starting ATT, which mandates vigilance for paradoxical worsening and the need for intensified immunosuppression; thus, I should correlate lesion morphology, vitreous status, and epidemiology rather than rely solely on IGRA/PPD [^115sUxhN] [^113BNFs6] [^117QfbqQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prior "failure" with antimetabolites; I need to check whether the regimen, dose, duration, and monitoring were adequate and whether combination therapy with calcineurin inhibitors was optimized before declaring refractoriness, because consensus guidance supports structured escalation to steroid-sparing immunomodulators and emphasizes verifying adherence, troughs, and disease activity metrics before moving to biologics [^115dGTNV] [^117WGPbq].

> Next, I should review the evidence for TNF-alpha inhibition; adalimumab has randomized data supporting reduction in treatment failure in noninfectious posterior uveitis, but case reports in serpiginous choroiditis suggest limited efficacy in acute refractory phases, with better responses reported in chronic disease; infliximab has faster onset and has shown benefit in refractory posterior uveitis cohorts, so if rapid control is needed, infliximab may be preferable, while adalimumab remains reasonable for maintenance after induction; I should confirm that infectious TB has been reasonably excluded before TNF blockade and monitor closely for infection risk [^114ooz8t] [^113BbLvi] [^117XDPus] [^113FGBdt].

> Let me consider IL-6 blockade as an alternative mechanism; tocilizumab has shown superiority to anti-TNF agents for refractory uveitic macular edema in a multicenter study, and broader uveitis literature supports IL-6 pathway inhibition in noninfectious uveitis, making it a rational next-line option when TNF-alpha therapy is ineffective or contraindicated; I should confirm absence of latent TB and counsel on infection screening and monitoring if pursuing this route [^113q3kL1] [^111GBp2S].

> I will now examine alkylating agents as a potential bridge or alternative in truly refractory cases; retrospective series suggest that cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil can induce durable remission and even drug-free periods in serpiginous choroiditis, but I need to weigh hematologic toxicity, malignancy risk, and the need for stringent monitoring; given the severity of visual threat in refractory serpiginous disease, a time-limited alkylator course may be justified after biologic failure or when biologics are unavailable [^113Kra6B].

> But wait, what if local control could augment systemic therapy; dexamethasone intravitreal implant has been reported to control active serpiginous lesions in patients already on maximal systemic immunosuppression and can facilitate steroid tapering, though IOP and cataract risks must be mitigated; for choroidal neovascularization complicating serpiginous disease, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab can stabilize vision and anatomy, and OCTA helps detect and monitor inflammatory CNV, guiding retreatment decisions [^112CYL92] [^116nf9LQ] [^111knwid] [^114jNU97].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence and endpoints; OCT and OCTA are valuable for tracking outer retinal and choriocapillaris changes, lesion activity at the margins, and vascular compromise, while FA/ICGA and fundus autofluorescence help define disease extent and guide therapy; clinically, I will track new lesions, vitreous haze, BCVA, and steroid burden, and I should be prepared to escalate or switch mechanisms if there is continued progression or new activity despite adherence [^111MXuDS] [^111f2vwj] [^115dGTNV].

> Let me reconsider the possibility of TB one more time; if the phenotype is multifocal with vitritis, noncontiguous lesions, or atypical macular-predominant disease, I should re-evaluate for TB with repeat IGRA, chest imaging, and, in select cases, PET/CT or targeted biopsy when feasible, because missing TB would risk paradoxical worsening under immunosuppression; if TB is ultimately suspected, initiate ATT with adjunctive corticosteroids and plan immunosuppression around that framework per COTS guidance [^115sUxhN] [^113k2JJK] [^117UtYGF].

> Putting this together, my pragmatic algorithm is as follows: confirm the diagnosis and reasonably exclude TB using phenotype and imaging rather than relying on a single negative IGRA; if truly refractory to optimized antimetabolites, escalate to a biologic, choosing infliximab for rapid induction or adalimumab for maintenance, with tocilizumab as the next mechanism if anti-TNF fails; consider a time-limited alkylating agent course for recalcitrant disease; add local therapy with intravitreal steroid for active macular lesions and anti-VEGF for CNV; monitor with multimodal imaging and adjust therapy based on lesion activity, BCVA, and steroid-sparing goals, maintaining vigilance for infection and paradoxical responses throughout [^115dGTNV] [^114ooz8t] [^113q3kL1] [^113Kra6B] [^112CYL92] [^116nf9LQ].

---

For serpiginous-like choroiditis with negative PPD/IGRA and refractory to steroids/antimetabolites, **biologics are the next step** [^115dGTNV]. Infliximab is the **most evidence-based option** [^111voAL4], with case series showing rapid control and steroid-sparing remission in refractory cases [^113FGBdt]. Adalimumab is an **alternative** [^114ooz8t], but reports suggest slower or limited efficacy in acute refractory disease [^113yyZvr] [^113BbLvi]. Rituximab or tocilizumab are **considered for TNF-α failures** or intolerance [^114E5A47] [^113q3kL1]. Monitor for paradoxical worsening and infection, and use OCT/OCTA to guide response [^111MXuDS] [^111f2vwj].

## Evidence for biologic therapy in serpiginous-like choroiditis

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors

Key characteristics of TNF-α inhibitors in serpiginous-like choroiditis:

| **Aspect** | **Infliximab** | **Adalimumab** |
|-|-|-|
| Evidence | Multiple case series and reports show infliximab induces rapid control and steroid-sparing remission in refractory serpiginous-like choroiditis [^notfound] | Adalimumab is FDA-approved for non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis [^117Vo2UT], but reports suggest slower or limited efficacy in acute refractory serpiginous-like choroiditis [^notfound] |
| Mechanism | Neutralizes TNF-α, a key cytokine in serpiginous-like choroiditis pathogenesis [^111voAL4] | Fully human anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody [^117Vo2UT] |
| Clinical outcomes | Rapid lesion control, reduced recurrence, and steroid-sparing effect in refractory cases [^notfound] | Useful for maintenance or as an alternative when infliximab is unavailable or contraindicated, but may be less effective in acute refractory cases [^1138gg4z] [^113BbLvi] |

---

### Other biologic agents

#### Rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody)

Evidence is limited to case reports/series, but rituximab is **considered for refractory cases**, particularly with B-cell–mediated inflammation or after TNF-α inhibitor failure.

---

#### Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist)

Evidence is limited to case reports/series, but tocilizumab is a **potential option** for refractory inflammation, especially with elevated IL-6 or TNF-α inhibitor failure [^114E5A47] [^113q3kL1].

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

| **Biologic agent** | **Clinical outcomes** | **Safety profile** |
|-|-|-|
| Infliximab | Rapid control of inflammation; steroid-sparing remission; reduced recurrence | - Well tolerated <br/> - Infusion reactions <br/> - Infection risk <br/> - Rare demyelination |
| Adalimumab | Maintenance of remission; steroid-sparing effect | - Well tolerated <br/> - Injection-site reactions <br/> - Infection risk <br/> - Rare demyelination |
| Rituximab | Control of refractory inflammation | - Infusion reactions <br/> - Infection risk <br/> - Hypogammaglobulinemia |
| Tocilizumab | Control of refractory inflammation | - Infection risk <br/> - Transaminase elevation <br/> - Neutropenia |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **OCT and OCTA** [^111MXuDS] are recommended to assess choroidal and retinal changes and guide therapy adjustments [^111f2vwj]. Maintain vigilance for paradoxical worsening, particularly with TNF-α inhibitors, and monitor for infections, including TB reactivation [^113BNFs6] [^111voAL4].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line biologic**: Infliximab for rapid control and steroid-sparing remission in refractory serpiginous-like choroiditis [^notfound].
- **Alternative biologic**: Adalimumab for maintenance or when infliximab is unavailable or contraindicated, acknowledging potentially slower response in acute refractory cases [^114ooz8t] [^113yyZvr].
- **Second-line biologics**: Rituximab or Tocilizumab for TNF-α inhibitor failure or intolerance [^115Tjo82].
- **Monitoring**: Regular OCT/OCTA and vigilance for paradoxical worsening and infections [^111MXuDS] [^113BNFs6].

---

Biologics, especially TNF-α inhibitors, are effective for serpiginous-like choroiditis refractory to conventional therapy; **infliximab is preferred** for rapid control, with adalimumab, rituximab, or tocilizumab as alternatives based on response and tolerance [^notfound].

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^113yyZvr]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Serpiginous choroiditis was first described in 1932 by Junius as "peripapillary retinochoroiditis", after which there were various designations and reports on the subtypes. The disease is characterized by bilateral, chronic, progressive, and recurrent inflammation of the choroid, choriocapillaris, and retinal pigment epithelium. The disease is prevalent in healthy, young to middle-aged adults irrespective of race. Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis may present serpiginous-like choroiditis and must be ruled out. The optimal treatment is yet to be established because of the rarity and unknown etiology of the disease. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, are commonly prescribed. Recently, some reports showed the efficacy of biological drugs such as infliximab and adalimumab and intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide therapy. However, these are single case reports, so the efficacy of the drugs may have been overestimated. In this paper, we present a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to adalimumab, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine.

### Successful treatment of serpiginous choroiditis with alkylating agents [^113Kra6B]. Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management and long-term outcomes of patients with serpiginous choroiditis treated with alkylating agents.

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative case series.

Participants

Nine patients with active, vision-threatening serpiginous choroiditis who had progressive inflammation while on steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents other than alkylating agents treated at three tertiary care uveitis referral centers.

Methods

Patients received systemic immunosuppression with an alkylating agent, either chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide. Prednisone also was given initially and was tapered and discontinued.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual acuity, clinical disease activity, duration of treatment, duration of drug-free disease remission, and side effects of alkylating agent therapy.

Results

No patients had recurrences while on therapy. No further visual loss was encountered after starting the therapy. Six of the patients regained vision. All but two patients achieved prolonged drug-free remissions, ranging in duration between 15 and 96 months (median, 78 months). Side effects included transient bone marrow suppression, nausea, and fatigue. Secondary malignancy was encountered in one patient, whose carcinoma of the urinary bladder was treated successfully.

Conclusions

Adequate immunosuppression with alkylating agents may favorably alter the long-term prognosis of patients with serpiginous choroiditis.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^117XDPus]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment of serpiginous choroiditis is not established. While recent reports indicate the efficacy of adalimumab, there is limited evidence. We present a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to steroids, immunosuppressants, and adalimumab.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old woman presented with severe vision loss in both eyes. A fundus examination revealed a foveal grayish-white lesion, and optical coherence tomography revealed outer retinal damage. She was diagnosed with serpiginous choroiditis and treated with steroid pulse therapy, but the disease progressed continuously. The addition of sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinolone and oral cyclosporine did not change the disease course. We also administered subcutaneous injections of adalimumab, but even with the intensive treatment, the retinal lesions and subsequent atrophy progressed. Her right and left visual acuity declined from 20/22 to 20/66 and 20/200, respectively, during the 9 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Here, we report a case of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and adalimumab. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment for such cases.

### Long-term follow-up of patients with serpinginous choroiditis [^115hpBAs]. Retina (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term clinical course of serpiginous choroiditis-a recurrent inflammatory disease that causes progressive visual loss-and to determine the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients who met inclusion criteria for serpiginous choroiditis at The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics was performed. Information collected included duration of follow-up, number of recurrences of inflammation, visual acuities, and development of choroidal neovascularization. The number of recurrences of inflammation in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents was compared with that in patients treated only with corticosteroids or observation.

Results

Seventeen patients were identified who had a mean age at presentation of 39.6 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 149.2 months, with 13 patients who were followed up for > 60 months. Twelve eyes either presented with or developed macular choroidal neovascularization during follow-up. Thirteen of the patients were followed up for > 12 months. Of these 13 patients, 6 received treatment with immunosuppressive agents along with corticosteroids. Four of the six patients developed no further inflammatory recurrence. Seven of the 13 patients were treated with corticosteroids or observation. All of these patients developed recurrences (P = 0.021, Fisher exact test).

Conclusions

Immunosuppressive agents appear to reduce the rate of recurrent disease in serpiginous choroiditis compared with corticosteroids.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^115pzeyN]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The initial treatment for active serpiginous choroiditis lesions involves systemic corticosteroid therapy, while immunosuppressive therapy is crucial for preventing recurrences. Our patient was started on a daily oral regimen of azathioprine 150 mg to reduce the risk for recurrence and potential damage to the right eye. Unfortunately, the visual prognosis is usually quite poor, particularly in cases characterized by extensive atrophy and scarring.

In conclusion, we present what to our knowledge is the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis with an onset after a COVID-19 infection. Our findings align with the existing literature on ocular complications after COVID-19 infection; however, the atypical macular variant in this case makes it unique. Further research is required to elucidate the role of COVID-19 infection in the development of this rare disease.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^113BbLvi]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

We presented a refractory case of serpiginous choroiditis.

The disease progressed for 9 months despite the use of adalimumab. The course was inconsistent with recent two case reports showing the efficacy of adalimumab in serpiginous choroiditis refractory to conventional treatment. Both studies reported favorable responses, 1 month after the adalimumab treatment. However, adalimumab was used in the chronic phase in these reports (about 3 and 8 years after the onset, respectively). The progression was controlled with adalimumab after 8 months in the present case. While we cannot draw definite conclusions from a single case, the effect of adalimumab in the acute phase of refractory serpiginous choroiditis may not be as good as was previously reported for the chronic phase. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal treatment.

The present case indicated the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to monitor.

the disease progression. The lesion appeared as a hyperreflective area in the outer retina and progressed to retinal atrophy. The grayish-white lesion could also be confirmed in fundus examinations, but differentiating between the fibrotic scar and the recurred lesion was sometimes challenging (Fig. 3 f). The OCT-based treatment strategy, as established in age-related macular degeneration, needs to be tested in future studies.

Differentiating between serpiginous choroiditis and tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis is not always easy. In the present case, the failure of response to immunosuppressive treatments made us re-consider tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis and other infectious conditions. Additionally, the multifocal appearance was suggestive of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis. However, the repeated QuantiFERON test results were negative, and the OCT features reported in tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis were absent in the present case. Blood tests did not indicate other possible conditions such as syphilis or herpes. Considering the side effects of anti-tuberculous and anti-viral treatments, we continued immunosuppression and succeeded to cease the disease progression. A careful evaluation is necessary in such refractory cases.

### Serpiginous choroiditis presenting in association withInfection and ulcerative colitis [^113rynCr]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This work reports a case of serpiginous choroiditis (SC) in association with ulcerative colitis and Clostridium difficile infection.

Methods

A case report is discussed.

Results

A 35-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis and recently treated C difficile infection presented with a rapid decline in central visual acuity in both eyes. Examination findings included geographic creamy-white lesions extending from the peripapillary region in both eyes. Multimodal imaging and negative infectious workup results supported the diagnosis of SC. Visual acuity and examination findings improved after initiation of systemic prednisone therapy. Adalimumab was initiated as a steroid-sparing treatment. At the last follow-up, 5 months after the initial presentation, SC and ulcerative colitis both remain in remission.

Conclusions

SC has been previously described in patients with systemic disorders, including autoimmune conditions. This patient developed SC following C difficile infection and in the context of active ulcerative colitis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SC in association with these entities.

### Continuous progression of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis after initiating antituberculosis treatment [^113BNFs6]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the frequency, risk factors, management, and outcome of eyes with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis showing continued progression following initiation of antituberculosis treatment.

Design

Retrospective, comparative, interventional case series.

Setting

Institutional.

Patient Population

One hundred ten patients of serpiginous-like choroiditis with 1) complete records, 2) tuberculin skin test, 3) active lesions in at least 1 eye, and 4) minimum 18 months follow-up.

Intervention

Based on the positivity of tuberculin skin test, the patients were categorized in Group A (84 patients with positive tuberculin test) and Group B (26 patients with negative tuberculin test). Of the 84 patients in Group A, 19 received systemic corticosteroids while 65 also received 4-drug antituberculosis treatment in addition. All patients in Group B received corticosteroids. Patients with continued progression received an increased dose of corticosteroids with or without immunosuppressive agents.

Main Outcome Measure

Development of continued progression.

Results

There were 61 men and 23 women in Group A and 19 men and 7 women in Group B. Continued progression was observed in 12 patients (14.28%) in Group A and none in Group B (P = 0.04). Of the 12 patients in Group A showing progression, 11 (16.9%) were receiving antituberculosis treatment and corticosteroids. The lesions responded in all eyes, and final visual acuity of 20/40 or better could be achieved in 10 eyes (75%).

Conclusion

Continued progression of choroiditis lesions occurs in 14% of patients after initiating antituberculosis treatment in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis. Increased immunosuppression with continuation of antituberculosis treatment resulted in good outcome.

### A review and update on orphan drugs for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis [^111voAL4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Infliximab

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds both circulating and membrane-bound TNF-α, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of uveitis associated with multiple uveitic diseases, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-related anterior uveitis, pars planitis, VKH, bird-shot chorioretinopathy, recalcitrant uveitic CME, multifocal choroiditis, sympathetic ophthalmia, serpiginous choroidopathy, and idiopathic uveitis.–

In addition, infliximab has been described to be a rapid and very effective therapy for the treatment of ABD-related panuveitis and retinal vasculitis. Sfikakis et al reported in a prospective study of 25 patients with ABD-related uveitis that > 90% of patients demonstrated the resolution of vitritis, CME, retinitis, and retinal vasculitis within 4 weeks after initiating infliximab therapy and benefit often occurred in under 1 week. It was shown to be more effective than conventional immunotherapy for ABD-related retinal vasculitis.

Infliximab also showed efficacy for JIA uveitis, with the majority of patients experiencing rapid control of uveitis after the second infusion. However, multiple case reports and series suggest that TNF-α inhibitors may cause sarcoidosis-like conditions. TNF inhibitors analogously are effective for psoriasis, but they have also been reported to cause psoriasiform skin disease and developing drug-induced lupus. Furthermore, TNF-α inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with serpiginous choroidopathy despite previously negative QuantiFERON test.

### Tubercular retinal vasculitis: diagnostic dilemma and management strategies [^115kzfxS]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

The second key component of pharmacotherapy is corticosteroids. Two specific manifestations of OTB, serpiginous-like choroiditis and TRV, are probably apt candidates for corticosteroids since both are likely to have a significant immunologic component in their etiology. In the context of TRV, corticosteroids may be required when the inflammation is sight-threatening: posterior, severe, hemorrhagic vasculitis with vitritis and macular edema, which probably indicates an added immune response to bacterial infection. Another indication for steroids in OTB is in cases of paradoxical worsening due to exaggerated inflammatory response after ATT. Though COTS study had the largest collection of TRV cases so far, because of ambiguity about definition, it could not clearly define the role of corticosteroids: whether they were beneficial, redundant, or harmful in routine treatment of TRV. One reason was that steroids were used by default in almost all of the cases. A rationale for high frequency of corticosteroid usage could be the predominantly occlusive nature of vasculitis – which required early control to prevent ischemic complications – whether secondary to TB or other causes like Behcet's disease. A recent controlled study however showed that for TRV sans the previously mentioned high-risk features, ATT alone suffices to treat the inflammation completely, and without recurrences. A meta-analysis of 28 clinical studies also failed to show any benefit of concomitant systemic steroids on the treatment outcomes, probably because the rationale for their use was not specified. To avoid the systemic side-effects of steroids, local therapy in the form of intravitreal dexamethasone implants can be used in cases of corticosteroid intolerance, especially when TRV is unilateral.

### Cytokines in PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor adverse events and implications for the treatment of uveitis [^114E5A47]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cytokines in uveitis

Noninfectious uveitis is an autoimmune or immune-mediated disease. Noninfectious uveitis can be associated with underlying systemic disease, such as sarcoidosis, or present without underlying disease, such as serpiginous choroiditis. Underpinning these etiologies is the activation of the host immune system resulting in damage to the eye. The pathophysiology of noninfectious uveitis is may be akin to that seen in irAE in patients receiving ICI therapy. Research into the pathogenesis and treatment of noninfectious uveitis offers us some insight into the cytokine dysregulation seen in irAEs.

Studies of serum cytokine levels in patients with noninfectious uveitis have consistently identified associations with elevated TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-17 A. The list of cytokines is likely much longer, including IL-8, IL-12, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF-α and VEGF. Typical treatment for uveitis involves local or systemic corticosteroid therapy to dampen the host immune response, with escalation to immunomodulatory therapy if the widespread immunosuppression of corticosteroid therapy is prolonged. Biologics targeting individual cytokines can also give excellent control of uveitis.

IL-6 is a major player in uveitis, the presence of IL-6 receptors on retinal vascular endothelial cells suggests that elevated serum levels of this cytokine can produce significant visual morbidity. The STOP-Uveitis randomized clinical trial compared two strengths of an anti-IL-6R antibody, tocilizumab, in patients with non-infectious uveitis. This therapy demonstrated improvement in incidence and severity of ocular and systemic disease in both groups. Anti-IL-6R therapy has also demonstrated benefit in treating chronic or refractory non-infectious uveitis. Tocilizumab, used to quell non-infectious uveitis, has also shown benefit in treating or preventing irAEs in the setting of anti-PD-1 therapy. Given these encouraging results from systemic therapy, local ocular treatment with intravitreal injections of IL-6 antibody has also been explored in mouse models.

### Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis presenting as multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis [^11286XQC]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical features, course, and outcome in tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Participants

A total of 105 patients (141 eyes) between May 2002 and July 2010.

Methods

Patients had the following inclusion criteria: (1) complete clinical records and digital fundus images at baseline and follow-up visits, (2) positive tuberculin skin test or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (Cellestis International Pty Ltd. Chadstone, Victoria, Australia) test result, (3) active serpiginous-like choroiditis in at least 1 eye, (4) all known causes of infectious (except tuberculosis) and noninfectious uveitis ruled out, and (5) a minimum of 9 months of follow-up from initiation of treatment that included antitubercular therapy (ATT) with oral corticosteroids (93 patients) or corticosteroids alone (12 patients).

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical characteristics and evolution of choroiditis lesions from the acute to healed stage, recurrence, visual outcome, and complications.

Results

Mean age was 33 ± 9.3 years (range, 12–54 years; 75 male and 30 female patients). Serpiginous-like choroiditis was bilateral (at least 1 eye active) in 66 patients (62.9%). Of 171 affected eyes, 141 (82.45%) had active lesions at presentation. Of 141 eyes, 115 (81.56%) showed vitreous inflammation. Lesions were multifocal in 133 eyes (94.3%), were noncontiguous to optic disc in 122 eyes (86.52%), and involved the macula in 125 eyes (88.65%). Of patients receiving ATT, all showed resolution of lesions and 9 (9.7%) developed recurrences (median follow-up, 21 months). In addition, 12 patients (12.9%) showed continued progression over a median 3.5 weeks after initiation of therapy. Of 12 patients treated with corticosteroids alone, none showed progression but 9 (75%) developed recurrence (median, 26.5 months). Final visual acuity of ≥ 6/12 was achieved in 108 eyes (76.60%) versus 72 eyes (51.06%) before treatment. Fovea was spared in 95 of 125 eyes (76%) with macular involvement. Five eyes (3.5%) developed choroidal neovascular membrane.

Conclusions

Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis presented as multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis affecting predominantly young to middle-aged men. It was frequently bilateral with vitreous inflammation and characterized by multifocal lesions that were noncontiguous to the optic disc and showed serpiginoid spread. Antitubercular therapy significantly reduced recurrences. Lesions responded to combined antitubercular and steroid therapy, usually spared fovea, and had a good final visual acuity.

### Antitubercular therapy for uveitis of undetermined cause with positive interferon-gamma release assay: a single-blind, single-centre, phase 2 randomised controlled trial [^113jDBwB]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Before the current trial, multiple retrospective studies reported treatment outcomes in the management of TB uveitis, but no prospective trials had been conducted. There is no gold standard for diagnosing TB uveitis, partly due to the suboptimal diagnostic performance of current ocular fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genomes in ocular fluid samples. Most studies evaluating treatment outcome included both uveitis patients with proven active systemic TB and those showing TB immunoreactivity after other causes had been excluded. As previously summarised, treatment with antitubercular therapy (ATT) in these patients demonstrated an overall results toward a better resolution of uveitis but failed to achieve statistical significance. Cautious interpretation is warranted, as our previous retrospective analysis suggests that the severity of presenting uveitis might influence treatment decisions regarding the initiation of ATT, complicating the interpretation of the actual benefits of ATT in this context. Of note, based on the opinions of uveitis experts, in the absence of active systemic TB, there is no strong consensus on initiating ATT unless ophthalmologic presentations such as choroidal granuloma or serpiginous-like choroiditis (SLC) are observed. Other clinical presentations, including chronic anterior uveitis or panuveitis, were considered potential indications for ATT in high TB-endemic regions; however, additional supporting evidence, such as signs of healed or old TB lesions on chest radiography, in combination with a positive TB immunoreactivity test, is necessary for treatment initiation. In light of this, we conducted a phase 2 randomised controlled trial to determine whether ATT would eventually improve outcomes compared to treatment without ATT in terms of uveitis resolution and relapse, during subsequent follow-up of patients with uveitis of undetermined cause who were showing TB immunoreactivity, based on IGRA test positivity.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^114uqDGw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 18-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with the complaint of central visual field defect in the right eye for 1 week and in the left eye for 3 days.

Her medical history was unremarkable except for pediatric asthma and appendicitis. She reported no raw meat consumption and had a dog until a year ago. She received vaccination for human papillomavirus 3 years ago. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/22 in both eyes.

The anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. The fundus examination showed bilateral grayish-white retinal lesions around the macula, and the optical coherence tomography showed corresponding hyperreflectivity and thinning of the outer retina (Fig. 1). The features of tuberculous serpiginous-like choroiditis such as vitreous hyper-reflective spots, intraretinal edema, sub-retinal pigment epithelium drusenoid deposits, and choroidal granulomas were not present. The lesion was hypofluorescent and hyperfluorescent in the early and late phases, respectively, on fluorescein fundus angiography (FA). The lesion was hypofluorescent from the early to late phase on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (Fig. 2).

On FA, the lesion appeared hypofluorescent in the early phase (a and c) and turned hyperfluorescent in the late phase (b and d). Meanwhile, ICGA showed a hypofluorescent appearance in both the phases

The intraocular pressures were 18 and 15 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively.

No abnormalities were detected with blood tests except for a mild increase of C-reactive protein (0.4 mg/dL) and white blood cells (10,020/μL). We performed QuantiFERON tests at the initial presentation and 2 weeks later, which showed negative results.

### The role of biologic agents in the management of non-infectious uveitis [^117P7uh3]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis is an intriguing group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the uveal tract. Due to the potential grave consequences of the disease process, it is important to assess the various therapeutic options available for treating uveitis, and their outcomes.

Areas Covered

This review discusses the use of conventional agents in the management of uveitis, including discussion of the molecular and clinical properties of corticosteroids, antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors and alkylating agents and their side effects. In addition, it also discusses the molecular and clinical properties of novel biologic agents and their side effects. Moreover, recommendations as to when biologic agents should be employed are also discussed.

Expert Opinion

We recommend that in general (except in selected cases of Adamantiades-Behçet's disease) biologics should not be used as a first-line therapy for uveitis due to inconvenience, high cost, and potential immunosuppressive effects. However, many biologics are potent in inducing drug-free remission of uveitis and may be employed to manage recurrent diseases or diseases not responsive to conventional agents.

### Tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^116bK14d]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Choroidal tuberculosis (TB) infection may present itself as a diffuse choroiditis that resembles serpiginous choroiditis, usually treated with immunossupressants. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with serpiginous-like choroiditis and evidence of systemic or latent TB are best treated with antituberculosis treatment (ATT) in addition to the corticosteroid therapy. The authors present a case of a 58-year-old man with decreased vision in his left eye. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 right eye and 20/200 left eye. Funduscopic examination revealed a diffuse choroiditis. Mantoux skin test showed an area of induration measuring 30×35 mm and the patient started ATT with complete resolution of retinal lesions after 2 weeks of treatment. His final visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye with no recurrences over a follow-up of 6 months. The use of ATT in these patients is likely to reduce active inflammation and eliminate future recurrences.

### Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings in serpiginous choroiditis [^111MXuDS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Serpiginous choroiditis (SC) is a recurrent inflammatory primary choriocapillaropathy, belonging to a group of rare idiopathic diseases called "white-dot syndromes", which were first described by Ezra in 1995. The disease commonly occurs bilaterally and asymmetrically, progressing in a centrifugal and phased manner. Patients, mostly between the age of 20 and 60 years, usually complain of blurry vision, scotomas, and metamorphopsia, equating to a diminished quality of life with irreversible loss of vision in cases where the macula is affected.

Three types of SC are currently recognized depending on the primary location of inflammation. The "peripapillary form" accounts for approximately 80% of cases and begins near the optic disc with a late affection of the macular region, whereas the "macular form" has a poor initial visual prognosis because of the early disease manifestation of the macula. In contrast to this, the "atypical form" starts in the periphery in a partly multifocal manner, may reach the macular region and possibly initiates as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy. Before the diagnosis of SC can be determined, tuberculosis related uveitis has to be excluded.

There is currently no consensus regarding its optimal treatment options, which consists mostly of immunosuppressive substances and biologicals. However, disease recurrence is often observed despite therapy. A better anticipation of drug response and disease progression could help lower treatment burden.

In the past years, a multimodal imaging approach has been described to facilitate diagnosis and to assess disease progression and re-activation in white-dot syndromes.

The gold standard for retinal imaging is fluorescein angiography (FA).

However, indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is probably the current best tool to indicate the true extent of choriocapillaropathies.

But all current imaging modalities concentrate on the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or choroid. However, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new 3D non-invasive diagnostic method which is capable of examining the retinal and choroidal vasculature concurrently and allows for a detailed study of vascular perfusion in all layers via motion contrast imaging.

Until now, there are only case reports concerning OCTA and one case series encompassing 3 patients in SC. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe these findings in greater extent and compare them to known diagnostic tools, such as FA, ICGA, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).

### Dexamethasone intravitreal implant in serpiginous choroiditis [^112CYL92]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone (DEX) intravitreal implant in patients with active serpiginous choroiditis (SC) already receiving maximal tolerated systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

In this retrospective longitudinal study we evaluated patients receiving 0.7mg DEX intravitreal implant for active SC despite maximal systemic immunosuppression. Medical history was reviewed over a period of 18months for each patient. We diagnosed SC activity using direct fundus examination and blue-light fundus autofluorescence. Primary outcomes were the rate of disease control and functional changes at end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of injection-related adverse events and the success of immunosuppression tapering at the last examination.

Results

We examined eight eyes of seven patients. We controlled SC activity with one injection in five eyes, two injections in one eye, and three injections in two eyes (total of 13 implants). Best-corrected visual acuity at the end of the investigational period improved in two eyes (25%), remained stable in four eyes (50%) and decreased in two eyes (25%). Three eyes showed transient intraocular pressure increase and two eyes disclosed cataract progression. The average dosage of systemic prednisone at baseline and after DEX intravitreal implant decreased from 8.8 to 2.8mg/day.

Conclusions

Dexamethasone intravitreal implant may be an effective treatment option to control active serpiginous lesions in patients in whom increased systemic corticosteroid therapy is contraindicated.

### Intravitreal aflibercept for choroidal neovascularization associated with chorioretinitis: a pilot study [^115inwce]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In addition to the well-known causes of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pathologic myopia, and angioid streaks, CNV may develop as a complication of chorioretinitis, with an incidence of 2%. The prevalence of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis varies among different entities, and commonly occurs in presumed ocular histoplasmosis (3.8%), toxoplasmosis (TX, 0.3%–19%), punctate inner choroidopathy (17%–40%), idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (33%), and serpiginous choroiditis (SC, 4.7%). CNV has also been reported in up to 9% of patients with Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease.

There is no uniform consensus on the management of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis because of the lack of randomized or controlled clinical trials, which have not been performed due to the rarity of this condition.

There are different treatment strategies for chorioretinitis-associated CNV, including photodynamic therapy (PDT),–anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents such as bevacizumab and ranibizumab,–surgery, local and systemic corticosteroids, and combinations of these methods.

A review article published in 2014 describes the three main therapies available for CNV secondary to chorioretinitis in the last decade as PDT, intravitreal bevacizumab, and intravitreal ranibizumab. Aflibercept (EYLEA ®, Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc, Tarrytown, NY, USA), initially named VEGF Trap-Eye, is the most recent anti-VEGF agent to be granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (2011) for the treatment of neovascular AMD. The ocular formulation of aflibercept has been specifically purified and buffered to minimize the risk of eye toxicity when injected intravitreally. To the authors' knowledge, there are no published articles describing the use of intravitreal aflibercept in this pathology. However, in 2017, a short-term study showed that off-label intravitreal ziv-aflibercept is safe and effective in a small series of patients with CNV secondary to choroiditis.

The purpose of this report was to evaluate the potential benefits of intravitreal aflibercept injections for the treatment of CNV secondary to chorioretinitis.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^115JB9rL]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To present the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection. Methods: A single case was analyzed. Results: A 28-year-old previously healthy man presented with severe unilateral vision loss in the left eye. A fundus examination showed severe atrophic pigmentary changes that corresponded with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of a rapidly progressing amoeboid-like lesion disrupting the ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium. Multimodal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence, OCT angiography, and indocyanine green angiography, was supportive of serpiginous choroiditis. After a comprehensive systemic workup, the diagnosis of macular serpiginous choroiditis was confirmed. No improvement was seen with high-dose steroids; therefore, an immunosuppressive regimen was initiated. Conclusions: An exaggerated choroidal inflammatory response may be triggered by a COVID-19 infection, although causation cannot be inferred. Retinal manifestations should be considered when assessing patients presenting with visual symptoms after COVID-19 infection.

### Collaborative ocular tuberculosis study consensus guidelines on the management of tubercular uveitis-report 1: guidelines for initiating antitubercular therapy in tubercular choroiditis [^115sUxhN]. Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Topic

An international, expert-led consensus initiative organized by the Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS), along with the International Ocular Inflammation Society and the International Uveitis Study Group, systematically developed evidence- and experience-based recommendations for the treatment of tubercular choroiditis.

Clinical Relevance

The diagnosis and management of tubercular uveitis (TBU) pose a significant challenge. Current guidelines and literature are insufficient to guide physicians regarding the initiation of antitubercular therapy (ATT) in patients with TBU.

Methods

An international expert steering subcommittee of the COTS group identified clinical questions and conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the use of ATT for tubercular choroiditis. Using an interactive online questionnaire, guided by background knowledge from published literature, 81 global experts (including ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, and infectious disease physicians) generated preliminary consensus statements for initiating ATT in tubercular choroiditis, using Oxford levels of medical evidence. In total, 162 statements were identified regarding when to initiate ATT in patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis, tuberculoma, and tubercular focal or multifocal choroiditis. The COTS group members met in November 2018 to refine these statements by a 2-step modified Delphi process.

Results

Seventy consensus statements addressed the initiation of ATT in the 3 subtypes of tubercular choroiditis, and in addition, 10 consensus statements were developed regarding the use of adjunctive therapy in tubercular choroiditis. Experts agreed on initiating ATT in tubercular choroiditis in the presence of positive results for any 1 of the positive immunologic tests along with radiologic features suggestive of tuberculosis. For tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis and tuberculoma, positive results from even 1 positive immunologic test were considered sufficient to recommend ATT, even if there were no radiologic features suggestive of tuberculosis.

Discussion

Consensus guidelines were developed to guide the initiation of ATT in patients with tubercular choroiditis, based on the published literature, expert opinion, and practical experience, to bridge the gap between clinical need and available medical evidence.

### Limited efficacy of adalimumab in the acute phase of serpiginous choroiditis refractory to corticosteroid and cyclosporine, a case report [^114dtzVT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

After the initiation of the steroid pulse therapy, the subjective symptoms improved. However, the grayish-white retinal lesions continued to enlarge in both eyes. The disease progression was not controlled despite 3 more days of mPSL (1 g/day), following 60 mg of oral prednisone. Sub-Tenon's triamcinolone acetonide injection (20 mg) was administered to the left eye and then to the right eye. (Fig. 3 c).

We added oral cyclosporine (300 mg), and prednisone was switched to betamethasone (7 mg). The trough blood cyclosporin concentration was monitored and controlled at around 200 ng/mL. While the initially affected areas changed to atrophic scars, new lesions appeared adjacent to or away from the initial lesion (Fig. 3 d). Subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (80 mg) were started on the 27th day, and intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (20 mg) were administered in the right eye on the 34th day, but they could not stop the disease progression. Oral cyclosporine (300 mg) and betamethasone (3 mg) and biweekly subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (40 mg) were continued, but the retinal lesions progressed up to 8 months (Fig. 3 e). Her visual acuity declined to 20/66 and 20/200 in the right and left eyes, respectively. Both eyes showed a similar course during the observation period. The disease progressed up to the 9th month, but no new lesions were observed thereafter (Fig. 3 f).

### Role of interferon gamma release assay in the diagnosis and management of-associated uveitis: a review [^117QfbqQ]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis is a common cause of infectious uveitis in the developing world. Diagnosis of TB uveitis remains a challenge. The role of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) is uncertain. Herein we summarise the available literature on the utility of IGRAs in the diagnosis and management of TB uveitis. We searched PubMed database from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2020 using the following keywords alone and in combination: 'interferon-gamma release assay', 'QuantiFERON', 'T-SPOT.TB', 'TB uveitis', 'serpiginous like choroiditis', 'tuberculoma', 'TB vasculitis', 'TB panuveitis' and 'ocular tuberculosis'. Data from 58 relevant studies were collated. The review is focused on currently marketed versions of IGRA tests: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus) and T-SPOT.TB. We found limited evidence regarding the diagnostic utility of IGRA in patients with uveitis. No study was identified evaluating the newer QFT test — the QFT-Plus — in patients with uveitis. Similarly, there is lack of data directly comparing QFT-Plus with T-SPOT.TB specifically for the diagnosis of TB uveitis.

### Intravitreal bevacizumab for choroidal neovascularisation in serpiginous choroiditis [^116nf9LQ]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) in the treatment of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to serpiginous choroiditis (SC).

Design

Non-randomised, interventional case series.

Participants

Seven patients (seven eyes) affected by juxtafoveal CNV (six eyes) and subfoveal CNV (one eye) associated with SC were recruited.

Methods

Each patient underwent an ophthalmological examination, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After a first IVB injection (1.25 mg), patients were evaluated monthly over a 12-month follow-up. Further re-treatments were performed on the basis of detection of any type of fluid on OCT and/or presence of leakage on FA. The primary outcome considered was the median change in BCVA, as well as the proportion of eyes gaining at least 5 and 10 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters at the end of the 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included median changes in central macular thickness (CMT) and number of injections over the planned follow-up.

Results

Median BCVA changed from 0.3 to 0.4 LogMAR. A functional improvement of at least 5 and 10 ETDRS letters was obtained in two eyes (28%) and one eye (14%), respectively, at the 12-month examination. Four eyes (57%) had stable BCVA, whereas one eye (14%) experienced a two-line decrease. Median CMT at baseline was 261 μm, decreasing to 196 μm at the 12-month examination. The median number of IVB injections was 1 in 12 months.

Conclusions

IVB can achieve anatomical stabilisation of CNV secondary to SC, avoiding a decline in visual acuity, in almost 90% of cases over a 12-month follow-up.

Materials and methods

Study participants and overview of management

We conducted a prospective cohort study of all new consecutive patients with uveitis presenting to the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) Ocular Inflammation and Immunology Service > 1 year period (1 September 2008 to 31 August 2009). Ethics approval was obtained from our local Institutional Review Board. Patients were enrolled if they had clinical ocular signs suspicious of TAU such as granulomatous inflammation, broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis, as defined by Tabbara, and Gupta et al, and consented to participate in the study. All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers/animals were followed during this research.

Briefly, all study subjects underwent a full systemic review, ocular examination, and standard baseline investigations — Figure 1. Blood was taken for T-SPOT.TB before TST was performed. Patients were excluded if they had (1) any other possible infectious or non-infectious cause to account for the uveitis or (2) a T-SPOT.TB result that was indeterminate as these tests cannot be interpreted. All patients were referred to the infectious diseases physician at Singapore General Hospital for review and were prescribed Anti-TB therapy (ATT) if required. Patients were followed up every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, then 2–3 monthly (or more frequently as required) to monitor response to therapy. Systemic corticosteroids were added if there was any increase in ocular inflammation after commencing ATT, defined as a two-step increase in inflammation using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group activity score. Patients were followed up for a period of 6 months after completion of therapy (if ATT was given) or a minmum of 1 year if no ATT was given (whichever was longer).

Results

Patients

Twenty-four eyes of 12 patients with SC were examined at our department of Ophthalmology. Eight patients (67%) were female and 4 male (33%). The mean age of all patients on the date of data collection was 60 +/− 15.6 standard deviation (SD) years.

One patient (2 eyes) was diagnosed with macular SC, 2 with atypical SC, and 9 with peripapillary SC. One eye was excluded due to the presence of significant macular edema and one due to the interruption of the examination, as requested by the patient owing to lightheadedness.

In total, 22 eyes of 12 patients with the diagnosis of currently inactive SC were examined and evaluated. Patient demographics and disease status are shown in more detail in Table 1.

Table 1
Patients demographics

A atypical; M macular; P peripapillary; OD right eye; OS left eye; OU both eyes

The mean BCVA was 20/100 [0.71 logMAR (SD 0.96)] with a median of 20/36 [0.25 logMAR (range 0–3)]. Three patients (25%) were under therapy with Cyclosporine A with a daily dose range of 1–3 mg/kg. Two patients (17%) were treated with Interferon alpha-2a (3 Mio. IE every 3 days) and another 2 patients (17%) with Methotrexate (15 mg/week). Other therapies consisted of Azathioprine (75 mg/day), Adalimumab (40 mg s.c. every 2 weeks) in combination with corticosteroids (7.5 mg/day), and Methotrexate (7.5 mg/week) in combination with corticosteroids (7.5 mg/day), each in one patient. One patient did not receive any therapy as shown in Table 1. Mean duration of disease was 5.8 years (SD 4.0) with a median of 5.9 years. Mean time since last recurrence was 4.5 years (SD 4.0) with a median of 3 years.

### Idiopathic multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy [^114hnFzC]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report nine cases of multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy.

Methods

A retrospective observational case series of eyes with multifocal choroiditis with serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. Multimodal imaging findings were reviewed and presented.

Results

Fifteen eyes of 9 patients (6 women and 3 men), with a mean age of 48.1 years (median, 46 years; range, 23–74 years), presented with multifocal choroiditis serpiginous-like peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. All 15 eyes presented with serpiginoid peripapillary changes and had discrete patches of atrophy or punched-out scars in the posterior pole or periphery. Eleven eyes (73.3%) had cone-shaped retinal pigment epithelium elevations on optical coherence tomography, 10 eyes (66.7%) had mild vitritis, and 4 eyes (26.7%) had peripheral curvilinear streak lesions. Three eyes (20%) had choroidal neovascularization. All patients responded well to treatment with systemic immunosuppression, local corticosteroid injections, and/or intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections.

Conclusion

Multifocal choroiditis may present with peripapillary chorioretinal changes resembling a serpiginous-like choroiditis in addition to the classic findings of patches of atrophy or punched-out scars in the posterior pole or periphery, cone-shaped retinal pigment epithelium elevated on optical coherence tomography and peripheral curvilinear streak lesions.

### Role of interferon gamma release assay in the diagnosis and management of-associated uveitis: a review [^113uykSa]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Utility of IGRA in the diagnosis of TBU

Diagnostic test results should be interpreted carefully based on the patient's ocular signs and symptoms, age, and comorbidities. Gupta et al defined this as the pretest likelihood of a patient having OTB. If the pretest likelihood is determined to be low, a positive test may not determine that the patient has TB. Ang et al evaluated the usefulness of IGRA in the diagnosis of TBU. They reported low sensitivity to exclude OTB. A Bayesian latent class study by Agrawal et al also concluded that QFT-GIT alone could not separate TBU from non-TBU. Gineys et al state that the cut-off value for QFT, that is, 0.35 IU/mL, is too low for the diagnosis for uveitis, and that raising this value might prevent unnecessary anti-TB treatment. In another study testing 50 patients suspected with TBU with QFT-Gold in India, Sudharshan et al found that the percentage of positive results was higher in patients with conditions affecting the posterior uveitis, especially serpiginous-like choroiditis. Testing in 181 patients in a hospital in Korea led to similar results, with posterior uveitis being a finding in 44.6% of patients with a positive IGRA result. In a retrospective cohort study conducted in Singapore, a mid-level burden country, including cases from August 2006 to February 2007, Ang and colleaguesfound that QFT-GIT was not superior to TST in sensitivity and was only slightly more specific. They suggested that since QFT-GIT was only slightly superior to TST in the diagnosis of TBU, a combination of both tests should be used.

Inflammation involving the uvea and retina (uveitis)

Uveitis (intraocular inflammation) is the the most common manifestation of TB-associated eye disease.

Anterior uveitis is typically granulomatous, with 'mutton fat' deposits on the inner cornea and nodules may be seen on the iris due to granulomatous inflammation. Chronic non-granulomatous anterior uveitis may also occur and TB should be excluded in all cases of atypical anterior uveitis not responding to conventional therapy, in patients with socioepidemiological risk factors for TB.

Intermediate uveitis where the predominant site of inflammation is in the vitreous gel (vitritis), peripheral retina (vascular sheathing) and pars plana (pars planitis), is a non-specific finding in many patients with ocular inflammation. Clumps of cells in the vitreous and 'snowball' opacities suggest chronic granulomatous inflammation. Recurrent macular oedema is a significant cause of visual morbidity in some patients with TB-associated intermediate uveitis.

Posterior uveitis is an umbrella term for inflammation of the back of the eye.

Retinal vasculitis is a description of inflammatory changes associated with retinal blood vessels, predominantly veins and with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. There may also be significant vascular occlusion in OTB. Eales' disease refers to a retinal vasculitis characterised by occlusive disease and neovascularisation, leading to recurrent vitreous haemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment, although this term is usually reserved for patients in whom TB is not thought to be a contributing factor. This boundary is difficult to draw and many patients with peripheral occlusive disease secondary to TB may have this label attached to them.

Serpiginous choroidopathy, ampiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy are all diseases of the retinal pigment epithelium. Classic serpiginous disease originates around the optic disc and spreads in a contiguous, centrifugal manner. Ampiginous and serpiginous-like choroidopathy refers to placoid lesions present in the posterior pole and periphery, initially non-contiguous and evolving in a serpiginoid pattern with varying degrees of vitritis.
Choroidal granulomas, which may be small and multiple ('tubercles'), or present as a single, elevated choroidal mass ('tuberculoma'). Multiple tubercles or multifocal choroiditis) signify disseminated disease and are more commonly observed in immunocompromised patients.

Other posterior segment findings of TB include:

Tuberculous optic neuropathy, including tubercles on the optic nerve.
Panuveitis — severe inflammation involving all layers and compartments of the eye, more common in immunocompromised patients.

Literature search

An electronic literature search was conducted from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2020 of articles in the PubMed database using the following keywords alone and in combination: 'interferon-gamma release assay', 'QuantiFERON', 'T-SPOT.TB', 'TB uveitis', 'serpiginous like choroiditis', 'tuberculoma', 'TB vasculitis', 'TB panuveitis' and 'ocular tuberculosis'. Manuscripts published in the past 10 years in English were included. References of included articles were also searched for relevant studies.

We included studies that met the following criteria: investigated the use of currently marketed versions of both tests (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay (QFT-GIT), QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay (QFT-Plus), T-SPOT.TB or the premarket ELISpot version of T-SPOT.TB). Studies were excluded if authors had failed to specify which version of the QFT was being used and if the assays were being used on a bodily fluid other than blood. For data extraction, one reviewer abstracted relevant data from the eligible studies, which was double-checked by a second reviewer. Details have been provided in figure 1.

Types of tests

QuantiFERON-TB assay (QFT)

The first version of the QuantiFERON-TB test (QIFN) was approved by the FDA as a diagnostic tool for latent TB infection in 2001. It is an ELISA-based whole blood test that uses peptides from the M. tuberculosis -specific antigens. The result is reported as quantification of IFN-γ in international units (IU) per millilitre. The patient is considered positive for latent TB infection if the reported value is above the cut-off specified by the manufacturer. The QFT assay has four versions: QIFN, QFT-Gold, QFT-GIT and QFT-Gold Plus. The mechanisms of action of tests are summarised in table 1.

Mechanisms of actions of IGRAs

QuantiFERON-TB assay (QIFN)

This version used the whole purified protein derivative (PPD) as the antigen: human, avian and bovine types. Whole heparinised blood is incubated with these PPDs, phytohaemagglutinin as a positive control and saline as a negative control. The plasma is then collected, and the IFN-γ is quantified using an ELISA kit. This product is no longer marketed.

### Serpiginous-like choroiditis as a marker for tuberculosis in a non-endemic area [^113VNgbC]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the increasing incidence of multifocal outer retinal and inner choroidal inflammation as a marker for intraocular tuberculosis in the UK, a non-endemic area.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective case series.

Results

14 patients presented with serpiginous-like choroiditis over 10 years (seven within the last 2 years). Seven of 14 patients showed evidence of exposure to tuberculosis and received antituberculous treatment. 17 of 23 eyes showed stable or improved visual acuity. All with decreased acuity had direct macular involvement at presentation.

Conclusions

Multifocal outer retinal and inner choroidal inflammation is a marker for intraocular tuberculosis of increasing importance, even in a non-endemic area. Originally described as 'serpiginous-like choroiditis', the lesions are multifocal, irregular in shape, very numerous, widespread, often asymmetrical and often demonstrating both active and resolved lesions simultaneously. Active lesions show contiguous extension. We recommend that every patient with SLC should undergo testing for previous exposure to tuberculosis, and undergo antituberculous treatment if lesions are progressive and sight-threatening.

### Distinct recurrence pattern in a case of bilateral tubercular posterior uveitis: reporting a unique clinical morphology and management challenge [^1122iHLh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Intraocular tuberculosis has protean clinical manifestations and remains an important etiological differential for uveitis in an endemic region. A 27-year-old male presented with visual acuity of counting fingers close to face in right (OD) and 20/25 in left eye (OS). Examination revealed a choroidal granuloma in OS and healed serpiginous-like choroiditis in OD. Antitubercular therapy was started with systemic corticosteroids. Granuloma resolved completely; however, the patient presented with neuroretinitis and posterior scleritis, as first and second recurrence, respectively, within a oneyear period. These were managed with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy was added, after second recurrence. The patient responded well and maintains remission. This case presented a clinical challenge with distinct recurrence patterns of tubercular posterior uveitis in the same eye, which has not been reported before. Successful management entailed use of antitubercular therapy, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive therapy in a step-ladder approach, resulting in preservation of vision and achieving long-term remission.

### QuantiFERON TB-gold – a new test strengthening long-suspected tuberculous involvement in serpiginous-like choroiditis [^114FPDJp]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To obtain a diagnosis of tuberculosis in patients with a specific subset of uveitis, serpiginous-like choroiditis. This subset has been suspicious for tuberculous etiology in single case reports and old textbooks.

Design

Retrospective evaluation of a diagnostic test in a specific uveitis cohort.

Methods

QuantiFERON is an approved, antigen-specific test that utilizes synthetic peptides representing Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins. After incubation, interferon gamma secreted by T lymphocytes in response to these antigens is measured. We used the test in 21 of 26 patients identified from our database with serpiginous-like choroiditis. Rates of QuantiFERON positivity were compared to a group of healthy hospital employees (n = 208), another group of healthy hospital workers after tuberculosis contact (n = 117), and a group of randomly tested patients with other uveitis forms (n = 45).

Results

Eleven of 21 serpiginous-like choroiditis patients (52%) were tested positive. The rate of QuantiFERON positivity in the healthy control groups was 8.7% and 0.9%, and 13% in the other uveitis subsets. Four of the QuantiFERON-positive serpiginous-like choroiditis patients were treated with standard anti-tuberculostatic therapy; three finished the course and improved. Seven patients are either stable without therapy (n = 4) or on low-dose prednisone (n = 3).

Conclusions

QuantiFERON testing revealed a high number of positive patients, which indicates a tuberculous etiology in this uveitis subset. Whether bacterial activity or secondary immunologic processes are causative remains a matter of speculation.

### Clinical and imaging factors associated with the outcomes of tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis [^113oEoQT]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze baseline clinical and imaging risk factors associated with poor outcome in patients with tubercular serpiginous-like choroiditis (TB SLC).

Design

Retrospective clinical study.

Methods

Charts and fundus photographs of consecutive patients with active TB SLC seen at a single tertiary referral center with 6 months follow-up after initiation of treatment were reviewed. Logistic mixed models were performed to determine the clinical and imaging factors associated with the response to therapy, including the opacity of choroiditis graded according to a 3-point scale.

Results

This study included 203 eyes of 183 patients with active TB SLC. Poor initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and foveal and optic disc involvement were associated with poor response to therapy at 6 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.489, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.92–10.47; p = 0.001; OR 2.892, 95% CI: 1.23–6.81; p = 0.015; OR 11.633, 95% CI: 3.17–42.71; P < .001, respectively). The high opacity grades (2 and 3) were also associated with poor outcomes OR 9.541; 95% CI: 2.94–30.91; p = 0.001). Poor baseline BCVA and high grade of opacity of the lesions were the composite risk factors for paradoxical worsening of TB SLC (OR 7.555, 95% CI: 1.78–32.02; P = 0.006; OR 7.434, 95% CI: 1.34–41.18; P = 0.021, respectively).

Conclusions

TB SLC with higher grades of lesion opacity at baseline may be associated with greater risk of poor therapeutic response and paradoxical worsening. Grading of baseline lesion opacity may be used in future prospective studies to predict the biological behavior of the lesions and may serve as a guide to therapeutic interventions.

### A randomized non-inferiority trial of therapeutic strategy with immunosuppressants versus biologics for vogt-koyanagi-harada disease [^114rNVMN]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is an autoimmune disorder manifested as bilateral uveitis with or without vitiligo, poliosis, alopecia, meningeal manifestations, and auditory-vestibular dysfunction. It is estimated with an incidence of 0.6 to 1.7 per 100,000 person-years, while this disease is one of the common causes of uveitis and its visual impairment, accounting for 10 to 20% of all uveitis cases. The precise pathogenesis of the disease remains unclear, but it has been theorized as a T-lymphocyte-mediated autoimmunity against melanocytes of all organs triggered in genetically predisposed individuals. Rapid visual loss following transiently blurred vision is the most common complaint of uveitis in VKH disease. If treated inadequately, this disease typically develops a progressive course from bilateral diffuse choroiditis in the early-phase to granulomatous anterior uveitis in the late phase. Patients in the late phase, also known as chronic recurrent VKH disease, may be refractory to treatment, manifesting severe anterior segment inflammation, frequent vision-threatening complications, and a poor visual outcome.

Although several drugs are used for VKH disease in clinical practice, the therapeutic strategy for the disease is generally empirical. Systemic corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment for VKH disease, but they frequently cause adverse effects or intolerance which have tempered the overall effectiveness. Some evidence suggests that corticosteroid monotherapy may not be effective enough. Combination with an immunomodulatory therapy would bring additional benefits in visual improvement and corticosteroid-sparing effects. Adalimumab, one of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs, is an approved biologic therapy for uveitis, of which the efficacy and safety were shown in phase 3 randomized-controlled trials involving patients with VKH disease. Observational studies have also shown that adalimumab was effective to achieve remission in some patients with refractory VKH disease. In addition, retrospective studies and early small trials have suggested that conventional immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporine, would be an effective option for VKH disease. Guidance on Noncorticosteroid Systemic Immunomodulatory Therapy in Noninfectious Uveitis have included adalimumab (Grade A recommendation, evidence level 1B) as a biologic therapy and cyclosporine (Grade B recommendation, evidence level 2B) as an immunosuppressive therapy to be considered in the management of patients. However, there is a lack of head-to-head comparisons between immunosuppressant and biologic therapies to guide the medical choices in VKH disease.

### Intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of inflammatory choroidal neovascularization [^111knwid]. Retina (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of individualized repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (Lucentis) on visual acuity and central foveal thickness in patients with choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) associated with various ocular inflammatory clinical entities.

Methods

Our study was a retrospective, noncomparative, interventional, and observational case series. Sixteen eyes of 15 consecutive patients diagnosed with inflammatory CNV treated with repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab were evaluated. The underlying diagnoses were toxoplasmosis (n = 4), serpiginous choroidopathy (n = 2), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 5), multifocal choroiditis (MFC, n = 3), and scleroderma (n = 2). All patients underwent monthly optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and fluorescein angiography/indocyanine green angiography every 1 month after every injection and then every 3 months. Optical coherence tomography scans and fluorescein angiography were performed by the same experienced physician. Repeated intravitreal injections were performed when persistent/recurrent fluid on OCT and/or signs of active CNV on angiography were present. Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity and central foveal thickness were statistically analyzed.

Results

The mean follow-up time was 70.4 ± 24 weeks (17.6 months; range, 44–116 weeks [11–29 months]). The mean number of injections performed was 2.3, and the mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.9 ± 0.4 [mean ± SD]) at baseline to 70.3 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution, 0.6 ± 0.4) at the end of the follow-up, a statistically significant change compared with baseline (P < 0.0001). The mean letter gain was 15.3 letters, and best-corrected visual acuity improved in 14 of 16 patients (88%) and remained stable in 2 patients (12.5%) without any patient demonstrating deterioration. The mean central foveal thickness (although not excessively increased at baseline) improved from 285 ± 20 μm at baseline to 233 ± 21 μm (statistically significant compared with baseline, P < 0.0001) at the end of the follow-up. At the end of the follow-up, all patients demonstrated CNV regression, and retinal pigment epithelial atrophy surrounding the regressed CNV was developed in 11 of the 16 eyes (68.8%). During the same period, no CNV recurrence was observed and no injection-related complications such as cataract, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, or exacerbation of uveitis were noted.

Conclusion

Overall, our findings suggest that intravitreal injections of ranibizumab have shown promising results in visual acuity improvement and a decrease in macular thickness in patients with inflammatory CNV. Of course, further studies are needed to confirm the exact benefit and standardize the optimal treatment regimen.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^1141NYv6]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although respiratory disease from SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively documented, the ocular associations related to COVID-19 continue to be reported in the literature. Conjunctivitis remains the most frequent COVID-19 ocular manifestation (11.4%); however, an increasing number of cases of retinal and choroidal involvement have been reported. Diverse posterior segment manifestations have been found, including cotton-wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, posterior uveitis, retinal ischemia, and optic neuropathies. Some centers have had a significant increase in white-dot syndrome referrals during the pandemic, including serpiginous choroiditis.

Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare, idiopathic, sight-threatening posterior uveitis often observed in healthy young or middle-aged individuals that tends to have a poor visual prognosis. It is characterized by asymmetric, recurrent, progressive inflammation of the choroid, resulting in atrophy of the choriocapillaris and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, serpiginous choroiditis has been proposed to be immunogenic in nature, often preceded by a viral prodrome. Various infectious etiologies have been implicated, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and the herpes virus.COVID-19 has also been proposed as an immunologic trigger for reactivation of serpiginous choroiditis, with 1 documented case to date of recurrence after COVID-19 infection.

We present what to our knowledge is the first case of macular serpiginous choroiditis onset after COVID-19 infection.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and study of autoimmune retinopathy from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's task force [^1134iLS9]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) therapeutic options and consensus — Intraocular and systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and systemic immunosuppression with antimetabolites, T-cell inhibitors, and targeted B-cell therapy have all been employed. Fox and colleagues found expert consensus that local or systemic steroids, conventional immunosuppression, biologics, and intravenous immunogloblin were appropriate treatment options; however, consensus was not reached on the use of plasmapheresis. Rituximab is an attractive treatment option as it directly reduces antibody production, the addition to bortezomib to rituximab was suggested to provide benefit on electrophysiologic testing in one small series, and intraocular steroids can help control macular edema and may also have a role in managing AIR even in the absence of edema.

### Subcutaneous tocilizumab in the management of non-infectious uveitis in children: a brief report [^115Tjo82]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric non-infectious uveitis is a rare and sight-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the uveal components of the eye (retina, choroid, and iris). Its pathophysiology is not fully understood, and its aetiology is probably multifactorial, with genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Pediatric non-infectious uveitis may be idiopathic in up to 50% of cases, while it is often associated with systemic diseases, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in 40% of cases.

Delayed or ineffective uveitis treatments may lead to severe complications, like cataracts, glaucoma, macular oedema, synechiae, and eventually vision loss. A step-by-step approach is recommended to treat uveitis correctly. Topical glucocorticoids can cure mild and transient uveitis, but these medications cannot be used for long due to eye toxicity, with a risk of glaucoma and cataracts. Thus, in refractory cases, starting a systemic immunosuppressive treatment is recommended, usually with methotrexate. In most severe cases, biological treatment is required to control inflammation. Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) agents are recommended for first-line biological treatment, but up to 50% of patients are unresponsive or intolerant. Inhibition may be an effective treatment for the most severe cases of uveitis unresponsive to anti-TNF agents. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and its inhibition has been recently shown to be effective in treating the most severe cases of uveitis that are unresponsive even to anti-TNF agents.

### Presumed tubercular serpiginouslike choroiditis: clinical presentations and management [^116sH8EE]. Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Choroiditis, choroidal tubercles, and tuberculomas are well known ocular manifestations of systemic tuberculosis. The present series aimed to report the occurrence of serpiginouslike choroiditis of presumed tubercular origin.

Design

Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.

Participants

Eleven eyes in seven consecutive patients with a diagnosis of choroidal tuberculosis simulating serpiginous choroiditis were studied between 1997 and 2000. TESTING AND INTERVENTION: All patients had their fundus photographs taken at the time of initial presentation as well as during follow-up. All patients underwent a Mantoux skin test and chest radiography. In addition, five patients had their aqueous or vitreous humor subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sputum examination, biopsy, or both were carried out whenever recommended by the pulmonologist. Systemic antituberculosis chemotherapy was instituted in combination with treatment for ocular inflammation.

Main Outcome Measure

Therapeutic response and visual improvement.

Results

There were five men and two women ranging in age from 17 to 32 years. Clinical presentations included three morphologic variants; multifocal progressive choroiditis showing wavelike progression to confluent, diffuse lesions resembling serpiginous choroiditis (three eyes); diffuse choroiditis characterized by diffuse plaquelike choroiditis with an amoeboid pattern suggestive of serpiginous choroiditis at initial presentation (four eyes); and mixed variety where opposite eyes had mixed features (four eyes). All patients had strongly positive Mantoux skin test results and positive chest radiograph results. The PCR results from aqueous and vitreous humor in four samples was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; one had sputum positive for acid-fast bacilli, whereas two had histopathologic evidence of tuberculosis from cervical or parahilar lymph nodes. Treatment was associated with resolution of choroidal lesions and visual improvement. Final visual acuity of 20/30 or better was achieved in five eyes.

Conclusions

Choroidal tuberculosis may present as multifocal progressive or diffuse choroiditis resembling serpiginous choroiditis. It is important to recognize these presentations because these eyes show good response to systemic antituberculosis chemotherapy.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^1137S1Jz]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare, idiopathic eye disease characterized by asymmetrically bilateral, recurrent, progressive inflammation of the choroid that results in atrophy of the choriocapillaris and RPE. To our knowledge, ours is the first documented case of macular serpiginous choroiditis presenting after a COVID-19 infection.

Macular serpiginous choroiditis was diagnosed after a comprehensive assessment to eliminate possible causes that may be masquerading as placoid maculopathy. The most common etiology, tuberculosis-related serpiginous-like choroiditis, was deemed to be unlikely because there was no known exposure to tuberculosis and the interferon gamma release assay bloodwork was negative. The differentiation between serpiginous choroiditis and serpiginous-like choroiditis is critical because the immunosuppressive drugs used for serpiginous choroiditis can reactivate and exacerbate tuberculosis infection. The observed macular presentation was distinct from that of tuberculosis-related serpiginous-like choroiditis, which typically involves stippled, multifocal lesions in the posterior pole and fundus periphery and is often associated with significant vitritis. Similarly, acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, which presents with large yellowish, multifocal placoid lesions and significant vitritis in immunocompromised hosts, was ruled out by laboratory work. In addition, the characteristic imaging hallmarks of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis were not seen on OCT, including reversible, irregular focal thickening and nodularity of the RPE with a disrupted EZ, and progressive hyperfluorescence with focal hypofluorescence or leopard spotting was not seen on fluorescein angiography. All other infectious workups were negative.

### Infectious eye disease in the 21st century-an overview [^117UtYGF]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis is associated with distinct medical risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, dialysis and intravenous drug use. Lemon juice used to dissolve opiates and stimulants has long been identified as a source of Candida spp. in cases of endophthalmitis among intravenous drug users.

Mycobacterial diseases, chief among which is tuberculosis, impose a significant burden on vision worldwide, especially in endemic areas but also in some countries with low endemicity. Approximately 10.6 million people around the world fell ill with TB in 2021, yet significant gaps in our knowledge concerning the global visual burden of ocular TB remain. In part, this is because ocular TB is itself often a challenging concept for ophthalmologists and TB physicians alike. The diagnosis can be straightforward, for example when a choroidal granuloma is found in a patient from an endemic area, and a chest X-ray showing characteristic changes together with a positive immunological test corroborate the ocular findings. At the other end of the scale are clinical presentations that suggest but do not establish beyond doubt a diagnosis of ocular TB, such as occlusive retinal vasculitis, ampiginous, serpiginous-like and multifocal choroiditis, as well as chronic granulomatous uveitis. To complicate matters, radiological and immunological tests (e.g. tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay, which do not distinguish between active and latent TB) may be negative even in culture-confirmed TB. The Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study group has recently devised a consensus-based decision-making tool enabling users to confidently recommend starting ATT. Once treatment is started, the clinical picture may initially deteriorate due to increasing inflammation, a phenomenon known as paradoxical worsening. The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of TB further complicates progress, although new drug regimens have recently been found to be non-inferior to standard treatments. The global prevalence of visual impairment secondary to ocular TB, therefore, is a complex question likely to tax even the most assiduous epidemiological researcher.

### Pharmacotherapy for uveitis: current management and emerging therapy [^111xu8Md]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Extent and severity of uveitis and associated inflammation

In general, isolated uncomplicated anterior uveitis (whether unilateral or bilateral) can often be managed by topical therapy alone; frequent topical corticosteroids are used for rescue treatment, and then titrated down to complete cessation (in acute disease) or to a low frequency maintenance regimen (chronic disease or frequent recurrences); a mydriatic is commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of posterior synechiae.

In cases of posterior segment uveitis (intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis), the topical route provides inadequate penetration to the inflamed tissue, although topical therapies may still have an adjunctive role. For these cases, the choice of treatment will depend on whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral, and whether it is isolated or is a manifestation of a systemic inflammatory process. Unilateral and, increasingly, bilateral disease may be treated by local therapies (peribulbar, sub-Tenon's, or intravitreal routes); corticosteroids are the most common drugs given by these routes although the role of other agents (see "Update on drugs currently in development stages for uveitis treatment" section for further details) are also being assessed. Local therapy may be sufficient to control the disease, but in more severe inflammation, or in the presence of systemic disease, systemic therapy is likely to be necessary. In addition, there may be contraindications to the use of local therapies in some cases.

Recognition and treatment of any associated systemic disease is a priority. Therapy initiated for coexistent systemic inflammatory disease may ameliorate any active uveitis, reducing the need for direct ophthalmic intervention. Once again, rescue therapy is traditionally performed with corticosteroids (either intravenous or oral), with maintenance therapy comprising either a lower dose of corticosteroid or a steroid-sparing IMT agent. The range of steroid-sparing IMT agents available (including biologics) is steadily increasing, although the evidence of their efficacy and safety in uveitis is often lacking. Current options include antimetabolites (such as methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil), T-cell inhibitors (such as cyclosporine), and alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide). More recently, biological therapies (such as infliximab) have been utilized in the management of severe and refractory uveitis.–A brief discussion of such agents is included in the next section.

### Predictive factors and adalimumab efficacy in managing chronic recurrence vogt-koyanagi-harada disease [^116J9UXF]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) is an autoimmune disease characterized by severe bilateral non-granulomatous panuveitis, typically accompanied by systemic symptoms such as tinnitus, alopecia, myelitis, and vitiligo. Patients with VKH may experience serious visual impairment due to ocular inflammation and its complications, including cataracts, secondary glaucoma, and choroidal neovascularization.

VKH disease is clinically divided into four stages: prodromal, uveitic, convalescent, and chronic recurrent. The treatment approach for the acute phase of VKH involves prolonged and aggressive use of systemic corticosteroids, often combined with systemic immunomodulatory therapy. Some VKH patients, when promptly and appropriately treated with systemic corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy, may gradually reduce the dosage of systemic corticosteroids without worsening the condition. However, there is a subset of VKH patients who, even with proper and aggressive use of systemic corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy, may experience disease recurrent. In cases of VKH disease recurrence, inflammation becomes difficult to control, necessitating additional therapeutic approaches such as increasing corticosteroid doses, combining various immunosuppressive agents, or introducing biologic agents. While a small number of studies have reported various factors associated with the progression of VKH to the chronic recurrent stage, such as age at onset, poor initial visual acuity, rapid corticosteroid tapering, and disease presentation type (e.g. optic disc edema or serous retinal detachment), larger studies exploring the influencing factors on VKH progression to the chronic recurrent stage are still lacking. Therefore, recognizing potential prognostic factors influencing disease recurrence and adjusting treatments accordingly holds significant clinical importance.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) has played a crucial role in the development of chemokines, adhesion molecules, and cytokines associated with ocular inflammation. In the management of severe posterior uveitis and panuveitis, the application of TNF-α inhibitors stands prominent. The guidelines offered by the American Uveitis Society suggested TNF-α inhibitors as prospective second-line immunosuppressive agents to control over the intense ocular inflammation. The efficacy of Adalimumab (ADA; AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA) treatment for VKH patients resistant to conventional therapy has been demonstrated. Yang et al. evaluated nine refractory VKH patients treated with ADA in combination with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents for an average duration of 10 months. During the treatment, most patients exhibited good control of ocular inflammation, including anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation. Due to the small sample size, long-term and larger-scale observations are still needed to assess the safety of ADA.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^1119EQyk]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Biologic agents

When corticosteroids and cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy fail to produce complete and sustainable remission or in cases of intolerance, the relatively novel option of biologic-response modifiers is often considered. These are recombinant proteins or antibodies regarded as targeting specific molecules or cytokines involved in the inflammatory cascade of the disease pathway. A fundamental feature of these agents is specifically targeted suppression of the immunoeffector responses that are accountable for damaging tissue. The advent of biologic agents and the recent FDA approval of adalimumab for uninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis has been a game changer in the field of uveitis management. While antimetabolites have been established as steroid-sparing agents without necessarily being more potent than them, biologic therapy offers the option of an equally or more efficacious choice for chronic disease, capable of inducing complete and prolonged quiescence. In ocular sarcoidosis in particular, where systemic therapy holds an important place in achieving control of inflammation, biologic agents seem to stand as an increasingly popular choice. Although growing evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the use of biologic agents are gradually coming to light with promising results, on the grounds of limited long-term safety and efficacy data, these agents widely remain a second-line treatment choice among uveitis experts and reserved for use if and when antimetabolites fail to induce and sustain remission.

TNFα inhibitors

TNFα is a powerful, pleiotropic, multifunctional, proinflammatory cytokine that plays a principal role in a wide range of autoinflammatory conditions. High levels of TNFα are secreted by alveolar macrophages, thereby contributing to the formation and preservation of sarcoidal granulomas in patients with active disease, indicating that selective blockage of this cytokine could accomplish satisfactory control and remission of inflammation. In fact, it has been advocated that in a considerable number of refractory sarcoidosis cases, failure of corticosteroid or antimetabolite therapy might be due to the significantly increased TNFα release. As such, TNFα inhibition could conceivably be a favorable option in sarcoidosis-related intraocular inflammation compared to other types of uveitis, such as nongranulomatous inflammation. These agents have demonstrated a relatively safe profile with acceptable tolerability, although a small number of case reports describing autoimmune adverse events, paradoxically listing uveitis as one of them, have emerged.

Clinical data for patients with suspected tuberculous uveitis

In this study, 1 patient discontinued treatment due to ineffective diagnostic anti-TB therapy, while 3 patients either discontinued treatment or were lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 11 patients (13 eyes) with suspected tuberculous uveitis, who received standard anti-TB therapy for at least 6 months, treatment was effective. Clinical data for these 11 patients are summarized in Table 2.

PurposeTo assess the incidence, clinical ocular involvement and effectiveness of anti-tuberculous treatment in patients with chronic uveitis presumed to be associated with tuberculosis in a non-endemic community. Patients and methodsRetrospective case series of patients with uveitis and evidence of tuberculosis, with no other identified cause of uveitis, who underwent a 6-month course of standard anti-tuberculosis treatment between 2008 and 2015. The response to treatment was assessed at 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. ResultsForty-eight patients were included of whom 36 (75%) were born outside the United Kingdom. Only five had concurrent active pulmonary or nodal tuberculosis. There were 85 affected eyes, including 25 with granulomatous anterior uveitis, 32 with retinal vasculitis (occlusive in 21), and 20 with multifocal choroiditis or serpiginous-like retinochoroiditis. Gamma-interferon testing was positive in 95%. Complete resolution at end point was seen in only 60%, but a further 19% were inflammation-free on topical steroid only. Resolution was lower (50%) in those with panuveitis compared to other anatomical types (75%). Sixty-four eyes (75%) had a LogMAR visual acuity of 0.1 or better at the end of the study. ConclusionsThe incidence of presumed tuberculosis-associated uveitis (TBU) has almost quadrupled in this region. The efficacy of treatment has not been enhanced by the introduction of gamma-interferon testing to support diagnosis. Some patients may require more prolonged antibiotic therapy to ensure quiescence, but chronic non-infective anterior uveitis may in any case follow treated TBU.

### Classification criteria for serpiginous choroiditis [^11725Yb7]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine classification criteria for serpiginous choroiditis.

Design

Machine learning of cases with serpiginous choroiditis and 8 other posterior uveitides.

Methods

Cases of posterior uveitides were collected in an informatics-designed preliminary database, and a final database was constructed of cases achieving supermajority agreement on diagnosis, using formal consensus techniques. Cases were split into a training set and a validation set. Machine learning using multinomial logistic regression was used on the training set to determine a parsimonious set of criteria that minimized the misclassification rate among the infectious posterior uveitides / panuveitides. The resulting criteria were evaluated on the validation set.

Results

One thousand sixty-eight cases of posterior uveitides, including 122 cases of serpiginous choroiditis, were evaluated by machine learning. Key criteria for serpiginous choroiditis included (1) choroiditis with an ameboid or serpentine shape; (2) characteristic imaging on fluorescein angiography or fundus autofluorescence; (3) absent to mild anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation; and (4) the exclusion of tuberculosis. Overall accuracy for posterior uveitides was 93.9% in the training set and 98.0% (95% confidence interval 94.3, 99.3) in the validation set. The misclassification rates for serpiginous choroiditis were 0% in both the training set and the validation set.

Conclusions

The criteria for serpiginous choroiditis had a low misclassification rate and seemed to perform sufficiently well for use in clinical and translational research.

### OCT angiography imaging in serpiginous choroidopathy [^111f2vwj]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report OCTA findings in 3 cases, 2 active and 1 inactive, of serpiginous choroidopathy (SC) and describe OCTA changes in response to treatment.

Design

Retrospective case series.

Participants

We studied 6 eyes of 3 patients with SC.

Methods

Retrospective case series of 3 patients with SC undergoing multimodal imaging, including OCTA. In 1 treated eye, both pre- and posttreatment images were compared.

Main Outcome Measures

Description of OCTA findings in patients with SC.

Results

In the active phase, OCTA images show an apparent absence of the choriocapillaris with variable outer retinal and retinal pigment epithelial thickening. After treatment, OCTA of previously active lesions demonstrates a partial reappearance of the choriocapillaris, especially at lesion margins. In inactive SC, the choriocapillaris, along with the retinal pigment epithelium and outer retina, is notably absent.

Conclusions

Optical coherence tomography angiography suggests absence of choriocapillaris in both active and inactive phases of SC with partial reestablishment following treatment. Although the exact pathogenesis of SC is not elucidated by these findings, OCTA images allow us to better evaluate choroidal involvement.

### Tubercular retinal vasculitis: diagnostic dilemma and management strategies [^113z86ei]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

The Conundrum of Ocular Tuberculosis

TB affects the eye mainly via the bloodstream, and consequently the most vascular ocular tissue, uvea, is most commonly affected. Tubercular uveitis (TBU) is typically a granulomatous inflammation. It may present as anterior, intermediate, posterior uveitis, panuveitis or retinal vasculitis; posterior uveitis is the most common presentation. Tubercular posterior uveitis (choroiditis) could in turn present as serpiginous-like choroiditis, choroidal granuloma or focal/multifocal choroiditis. The variability of clinical picture is only the beginning of the diagnostic riddle.TB is a smoldering low-grade paucibacillary infection which is difficult to culture, more so from the intraocular issue due to inaccessibility, small sample size and inherent risk during culture harvest. Gene amplification by nested or multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is difficult, expensive, inaccessible in clinical settings, and still unreliable. Since the most common site of primary involvement are lungs, a chest CT scan or X-ray (CXR, though less reliable is more practical in developing world) may show active or healed lesions of TB. Negative chest imaging however does not rule out ocular TB. Latent TB can be diagnosed by Tuberculin Skin test (TST) or Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), the latter is faster, and does not show false-positive results from BCG vaccination or non-TB mycobacterial infections.TST scores in low cost, and good predictive value in high-endemic regions. Neither test differentiates active from latent TB. The diagnosis of ocular TB (OTB) is further muddled by the variability of clinical presentations across different ethnic and geographic populations. Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS) evolved a survey-based consensus of 81 uveitis experts across the globe to clear the murky profile of OTB: the clinically suggestive ocular features when supported by systemic presence of active or latent TB are sufficient to presumptively diagnose OTB and start anti-tubercular treatment (ATT). However, the expert consensus was less clear about the management of anterior or intermediate uveitis and retinal vasculitis. One reason for the ambiguity was the homogenization of TRV and Eales disease as a single entity, as a manifestation of immune response to the tubercular bacillus.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for uveitis [^111TYp8b]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Adalimumab and Dexamethasone for Treating Non-Infectious Uveitisis a guideline produced by the UK NICE, which is most concerned with providing guidance for medical practitioners working within the UK National Health Service. It specifically deals with the use of the biological treatment adalimumab, and with dexamethasone intravitreal implants, in cases of posterior uveitis. Within this narrow scope, its recommendations are clear and concise and were decided on by an appraisal committee, which heard evidence from clinical experts and received evidence from pharmaceutical companies. Included in this were results from randomised controlled trials. The guidance advised the use of adalimumab in cases of non-infectious posterior uveitis unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy, and dexamethasone intravitreal implant as an option if there is active posterior uveitis causing worsening vision with a risk of blindness. Expert opinion also advised that adalimumab therapy be halted if new choroidal or retinal inflammatory lesions developed, or if there was an increase in intraocular inflammation or a decrease in visual acuity by 3 or more lines or 15 letters while on treatment.

The Clinical Knowledge Summary on Uveitisproduced by the NICE provides general recommendations on uveitis covering clinical assessment, differential diagnosis and referral. It is explicitly meant to support practitioners in primary care, and recommendations were largely drawn from review articles and medical textbooks.

### The white dot syndromes [^111BQ22j]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the distinctive and shared features of the white dot syndromes, highlighting the clinical findings, diagnostic test results, proposed etiologies, treatments, and prognosis.

Design

Review.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Results

Common white dot syndromes are reviewed, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, birdshot chorioretinopathy, diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis, serpiginous choroiditis, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy.

Conclusions

The white dot syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by multiple whitish-yellow inflammatory lesions located at the level of the outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid. For clinicians and researchers alike, they present significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

### Long-term treatment of refractory posterior uveitis with anti-TNFalpha (infliximab) [^113FGBdt]. Eye (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of infliximab as treatment for noninfectious posterior uveitis.

Methods

An open-label clinical trial including seven patients (12 eyes) with posterior uveitis refractory to conventional treatment regimens with corticosteroids and at least one immunosuppressive agent. Three intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg of infliximab were administered at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Infliximab infusion was repeated in patients undergoing a relapse of uveitis after initial remission. Improvement was defined as amelioration of visual acuity or disappearance of retinal exudates and/or haemorrhages, decreased macular oedema and/or vitreous opacities. All patients were followed up for at least 36 months.

Results

Six of the seven patients (five diagnosed with Behçet's disease and one diagnosed with sarcoidosis) showed a significant improvement after the first infliximab dose. Only in one patient diagnosed with chronic idiopathic multifocal choroiditis did the drug have no effect, and this patient was withdrawn from the study. At the end of follow-up, one eye had lost one line of vision and three eyes showed improved vision. All eyes had improved in terms of signs of inflammation. No adverse effects of treatment were observed.

Conclusion

Infliximab is efficient and safe for the long-term management of refractory posterior uveitis, especially in patients with predominant retinal vasculitis and vitritis.

### Biological therapy in noninfectious pediatric uveitis: a systematic review [^113wKGcm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was developed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Intervention Reviewsand described according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled studies (NRS) involving children under 18 years old with noninfectious uveitis, regardless of sex and type of associated systemic disease, were included. Interventions included any treatment regimen of biological therapy versus placebo, other drugs, or a combination of therapies. The primary outcome was the rate of satisfactory response to treatment, characterized by the reduction or resolution of ocular inflammatory activity in the anterior chamber and the occurrence of local and systemic adverse events. The secondary outcome included reduction in or interruption of the use of corticosteroids.

Data Source and Searches

Seven databases were searched in this review, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 1996 to March 2021), PubMed (1966 to March 2021), Web of Science (1900 to March 2021), EMBASE (1974 to March 2021), Latin American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS; 1982 to March 2021), SCOPUS (2004 to March 2021), and Clinical Trials (2008 to March 2021). Using the terms of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and accessible terms related to "uveitis", tumor necrosis factor antagonist alpha", and "child", the search strategy was adapted and replicated for each database. There were no restrictions on language or publication year.

The proposed search strategy was as follows: [(uveitis or iritis or iridocyclitis or pars planitis or retinochoroiditis or choroiditis or retinitis or Behcet or Vogt or Koyanagi or Harada or Fuchs or juvenile rheumatoid or juvenile idiopathic arthritis) and ((Tumor necrosis factor-alpha) or biologic therapy or biological therapies monoclonal antibodies or humanized monoclonal antibodies or Infliximab or Adalimumab or Etanercept or Certolizumab Pegol or Remicade or Humira or Enbrel or Golimumab or Simponi or Cimzia or (TNFR-Fc fusion protein)) and (child or children or pediatric or pediatrics or childhood) and (noninfectious)].

### Clinical presentations and therapeutic effect of presumed choroidal tuberculosis [^11297FGy]. Retina (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present the clinical findings and to evaluate the therapeutic response to systemic antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy in 18 cases of presumed choroidal TB.

Methods

Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series. Eighteen patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination and relevant laboratory and radiologic investigations. All patients were treated with systemic anti-TB therapy accordingly.

Results

In 18 cases of choroidal TB, there were 8 men and 10 women ranging in age from 8 years to 52 years. Ten patients also had evidence of pulmonary TB and among of them, two patients had coexistent central nervous system TB, one patient had lymphoid TB, and one patient had abdominal TB. Those cases had varied clinical presentations including tubercle, tuberculoma, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous like choroiditis, and/or diffuse choroiditis. Two cases (11.1%) had bilateral presentation. All patients were referred to a TB specialist to initiate a full standard course of anti-TB therapy according to the guideline of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aside from one case, which worsened to panophthalmitis, the others responded to anti-TB therapy very well. None of the patients had human immunodeficiency virus and none was immunocompromised.

Conclusion

Choroidal TB may present as variable clinical manifestations and occasionally be misdiagnosed as intraocular tumor or metastatic tumor. In our case series, the prognosis of this disease was well by giving systemic anti-TB therapy. So all ophthalmologists especially in developing countries should have a high degree of clinical suspicion to maximally maintain visual acuity.

### Placoid lesions of the retina: progress in multimodal imaging and clinical perspective [^113jyEP6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Placoid lesions of the retina may be secondary to a wide spectrum of acquired inflammatory conditions that have been reported as single entities with different presentation and clinical course. These conditions include acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, persistent placoid maculopathy, serpiginous choroiditis, serpiginous-like choroiditis, relentless placoid chorioretinitis and acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. In this article, we will group these conditions under the name of 'placoids'. The recognition of the specific condition may be challenging in clinical practice, often resulting in diagnostic and therapeutic delay. Given the complex nature of placoids and their similarities, a systematic approach including differentiating between infectious and non-infectious aetiologies increases the chance of reaching the correct diagnosis. Detailed history and comprehensive clinical examination are the first steps to formulate a diagnostic hypothesis that should be corroborated by multimodal imaging and appropriate investigations. The advent of multimodal imaging has made it possible to extensively study placoids and revealed a constellation of specific findings that may help clinicians in the diagnostic process. The treatment of the conditions other than syphilis is complex and sometimes challenging. Our article is aimed at giving an overview of the individual entities associated with placoids and discussing the differential diagnosis. A practical and systematic approach is then proposed.

### Sympathetic ophthalmia: where Do we currently stand on treatment strategies? [^113wRLQX]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare bilateral diffuse granulomatous panuveitis that usually results from surgical or penetrating trauma to one eye. The symptoms range from impaired near vision to pain, photophobia, and loss of visual acuity. Anterior segment manifestations include bilateral acute uveitis with mutton-fat keratic precipitates and posterior segment findings include vitritis, multifocal neurosensory retinal detachment, choroiditis, optic nerve edema, and Dalen–Fuchs nodules. The diagnosis is clinical. Ancillary investigations include fundus fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultrasound B scan, and autofluorescence imaging. The management options include corticosteroids (topical and systemic) as the first line along with immunomodulatory therapy started at the presentation of the disease. Recent advances include imaging with OCT-angiography, enhanced depth imaging-OCT (EDI-OCT, choroidal vascular index/CVI), targeting IL-23/IL-17 pathway, and use of biologics for the management of this rare entity. Recent advances in early diagnosis and prompt treatment has led to improved final visual outcomes in both the sympathizing and exciting eye. This review is aimed at giving a comprehensive overview of sympathetic ophthalmia along with a special emphasis on current treatment strategies and recent advances.

### Anti-tumor necrosis factor α versus tocilizumab in the treatment of refractory uveitic macular edema: a multicenter study from the French uveitis network [^113q3kL1]. Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the factors associated with response (control of ocular inflammation and corticosteroid-sparing effect) to biologics (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α agents and tocilizumab) in patients with refractory uveitic macular edema (ME).

Design

Multicenter, retrospective, observational study.

Participants

Adult patients with uveitic ME refractory to systemic corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or both.

Methods

Patients received anti-TNF-α agents (infliximab 5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, 6, and every 4–6 weeks [n = 69] and adalimumab 40 mg/2 weeks [n = 80]) and tocilizumab (8 mg/kg every 4 weeks intravenously [n = 39] and 162 mg/week subcutaneously [n = 16]).

Main Outcome Measures

Analysis of complete and partial response rates, relapse rate, low vision (visual acuity in at least 1 eye of ≥ 1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution), corticosteroid-sparing effect, and adverse events at 6 months.

Results

Two hundred four patients (median age, 40 years [interquartile range, 28–58 years]; 42.2% men) were included. Main causes of uveitis included Behçet's disease (17.2%), birdshot chorioretinopathy (11.3%), and sarcoidosis (7.4%). The overall response rate at 6 months was 46.2% (21.8% of complete response) with anti-TNF-α agents and 58.5% (35.8% of complete response) with tocilizumab. In multivariate analysis, treatment with tocilizumab (odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–4.06; P = 0.03) was associated independently with complete response of uveitic ME compared with anti-TNF-α agents. Anti-TNF-α agents and tocilizumab did not differ significantly in terms of relapse rate (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.31–3.18; P = 0.99) or occurrence of low vision (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.51–2.07; P = 0.95) or corticosteroid-sparing effect (P = 0.29). Adverse events were reported in 20.6% of patients, including serious adverse events reported in 10.8% of patients.

Conclusions

Tocilizumab seems to improve complete response of uveitic ME compared with anti-TNF-α agents.

### Lack of herpes virus DNA in choroidal tissues of a patient with serpiginous choroiditis [^11541G8c]. Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the role of herpes viruses in the etiology of serpiginous choroiditis.

Design

Interventional case report.

Participant

A 59-year-old male patient with long-term history of serpiginous choroiditis.

Intervention

The patient's affected eye was obtained during autopsy. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in the microdissected choroidal tissues.

Results

Histopathologic examination demonstrated active inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid. No viral DNA was amplified using pairs of herpes simplex virus (HSV) P1/P2 (for HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV] and human herpes virus [HHV]-8), and varicella-zoster virus [VZV] P1/P2 (for VZV, HHV-6, HHV-7) in the infiltrating lymphocytes or choroidal tissues.

Conclusions

The current observation suggests a lack of a role for herpetic viral etiology in the etiopathogenesis of serpiginous choroiditis.

### Longitudinal analysis of serum cytokine profile among patients with tubercular multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis: a pilot study [^112eGuia]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To analyze the serum cytokines profile in patients with tubercular multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis (TB MSC) receiving anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) and oral corticosteroids.

Methods

In this prospective longitudinal study, patients with active TB MSC were included. Serum levels of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were analyzed using bead-based immunoassay. The levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β were measured using cytokine bead array. Serial measurement was performed at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 weeks after initiation of therapy. Patients developing paradoxical worsening (PW) of TB MSC were identified and their serum levels of cytokines were compared with those patients who showed healing of lesions. Comparison of cytokine levels with baseline values was also performed.

Results

Twelve patients (three females) were included in the study. Four patients showed paradoxical worsening of TB MSC at 3.2 ± 1 weeks after initiation of therapy. Compared to patients who showed healing of lesions, patients with PW showed higher baseline IL-10 (not significant; p = 0.28). Among patients developing PW, levels of IFN-γ peaked at 1 week ((p = 0.01) and levels of TNF-α peaked at 3 weeks (p = 0.02) (coinciding with PW) compared to patients who showed healing. There was no significant difference in TGF-β levels at any time point in either group (p > 0.47).

Conclusions

Baseline and serial levels of inflammatory serum cytokines may help in predicting the response to ATT and corticosteroids in TB MSC. Patients with paradoxical worsening may show rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines after initiation of ATT indicating higher bacillary load.

### Interferon-gamma release assay as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis-associated uveitis [^112dK8ng]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study found that patients with suggestive clinical signs of TB plus either a positive TST or T-SPOT.TB were approximately 1.5 times more likely to have TAU as compared with patients with negative tests. We also found that T-SPOT.TB is more specific but less sensitive than TST, and when both tests are used in combination the overall accuracy for diagnosing TAU increases. Patients with suggestive clinical signs in addition to positive TST and T-SPOT.TB have a two times increased likelihood of having TAU. On the other hand, we found that both tests (used individually or in combination) have poor sensitivities. Therefore, neither a negative T-SPOT.TB nor a negative TST result, in patients who have ocular signs suggestive of a tubercular cause, adequately excludes TAU (negative likelihood ratios < 1.0 for both tests individually and in combination — Table 2).

In our clinical practice, a high index of suspicion is required to diagnose TAU. Current clinical practice involves diagnosing TAU by using a positive TST and suggestive clinical signs such as broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis with or without choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis. Our study found that adding T-SPOT.TB increases the discrimination and accuracy of diagnosing TAU. However, it must be noted that the AUC value of combining T-SPOT.TB and TST with clinical signs is only fairly good for discrimination (AUC = 0.665). Our findings are consistent with published studies, which found low sensitivities for T-SPOT.TB and TST in patients with extrapulmonary and latent TB. This makes negative T-SPOT.TB or TST results difficult to interpret, as up to 20% of persons with negative tests may still have TB infection. However, the results of our study should be taken in consideration together with the prevalence of disease and the prior probability of disease. In the same study period, we diagnosed TAU in 50 out of 621 patients with uveitis (8%), which is consistent with our intermediate burden of TB disease. The estimated prevalence of tubercular uveitis range from 1–4% areas with low TB endemicity such as USA, Europe, and Japan to 10–26% in highly endemic regions such as India and Saudi Arabia.

### Serpiginous choroiditis after COVID-19 infection [^115gzTA5]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

On fundus photography, the macular atrophic lesion appeared as a gray–yellow patch with indistinct borders (Figure 3, A and B). Fundus autofluorescence showed a corresponding hypoautofluorescent macular lesion surrounded by an amoeboid hyperautofluorescent ring projecting away from the fovea (Figure 4B). OCT angiography (OCTA) en face analysis showed severe inner choroidal ischemia at the lesion site (Figure 3, C and F). There was no macular neovascularization on OCTA. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) analysis also showed early-phase and late-phase hypofluorescence of the lesion, indicating choroidal ischemia (Figure 3, D and E).

Figure 3.
Multimodal imaging of the choroidal lesion 1 month after initial presentation. True color fundus photography of (A) the right eye and (B) the left eye shows a large unilateral gray–yellow macular lesion in the left eye. Indocyanine green angiography of the left eye shows hypofluorescence of the lesion during (D) the early phase and (E) the late phase of the study that corresponds with choroidal nonperfusion. Optical coherence tomography angiography en face analysis of (C) the choriocapillaris and (F) the choroid in the left eye shows severe ischemia of the affected choriocapillaris.

Figure 4.
Widefield pseudocolor fundus photography and fundus autofluorescence of the left eye at 1 month (A and B) and 4 months (C and D) from initial presentation. Images show a large foveal hypoautofluorescent lesion surrounded by an irregular hyperautofluorescence border that evolved over time.

An extensive inflammatory and infectious workup, including a complete blood count, complement proteins C3/C4, C-reactive protein, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, renal function tests, liver function tests, an antineutrophil antibody screen, and a vasculitis panel (antimyeloperoxidase, antiproteinase, antiglomerular basement membrane screens) yielded results within normal range or negative. Bartonella, toxocara serology, toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG, a Lyme disease antibody test, a syphilis enzyme immunoassay, an interferon gamma release assay tuberculosis test, and an HIV test were all negative. Aqueous fluid samples from the left eye were negative for adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 and varicella zoster. Computed tomography of the head and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were within normal limits.

### Persistent placoid maculopathy: a new clinical entity [^116qyBUN]. Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a previously unreported clinical entity superficially resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but with a distinct presentation and clinical course.

Design

Retrospective observational case series.

Participants

Six patients, 50 to 68 years old, exhibiting this entity who were seen at 5 different centers from 1984 to 2006.

Methods

Review of medical records.

Main Outcome Measures

Best-corrected visual acuity (VA) and clinical and angiographic findings.

Results

The lesions in our patients are similar to those of acute macular serpiginous choroiditis. Our patients had well-delineated whitish plaquelike lesions involving the macula and sparing the peripapillary areas of both eyes. In contrast to serpiginous choroiditis, VA remained good despite early involvement of the fovea until complications related to choroidal neovascularization or pigmentary mottling developed. Angiographic characteristics and the clinical course were also atypical. Fluorescein angiography revealed well-defined early hypofluorescent areas that partially filled in the late phase. Indocyanine green angiography showed the hypofluorescence to be persistent. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, the white macular lesions faded over a period of months to years, whereas the characteristic angiographic findings often persisted longer. Choroidal neovascularization developed in 11 of 12 eyes, with subsequent conversion to disciform macular scars in 9 of 12 eyes. Unlike serpiginous choroiditis, none of the eyes showed chorioretinal scar formation unless related to choroidal neovascularization.

Conclusion

Persistent placoid maculopathy has features resembling macular serpiginous choroiditis but differs in its clinical course and effect on VA. It appears to be a new entity. The majority of eyes develop choroidal neovascularization that results in loss of central vision.

Introduction

Uveitis, a leading cause of preventable blindness around the world, is a critically underserved disease in regard to the medications approved for use. Multiple immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) drugs are appropriate for uveitis therapy but are still off-label. These IMT agents, including antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors, alkylating agents, and biologic agents, have been designated as "orphan drugs" and are widely used for systemic autoimmune diseases or organ transplantation.

Area covered

The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively review and summarize the approved orphan drugs and biologics that are being used to treat systemic diseases and to discuss drugs that have not yet received approval as an "orphan drug for treating uveitis" by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Our perspective

IMT, as a steroid-sparing agent for uveitis patients, has shown promising clinical results. Refractory and recurrent uveitis requires combination IMT agents. IMT is continued for a period of 2 years while the patient is in remission before considering tapering medication. Our current goals include developing further assessments regarding the efficacy, optimal dose, and safety in efforts to achieve FDA approval for "on-label" use of current IMT agents and biologics more quickly and to facilitate insurance coverage and expand access to the products for this orphan disease.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^111RTEeW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of chronic ocular sarcoidosis

The management of ocular sarcoidosis, especially intraocular inflammation in the form of uveitis, which is by far the most common and serious presentation, has traditionally been a challenge for the treating ophthalmologist, due to the complexity of the disease, difficulty in reaching the diagnosis, and lack of a standardized algorithm. A stepwise approach is usually recommended, with sight-threatening situations requiring a more aggressive scheme of therapy. Corticosteroids, either topical (eyedrops, periocular, intraocular injections) or systemic, have been the pillar of ocular sarcoidosis management for many decades and continue to be. However, in recent years, the introduction of immunomodulators and the more contemporary biologic agents have tremendously altered the landscape in managing ocular sarcoidosis, establishing a new era in the successful treatment of many inflammatory ocular diseases (Table 3).

We conducted a review of the recent literature of the last 5 years (September 2012–September 2017) regarding treatment modalities in chronic ocular sarcoidosis, including available topical and systemic therapies. We searched PubMed for all published literature on the management of chronic sarcoid-related eye disease, focusing mainly on the principal manifestation of intraocular inflammation (uveitis). All clinical studies reporting the employment of topical, periocular, and intraocular systemic corticosteroids, systemic immunomodulatory therapy (alkylating agents, antimetabolites), and biologic agents (anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies) in adult patients with uninfectious uveitis inclusive of sarcoidosis are included in this review. Studies with no data on uveitis underlying etiology or not inclusive of sarcoidosis of uveitis cases were excluded. We focused our review on newer trends in intravitreally used agents and biologics.

### Management of chronic ocular sarcoidosis: challenges and solutions [^117Vo2UT]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Anti-TNFα agents, including infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab, are monoclonal antibodies that bind the TNFα molecule, which plays a crucial role in the granulomatous inflammation of sarcoidosis. These biologic agents have been most studied in the treatment of sarcoid-related uveitis. By blocking the TNFα receptors and competitively binding circulating TNFα, these molecules facilitate the dissolution of granulomas in sarcoidosis.

Adalimumab (Humira; AbbVie, Chicago, IL, USA) is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against TNFα. It has been in the spotlight recently, as it is the first biological agent ever approved by the FDA for the treatment of uninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis in adults, being as such the only steroid-sparing option having a clear indication for uveitis, while all other steroid-sparing treatments continue to be used off-label. With FDA approval, the drug can now be prescribed, hence addressing the issue of financial restrictions which has been a significant hindrance in utilizing it up until recently. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, Phase III studies evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of subcutaneous adalimumab in adults with active (VISUAL I) or inactive (VISUAL II) uninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. In these two studies, adalimumab significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure relative to placebo following the tapered withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy.VISUAL I enrolled 217 patients, 18 of whom had sarcoid uveitis, and demonstrated that patients receiving adalimumab were 50% less likely to experience treatment failure than the placebo group, also exhibiting better results in the secondary end points of anterior-chamber inflammation, vitreous haze, and BCVA, significantly lowering the risk of uveitic flare and visual impairment. Likewise, VISUAL II assessed the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in 229 patients with inactive disease (32 patients with sarcoid uveitis as the underlying etiology) controlled by systemic corticosteroids against placebo. Time to treatment failure was significantly longer for patients receiving adalimumab compared to placebo, reducing by half the risk of uveitic flare and loss of VA. The most common adverse events of the drug in these studies were injection-site reactions and allergic reactions, while serious adverse effects include an increased risk of infection, a lupus-like syndrome, and demyelinating disorders. Nevertheless, the safety profile of adalimumab overall seems comparable to that in other approved indications, with acceptable tolerability. Future studies exploring long-term safety and efficacy of adalimumab in uninfectious uveitis are on the way. Before VISUAL I and II, Erckens et al studied the use of adalimumab in 26 sarcoidosis patients with refractory posterior uveitis unresponsive to corticosteroids or Mtx: 85% of patients showed improvement of intraocular inflammatory signs, as well as other indicators of disease activity, while 15% of them had stable outcomes.–The approval of adalimumab for uveitis is a huge step forward in the management of refractory sarcoid uveitis. Table 4 contains a summary of the latest studies on the use of adalimumab in sarcoid-related uveitis.–

### Use of immunomodulators in non-infectious uveitis: lights and shadows [^117WGPbq]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is one of the leading causes of sight impairment worldwide. Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment for acute NIU, although their known systemic and ocular side effects limit their long-term use. The most common types of immunosuppressants used as steroid-sparing treatment are non-biologic drugs, particularly antimetabolites (methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine) and biologic drugs, mainly TNF-α inhibitors such as Adalimumab or Infliximab. Antimetabolites have shown their effectiveness in the treatment of NIU in individual and comparative studies, being methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil usually preferred over azathioprine. The choice of which antimetabolite to use at first is not well defined, and decisions usually depend on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preferences. Treatment of NIU with biologic drugs, and particularly TNF-α inhibitors, has significantly increased in the last years and is considered an important alternative in patients not responding to first-line immunomodulators such as antimetabolites. However, data regarding how different immunomodulators or biologic drugs perform in different NIU is still limited, and little is known about the optimization of both biologic and non-biologic drugs when used in NIU. Further randomized clinical trials and comparative studies are required to achieve more understanding and better results when addressing complicated NIU. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of non-biologic and biologic drugs in NIU, which may be useful for clinicians in their daily practice, and to address those aspects that are less known about these treatments as well as their weaknesses.

### The use of positron emission tomography / CT in the diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated uveitis [^113k2JJK]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Detection of tuberculosis as the underlying disease in uveitis can be problematic because of the limited sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods, especially in the case of latent infection. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT ((18)F-FDG-PET/CT) in patients with uveitis and positive interferon-γ release assay.

Methods

We screened 95 patients with different uveitis forms by QuantiFERON TB-Gold test. Positive results were found in 24 cases. (18)F-FDG-PET/CT was performed in 20 QuantiFERON-positive patients. PET/CT images were evaluated for the presence, size and metabolic activity of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary lesions.

Results

In nine patients (45%) PET/CT detected increased FDG uptake in mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. In two patients Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in culture after PET/CT-guided lymph node biopsy. In seven patients (35%) with serpiginous choroiditis partly calcified lymph nodes without FDG-uptake were found. Remission of uveitis was achieved in nine of 11 (82%) anti-tuberculosis-treated patients with progressive course of uveitis.

Conclusion

In QuantiFERON-positive patients with severe uveitis forms, such as serpiginous choroiditis and occlusive retinal vasculitis, (18)F-FDG-PET/CT is useful to identify lesions appropriate for biopsy and helps to establish the diagnosis and appropriate therapy for presumed tuberculosis-induced intraocular inflammation.

### Interferon-gamma release assay as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis-associated uveitis [^1173a7Zb]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical characteristics of the 138 study subjects are seen in Table 1. The mean age of these patients was 46.8 ± 15.3 years. The majority were Chinese (n = 80, 58.0%) and female (n = 75, 54.3%). We found no significant differences in terms of age, gender, race, or anatomical classification of uveitis between patients with positive or negative T-SPOT.TB results. Patients presented with ocular signs consistent with a tubercular cause such as granulomatous (n = 10) or medium keratic precipitates (n = 52); iris nodules (n = 16); broad and extensive posterior synechiae (n = 36); choroiditis (n = 14), serpinginous choroiditis, (n = 1) or vasculitis (n = 33). There were no cases of definite ocular TB infection in this study cohort as nine patients had vitreous biopsy and were found to have no evidence of a positive AFB smear, MTB culture, or PCR assay from these ocular samples. However, five patients (3.7%) had AFB smear-positive sputum samples and two (1.5%) patients had positive PCR results from urine samples. The majority of patients (124/138, 89.9%) had CXR findings that were not suggestive of pulmonary TB infection, as defined. A total of 50 patients were presumed TAU as defined in our study, and completed ATT for a median duration of 6.9 (range 6–9) months. All patients who were treated with ATT resolved with no recurrence. The remaining patients (n = 88) were presumed negative and were responsive to corticosteroid therapy only.

### Guidance on noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory therapy in noninfectious uveitis: fundamentals of care for uveitiS (FOCUS) initiative [^115dGTNV]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Topic

An international, expert-led consensus initiative to develop systematic, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis in the era of biologics.

Clinical Relevance

The availability of biologic agents for the treatment of human eye disease has altered practice patterns for the management of noninfectious uveitis. Current guidelines are insufficient to assure optimal use of noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory agents.

Methods

An international expert steering committee comprising 9 uveitis specialists (including both ophthalmologists and rheumatologists) identified clinical questions and, together with 6 bibliographic fellows trained in uveitis, conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol systematic review of the literature (English language studies from January 1996 through June 2016; Medline [OVID], the Central Cochrane library, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, BIOSIS, and Web of Science). Publications included randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective studies with sufficient follow-up, case series with 15 cases or more, peer-reviewed articles, and hand-searched conference abstracts from key conferences. The proposed statements were circulated among 130 international uveitis experts for review. A total of 44 globally representative group members met in late 2016 to refine these guidelines using a modified Delphi technique and assigned Oxford levels of evidence.

Results

In total, 10 questions were addressed resulting in 21 evidence-based guidance statements covering the following topics: when to start noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy, including both biologic and nonbiologic agents; what data to collect before treatment; when to modify or withdraw treatment; how to select agents based on individual efficacy and safety profiles; and evidence in specific uveitic conditions. Shared decision-making, communication among providers and safety monitoring also were addressed as part of the recommendations. Pharmacoeconomic considerations were not addressed.

Conclusions

Consensus guidelines were developed based on published literature, expert opinion, and practical experience to bridge the gap between clinical needs and medical evidence to support the treatment of patients with noninfectious uveitis with noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory agents.

### Successful treatment with infliximab in a patient with diffuse subretinal fibrosis syndrome [^1135Crdc]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of Diffuse Subretinal Fibrosis (DSF) syndrome refractory to immunosuppressive therapy who was successfully treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibodies infliximab.

Design

Interventional case report.

Methods

A 23-year-old male with bilateral choroiditis presented sudden dimness of vision associated to nasal scotoma in his right eye. Complete ophthalmic examination with appropriated clinical and laboratorial evaluations was carried out during all follow-up. Inform consent statement and Internal Ethics Board approval were also obtained for an open-label therapy schedule.

Results

Extensive temporal subretinal lesion in his right eye and DSF in the left eye were observed. The patient received intravenous infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg) schema. Four weeks after starting treatment his visual acuity improved with decrease in ocular inflammation.

Conclusions

This report describes a case of DSF syndrome that responded remarkably well to infliximab treatment suggesting that TNF-alpha could play an important pathogenetic role in this syndrome.

### Non-infectious orbital vasculitides [^114XzEjM]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Non-infectious vasculitides comprise a large number of diseases. Many of these diseases can cause inflammation within the orbit and a clinical presentation, which mimics numerous other processes. Orbital disease can often be the initial presentation of a systemic process and early diagnosis can help prevent long-term, potentially fatal consequences. The evaluation and treatment of non-infectious orbital vasculitides are often complicated and require a thorough understanding of the disease and underlying systemic associations. The long-term prognosis visually and systemically must be weighed against the risks and benefits of the treatment regimen. A large variety of corticosteroid formulations currently exist and are the mainstay of initial treatment. Traditional steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents are also an important arsenal against these vasculitides. Recently, a new class of drugs called biologics, which target the various mediators of the inflammation cascade, may potentially provide more effective and less toxic treatment. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on non-infectious orbital vasculitides.

### The association between quantiFERON-TB gold test and clinical manifestations of uveitis in the United States [^112JujPn]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To report the prevalence of QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) positivity among uveitis patients compared to general population and to evaluate the differences in clinical features of uveitis.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

SETTING: Institutional.

Patient Population

418 consecutive new uveitis patients, regardless of clinical suspicion, were tested for QFT-G.

Observation Procedures

Demographics, TB risk factors, clinical characteristics of uveitis were collected.

Main Outcome Measures

The frequency of QFT-G positivity among uveitis patients and characteristic clinical features among QFT-G positive patients.

Results

QFT-G positivity was found in 60/418 patients with uveitis (14.4%, 95% CI: 11.18–18.14) higher than the general US population (5%, 95% CI: 4.2–5.8, p < .001). Age, gender and residence were similar between QFT-G positive and negative groups. Uveitis patients with positive QFT-G were more likely to be foreign born or have a recent travel history (OR:5.84; 95% CI: 2.83–12.05; p < .001). QFT-G positive patients were more likely to present with granulomatous uveitis (OR 2.90; 95%CI 1.36–6.21; p = .006). No significant association was found with specific clinical features such as choroiditis, retinal vasculitis, occlusive vasculitis, and serpiginoid choroiditis (p > .05 for each). Prevalence of TB-uveitis based on treatment response was 1.19%.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates significantly higher prevalence of QFT-G positivity among uveitis patients compared to average US population. Characteristic signs of TB uveitis reported in endemic countries were not seen in this cohort. Implications of higher prevalence of QFT-G positivity among uveitis patients require further investigation.

### Effect of adalimumab on choroidal thickness and choroidal vascularity index in eyes with non-infectious uveitis using enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography [^116GQzFg]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uveitis is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world, accounting for 10–15% of all blindness cases. Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) can be caused by various systemic or ocular autoimmune rheumatological disorders including Behçet disease (BD), HLA-B27-associated uveitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. However, patients with systemic rheumatological disorders without ocular involvement (non-uveitic = NU) may also be encountered.

There are several immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of NIU. Although corticosteroids are commonly preferred, immunomodulatory steroid-sparing agents such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and calcineurin inhibitors are necessary in cases with panuveitis. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of NIU, and anti-TNF-α drugs such as infliximab, daclizumab, and adalimumab (ADA) have been used to selectively inhibit this cytokine as a novel modern therapy in refractory cases.

It is important to monitor disease activation, complications, and the effects of systemic treatment in patients with uveitis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to monitor retinal complications and provides information on macular thickness (MT). Although various studies have investigated choroidal thickness (ChT) as an indicator of disease activity, its measurement does not objectively represent the entire choroidal vascular structure, and ChT is influenced by many factors such as age, sex, axial length, refractive error, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Enhanced-depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT), in turn, is a non-invasive technique that provides deeper choroidal accessibility and visibility. The choroid's vascular-luminal area (LA), interstitial-stromal area (SA), and subfoveal-total choroidal area (TCA) can be measured separately using EDI-OCT. The novel choroidal vascularity index (CVI) is then calculated as the ratio of LA/TCA that demonstrates the % proportion of vascularity within the choroidal tissue. Therefore, CVI is thought to be more stable and less variable than ChT in the presence of abnormalities in choroidal microvascular structure, which may be used as a more specific, quantitative, and reliable biomarker in numerous retinal and choroidal diseases.

### Role of optical coherence tomography angiography in detecting and monitoring inflammatory choroidal neovascularization [^114jNU97]. Retina (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the utility of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for the detection of inflammatory choroidal neovascularization (iCNV) and monitoring their response to treatment.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of uveitis and associated iCNV with active exudation was performed. Active iCNV was determined by spectral domain OCT and/or fluorescein angiogram. Spectral domain OCTA outer retina to choriocapillaris slabs was evaluated for the presence of iCNV. Follow-up OCTA images were qualitatively assessed to determine whether regression of iCNV occurred after treatment.

Results

Thirteen eyes of 12 patients were included. The etiologies of uveitis include punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 4), multifocal choroiditis (n = 2), presumed sarcoid uveitis (n = 2), tuberculous choroiditis (n = 1), birdshot chorioretinopathy (n = 1), syphilitic uveitis (n = 1), serpiginous choroiditis (n = 1), and idiopathic panuveitis (n = 1). Inflammatory choroidal neovascularization was detected on en face OCTA in 10 of 13 eyes (76.9%). After iCNV treatment, en face OCTA demonstrated complete regression of iCNV in 5 of 10 eyes (50%), partial regression in 2 of 10 eyes (20%), and no regression in 3 of 10 eyes (30%).

Conclusions

Optical coherence tomography angiography is an effective modality for detecting iCNV and could provide detailed visualization regarding location, morphologic structure, and flow of the iCNV and its response to therapy.

### Corticosteroids with or without conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug as first-line therapy in nonanterior sarcoidosis uveitis [^1172VP3D]. Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Sarcoidosis is one of the leading causes of non-infectious uveitis. Systemic immunosuppressive treatment is required in 45–70% of cases for severe intermediate or posterior uveitis, and relapses are frequent (30–60%) during the follow-up. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroid therapy alone versus corticosteroid plus Cs-DMARDs as first-line therapy in patients with non-anterior sarcoidosis uveitis.

Design

We conducted a multicentric retrospective study.

Participants

163 patients with non-anterior sarcoidosis-related uveitis were included.

Intervention

We have compared a first-line therapy with systemic corticosteroid therapy alone (CTC group) (n = 122) versus corticosteroid associated with csDMARD (CTC-DMARD group) (n = 41).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was treatment failure-free survival (TFFS) defined by the discontinuation of treatment for inefficiency or the occurrence of relapse.

Results

TFFS at 12 months was 0.83 [95%CI 0.67;0.91] and 0.65 [95%CI 0.55;0.72], respectively, in the CTC-DMARD and CTC group. In multivariable analysis adjusted on multifocal choroiditis and baseline dose of corticosteroids, the TFFS was significantly higher in the CTC-DMARD group as compared to the CTC group (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.21 [1.18;4.14], p = 0.01). There was a significant steroid-sparing effect at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.05) in the CTC-DMARD group compared to the CTC group. Fourteen (34%) and fifty (41%) patients had at least one adverse event in the CTC-DMARD and CTC groups, respectively.

Conclusions

In non-anterior sarcoidosis-associated uveitis, the CTC-DMARD association seemed to be more efficient than CTC alone, with an acceptable safety profile.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1116ruNn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Uveitis or iritis with ICPI therapy — grade-based management is as follows: For G1 anterior uveitis with trace cells, Continue ICPI, Prompt referral to ophthalmology (usually within 1 week), and Artificial tears. For G2 anterior uveitis with 1+ or 2+ cells, Hold ICPI temporarily until after ophthalmology consult and obtain Urgent ophthalmology referral; start Topical corticosteroids (eg, 1% prednisolone acetate suspension), cycloplegic agents (eg, atropine), and systemic corticosteroids; May resume ICPI treatment once off systemic steroids if patient has only ocular irAE, once corticosteroids are reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone equivalent; Continued topical or ocular steroids are permitted when resuming therapy to manage and minimize local toxicity; and Retreat after return to ≤ G1. For G3 anterior uveitis with 3+ or greater cells; intermediate posterior or pan-uveitis, Permanently discontinue ICPI with Urgent ophthalmology referral and Systemic corticosteroids and intravitreal or periocular/ or topical corticosteroids; Methotrexate may be used in patients who respond poorly to systemic corticosteroids or those with severe sight-threatening inflammation. For G4, defined as Best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the affected eye, Permanently discontinue ICPI, obtain Emergent ophthalmology referral, and give Systemic corticosteroids — prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/d or methylprednisolone 0.8–1.6 mg/kg/d and intravitreal or periocular or topical corticosteroids per ophthalmologist opinion. Additional considerations: Consider use of infliximab, other TNFα blockers, or IVIG in cases that are severe and refractory to standard treatment.

### Adalimumab (adalimumab-aacf) [^114ooz8t]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.10 Adult Uveitis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ′time to treatment failure′.

Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15.

Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.

Clinical Response

Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 20).

### A review and update on orphan drugs for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis [^111GBp2S]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

IMT agents include the antimetabolites methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil; the calcineurin inhibitors that include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and sirolimus; alkylating agents that include cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil; biologic response modifiers that include the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab, and certolizumab; lymphocyte inhibitors that include daclizumab, rituximab, abatacept, and basiliximab; specific receptor antagonists that include anakinra, canakinumab, gevokizumab, tocilizumab, alemtuzumab, efalizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab; and interferon (INF) treatments. Refractory and recurrent uveitis requires immunomodulatory monotherapy or a combination protocol to control the inflammation. Continuing evidence shows that second-line agents, including antimetabolites, T-cell inhibitors, and alkylating agents, and biologics are effective in many patients, allowing reduction in steroid dose and preservation of visual function. Aggressive treatment may result in fewer complications and less recurrence.

Our team has reviewed IMT drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in uveitis. In this study, we review and summarize conventional IMT drugs or biologics that have not received approval as an "orphan drug" from the FDA for use in noninfectious uveitic patients, despite having been approved for use in treating other systemic diseases or organ transplantation.
