## Question

￼ best way to treat a seroma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best way to treat a seroma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining seroma and its pathophysiology to anchor management. Then, I should classify seroma by clinical context and severity because treatment differs by procedure, size, and infection status. Next, I will review first-line conservative strategies, followed by second-line interventions for refractory cases. After that, I should consider special scenarios like infection, prosthetic devices, and chronic pseudobursa. Finally, I will integrate prevention, summarize an algorithm, and state a concise, evidence-based recommendation with caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: a seroma is a sterile collection of serous fluid in a surgical dead space, driven by disrupted lymphatics, inflammatory exudate, and shearing forces that prevent tissue apposition. Chronic collections may develop a fibrous capsule that perpetuates fluid accumulation, which is why recurrence is common without definitive obliteration of the cavity [^d60828ba] [^982528af].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical contexts because management is context-specific: seromas occur after abdominoplasty, mastectomy/axillary surgery, hernia repair, lymphadenectomy, prosthetic breast reconstruction, latissimus dorsi donor sites, and trauma-related Morel-Lavallée lesions. Incidence and behavior vary widely across these settings, so I need to tailor treatment accordingly [^a1b55072] [^6c3179e9] [^982528af] [^bf298f82] [^98872c31] [^df04119c].

> Next, I should review severity and indications for intervention, and I need to ensure I'm precise: small, asymptomatic seromas often resolve spontaneously, whereas symptomatic, large, persistent, or infected collections warrant treatment. Ultrasound helps confirm size, septations, and guide interventions, and in some settings (e.g. ventral hernia repair), early seromas are expected and observed unless symptomatic or persistent beyond roughly 90 days [^a4b4ae85] [^982528af].

> Let me consider first-line conservative management, and I should double-check the hierarchy: observation with compression and activity restriction is reasonable for small, asymptomatic collections. Ultrasound-guided aspiration is the preferred initial therapy for symptomatic or larger seromas because it is safe, accurate, and reduces recurrence compared to blind aspiration. Compression garments and immobilization can aid resolution after drainage, though compression alone does not prevent formation [^d9768044] [^0019fda6] [^0d0c55d1].

> Wait, let me verify the role of compression garments and immobilization so I don't overstate them: compression can reduce recurrence after aspiration and may modestly reduce formation in some contexts, but evidence is mixed and procedure-dependent. Immobilization for 48 hours after abdominoplasty has been associated with lower seroma rates, but thromboembolism risk must be mitigated, so I should individualize this strategy [^09e93646] [^0d0c55d1].

> I will now examine second-line options for refractory or recurrent seromas, and I need to check the strength of evidence: sclerotherapy with tetracyclines (commonly doxycycline) is a well-described, minimally invasive approach that induces fibrosis and obliterates the cavity. Success varies with seroma size and number of treatments, and it is particularly useful for chronic collections and Morel-Lavallée lesions. Fibrin sealant instillation can be effective in select refractory cases, though data are limited and heterogeneous. Surgical excision of the pseudobursa with quilting sutures is definitive for chronic, organized seromas that fail conservative therapy [^d60828ba] [^df04119c] [^b561db47] [^98872d31].

> But wait, what if the seroma is infected or around a prosthesis? I should confirm the management shift: infected seromas generally require drainage plus antibiotics. In prosthetic breast reconstruction, persistent seroma increases infection and explantation risk, so I should maintain a low threshold for aspiration, consider early expansion to reduce dead space, and use evidence-based infection-prevention strategies including timely drain removal and aseptic technique. In vascular access graft seromas, KDOQI advises individualized management, with ultrasound confirmation and escalation to graft revision if persistent or complicated [^bf424f29] [^442b50ed].

> Let me reconsider prevention because the best "treatment" is to avoid seroma in the first place: intraoperative strategies with the strongest support include progressive tension sutures, Scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty, and closed-suction drainage with evidence-based removal thresholds. Negative-pressure wound therapy on closed incisions reduces seroma in some settings but evidence is heterogeneous and device/settings matter. Fibrin sealant reduces drain output but does not consistently reduce seroma incidence, so I should not overpromise its benefit [^268d4677] [^3c5f2dd4] [^6c3179e9] [^b6fceefa] [^6d57ecad].

> I should double-check the practical algorithm so it's actionable: for any new seroma, confirm with ultrasound and assess symptoms, size, and infection risk. Small, asymptomatic collections get observation with compression and activity modification. Symptomatic or larger seromas undergo ultrasound-guided aspiration with aseptic technique and compression. Recurrent or persistent seromas after 2–3 aspirations should be considered for sclerotherapy or fibrin sealant. Chronic, organized pseudobursae require surgical excision with quilting sutures. Throughout, address modifiable risks and reassess for infection or prosthesis-related complications [^d9768044] [^982528af] [^d60828ba] [^98872d31].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure it aligns with evidence: there is no single "best" treatment for all seromas. The best approach is context-specific, starting with ultrasound-guided aspiration and compression for most symptomatic cases, escalating to sclerotherapy or surgical pseudobursa excision for refractory collections, and integrating prevention strategies to reduce recurrence. Early, definitive obliteration of the dead space is the key principle for durable resolution [^d9768044] [^d60828ba] [^98872d31] [^0d0c55d1].

---

The best way to treat a seroma is to **start with observation and compression** for small, asymptomatic collections, and escalate to **ultrasound-guided aspiration** if the seroma is symptomatic, large, or persistent [^d9768044] [^0019fda6]. For recurrent or chronic seromas, **sclerotherapy (doxycycline or talc)** is effective and should be considered [^d60828ba] [^3b131a47]. Reserve **surgical excision of the pseudobursa** for refractory cases that fail conservative measures [^98872d31]. Always confirm diagnosis with ultrasound, maintain strict aseptic technique, and tailor management to the clinical context and patient factors [^a4b4ae85] [^982528af].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and initial assessment

- **Ultrasound evaluation**: Ultrasound is the gold standard for confirming seroma, assessing size, location, and guiding interventions [^d9768044] [^a4b4ae85].

- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate for symptoms (pain, swelling, infection) and patient-specific factors (comorbidities, anticoagulation, immunosuppression) [^6af23ff7].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for **small, asymptomatic seromas** and includes:

- **Observation**: Many seromas resolve spontaneously over time [^982528af].

- **Compression garments**: Apply firm, consistent pressure to reduce fluid accumulation and promote tissue adherence [^0d0c55d1].

- **Activity modification**: Limit strenuous activities to minimize shear forces and fluid production [^09e93646].

---

## Ultrasound-guided aspiration

Indicated for **symptomatic, large, or persistent seromas**, ultrasound-guided aspiration is the **first-line invasive treatment**:

- **Procedure**: Aspirate fluid under sterile conditions using ultrasound guidance to avoid injury to adjacent structures [^d9768044] [^0019fda6].

- **Recurrence**: Recurrence is common (20–50%), especially if the cavity is not obliterated [^notfound].

- **Limitations**: Repeated aspirations increase infection risk and patient discomfort [^d60828ba].

---

## Sclerotherapy

For recurrent or chronic seromas, **sclerotherapy is effective**:

- **Agents**: Doxycycline, talc, or erythromycin are commonly used sclerosants [^d60828ba] [^3b131a47].

- **Mechanism**: Sclerosants induce inflammation, fibrosis, and obliteration of the seroma cavity [^74140403].

- **Success**: High success rates (70–90%) with low recurrence after 1–2 treatments [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Mild pain, fever, and rare infection are reported [^74140403].

---

## Surgical management

Reserve **surgical excision** for refractory seromas that fail conservative and sclerotherapy:

- **Indication**: Persistent seroma with a well-formed pseudobursa or multiple recurrences [^98872d31].

- **Technique**: Excise the pseudobursa, obliterate dead space with quilting sutures, and consider fibrin sealant or negative pressure therapy [^98872d31] [^4e1c331c].

- **Outcomes**: High success with low recurrence when performed correctly [^98872d31].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventive measures during the initial surgery **reduce seroma risk**:

- **Surgical technique**: Minimize dead space, preserve lymphatics, and use progressive tension sutures or quilting sutures [^268d4677] [^3c5f2dd4].

- **Drains**: Closed-suction drains are effective; remove when output is < 50 mL/day for 2 consecutive days [^6c3179e9] [^d85db6a5].

- **Adjuncts**: Fibrin sealant and negative pressure wound therapy may reduce seroma in select cases [^b6fceefa] [^a6e9ed99].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

Tailor management to **patient-specific factors**:

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, obesity, and immunosuppression increase risk and may require more aggressive management [^d44d9fb7] [^eecc8c3c].

- **Anticoagulation**: Coordinate anticoagulation management to balance thrombotic risk against bleeding during aspiration or surgery [^notfound].

- **Patient preference**: Engage in shared decision-making, especially for recurrent or chronic seromas [^6d57ecad].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Observation + compression | Small, asymptomatic seromas |
| 2 | Ultrasound-guided aspiration | Symptomatic, large, or persistent seromas |
| 3 | Sclerotherapy (doxycycline/talc) | Recurrent or chronic seromas |
| 4 | Surgical excision of pseudobursa | Refractory seromas failing conservative therapy |

---

The best way to treat a seroma is to **start with observation and compression**, escalate to **ultrasound-guided aspiration** if needed, and use **sclerotherapy or surgery** for recurrent or refractory cases, with management individualized to patient factors and clinical context.

### Strategies for postoperative seroma prevention: a systematic review [^0d0c55d1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of the various strategies to prevent postoperative seroma. Many high-quality studies have been performed to evaluate those strategies, but the numbers of patients included in those studies have been small. The authors' goal was to perform a systematic review of all Level I and II studies on the prevention of postoperative seroma.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed of all Level I and II studies that evaluated strategies for the prevention of postoperative seroma. Only English-language comparative studies on humans, defining seroma as a postoperative serous fluid collection detectable on physical examination, were included. Data from all the studies were compiled, and a systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy.

Results

Seventy-five studies comprising 7173 patients were included. Effective strategies for seroma prevention included the use of closed-suction drains; keeping the drains until their output volume was minimal; maintaining a high pressure gradient in the drains; using sharp or ultrasonic dissection rather than cautery; dissecting the abdomen in a place superficial to the Scarpa fascia; ligating blood vessels with sutures or clips; using quilting or progressive tension sutures; using fibrin, thrombin, or talc; and immobilizing the surgical site postoperatively. Surgical-site compression did not prevent seroma accumulation. The use of sclerosants at the initial operation actually increased the risk of seroma.

Conclusions

Seroma is a common and frustrating complication in plastic surgery. This study demonstrates that simple strategies can be used to lower the risk of seroma.

Seromas are a common complication in plastic surgery. In this article, the authors describe their approach to the prevention and treatment of seromas and include a discussion of the evolution of their techniques. They provide specific technical details for many body contouring operations, including abdominoplasty, belt lipectomy, brachioplasty, and thighplasty. Many of the authors' techniques question the traditional dictums of plastic surgery, and they hope to encourage others to consider novel techniques for the treatment and prevention of seromas.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^442b50ed]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 19 — management of arteriovenous graft (AVG) seroma states that KDOQI considers it reasonable to carefully monitor for complications of AVG seroma and manage based on the patient's individual circumstances and the clinician's best judgment and discretion (Expert Opinion). Reported incidence is 1.7% among 535 AVGs, ultrasound can confirm seroma/fluid around the AVG, and most early seromas are self-limited but can serve as a nidus for infection. Seromas that persist or develop after the early postoperative period may necessitate AVG removal and replacement, yet the majority of AVGs can be salvaged and longer-term results are reasonable.

### Prevention of seroma formation following abdominoplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a1b55072]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

With seroma formation being the most common complication of abdominoplasty, multiple surgical strategies have been proposed to lower the seroma rate, yet their effectiveness is unclear.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to comprehensively summarize and quantify the effects of preventive surgical measures for seroma in patients undergoing abdominoplasty.

Methods

A predetermined protocol was used. An electronic search in MEDLINE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and CENTRAL electronic databases was conducted from inception to June 2016. This search was supplemented by a review of reference lists of potentially eligible studies and a manual search of key journals in the field of plastic surgery. Eligible studies were prospective controlled studies, which investigated prevention of seroma formation and reported on seroma rate. Secondary outcomes were rate of hematoma, wound dehiscence, infection, reoperation and hospital readmission, time to drain removal, total drain output, and length of hospital stay.

Results

The meta-analysis included nine studies with 664 abdominoplasty patients. Seroma rate was 7.5% in the prevention group and 19.5% in the control group with the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) being 0.26 (0.10–0.67), P = 0.006, favoring the prevention group. Similar results were also revealed for infection rate, time to drain removal, and length of hospital stay. Subgroup analysis showed that preservation of Scarpa's fascia, tissue adhesives and, possibly, progressive tension sutures reduce, independently, seroma formation.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis provides strong evidence that the use of certain preventive measures during abdominoplasty, compared to conventional procedure, reduces seroma formation.

### Managing late periprosthetic fluid collections (seroma) in patients with breast implants: a consensus panel recommendation and review of the literature [^f8b53d7c]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this consensus is to establish an algorithm for the management of patients who develop a late or delayed periprosthetic fluid collection. A work group of practicing plastic surgeons and device industry physicians met periodically by teleconference and discussed issues pertinent to the diagnosis and management of late periprosthetic fluid collections in patients with breast implants. Based on these meetings, treatment recommendations and a treatment algorithm were prepared in association with an editorial assistant.

Method

The work group participants discussed optimal care approaches developed in their private practices and from evidence in the literature.

Results

The consensus algorithm and treatment and management recommendations represent the consensus of the group.

Conclusions

The group concluded that late periprosthetic fluid collection (arbitrarily defined as occurring ≥ 1 year after implant) is an infrequently reported occurrence (0.1 percent) after breast implant surgery and that, at a minimum, management should include clinically indicated ultrasound-guided aspiration of fluid, with appropriate cultures and cytologic testing. Further evaluation and additional treatment is recommended for recurrence of periprosthetic fluid collection after aspiration, or clinical suspicion of infection or neoplasia.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^c3323c1c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The three studies 34, 38, 39 that reported on seroma formation were performed by the same research team, rendering the study designs comparable. Owing to some risk of bias within the studies, and because all three studies had a small sample size (19–21 patients), the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. The pooled results showed a convincing effect of iNPWT on seroma formation. The NNT to avoid one seroma (3, 95 per cent c.i. 2 to 8) suggested that iNPWT might be cost‐effective with respect to reducing the risk of seroma formation within the first 10 days after surgery. However, with a mean reduction of 1·97 mL (day 5) and 1·44 mL (day 10), the clinical relevance is questionable. A larger effect was found in an animal study 21 focusing on the effect of iNPWT treatment on lymph clearance. The authors found that 4 days of treatment reduced the quantity of haematoma/seroma by a mean(s.e.m.) of 25(8) g in iNPWT sites compared with control sites. All three studies included in this review had a hospital‐based follow‐up of 10 days, which could be a weakness. Seroma volume and the duration of seroma production depend on many factors, including anatomical site, surgical procedure and the size of the defect. Many seromas might have decreased by day 10, but the total seroma production and a possible effect of iNPWT on this is difficult to assess when the patients have not been followed to the end of fluid production. Accordingly, longer follow‐up would be preferable.

### Managing infected seroma post-lymphadenectomy; A retrospective cohort study and cost analysis in melanoma patients [^ac5acb60]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Seromas are a common and unavoidable complication following lymphadenectomy, and often become clinically significant with superseded infection requiring re-admission for prompt intervention. However, there is no consensus as to whether a formal surgical incision and drainage (I&D), ultrasound (US)-guided aspiration or intravenous (IV) antibiotics alone is the most efficacious method of managing an infected seroma, the investigation of which formed the rationale for this study.

Subjects and Methods

This retrospective cohort study included a consecutive series of patients readmitted for infected seroma following a lymphadenectomy for melanoma at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust (LTHT) from 2006 to 2017. Details on management, length of hospital stay, length of follow-up and number of clinical appointments required were examined.

Findings

Seventy-one cases of infected seroma were identified from the cohort of 1691 lymphadenectomies. Initially, 21 patients (29.5%) were managed by IV antibiotics alone (failure rate of 52.4%); 18 (25.4%) with US-guided aspiration (failure rate 27.8%) and 32 (45.1%) with surgical I&D, which was 100% effective. Ultimately, 62.5% of the cohort required surgical management. Patients who underwent surgical I&D were discharged significantly faster following the procedure (3 versus 5 days for US-guided aspiration, p = 0.002) and spent fewer days in hospital overall (p = 0.022). The overall average cost was comparable across the three treatment groups.

Conclusions

Surgical management seemed preferential to conservative approaches in terms of efficacy and was not significantly more expensive overall; but carries anaesthetic risk. There may be a clinically significant difference in outcome depending on management; however, more evidence is required to investigate this.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^808bf75e]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

See the Commentary on this article.

Abdominoplasty, also known as a "tummy tuck," is currently 1 of the top 5 most frequently performed aesthetic surgical procedures in the United States. As the number of bariatric surgeries increases, the number of patients experiencing significant skin excess and laxity of predominantly the abdominal area is also expected to rise, leading to an anticipated increase in the number of abdominoplasties in the future. In fact, the number of abdominoplasties has already increased by 28% between 2012 and 2017, with a significant majority of patients being female.

Abdominoplasty has been shown to have a positive impact on self-image and quality of life, however it also has a relatively high complication rate. The most common complications are local and include seroma, hematoma, wound dehiscences, infections, and necrosis. Systemic complications, such as thromboembolic events, are less common. Seroma, defined as the accumulation of serous fluid between the abdominal skin flap and the rectus abdominis muscle fascia, is the most frequently reported complication, with rates ranging from 5% to 43%. Seroma can cause discomfort for the patient, require frequent outpatient visits with or without the need for aspiration, and may delay recovery. If left untreated, seroma can lead to the formation of a pseudobursa that may require surgical revision. Therefore, in the case of significant fluid accumulation, puncturing and draining are advised treatment options. The utilization of closed-suction drains at the end of an abdominoplasty procedure has been standard care for seroma prevention; however, this method has the disadvantage of causing postoperative pain and increasing the risk of infection, especially when the time to drain removal is extended. The formation of a "dead space," shearing forces between the abdominal flap and fascia, and the disruption of lymphatic vessels are thought to contribute to seroma formation following an abdominoplasty procedure. Currently there is a lack of hard evidence concerning the impact of lymphatic disruption on seroma formation.

### Therapeutical strategies to prevent abdominoplasty complications: a systematic review [^371e27d7]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures. Despite improvements in the abdominoplasty technique, seroma is the most common complication, ranging from 5 to 43%. This study aimed to review the literature to compare therapeutic strategies to prevent common adverse events in abdominoplasty.

Methods

This review analyzed patients of both sexes older than 18 years who underwent abdominoplasty with or without liposuction. This study analyzed the following endpoints: frequency of seromas, surgical site infection, hematoma, dehiscence, necrosis, death, treatment duration for adverse events, length of hospital stay, seroma/hematoma volume.

Results

We analyzed 24 articles, totaling 2997 participants with ages ranging from 18 to 85 years. The meta-analysis of 4 studies, with 180 participants, showed a 69% reduction in the occurrence of seroma when Scarpa's fascia preservation was adopted (OR, 0.38; 95%CI 0.16–0.91). Regarding other complications, Scarpa's fascia preservation showed a lower risk of infection (OR 0.31; 95%CI 0.12–0.79) and also lower risk of hematoma (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.09–0.95) in seroma for Scarpa's fascia preservation when compared to not fascia's preservation.

Conclusion

This review suggests that Scarpa fascia preservation decreases seromas, infections, and hematomas. However, more randomized controlled trials are necessary to improve the level of certainty.

### Clinical evaluation of 310 abdominoplasties and measurement of scar level [^d52e7eb5]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Seromas

When plastic surgeons discuss seroma rates, they typically mean seromas that require treatment. The average seroma rate reported in the literature is approximately 10%. An ultrasound study detected at least 20 mL of fluid in 38% of abdominoplasty patients 11 days after surgery. Most clinical studies on abdominoplasty have focused on seroma prevention. The word "seroma" frequently appears in the title. Remarkably, the 3 major changes in surgical method in the last 2 decades — quilting sutures, Scarpa fascia preservation, and a limited dissection lipoabdominoplasty — are all directed toward reducing the risk of this single complication and account for almost all publications on abdominoplasty. – Such a heavy emphasis on a self-limited event, to the exclusion of other more important considerations (eg, anesthetic considerations, improved safety, analysis of the aesthetic result), seems disproportionate. In the author's experience, seromas are typically managed in the office with aspirations (Fig. 13) and resolve, without any lasting effect. The 4.8% seroma rate in this study is almost identical to the 5.4% seroma rate in a previous study of patients treated between 2002 and 2006. This rate is sufficiently low to represent a minor nuisance. No patient required a return to the operating room for its treatment. This rate compares favorably with other series using alternative methods (range, 3.5%–32%).

### Buried dermal flap for the treatment of chronic postoperative seroma [^ffec0a7a]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Postoperative seroma is a common postoperative complication, particularly following surgery on massive weight loss patients. Within this patient population, seromas are often chronic, requiring multiple invasive procedures to adequately control. Here, the authors describe a unique dermal flap approach for the long-term treatment of postoperative seroma.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^81cd4b36]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this systematic review indicate that the preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure is associated with a lower incidence of seroma, reduced total drain output, and faster drain removal, compared with the traditional method of performing an abdominoplasty without Scarpa's fascia preservation. Sparing Scarpa's fascia may lead to a reduction in the formation of seroma after the procedure and for this reason it should be considered as a routine practice.

### Challenges and management of surgical site occurrences [^6af23ff7]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications such as surgical site infections, dehiscence, seromas, and hematomas prolong wound care and impose significant cost increases to patients and healthcare providers. Clinicians aiming to reduce the incidence of these complications should be aware of risk factors associated with surgical type, procedures used, patient characteristics, and postoperative care. Today, improved guidelines and general practices for managing surgical incisions have reduced the incidence of complications to historic lows. In addition to these standard care options, advanced wound care approaches have been extensively studied and exist as options for clinicians to provide adjunctive postoperative support and facilitate wound healing. These systems include advanced wound dressings and closed-incision negative-pressure therapy. Advanced wound care is not appropriate in all settings, and healthcare providers must assess each case for specific needs to be addressed by the available incision management plans. Emerging therapies that are intended to improve the continuum of postoperative care should continue to be evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine their effectiveness under different circumstances and to support the creation of more robust guidelines for their use.

### Prevention of seroma formation and its sequelae after axillary lymph node dissection: an up-to-date systematic review and guideline for surgeons [^6c3179e9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seroma formation after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains a troublesome complication with significant morbidity. Numerous studies have tried to identify techniques to prevent seroma formation. The aim of this systematic review and network meta-analysis is to use available literature to identify the best intervention for prevention of seroma after standalone ALND.

Methods

A literature search was performed for all comparative articles regarding seroma formation in patients undergoing a standalone ALND or ALND with breast-conserving surgery in the last 25 years. Data regarding seroma formation, clinically significant seroma (CSS), surgical site infections (SSI), and hematomas were collected. The network meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model and the level of inconsistency was evaluated using the Bucher method.

Results

A total of 19 articles with 1962 patients were included. Ten different techniques to prevent seroma formation were described. When combining direct and indirect comparisons, axillary drainage until output is less than 50 mL per 24 h for two consecutive days results in significantly less CSS. The use of energy sealing devices, padding, tissue glue, or patches did not significantly reduce the incidence of CSS. When comparing the different techniques with regard to SSIs, no statistically significant differences were seen.

Conclusions

To prevent CSS after ALND, axillary drainage is the most valuable and scientifically proven measure. On the basis of the results of this systematic review with network meta-analysis, removing the drain when output is < 50 mL per 24 h for two consecutive days irrespective of duration seems best. Since drainage policies vary widely, an evidence-based guideline is needed.

### Soft tissue masses: evaluation and treatment… [^a4b4ae85]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging Studies ULTRASONOGRAPHY 2, 54Advantages of using traditional or point-of-care ultrasonography include low cost, no radiation exposure, and the ability to evaluate compressibility and assess real-time blood flow. Point-of-care ultrasonography can be used for follow-up in the clinic to evaluate changes. COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY 56CT is especially helpful when a patient has a medical device that is incompatible with MRI, large body habitus, deep retroperitoneal mass, or a high-risk metallic foreign body. 56, 57. Biopsy 5, 24The location of the biopsy and possible local spread of the malignancy can affect management. 5If there is confidence in the diagnosis, benign masses such as epidermal inclusion cysts and lipomas can be removed en bloc by the family physician. 58, 59Tissue from a removed mass should be sent to pathology to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is in question, imaging should be considered before a procedure. 63, 64.

When a worrisome mass is found, initial radiography followed by an expedited MRI with contrast are recommended pending radiology recommendation and referral to an orthopedic oncologist. 5, 19, 65. 15, 59 32Imaging with ultrasonography or MRI is rarely indicated. Treatment for benign pilar cysts can be simple local excision. GANGLION CYST 14Aspiration requires a large 18-gauge needle to remove the thick gelatinous fluid, and recurrence is common. 72Aspiration should be avoided when neurovascular structures surround the cyst such as with radial-sided volar wrist cysts. Open or arthroscopic excision is suggested if initial conservative therapy is ineffective, and the cyst remains bothersome.
14. BAKER CYST 73These cysts can be more pronounced during a flare-up of knee arthritis. They may be found incidentally on MRI or ultrasonography.

Treatment includes monitoring, aspiration, corticosteroid injection, aspiration with ultrasound-guided fenestration of cyst walls, and arthroscopic cystectomy.
73. Treatment rarely requires excision, and many plantar fibromas can be managed conservatively with shoe padding or modifications. Corticosteroid injections can relieve pain and decrease the size of the fibroma. 36, 72 If orthotics and intralesional corticosteroid injections are ineffective, a subtotal fasciectomy with wide excision can be considered. 36.

### Seroma in prosthetic breast reconstruction [^bf298f82]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Seroma, as a complication of prosthetic breast reconstruction, results in patient distress, increased office visits, undesirable aesthetic outcomes, and — importantly — may escalate to infection and frank prosthesis loss. Herein, the authors review the pathophysiology and risk factors and attempt to collate published practices for avoidance and management of seroma.

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed using MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies published between 2000 and January of 2015. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the overall pooled incidence of seroma and to examine the effect of drain number and acellular dermal matrix use.

Results

Seventy-two relevant primary articles and three systematic reviews were identified. Fifty-one citations met inclusion criteria, including two randomized controlled trials. The overall pooled incidence was 5.4 percent (95 percent CI, 4.1 to 6.7 percent). Obesity, acellular dermal matrix, and preoperative irradiation were cited risk factors. Pooled relative risk for acellular dermal matrix was 1.83 (95 percent CI, 1.28 to 2.62). Drain practices were collated from 34 articles.

Conclusions

Seromas following prosthetic breast reconstruction are complicated by the hypovascular, proinflammatory milieu of the mastectomy skin flap, the geometrically complex dead space, and the presence of a foreign body with potential contamination and biofilm. There is reasonable evidence to suggest that these factors contribute to a progression of seroma to infection and prosthesis loss. These findings have motivated this summary article on current practice guidelines and strategies to prevent and treat seromas.

### Aspiration of periprosthetic seromas using the blunt seromaCath [^349ced0b]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Postoperative swelling following prosthetic implant breast augmentation and reconstruction is not uncommon. Prompt diagnosis and targeted treatment are critical. Current treatment recommendations achieve a diagnosis using specialized equipment with needle-guided imaging and/or surgical modalities. These techniques are expensive and delay diagnosis and treatment. The authors use an in-office, nonimaging technique to drain periprosthetic fluid after unilateral breast swelling after breast reconstruction or augmentation. Their technique is effective in diagnosing and treating seroma fluid with minimal risk of implant damage or perforation.

### Randomized clinical trial of prevention of seroma formation after mastectomy by local methylprednisolone injection [^abd3a634]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seroma formation, the most prevalent postoperative complication after mastectomy, is an inflammatory process that is potentially preventable via local steroid administration. This study investigated the effect of local steroid administration on seroma formation.

Methods

This was a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled intervention study of a single dose of 80 mg methylprednisolone versus saline on seroma formation after mastectomy. Patients were further classified according to the surgical axillary procedure: mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (M + SLNB) or mastectomy with level I-II axillary lymph node dissection (M + ALND). Treatments were administered into the wound cavity via the drain orifice following removal of the drain on the first day after surgery. The primary endpoint was seroma formation; secondary endpoints included the frequency of side-effects and complications.

Results

A total of 212 women scheduled for mastectomy for primary breast cancer were included. After M + SLNB, 32 (46 per cent) of 69 women developed a seroma in the methylprednisolone group, compared with 52 (78 per cent) of 67 in the saline group (P < 0.001). The mean cumulative seroma volume in the intention-to-treat population for the first 10 and 30 days was significantly lower in the methylprednisolone group (24 mL versus 127 mL in the saline group, and 177 versus 328 mL respectively) (P < 0.001). After M + ALND, similar proportions of patients developed a seroma in the methylprednisolone (35 of 37, 95 per cent) and saline (34 of 36, 94 per cent) groups, and methylprednisolone administration had no significant effect on seroma formation. No differences in infection rate were observed.

Conclusion

Methylprednisolone administered into the wound cavity on the first day after M + SLNB exerted a highly significant preventive effect against seroma formation during the next 30 days. This effect was not seen in the M + ALND group. Future studies may clarify whether higher or repeated methylprednisolone doses increase the efficacy.

### Effect of tissue adhesives on seroma incidence after abdominoplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^210bb202]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tissue adhesives (TAs) are widely utilized in abdominoplasty to reduce postoperative seroma. However, current literature regarding TAs in abdominoplasty is limited to small studies and the findings of single institutions.

Objectives

The authors reviewed the current literature regarding the effects of TAs on seroma formation and other endpoints following abdominoplasty, and summarized the types of TAs and application techniques that have been described to date.

Methods

A systematic review of the Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which the numbers of patients who experienced seroma after abdominoplasty were indicated. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was applied.

Results

Seven studies were included in a descriptive review, 5 of which were RCTs. Data from the 5 RCTs were pooled for a meta-analysis. Patients who received TAs following abdominoplasty had a similar incidence of seroma compared with patients who did not receive TAs. However, the total drainage volume was significantly lower for patients who received TAs.

Conclusions

There is a paucity of high-quality evidence to support the delivery of TAs to prevent seroma formation after abdominoplasty. Well-designed RCTs are needed to assess with confidence the overall effects of TAs in abdominoplasty.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^b6fceefa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative wound complications are common following surgical procedures. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well recognized for the management of open wounds and has been applied recently to closed surgical incisions. The evidence base to support this intervention is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whether NPWT reduces postoperative wound complications when applied to closed surgical incisions.

Methods

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of NPWT compared with standard postoperative dressings on closed surgical incisions.

Results

Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 1311 incisions in 1089 patients. NPWT was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk (RR) 0·54, 95 per cent c.i. 0·33 to 0·89) and seroma formation (RR 0·48, 0·27 to 0·84) compared with standard care. The reduction in wound dehiscence was not significant. The numbers needed to treat were three (seroma), 17 (dehiscence) and 25 (infection). Methodological heterogeneity across studies led to downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate for infection and seroma, and low for dehiscence.

Conclusion

Compared with standard postoperative dressings, NPWT significantly reduced the rate of wound infection and seroma when applied to closed surgical wounds. Heterogeneity between the included studies means that no general recommendations can be made yet.

### ASO author reflections: improved perioperative seroma and complication rates following the application of a two-layer negative pressure wound therapy system after inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic cutaneous melanoma [^5db7dbda]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Past

Inguinal lymphadenectomy is the current standard of care in the management of macroscopic nodal disease, but unfortunately postoperative complications are very common, especially seroma. Seroma rates from the published literature are, on average, approximately 50%. Multiple studies have investigated interventions designed to either reduce the incidence or reduce the extent of the problem once it has become established. A recent systematic review by the Cochrane Groupidentified a lack of any useful data and concluded that "… there is a need for high-quality randomized controlled trials to guide clinical practice in this under-researched area". Seromas are important because they affect patients' quality of life postoperatively, invariably cause patients to return repeatedly to the clinic over a period of many weeks for aspirations, and subsequent complications such as infection are common as a result.

### Surgical intervention for refractory donor-site seroma after immediate breast reconstruction with latissimus dorsi flap [^98872c31]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Donor-site seroma persisting for > 3 weeks is the most common complication of latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Conservative treatment is insufficient for refractory seroma resolution. We report the results of surgical intervention for refractory donor-site seroma. Between January 2012 and April 2018, 319 patients undergoing breast reconstruction using an LD flap at our hospital were treated with conservative therapy if seroma was found. Refractory seroma of > 3 months' duration was observed in five patients (1.6%). Before surgery, the precise location and extent of the capsule were determined using chest computed tomography, and surgical intervention was planned. An en bloc capsulectomy was performed after confirming the internal capsule. Simultaneously, a quilting suture, bolster suture, and fibrin sealant were applied to prevent recurrence. The mean age of the patients with refractory seroma was 45.4 (± 7.3) years, and their mean body mass index was 31.0 (± 6.2) kg/m 2. All patients underwent breast reconstruction with an extended LD flap or extended LD flap with a silicone implant after total mastectomy. During the follow-up period of ≥ 10.4 months, a mean of 34.4 (± 10.4) needle aspiration procedures were performed, and a mean of 12.8 (± 2.2) cc of seroma fluid was removed each time. Intraoperatively, the formation of a capsule with a well-defined border was confirmed; all patients showed complete resolution of donor-site seroma within 4 weeks after surgical intervention. Refractory donor-site seroma occurrence was rare in the cases assessed. Surgical intervention was successful in cases of refractory donor-site seroma unsuccessfully treated with conservative therapy and is thus one of the most effective methods for complete resolution of refractory seroma.

### Fibrin glue as a non-invasive outpatient treatment for post-arthroscopic knee seromas [^d0308123]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Post-surgical seromas and cysts have been reported across many surgical subspecialties including orthopaedics. Treatments include both invasive surgical approaches and more recently reported non-invasive techniques. Non-invasive approaches currently include compressive wrapping, vasopneumatic cryotherapy, and motion exercises. Persistent lesions have been treated with talc or doxycycline sclerodesis. This case presents a patient with a post-arthroscopic seroma that was treated with fibrin glue in an outpatient setting. Fibrin glue has not been reported in the post-arthroscopy outpatient setting to address cystic lesions. This case suggests a viable non-invasive treatment option for these lesions. Level of evidence V.

### Seromadesis following total hip resurfacing by aspiration and injection of doxycycline [^d60828ba]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

A seroma is a pocket of clear serous fluid that forms within the body after surgery. The fluid is composed of blood plasma and may form following disruption of lymphatic channels and the exudative inflammatory fluid produced from damage to bodily tissue during surgery. A surgically or traumatically created dead space leads to the accumulation of lymphatic, inflammatory and exudative fluids that prevent tissue adhesion. Seromas remain a trepid and difficult surgical complication. Different treatment options including external compression, percutaneous aspiration and additional surgical intervention which have all been used with variable success. Accessing the sterile fluid within the cavity percutaneously increases the risk for seeding bacteria into the seroma leading to an infected collection. The use of sclerotherapy in the management of seromas has been reported in small-scale studies and case reports, and has shown strong success with minimal complications. Any improvement in our ability to treat this challenging complication is of great importance.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^379be5b9]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple methods have been adopted to reduce the incidence of seroma after an abdominoplasty. These methods include multiple dissection techniques (ie, electrocautery dissection, scalpel dissection, and plasma-kinetic energy-based dissection), lipoabdominoplasty procedures, Scarpa's fascia preservation, quilting sutures or progressive tension sutures (PTS), closed-suction drains, adhesives or fibrin glue, postoperative immobilization, and compression garments. A recent study by Seretis et al showed that performing abdominoplasty with Scarpa's fascia preservation, tissue adhesives and, possibly, PTS could independently reduce seroma rates. Scarpa's fascia preservation is believed to be effective because it spares the lymphatics that are located near the fascial planes rather than in the adipose tissue itself. The importance of avoiding the lymphatics of the femoral triangle during a lower body lift to minimize complications has been previously highlighted by Lockwood, and Le Louarn has also previously demonstrated the effectiveness of sparing the fascia of Scarpa in reducing seroma incidence rates following an abdominoplasty procedure.

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of Scarpa's fascia preservation on seroma incidence and total drain output after an abdominoplasty in randomized and prospective or retrospective controlled trials.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^982528af]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Seroma management after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair — postoperative seroma is common and should be anticipated; asymptomatic seromas should be observed; persistent symptomatic seromas may be aspirated under sterile conditions with a low risk of complications; and recurrent symptomatic seromas after aspiration should be treated with surgical drainage and excision of the seroma lining if possible (Low quality, Strong recommendation). Cauterization of the hernia sac, the use of pressure dressings (such as abdominal binders), or suture closure of the hernia defect may be utilized to reduce the incidence of postoperative seroma (Low quality, Weak recommendation). Seroma formation following laparoscopic hernia repair should be considered an expected outcome, rather than a complication, and clinically detectable seromas in the early postoperative period have been reported to occur in about 35% of patients. In prospective studies, the incidence of early postoperative seroma detected utilizing ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan ranged from 95–100% in the early postoperative period, while the rate of seroma persisting beyond 90 days decreased to 0–20%, and seroma formation not resolving spontaneously occurred in 3–4% of patients. Aspiration of seroma fluid has been shown to reduce patient symptoms although recurrence following aspiration is common, and spontaneous seroma resolution may be anticipated in the majority of cases with persistent seromas drained percutaneously or surgically with success.

### Seroma reduction and drain free mastectomy… [^04470c9d]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Seroma Reduction and Drain Free Mastectomy ClinicalTrials. gov ID
- Seroma aspiration of clinically significant seroma Proportion of patients undergoing seroma aspiration of clinically significant seroma Clinically significant seroma defined as:

- Wound healing is at risk due to seroma
- There is discomfort or pain caused by large amounts of seroma, characterised by tenseness of the skin.
- There is contaminated/ infected seroma and aspiration is necessary to treat infection. All patients that undergo seroma aspiration due to infection will also be treated with a one week course of Augmentin 625 mg 3 times daily. Promising results have resulted from studies focusing on flap fixation in order to reduce the incidence of seroma and seroma aspirations. Mastectomy with flap fixation is becoming standard practice and is currently combined with closed-suction drainage.

Closed-suction drainage is considered gold standard for reducing seroma formation after breast cancer surgery. However, evidence shows that closed-suction drainage is insufficient in preventing seroma formation. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted comparing flap fixation with and without closed-suction drainage with seroma aspiration as the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that flap fixation with closed suction drainage does not cause a significant lower incidence of seroma aspirations, when compared to flap fixation alone. The investigators also expect that patients without drainage will experience significantly less discomfort and comparable rates of surgical site infections.

Objective: To prove that omitting drains after mastectomy and flap fixation does not contribute to higher incidence of seroma formation and therefore reducing patient disutility such as seroma aspirations and visits to the outpatient clinic, as well as reducing seroma related wound complications. Study design: Prospective randomized controlled trial Study population: Female patients > 18 years diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or DCIS with an indication to perform mastectomy. Intervention:

- Mastectomy with flap fixation using sutures with closed suction drainage
- Mastectomy with flap fixation using sutures without closed suction drainage Main study parameters/endpoints: Patients undergoing seroma aspiration). Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

### ACR appropriateness criteria on percutaneous catheter drainage of infected fluid collections [^0c4efbaa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Abnormal fluid collections occur throughout the body and represent a wide range of pathologies, including abscesses, pseudocysts, cysts, lymphoceles, seromas, bilomas, hematomas, urinomas, and infected neoplasms. Appropriate management often depends on clinical presentation, location, type of collection, early response to treatment, and the presence of complicating factors such as fistulas, septations, and increased viscosity. Physicians should carefully review clinical and imaging findings and make evidence-based recommendations for the best treatment, which may include antibiotics, needle aspiration, percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, or surgical drainage. This paper addresses percutaneous catheter drainage and alternative treatment options for the management of fluid collections and is the result of evidence-based consensus by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

### Preventing seroma in the latissimus dorsi flap donor site with fibrin sealant [^ca046850]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Donor site seroma continues to be the most common complication of latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction. Numerous preventive methods and treatments have been described. The use of fibrin sealant in the donor site before closure may be an effective means of seroma prevention. The authors evaluated the efficacy of fibrin sealant in conjunction with closed suction drainage in a series of 17 latissimus flap donor sites. They also determined their approximate institutional seroma rate with a retrospective chart review of 20 donor sites. The fibrin sealant patients had a seroma rate of 11.8% compared with a rate of 35% among the untreated patients (P = 0.047). This compares favorably with seroma rates as high as 79% described in the literature. In conclusion, the use of fibrin sealant in the latissimus flap donor site appears to be effective in preventing seroma.

### Effects of fibrin sealant on seroma reduction for patients with breast cancer undergoing axillary dissection: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6d57ecad]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Seroma formation is common in patients with breast cancer after axillary dissection. Fibrin sealant, containing fibrinogen and thrombin, has been developed to improve wound healing. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of fibrin sealants in reducing seroma among patients with breast cancer undergoing axillary dissection.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to April 2020. Pooled estimates of the outcomes were computed using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were incidence and volume of seroma, while the secondary outcomes were volume and duration of drainage, incidence of infection, and length of hospital stay.

Results

We reviewed 23 RCTs that included 1640 patients. Compared with the control group, the fibrin sealant group had no significant differences in the incidence of seroma, length of hospital stay, or incidence of surgical site infection. Significant intergroup differences were discovered in lower volume of seroma (weighted mean difference [WMD]-71.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]-135.58 to-8.19), volume of drainage (WMD-73.24, 95% CI-107.32 to-39.15), and duration of drainage (WMD-0.84, 95% CI-1.50 to-0.19).

Conclusions

Fibrin sealants provide limited benefits in reducing the volume of seroma and the volume and duration of drainage. Therefore, after shared decision making, surgeons may apply fibrin sealants to patients with breast cancer undergoing axillary dissection.

### Improved perioperative seroma and complication rates following the application of a 2-layer negative pressure wound therapy system after inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic cutaneous melanoma [^0f6aa07c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

It is generally acknowledged that inguinal lymphadenectomy is a standard procedure in the surgical oncology armamentarium that has a disproportionately high complication rate. Whilst the complications are generally non-life threatening and localised to the site of operation, they are often protracted and have a substantial impact on the patients' quality of life. One of the most common postoperative complications in the perioperative period is seroma. There have been multiple studies that have investigated interventions designed to either reduce the incidence or reduce the extent of the problem once it has become established.–A recent systematic review by the Cochrane Groupidentified a lack of any useful data and concluded that, "… there is a need for high quality RCTs to guide clinical practice in this under-researched area." Unfortunately, there have been no studies to date that have demonstrated a reliable method to reduce the incidence of seroma.

### Is breast seroma after tumour resection associated with patient-reported breast appearance change following radiotherapy? Results from the IMPORT HIGH (CRUK / 06 / 003) trial [^c4ecd95c]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seroma formation describes the collection of serous fluid within a cavity and has been reported following breast surgery. Seroma prevalence of 37% and 57% was reported in the Cambridge IMRTand FASTtrials respectively. Seroma has been associated with increased rates of post-operative infection and haematoma, and is an independent risk factor for normal tissue effects (NTE) following radiotherapy.

An association between seroma and NTE has been reported in the RAPIDand Cambridge IMRT trials. The mechanisms by which seroma may lead to NTE following radiotherapy are unknown. As well as fibrosis and retraction of the seroma cavity being possible contributing factors, seroma leading to larger volumes receiving radiotherapy boost doses should also be considered. In the EORTC 'boost versus no boost' trial there was an increased risk of fibrosis in those patients receiving a boostand this risk was further increased in patients with a seroma. However, this was significant on univariate analysis only.

The majority of these trials used clinician assessments of NTE and/or serial photographs. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide an opportunity to understand the patients' own perception of NTE and studies have found that patients report more NTE compared with clinicians and those detected on photographs. However, the association between the presence of seroma and patient-reported NTE following breast radiotherapy has not been investigated to date.

This analysis from IMPORT HIGH uniquely combines comprehensive PROMs' data with presence/absence of seroma whilst accounting for other patient, tumour and treatment factors. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether seroma is associated with patient-reported breast appearance change following breast radiotherapy. The secondary aim was to investigate associations between other patient/tumour/treatment factors and patient-reported breast appearance change.

### Seroma development following body contouring surgery for massive weight loss: patient risk factors and treatment strategies [^eecc8c3c]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The most common complications following body contouring surgery for massive weight loss include delayed wound healing and seroma. The authors investigated risk factors for seroma in this patient population and describe treatment strategies.

Methods

A retrospective review of 222 patients who underwent body contouring surgery for massive weight loss from March of 1997 to December of 2005 was performed. Risk factors assessed included age, sex, medical conditions, tobacco use, body mass index, weight of skin excised, and surgery performed.

Results

Within this group, there were 187 women and 35 men, with a mean age of 42 years. Weight loss was achieved by open (n = 167) or laparoscopic (n = 35) gastric bypass surgery, or diet (n = 20). Average body mass index at contouring was 33, ranging from 20 to 69. Surgical areas addressed alone or in combination included the abdomen (n = 205), thigh (n = 71), arm (n = 69), back (n = 59), and chest (n = 57). Average weight of skin excised at surgery was 9.6 lb, ranging up to 49 lb. Seroma occurred in 31 patients, placing the risk at 14 percent in this series. Seroma risk in abdominal panniculectomy was 12 percent; in circumferential belt lipectomy, the risk was 18 percent; and in thigh lift, the risk was 4 percent. On multivariate statistical analysis, the major risk factor for seroma formation was weight of skin excised, with seroma risk increasing 9 percent for each additional pound of skin excised.

Conclusions

The most important risk factor for seroma is weight of skin excised at the time of surgery. Treatment strategies include aspiration, drain placement, sclerosis, and surgery.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^77faa828]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that nonsurgical strategies, such as postoperative garments (eg, abdominal binders) and physical activity restrictions, may also play a role in reducing the risk of seroma formation following an abdominoplasty procedure. However, the related impact of these nonsurgical strategies, compared with surgical strategies such as Scarpa's fascia preservation or PTS, could not be determined from this review. This is because 6 of the 8 studies included in this review mentioned employing postoperative garments for 4–6 weeks postoperatively, whereas the other 2 studies did not mention any adoption of garments postoperatively. Although it is not demonstrated by this review, in the personal experience of the senior author (BL), postoperative garments and physical activity restrictions can also help to lower the risk of seroma formation. It would be interesting to investigate the relative impact of these nonsurgical strategies on seroma formation after an abdominoplasty procedure in future research.

Finally, it is worth noting that in 1 of the studies in this review the clinical outcomes of Scarpa's fascia preservation during an abdominoplasty in patients with an average BMI of 36.6 were investigated. This is in contrast to the other included studies, which had patients who had an average BMI below 30. It was found that both the total drain output and the time to drain removal were notably increased in the high BMI patients when compared with the other studies. However, it should be noted that this particular study also included the correction of abdominal herniations with mesh, in contrast to the other studies included in this review. Therefore, it is difficult to determine with certainty the actual impact of a higher BMI on seroma formation from this study.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^8be3f032]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair — seroma prevention and management indicate that aspiration of a postoperative seroma carries a potential risk of bacterial inoculation, yet retrospective studies have demonstrated the safety of seroma aspiration, and conservative seroma management is not associated with an increased risk of infectious complications. Chronic seromas that fail to respond to aspiration and/or drainage have been reported to be successfully treated with either mesh excision or laparoscopic excision of the mesothelial layer surrounding the seroma. Preventive approaches include cauterization of the hernia sac, with a prospective study of 51 patients demonstrating a reduction in seroma formation, and the use of abdominal pressure dressings and abdominal binders, for which retrospective studies have demonstrated a reduction in postoperative seroma formation. Laparoscopic defect closure at the time of repair has been performed to help restore contour, reduce abdominal bulging, and reduce seroma formation, with reports noting a low or absent incidence of clinically significant seromas; in a retrospective comparison of repair without versus with defect closure, the incidence of seroma formation beyond 8 weeks was decreased, and a larger series of 176 hernia repairs showed a reduction from 28% to 6% when the hernia defect was closed percutaneously.

### Wound drainage after axillary dissection for carcinoma of the breast [^d85db6a5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Axillary dissection is commonly performed for breast carcinoma. It is uncertain whether insertion of a drain reduces complication rates.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wound drainage after axillary dissection for breast carcinoma on the incidence of postoperative seroma formation. Secondary outcome measures include the incidence of infection and length of hospital stay.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Wound and Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Registers (22 February 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to 22 February 2013), EMBASE (1966 to 22 February 2013), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (22 February 2013) for all prospectively registered and ongoing trials (22 February 2013). Reference lists of included studies were handsearched by two independent review authors to look for additional eligible trials.

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound drainage versus no wound drainage in individuals after axillary dissection for the treatment of breast carcinoma were included. All disease stages were considered. Breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy were considered. Patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy without axillary dissection were not included. No limits were applied to language or study location. Two review authors independently determined the eligibility of each study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data for each included study using a predesigned data extraction proforma and assessed risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion with a third review author. Dichotomous variables were analysed using a Mantel-Haenszel model to produce odds ratios (ORs). Continuous variables were analysed using an inverse variance model to produce a mean difference (MD).

Main Results

Seven RCTs including 960 participants were identified. The quality of trials was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment. There was a high level of statistical variation between the studies, which therefore reduces the reliability of the evidence. The OR for seroma formation was 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.91, P = 0.03) in favour of a reduced incidence of seroma in participants with drains inserted. There was no significant difference in infection rates between drainage and no drainage groups (OR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.12, P = 0.14). The mean difference in length of hospital stay, reported in four trials consisting of 600 participants, was 1.47 days greater in the drained population (95% CI 0.67 to 2.28, P = 0.0003). A mean difference of 0.79 fewer postoperative seroma aspirations was found in the drained population (95% CI 1.23 to 0.35 fewer, P = 0.0004) in two trials including 212 participants. No significant difference in volume of seroma aspirations was reported (MD -19.44, 95% CI -59.45 to 20.57, P = 0.34) in three trials including 519 participants. No significant difference in the incidence of lymphoedema was noted (OR 2.31 favouring no drainage, 95% CI 0.47 to 11.37, P = 0.30), with only six instances reported in three trials of 360 participants, nor was any significant difference in the incidence of haematoma observed (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.33 to 8.51, P = 0.53), with only five instances reported in two trials of 314 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited quality evidence that insertion of a drain following axillary lymphadenectomy reduced the odds of developing a seroma and reduced the number of post-operative seroma aspirations. These benefits should be balanced against an increased length of hospital stay in the drained population.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society [IEHS])-part 2 [^bac79068]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

If an interventional conservative attempt at treating a mesh infection after laparoscopic IPOM proves unsuccessful or if from the outset the circumstances no longer allow preservation of the mesh, various options can be used for mesh infections after mesh repair of incisional and ventral hernias [58–61], including
Mesh removal and primary skin closure, with the repair repeated after 6–9 months.
Mesh removal using the component separation technique, with the skin left open and vacuum-assisted wound closure or open-wound dressing applied.
Mesh removal, repair of the defect with a biologic mesh, leaving the skin open and applying vacuum-assisted wound closure or open-wound dressing.
Mesh salvage, with the skin left open, and vacuum-assisted wound closure or open-wound dressing applied.

Because the treatment options available in the literature relate only to individual cases or to small case series, currently, no concrete evidence-based recommendation can be made for the optimal management that gives the best results. Instead, the surgeon must decide in the individual case which option is best for the individual patient. There is an absolute need for further studies.

### "No drain, No gain": simultaneous seroma drainage and tissue expansion in pre-pectoral tissue expander-based breast reconstruction [^8eace09d]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Seromas represent the most frequent complication following immediate breast reconstruction surgery, in particular when acellular dermal matrix or synthetic meshes are used to add coverage to implants. Little information regarding breast seroma management is available in the literature. When seroma becomes clinically significant, current methods for its management consist of repeated needle aspiration. We report a fast, efficient, easy and riskless technique to perform serum aspiration in patients who underwent breast reconstruction with a tissue expander that allows simultaneous drainage and expansion of the implant at once. This procedure is safe, painless, does not need special supplies or additional costs and can be easily performed in ambulatory setting to manage breast seromas.

### Is breast seroma after tumour resection associated with patient-reported breast appearance change following radiotherapy? Results from the IMPORT HIGH (CRUK / 06 / 003) trial [^8f6eebfc]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy was also considered a potential confounder in IMPORT HIGH. However, in our study, adjusting for adjuvant chemotherapy use made little difference to the estimate of association between seroma and breast appearance change. Nevertheless, seromas persisting after chemotherapy may be more stable during radiotherapy such that dosimetric heterogeneities within the tumour bed region incurred by fluctuating seroma volume will be minimised. In addition, seromas persisting following chemotherapy may maintain volume within the tumour bed such that any distortion associated with their resolution may be less likely.

Surgical practices have changed since the FAST and Cambridge IMRT trials were conducted, from leaving the excision cavity open (which may be associated with seroma formation) towards primary closure of the defect by either direct suturing of cavity walls together, local glandular mobilisation or therapeutic mammoplasty. In patients who develop a seroma in an open cavity, fibrosis and retraction of tissue surrounding the excision cavity (following seroma reabsorption) could result in a noticeable defect. In contrast, there is also evidence to suggest that the seroma cavity may not always contract and new tissue may be laid down in concentric rings. With increasing use of oncoplastic surgery to redistribute breast tissue into locations of volume loss particularly in those requiring extensive resections, rates of seroma are likely to have reduced. One study reported significantly lower rates of seroma in patients undergoing oncoplastic surgery compared with standard breast conserving surgery: 1.7% versus 4.4%, p = 0.04, albeit that seromas were diagnosed clinically in this study and thus rates were lower than described in the radiotherapy literature.

It is possible that our study was underpowered to detect a moderate effect of seroma; with around 200 cases and controls the study had 78% power to detect an odds ratio of 2, based on 16% seroma prevalence in our control population (alpha = 0.05). Although there was no significant association between seroma and breast appearance change, greater seroma volume was associated with breast appearance change on univariate analysis. For the analysis, seroma volume was set to zero for patients without seroma. Limited patient numbers with seroma may have contributed to the lack of significance on multivariable analysis, or it may be that the association between seroma and NTE is weaker than previously reported. The RAPID trial testing partial-breast radiotherapy using 3D conformal radiotherapy versus whole-breast radiotherapy reported an association between seroma volume and adverse cosmesis at 3-years.

### Technique for seroma drainage in implant-based breast reconstruction [^42aa0457]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Seromas are a common complication associated with breast reconstructive surgery. In expander based breast reconstructions, a seroma can pose a particularly difficult problem related to final tissue envelope shape as well as an increase in the risk of infection and possible tissue necrosis. Unfortunately, the literature describes few non-image related techniques to drain a seroma with a breast implant in place. We present a technique to drain a seroma associated with expander based breast reconstruction in conjunction with expander inflation, minimizing the risk of expander puncture, utilizing the same equipment necessary for expander inflation in the office. The benefit to this technique is that diagnostic and therapeutic imaging is not necessary and the risk of expander damage is minimized.

### Ultrasound-guided scraping of fibrous capsule plus bilayered negative pressure wound therapy for treatment of refractory postmastectomy seroma [^4e1c331c]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Seroma is a frequent complication of breast cancer surgery. Treatment of prolonged or refractory seroma remains a clinical challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel approach for refractory seroma treatment; the method combines minimally invasive scraping for fibrous capsule removal and self-designed bilayered negative pressure wound therapy (b-NPWT) to achieve favorable wound healing.

Methods

Twenty-four patients with refractory seroma received ultrasound-guided scraping of fibrous capsule around the refractory seroma, and then a bilayered NPWT system simultaneously allowing for fluid drainage and dynamic topical pressure was manually implemented immediately. The time of NPWT application and wound healing was recorded, and pathological examination was conducted for the removed fibrous tissues.

Results

Removal of the fibrous capsule was securely achieved by minimally invasive scraping through a 1.5-cm incision guided with ultrasound scanning. All refractory seromas in the 24 patients healed uneventfully after an average application of NPWT for 7.2 ± 3.3 days without recurrence during the 3–12 months of follow-up. Biopsy of the removed fibrous tissue demonstrated that single-layered endothelial cells stained with CD31, D2-40, and Ki-67 existed both on the surface of and inside the fibrous tissue.

Conclusions

The combination of fibrous capsule removal by ultrasound-guided scraping with successive bilayered NPWT therapy is effective and minimally invasive for promoting wound healing of refractory postmastectomy seroma.

### Seromadesis following total hip resurfacing by aspiration and injection of doxycycline [^45f02593]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

A seroma is a pocket of clear serous fluid that forms within the body after surgery. A surgically or traumatically created dead space leads to the accumulation of lymph, inflammatory and exudative fluid which prevents tissue adhesion. The fluid is composed of blood plasma from leaky vessels, disrupted lymphatic channels and the exudative inflammatory fluid produced from damaged cells. Seromas remain a trepid and difficult surgical complication. Different treatment options include external compression, percutaneous aspiration and additional surgical interventions with varied success. In this case, there may have been an additional inflammatory exudate due to fine element wear debris produced from the metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implant. This may have been exacerbated by an early, rapid progression to intense physical activity during the postoperative period. Seromas remain a trepid and difficult surgical complication. Current treatment options include compression, percutaneous aspiration and possible additional surgical interventions. Accessing the sterile fluid within the cavity poses a risk for contaminating the seroma with commensal organisms resulting in infection. The use of sclerotherapy in the management of seromas has been reported in small scale studies and case reports, and has shown strong success with minimal complications. In this case, the initial aspiration and washout of the early postoperative haematoma collection did not succeed in preventing the seroma formation. Furthermore, the open washout and repeat aspiration, though negative for organisms on tissue culture, led to the formation of a small sinus and an infected seroma. This ultimately required two-stage revision surgery given the likely communication with the hip resurfacing implant. Despite excision of the pseudo-capsule that had formed during the second stage revision total hip replacement, the seroma recollected.

### Prevention of seroma after abdominoplasty [^09e93646]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Seroma is one of the most troubling complications after abdominoplasty; incidence rates of up to 25% have been reported. If it is correct that shearing forces between the two separated abdominal layers play a key role in the development of seroma, postoperative immobilization of the patient until the layers are sufficiently adhered may be a solution to the problem.

Objective

The authors examine the association between length of immobilization and the development of seroma.

Methods

This retrospective study included 60 patients; half were immobilized for 24 hours (group 1) and the other half were immobilized for at least 48 hours (group 2). For thromboembolism prophylaxis, all patients received low molecular weight heparin and compression stockings. Postoperative follow-up for detection of seroma continued for at least three months.

Results

Mobilization after 24 hours led to a seroma rate of 13%, whereas immobilization of at least 48 hours decreased the seroma rate to 0%.

Conclusions

For abdominoplasty patients with a low or moderate thromboembolic risk, the data suggest that immobilization for at least 48 hours with chemical and mechanical thromboembolism prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of seroma.

### Treatment of refractory donor-site seromas with percutaneous instillation of fibrin sealant [^b561db47]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Seromas at the flap donor site can occur following reconstructive surgery, and chronic seromas are particularly difficult to treat. Intraoperative use of fibrin sealant has been shown to enhance adherence of tissue surfaces and reduce postoperative fluid drainage. It was hypothesized that percutaneous instillation of fibrin sealant is effective for the postoperative treatment of refractory donor-site seromas.

Methods

Four patients over a 3-year period developed refractory donor-site seromas that were treated with instillation of fibrin sealant. The thrombin concentration was diluted to 5 IU/ml to increase polymerization time. The seromas were completely aspirated, and 20 mL of fibrin sealant was instilled through a dual-lumen catheter. Seroma recurrence was evaluated by serial physical examinations. Results were compared with those of control patients (n = 26) with seromas that persisted at least 6 weeks postoperatively despite conservative therapy including serial aspirations and/or drain reinsertion.

Results

All study patients failed conservative therapy before fibrin sealant instillation, which was performed a mean of 6.1 weeks postoperatively. All four patients had immediate and complete resolution of their refractory seromas following a single fibrin sealant instillation. There were no complications or recurrences during the mean follow-up time of 73.8 weeks. The success rate for seroma resolution (100 percent) was significantly greater with fibrin sealant injection in study patients than with serial aspiration alone (23 percent) in control patients (p = 0.0077).

Conclusions

Percutaneous instillation of fibrin sealant may be an effective treatment for refractory donor-site seromas. Ongoing clinical experience and prospective controlled trials will be needed to define its role in seroma treatment.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^5500ac0a]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Abdominoplasty is a widely utilized cosmetic surgery procedure. Despite its popularity, seroma formation remains a prevalent complication. Seroma can lead to extended recovery time, increased medical appointments, and the potential for infection or the need for additional surgical revision. Preserving Scarpa's fascia may mitigate the risk of seroma in patients following abdominoplasty. The goal of this systematic review was to determine the impact of preserving Scarpa's fascia on the occurrence of seroma and total drain output following an abdominoplasty procedure. This review searched academic literature in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (OvidSP), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for clinical and observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals, from March 2022 to November 2022, that evaluated the impact of preserving Scarpa's fascia on postoperative seroma and total drain output during abdominoplasty. The primary outcomes of interest were seroma and total drain output, with secondary outcomes of interest including hematoma, time to drain removal, length of hospital stay, wound dehiscence, and infection rate. The systematic review of 8 studies, involving 846 patients, found that the preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure was associated with decreased seroma occurrence, reduced drain output, faster drain removal, and fewer infections. However, it did not affect the incidence of hematoma, hospital stay duration, or wound dehiscence. The preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure should be considered as a routine practice, because it has been shown to result in reduced seroma incidence rates and faster drain removal.

### Progressive tension sutures in the prevention of postabdominoplasty seroma: a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^4cf8b0ae]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the seroma reduction capabilities of progressive tension sutures and compare them with the conventional use of drains.

Methods

Sixty female patients were randomized into four groups: group 1 (control, no drains, and no progressive tension sutures), group 2 (progressive tension sutures alone), group 3 (drains alone), and group 4 (progressive tension sutures and drains). All patients underwent a classic abdominoplasty and drains were left for 7 days in the corresponding groups. Clinical and ultrasound assessments were performed 2 weeks after the operation by blinded evaluators. Punctures, volumes, nonseroma complications, and aesthetic outcome were also measured.

Results

Surgical time was 50 minutes longer in groups 2 and 4. Drain outputs were higher in group 3 than in group 4. The clinical and ultrasound seroma frequency was 35 percent and 90 percent respectively, without significant differences among the groups. The control group was interrupted at 10 patients because of considerably larger seromas and an increased amount of punctures needed for treatment. No differences were found in the other groups. There were no differences with respect to complication rates and aesthetic outcome after follow-up.

Conclusions

Progressive tension sutures increase surgical time, reduce drain outputs, and have the same clinical and ultrasound seroma frequency as the use of drains alone. The combination of both methods simultaneously does not add any advantages. However, complications and interventions increase if at least one of them is not used. The mechanism of action of progressive tension sutures could be the compartmentalization of the fluid collection under the flap facilitating absorption.

### Seroma after breast reconstruction with tissue expanders: outcomes and management [^6f5ed02f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Seroma is a relatively common complication after breast reconstruction with tissue expanders. The main risk in the presence of seroma is development of periprosthetic infection, which can lead to implant loss. Our goals were to identify risk factors for seroma, and to describe our protocol for managing fluid accumulation.

Patients and Methods

An IRB approved breast reconstruction database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent tissue expander reconstruction. Patient characteristics, details of surgery, outcomes and treatment were recorded.

Results

Two hundred nineteen tissue expander reconstructions were performed in 138 patients. Twenty-eight reconstructions developed seroma (12.8%), and 75 were identified to have prolonged drains (34.2%). Seroma was more common in patients with lymph node surgery (P = 0.043), delayed reconstruction (P = 0.049), and prepectoral reconstruction (P = 0.002). Seroma and/or prolonged drains were more commonly noted in patients with higher body mass index (P = 0.044) and larger breast size (P = 0.001). Aspiration was the most common intervention (85.7%), which was performed in the clinic utilizing the expander port site. There was no difference in infection or explantation rate between seroma and no-seroma patients (P = 0.546 and 0.167), whereas patients with any fluid concern (seroma and/or prolonged drains) were more prone to developing infection and undergoing explantation (P = 0.041 and P < 0.005).

Conclusion

We recommend that prolonged drain placement longer than 3 weeks should be avoided, and patients should be screened for fluid accumulation after drain removal. Serial aspiration via expander port site and continuation of expansion provide a safe and effective method to manage seromas to avoid infection and expander loss.

### Seroma following endoscopic extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty [^ee2b20ed]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Because it mimics a postoperative recurrence of hernia, seroma has been a concern to patients. There has been no consensus on the management of this condition after endoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty (TEP). The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the incidence and treatment of seroma after TEP. Risk factors for the development of seroma were also examined.

Methods

A total of 450 consecutive patients who underwent TEP between June 1999 and May 2002 were recruited. All data were collected prospectively. The outcomes of patients who developed seromas were compared to those without this postoperative complication. Regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for seroma formation.

Results

The overall incidence of seroma formation was 7.2% (n = 40). The postoperative recovery of patients was not influenced by the development of seroma. The mean size of the seromas was 3.8 cm. Adopted treatment strategies included observation (n = 29), oral lysozyme (n = 10), and percutaneous aspiration (n = 3), but neither of the two interventions appeared to be effective. The seromas resolved spontaneously by an average of 2.4 (mean) months. Significant clinical factors associated with seroma formation included old age, large hernial defects, an extension of the hernia into the scrotum, and the presence of a residual distal indirect sac. By logistic regression, a large hernial defect and an extension of the hernia into the scrotum were found to be independent risk factors for seroma formation.

Conclusions

Although seroma is a frequent minor morbidity after TEP, it has no impact on postoperative recovery. Because all seromas invariably resolve, expectant treatment with observation is recommended. Inguinoscrotal hernia carries a four-fold increased risk of developing seroma after TEP.

### Risk factors for surgical complications in ventral hernia repair [^8e4d75e6]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

To assess the most appropriate treatment principle, knowledge of the natural course of ventral hernia is important. A small incisional hernia occurring early post-laparotomy should be repaired while it is still small. These hernias almost always expand over time and extend to the entire incision leading to substantial comorbidity. Current analysis states the importance of timing and suggests that prompt intervention in some cases is beneficial. Watchful waiting studies have sometimes prioritised analysing risk of acute intervention, thus neglected the risk of a more complex repair at the time of intervention.

There are reports in the literature indicating concomitant bowel surgery to be a risk factor for surgical complication. In the present study, concomitant bowel surgery manifested as a risk factor in the univariate but not in the multivariate analysis.

When performing concomitant bowel surgery, it is of utmost importance that the surgical team is experienced and well prepared. A meticulous adherence to hygienical principles: changing of gloves and instruments as well as re-sterilising the abdominal skin before inserting the mesh and use of modern large pore biomaterials of polypropylene or PVDF are principles routinely exerted by the authors. When assessing risk for adverse event in the individual case, it is necessary to take into account that concomitant surgical procedures might increase the risk for complication. However, performing the two procedures on different occasions can also increase post-operative morbidity since there will be two episodes of general anaesthesia and two post-operative courses. The reason for choosing an onlay procedure was not registered in the database. If an onlay repair is considered the most appropriate method for a specific patient, then maybe seroma should not be regarded as a complication, but rather an expected consequence of surgery.

### Clinical and cost outcomes of a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated patch versus drainage after axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer: results from a multicentre randomized clinical trial [^ca6b746c]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In the multivariable analysis, previous axillary surgery was associated with a greater need for an ED visit (P = 0.0122), and the use of a PEG-coated patch was associated with a lower probability of an ED visit (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the patch group exhibited a greater incidence of seroma in the multivariable analysis (P < 0.001).

Obese patients are at increased risk of postoperative complications. Additionally, increased body weight, and BMI, have both been associated with increased seroma formation. In the current study, obesity was, however, not significantly associated with either the incidence of seroma or the need for an ED visit.

Public health services must cope with an unlimited demand for limited resources. Therefore, it is extremely important to identify cost-effective treatments. In the current study, although the incidence of seroma was greater in the patch group, their postoperative management appeared to be smoother. Cost and cost-effectiveness analyses support this assumption, as a PEG-coated patch resulted in a total mean cost savings of €100.41 per patient. Additionally, the use of drainage was associated with an ICER of €491.7, €7594.4, and €542.5 for no need for an ED visit, no need for hospital admission, and for achieving treatment success respectively.

### Abdominal etching – A novel classification method for surgical approach [^93fe4f9f]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found that high-definition liposuction and abdominal etching done according to the novel classification system, as described in 62 consecutive patients, were shown to be safe and effective. Satisfaction with results of the technique was high both among patients and the surgeon. The most common complication was seroma in the liposuctioned areas; yet, all resolved with conservative treatment. It is imperative to explain to patients that seroma formation can be expected and that it will resolve in most cases either following a single aspiration or with watchful waiting. Danilla et. al also reviewed complications of high-definition liposuction and treatment options. In their study, about 30% of cases had seroma formation and all responded to percutaneous aspiration. The high rates of seroma in high-definition liposuction and body contouring can be secondary to aggressive liposuction and damage to superficial lymphatic tissues. The use of energy-based liposuction can also increase production of seroma and has been related to skin hyperpigmentation. Several authors addressed the buildup of seroma following liposuction with various adjunct modalities suggested to reduce the formation of seroma, including the use of drains and pressure garments.

Our technique uses power-assisted liposuction and has not encountered any instance of skin hyperpigmentation. We do not place drains and abdominal binders are fitted in all cases. When considering seroma formation in our patient cohort, the majority of cases resolved spontaneously and those that required percutaneous aspiration did not have any further complications following the intervention. Skin necrosis is a dreaded complication and can be caused by aggressive superficial liposuctioning or the use of energy-based modalities. Meticulous technique can prevent this complication. In the one case described in our study, the skin necrosis was on a minor surface area, was treated conservatively, and healed well.

Thirty percent of patients returned to request a second liposuction to further enhance the results already achieved. It must be stated that these were small "touch-ups" and enhancements that included minor liposuction and grafting revisions. We believe that it is imperative to consult this subset of patients more meticulously regarding the expected result and their expectations early in the process, to decrease the number of secondary procedures.

### Symptomatic axillary seroma after sentinel lymph node biopsy: incidence and treatment [^d44d9fb7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative seroma is a nuisance for patients and surgeons. Few studies investigate predisposing factors for axillary seroma after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We sought to quantitate the risk of symptomatic seroma and characterize interventions.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 667 women undergoing breast-conserving surgery and SLNB at our institution between July 2007 and January 2015. Surgeons dissected sharply or with standard electrocautery. We correlated patient and tumor characteristics with symptomatic seroma using logistic regression models for univariate and multivariate predictors. All statistical tests were two sided, with p < 0.05 considered significant.

Results

Overall, 127 (19%) of 667 women had axillary seromas and 98 (77%) of 127 required further intervention for symptom relief. Seroma patients were similar in age, BMI, race, tumor type, T and N stage, and number of nodes removed as those without (all p > 0.07). Seroma rates did not vary according to surgeon, nodal mapping technique, or axillary closure technique (p = 0.8789). Multivariate analysis identified diabetes, smoking, and SSI as predictors of symptomatic axillary seroma with odds ratio of 1.97, 1.98, and 37.19 (all p < 0.017), respectively. Among the 98 of 127 patients with seroma, most (81 of 98, 83%) resolved with a mean of 1.3 aspirations. The remainder resolved after axillary drain (13 of 98, 13%) or additional surgery (4 of 98, 4%).

Conclusions

Symptomatic axillary seroma occurs in 14% patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with SLNB and is not influenced by tumor, nodal mapping, or surgeon characteristics. Management infrequently requires more than simple aspiration. Drain placement at initial surgery may be considered in smokers or patients with diabetes.

### Ultrasound-guided drainage of a seroma following tumescent liposuction [^0019fda6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Of the complications that can occur following tumescent liposuction, seroma formation is unusual. It is a common practice for seromas to be aspirated blindly with a needle and syringe. We present a case of seroma formation following liposuction, with a subsequent step-by-step technical description of ultrasound-guided drainage of the seroma. Utilization of ultrasound provides a safe, effective method for aspirating seromas, allowing for accurate visualization and delineation of the seroma margins, proper needle placement, and monitoring of progress. It is a simple and useful tool in postprocedural management of patients undergoing liposuction.

### Efficacy and safety of scarpa fascia preservation during abdominoplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c5f2dd4]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Scarpa fascia preservation might be a promising approach to reduce seroma and other complications after abdominoplasty. However, the results remained controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of scarpa fascia preservation in patients with abdominoplasty.

Methods

PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials assessing the effect of scarpa fascia preservation versus control (without scarpa fascia) during abdominoplasty were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were seroma and hematoma/bleeding. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effect model.

Results

Four studies involving 630 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with the control group, scarpa fascia preservation was associated with a significant reduced seroma (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.06–0.43; P = 0.0004), time until drain removal (std. mean difference = -0.92; 95% CI -1.31 to -0.54; P < 0.00001;), drain output (std. mean difference = -0.92; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.45; P = 0.0001), and hospital stay (std. mean difference = -0.93; 95% CI -1.48 to -0.39; P = 0.0008), but it failed to alter hematoma/bleeding (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.09–2.38; P = 0.36), infection (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.11–1.25; P = 0.11), and suture rupture (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.12–3.73; P = 0.65) in patients with abdominoplasty.

Conclusions

Scarpa fascia preservation was associated with a significant decreased seroma, time until drain removal, drain output, and hospital stay, but could not change hematoma/bleeding, infection and suture rupture following abdominoplasty. Scarpa fascia preservation should be recommended during abdominoplasty.

### Prevention of seroma formation and wound complications using NPWT devices… [^a17eb808]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Study Overview The specific aim of this study is to improve post-operative wound care in the morbidly-obese body-contouring patient population following massive weight loss undergoing either panniculectomy or formal abdominoplasty, those patients undergoing complex abdominal wall reconstruction and breast reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix, as well as patients undergoing regular lipo-abdominoplasty by comparing the effectiveness of standard closed-suction drains versus the immediate application of continuous negative pressure via a NPWT device attached to non-compressible drains. Additionally, we aim to demonstrate increases both in cost-effectiveness and quality of life in these patients with the use of the NPWT wound care apparatus.

Hypothesis 1 Continuous negative pressure devices decrease the incidence of wound complications in comparison with conventional closed suction drains when used in patients after massive weight loss undergoing body-contouring procedures, and in patients undergoing VHR and breast reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix, as well as those undergoing regular lipo-abdominoplasty. Hypothesis 2 Although initially more costly than traditional closed suction drains, the use of continuous negative pressure devices will in the long-term result in lower total health care costs in the above-stated patient population due to a decreased need for additional procedures and/or clinical management, including surgical interventions, hospital admissions, administration of antibiotics, multiple follow-up office visits, and chronic wound care.

Hypothesis 3 Better quality of life is associated with the use of continuous negative pressure devices compared to closed suction drains in these patient populations.
- 30 total patients undergoing ventral hernia repair using acellular dermal matrix
- 30 total patients undergoing bilateral breast reconstruction using acellular dermal matrix with 30 breasts randomized to conventional closed suction and 30 breasts randomized to continuous negative pressure devices. The control subject arm of each procedure group will be outfitted with 2 standard closed suction Jackson-Pratt drains for a period of 4 weeks, both as an inpatient and at home.

The experimental subject arm of each procedure group will be outfitted with 2 non-compressible Blake drains attached to continuous suction via NPWT device for a period of 4 weeks, both as an inpatient and at home.

### Tranexamic acid in body contouring surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9176efae]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The formation of seromas can impede proper wound healing, potentially leading to complications such as tissue necrosis, infection, and delayed initiation of adjuvant therapies. Symptomatic seromas have also been identified as a risk factor for lymphedema development, further elucidating the importance of surgical techniques and postoperative care that minimizes the risk of seroma formation. Our analysis found that the use of TXA does not decrease seroma formation in contrast to prior studies that demonstrated seroma risk reduction with TXA dosing. Electrocautery use for dissection, early removal of drains, low-vacuum drains, dead space obliteration, and early ambulation have been cited as methods to reduce seroma formation after body contouring surgery.

Reported rates of surgical-site infections following breast surgery procedures are generally low, typically ranging between 1.4% and 3.2% according to reviews of data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Database. We found that the administration of TXA was associated with a significantly reduced risk of infection with topical (P = 0.005) administration but not with IV (P = 0.08) TXA administration. Although some previous studies did not observe an effect of TXA on infection rates, this discrepancy is likely attributable to differences in methodologies, sample sizes, and other confounding factors. The etiology of surgical-site infections is often complex and influenced by multiple factors related to the patient, surgical procedure, and microbial environment. TXA may indirectly reduce infection rates through multiple mechanisms.

By minimizing hematoma formation, TXA prevents the development of environments that are conducive to microbial growth. Furthermore, a recent animal study demonstrated that TXA prevented the formation of biofilms, suggesting that the therapy potentially has direct antimicrobial effects.TXA also can reduce drain output and allow for earlier drain removal. Prolonged drain placement is an independent risk factor for surgical-site infections, because it provides an opportunity for retrograde bacterial migration along the drain tract from the external environment into the surgical wound. By facilitating earlier drain removal, TXA may be indirectly reducing the risk of drain-related infections.

In addition to reducing hematoma rates, authors of several studies in our analysis cited a decrease in drain output and time to drain removal. Despite variations in study methodologies and patient populations, the consistent reduction in drain output seen in our study and others underscores the potential clinical benefit of TXA in mitigating complications related to excessive drainage.

### Seromas following pediatric spinal deformity surgery: is operative management necessary? [^9738b0d5]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Seromas are known complications after pediatric spinal deformity surgery. Although many surgeons perform an early debridement to prevent deep surgical site infections (SSIs), a less invasive approach to seroma management has not been studied. We hypothesized that a conservative approach to seroma management would be safe and yield equivalent outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients who developed a postoperative seroma with or without nonpurulent drainage. Inclusion criteria were patients below 21 years who underwent primary posterior spinal fusion from 1996 to 2016 and developed a postoperative wound seroma. Seromas were clinically defined as an afebrile patient with a fluid collection that was soft and nontender to palpation and without induration or erythema. Growing spine surgeries and revision procedures were excluded from this study.

Results

Twenty-five of 790 total patients with a mean follow-up of 57.8 months (± 48.5mo) developed a seroma. Seromas were identified at a mean of 13.6 days postoperatively and resolved after a mean of 12.2 days following the presentation. Seromas occurred in 12 patients with idiopathic scoliosis, 12 with neuromuscular scoliosis, and 1 patient with Scheuermann kyphosis. All cases were managed conservatively with monitoring of the incision without an operative procedure. In cases of spontaneous drainage, a sterile dressing was applied to the wound and changed as needed until drainage ceased. Two patients underwent bedside needle aspiration and 5 patients received prophylactic antibiotics at the treating surgeon's discretion. All cases resolved spontaneously without development of an acute SSI. Three cases subsequently developed a late SSI (range, 18 to 38mo postoperatively). Two had idiopathic scoliosis and 1 had neuromuscular scoliosis. None of these seromas drained spontaneously.

Conclusions

Conservative management of postoperative seromas after pediatric spinal deformity surgery is appropriate. It is unclear if seromas contributed to the development of the 3 late infections. Further studies are needed regarding the relationship of late infections in seroma patients.

### Three-dimensional radiofrequency tissue tightening: a proposed mechanism and applications for body contouring [^ad1913d6]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

About 30% of patients noted minor weight loss but it is premature to correlate it with the treatment procedure.

The in vitro experiments produced different degrees of contraction for septal and dermal tissues which emphasizes the balance between these processes for optimal aesthetic results. Lower two-dimensional contraction of the skin and significant three-dimensional contraction of subdermal adipose connective tissue may cause wrinkling of the skin surface in high-volume liposuction patients.

During this study we had one case of a seroma that was treated with closed serial aspiration. Seroma is not a rare side effect for energy-assisted liposuction, especially for high-volume treatment and may necessitate a lower threshold for closed drainage systems in selected patients.

### Effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil and hypertonic glucose in the prevention of post-mastectomy seroma in an experimental animal model [^7f4e43bd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seroma is a frequent complication that can affect the final result of reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.

Methodology

This study evaluated the effectiveness of 5-Fluorouracil and 75% hypertonic glucose in preventing seroma in a mastectomy rat model, as well as cellular and vascular events in adjacent tissues. A left mastectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed in 60 Wistar-Albino female rats. Animals randomly allocated to the control group (Group I; n = 20) were sutured right after mastectomy. The intervention groups received 1.0 mL of 75% hypertonic glucose (Group II; n = 20) or 1.0 mL of 5-Fluorouracil (Group III; n = 20) at the surgical site before suturing. The assessment of the presence of seroma was performed in all animals at 24, 48, and 72 h and on the 7th and 12th postoperative day. After the 12th day, a tissue sample was taken from the surgical site and sent for histological analysis. The occurrence of seroma was assessed using GEE. A significance level of 5% was adopted.

Results

Differences in seroma formation over time were observed for both Control Group I (p = 0.041) and Intervention Group II (p < 0.001). In Intervention Group III, there was no difference in the percentage and volume of seroma across the assessment points (p = 0.627). When both the Control and Intervention Group II were compared to Intervention Group III, we found a reduction in seroma formation in the last group. The reduction in the inflammatory process was more regular to Intervention Group III.

Conclusion

In this animal model, 5-Fluorouracil was more effective in preventing seroma formation than 75% Hypertonic Glucose.

### Management of recurrent post-traumatic seroma of thigh (morel-lavallée lesion) by percutaneous aspiration and sclerotherapy using tetracyclines (PAST) [^df04119c]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Morel-Lavallée lesion is a chronic, recurrent collection of serous fluid in the soft tissues and usually occurs following injury. The most common sites are thigh, hip and pelvic region. This presents as a local or diffuse swelling and may cause discomfort to the patient besides being a potential site for bacterial contamination. So, early diagnosis and timely management is crucial for an early and successful outcome. The investigation modality of choice for diagnosis of these lesions is MRI. Definitive management ranges from percutaneous aspiration with or without sclerotherapy to open debridement and irrigation. Although recurrences are common with conservative management, it can be minimised with judicious use of sclerotherapy.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^611b50c2]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review demonstrates that the preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure is associated with a significant reduction in seroma formation, with an overall incidence rate of 5.3% compared with 15.1% after a traditional abdominoplasty. This is consistent with a previous review of 1824 abdominoplasties that showed seroma rates after a traditional abdominoplasty ranging from 1% to 57% with an average of 10%. Additionally, the total drain output after Scarpa's fascia preservation abdominoplasty is significantly lower, with a mean volume of 256 mL compared with a mean volume of 625 mL after a traditional abdominoplasty. This is in line with another review of 191 abdominoplasties, which found that total drain output ranged from 210 to 686 mL after Scarpa's fascia preservation abdominoplasty and 445 to 1410 mL after traditional abdominoplasty. The time to drain removal in case of a Scarpa's fascia preservation abdominoplasty was approximately 4 days, in contrast to 7 days after a traditional abdominoplasty. The incidence of infections was also significantly lower when Scarpa's fascia was preserved during an abdominoplasty (2.1% compared with 5.2% after a traditional abdominoplasty). However, preserving Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty did not affect the incidence of hematoma or wound dehiscence, nor did it affect the length of hospital stay. Based on these findings, the preservation of Scarpa's fascia during an abdominoplasty procedure is recommended. The senior author (BL) has employed this technique in over 400 cases, and none of his patients has experienced seroma.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^f0f1beb9]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome Measures

The present study was designed as a non-inferiority study in order to test the hypothesis that the use of the lysine-derived urethane adhesive, without the concomitant use of drains, could provide a less invasive alternative to the use of drains for the management of fluid accumulation following a common large flap surgical procedure. In order to normalize the treatment modalities and effectively compare the two groups, the primary endpoint for the study was defined as the number of post-operative invasive procedures. Removal of an indwelling drain was counted as a single invasive procedure, as was a percutaneous needle aspiration. This design takes into account the fact that an indwelling drain is an invasive method of managing post-operative fluid. While it would be possible to design an outcome measure that takes into account the number of days an indwelling drain was in place, this study design focused on singular events that could be reasonably compared. As a result, removal of one drain was scored as a single invasive procedure regardless of the number of days it had been in place and represents the entire treatment process of having that drain in place.

Using the number of post-operative invasive procedures, the frequency of invasive management of the fluid-related complications (such as needle aspiration or removal of post-operative drains) can be captured and compared in an unbiased manner between test and control conditions. Our study hypothesis was that the elimination of dead space in the wound in the Treatment group would reduce the number of invasive procedures related to post-operative fluid management and the Treatment group would not be inferior to the Control group.

Secondary endpoints for the study included cumulative drain volume, aspiration volume, total wound drainage (drain volume + aspiration volume), cumulative days of invasive treatment (days with drains in + days aspirated), and days to drain removal. A patient questionnaire that evaluated Quality of Life measures related to resuming normal activities was also administered during the study. Seroma rate (defined as a clinically detectable palpable fluid collection requiring needle aspiration) was also documented. However, it should be recognized that in a treatment paradigm that involves an adhesive and not drains, percutaneous aspiration is the only method used for managing post-operative fluid collections, and that any fluid collection treated is classified as a seroma. Conversely, in the Control group, all subjects have indwelling drains, an invasive treatment to control fluid, and seroma is only diagnosed and treated with a second invasive therapy after the drains are removed.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^d9768044]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided fluid aspiration — definition and indications — is defined as procedures in which real-time ultrasound visualization is used to guide a needle or catheter into a fluid collection (eg, cyst, seroma, ganglion, or abscess) for diagnostic or therapeutic aspiration, with general indications for placing a needle or catheter into a fluid collection including diagnostic aspiration for fluid analysis to exclude infection, metallosis, crystal disease, and other etiologies of abnormal fluid collections; therapeutic aspiration for symptomatic relief or to facilitate resolution of the fluid collection; installation of a catheter for therapeutic drainage of a fluid collection; and installation of therapeutic agents such as corticosteroids and sclerosing agents.

Most related AEs did not require any action (148/217, 68.2%). Where action was specified, it often involved over-the-counter pain medication and at-home recovery management with compression, massage, and icing. Only 4 events required minor intervention (1.8%), which included aspiration of seroma and hematoma, aeration for a small mass, and precautionary stitches on the access site. Additionally, there were no new or ongoing patient reports of soreness, discomfort, or pain at the 6-month and 12-month visits on the ePROs.

### Does scarpa's fascia preservation in abdominoplasty reduce seroma? A systematic review [^c76f94b7]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the application of tissue adhesives or fibrin glue, a meta-analysis by Nasr et al has found that adhesives in abdominoplasty procedures does not result in a lower incidence of seroma formation. This is in contrast to the findings of Seretis et al, which suggested that tissue adhesives in conjunction with Scarpa's fascia preservation and possibly PTS might independently reduce seroma rates. It was theorized that tissue adhesives might act as hemostatic agents, sealing blood and lymphatic vessels, thus decreasing fluid accumulation and dead space that could lead to seroma formation. However, more clinical evidence is needed to confirm this potential benefit.

In recent years, an increasing number of surgeons have started performing abdominoplasty procedures without drains, because the preventive effect of drains on seroma formation has been called into question. Pisco et al demonstrated that applying 3 closed-suction drains does not confer any benefit in reducing the risk of seroma formation compared with the traditional 2 closed-suctions drains in abdominoplasty. Unfortunately, the study did not include an abdominoplasty group that did not involve any drains. In a 10-year, multicenter retrospective study, Rosen et al found that PTS in an abdominoplasty without drains reduced seroma incidence rates compared with techniques that used drains. Additionally, in a 3-year, single-center retrospective study, Vernier-Mosca et al found no significant differences in complication rates between patients who underwent an abdominoplasty with PTS and drains and patients that underwent the same operation but without drains. The group with drains had more seroma punctures and a higher amount of punctured fluid when compared with the group without drains. It seems plausible that application of closed-suction drains following abdominoplasty may confer little benefit in lowering the risk of seroma formation. The senior author (BL), in the time since he started performing Scarpa's fascia–sparing abdominoplasties and inserting drains for a maximum of 24 hours, with patients discharged the next day without drains in the absence of serious complications, has never observed seroma, in the course of more than 400 cases.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^af55e616]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Risk of bias within studies

The assessment of risk of bias within studies is shown in Table S1 (supporting information). Generally, the studies were reported incompletely (Fig. S1, supporting information). To obtain the missing information, the corresponding authors of the seven published papers were contacted. One study 37 provided the information requested. One author 36 did not respond to the request, but had corresponded with the authors of the Cochrane review 22. Accordingly, for this specific trial, the information from the Cochrane review was used.

The included trials were of moderate methodological quality. In general, randomization and allocation concealment were not described adequately. Blinding of outcome assessment was described adequately in two studies 36, 37. Three studies 35, 36, including that of B. D. Crist et al. (personal communication), did not describe loss to follow‐up properly. There did not appear to be selective reporting bias. Finally, all studies, except one 35, were either sponsored or had at least one consultant of a manufacturer as co‐author.

Results of individual studies

The ten included studies recruited a total of 1089 patients with 1311 incisions, of which 664 were treated with iNPWT and 647 with a standard postoperative dressing. The duration of treatment before first change of dressing varied from 2 to 7 (median 5) days in the intervention group and from 1 to 7 (median 2) days in the control group (duration was not stated in 3 studies 34, 38, 39). The length of follow‐up varied from 10 days to 1 year. Only two studies (S. Karlakki et al. and R. Galiano et al. personal communication) recorded the time points of evaluation and how the outcomes were assessed after discharge. The reported outcome was wound infection in seven of ten studies (1251 incisions), wound dehiscence in four studies (892 incisions) and seroma in three (60 incisions). One study (S. Karlakki et al. personal communication; 209 incisions) reported wound exudate as a primary outcome, and another study 33 (60 incisions) reported 'days to dry wound'.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^fc32a05d]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The results of this large randomized, prospective study support the use of the lysine-derived urethane adhesive as a safe and effective alternative to drains in subjects undergoing a common large flap surgical procedure. Subjects treated with the adhesive were able to achieve comparable outcomes compared to subjects with drains, while experiencing a decrease in the total number of invasive procedures required to manage postsurgical fluid accumulation-related issues. The cumulative number of days receiving treatment was also significantly less in the Treatment group since they did not require the placement of drains. In the Treatment group, 27% of the subjects required invasive procedures, whereas in the Control group, 100% required invasive procedures.

As is the convention in adverse event recording, aspiration was treated as a surrogate for seroma in our study, such that any time an aspiration was performed on a subject, the patient was counted as having a seroma. To avoid bias and insure consistency across study sites, a seroma was determined as present or absent independent of its volume, timing, or degree of risk to the subject. The higher seroma rate noted in the Treatment group was likely due to the difference in the way fluid removal was categorized between the two groups. Since the Treatment group had no drains, any fluid removal in this group (e.g. by aspiration) was categorized as a seroma, whereas removal of fluid by a drain in the Control group was considered as drainage volume only and not categorized as seroma. While drains were placed post-operatively for seroma formation in 4 subjects randomized to the Treatment arm, two of these subjects had very low total volumes of fluid aspirated (< 100 mL cumulative volume) prior to drain placement with the drains likely placed due to an overabundance of caution associated with the initial use of the adhesive without drains. The other two subjects who had drains placed were from the same study site where a higher volume (up to 500 mL) of tumescent fluid was utilized during the procedure compared to other sites (< 200 mL). This increased volume of tumescent fluid used may have contributed to the excess fluid accumulation observed in these two subjects.

### Ethanol sclerotherapy for postoperative seroma of the breast and axilla [^d56a0333]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Evaluate the effectiveness of alcohol sclerotherapy in postoperative breast and axillary seromas.

Methods

This was an IRB-approved retrospective review of consecutive patients from 2017 to 2021. The procedure involves aspiration of seroma fluid, injection of ethanol for 15 to 30 minutes, and then aspiration of the injected ethanol. Following review of the medical record, patient and procedure data were recorded. Success was defined as no recurrence of seroma. Statistical analysis was performed using a chi-square or t-test, as appropriate.

Results

Twenty seromas were treated in 19 patients (mean age, 63 years; range, 49–79) following mastectomy (9/20, 45%), lumpectomy (25%, 5/20), axillary nodal dissection (5/20, 25%), or chest wall surgery (1/20, 5%). The mean seroma volume was 146 ± 165 mL. There was a mean of 1.4 prior aspiration attempts (range, 0–3). Mean injected ethanol volume was 39 mL (range, 8–60 mL) for a mean of 26 ± 5 minutes. Seromas recurred in 85% (17/20) of cases, and repeat aspiration was performed in 35% (6/17). The mean recurrence time was 34 ± 29 days. The recurrent seromas were 31% smaller (mean, 80 ± 48 mL). Only a smaller pre-ablation seroma was associated with successful ablation (P < 0.01), as the mean pre-ablation volume was 36 ± 24 mL for successful ablations and 119 ± 56 mL for unsuccessful ablations. There were no post-procedural complications.

Conclusion

Single-treatment ethanol sclerotherapy is typically unsuccessful in ablating breast and axillary seromas. Only a smaller pre-ablation seroma size was associated with successful ablation.

### Fibrin sealant reduces the duration and amount of fluid drainage after axillary dissection: a randomized prospective clinical trial [^89b8c8e9]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who have axillary dissections during lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy for breast carcinoma accumulate serosanguinous fluid, potentially resulting in a seroma. Currently accepted practice includes insertion of one or more drains for fluid evacuation. This multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase II study was undertaken to evaluate whether a virally inactivated, investigational fibrin sealant is safe and effective when used as a sealing agent to reduce the duration and volume of serosanguinous fluid drainage and to determine the dose response of this effect.

Study Design

Patients undergoing lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy were randomized to treatment with 4, 8, or 16 mL of fibrin sealant or control (no agent) at the axillary dissections site. Patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy also received an additional 4 or 8 mL of fibrin sealant at the skin flap site. Efficacy was evaluated by the number of days required for wound drainage and the volume of fluid drainage compared with control. Safety was confirmed by clinical course, the absence of viral seroconversion, and no major complications attributable to the sealant.

Results

The 4-mL axillary dissection dose of fibrin sealant significantly reduced the duration and quantity of fluid drainage from the axilla following lumpectomy (p ≤ 0.05). In the modified radical mastectomy patients, a 16-mL axillary dissection dose combined with an 8-mL skin flap dose was significantly effective in reducing the number of days to drain removal (p ≤ 0.05) and fluid drainage (p ≤ 0.01). There were no fibrin sealant patient viral seroconversions and no major complications attributable to the sealant. A number of wound infections were noted, although this may represent a center-specific effect.

Conclusions

Application of fibrin sealant following axillary dissection at the time of lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy can significantly decrease the duration and quantity of serosanguinous drainage. The viral safety of the product was also supported.

### Effects of hydrochlorothiazide on drainage volume and seroma formation in deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction: randomized controlled trial [^4c1b2c25]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Seroma is a recognized complication encountered at the reconstructed breast and donor site after abdominal-based breast reconstruction. Seroma is caused by lymphatic channel disruption and the formation of a large space between the deep fascia during flap elevation. Surgical techniques to preserve the lymphatics and secure the closure of the donor site can reduce seroma formation. This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide at reducing interstitial fluid accumulation and seroma formation during deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction.

Methods

Sixty patients with breast cancer who underwent skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction were enrolled between August 2016 and June 2017. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 25 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide from the second to the twentieth day after surgery (treatment) or no diuretic (control). The clinicopathological characteristics, drainage time, and drainage volume were statistically compared between the two groups.

Results

The average total drainage volume at the donor site was 291 mL in the treatment group and 434 mL in the control group (p = 0.003). The differences in body mass index and flap weight between the two groups were not statistically significant (p = 0.879 and p = 0.963, respectively). No hypotension or electrolyte imbalance was noted during the follow-up.

Conclusions

Intake of 25 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide tablets effectively reduced the total abdominal drainage volume and removal time of indwelling drains. However, the adverse effects should be further investigated in a large population and multiracial cohort before using hydrochlorothiazide for seroma prevention.

### Within-patient randomized clinical trial comparing incisional negative-pressure wound therapy with suction drains in gender-affirming mastectomies [^97e6a9db]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Although understanding of seroma pathophysiology remains limited, seroma tends to occur in surgical dead spaces, and in the presence of factors such as a high BMI and extensive cauterization. Experimental studies, of NPWT have indicated that compression of dead space limits the accumulation of serous fluid and increases lymphatic drainage. Pachowsky and colleaguesshowed this seroma-reducing effect of iNPWT using ultrasound monitoring. Furthermore, two clinical studies, in breast surgery and abdominoplasty indicated that combined treatment with iNPWT and suction drains resulted in less drain fluid production and earlier drain removal. It is worthwhile mentioning that the abovementioned studies used PREVENA™ (KCI, Acelity, San Antonio, TX, United States), which generates –125 mmHg and does not have surgical drains as a contraindication. A significant increase in seroma formation was observed in the present study when iNPWT was used without suction drains, and therefore the claimed properties of iNPWT as a method for treating low-output wounds might be less pronounced or clinically relevant with the settings and instructions provided with the PICO™ device. The short period application of suction drains on the control side probably allowed drainage of early-onset exudate, which remained in situ on the iNPWT side. Therefore, the effectiveness of the intervention might have just been insufficient in preventing seroma formation in these large dead spaces without the assistance of suction drains.

### The effect of drains and compressive garments versus progressive tensioning sutures on seroma formation in abdominoplasty [^d901fdf6]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Seroma is a common problem following abdominoplasty surgery. Both compressive garments with drains and progressive tension sutures have their advocates to minimise seroma formation. This is a retrospective study in which patients underwent an identical surgical procedure, except for use of drains and garments in comparison to progressive tension sutures between 2005 and 2020. Two hundred thirty-two patients were included in the study 61 in the drains and garment group (DG group), and 171 with progressive tension sutures (PTS group) alone. There was a lower incidence of seroma formation in the PTS group (X 2 (1, N = 232) = 6.35, P = 0.012). The weight of tissue excised in the PTS group was greater than the DG group (P < .001). There was there a significantly higher tissue excision weights for patients who developed a seroma, compared with those who did not (P = 0.02). Patients, who developed a seroma in the PTS group, had significantly greater excision weights than the DG group. Liposuction did not change the incidence of seroma in each group (X 2 (4, N = 232) = 6.701, P = 0.08 n/s). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of progressive tension sutures in reducing the incidence of seroma formation following abdominoplasty, particularly when large excision weights are involved. The addition of small volume liposuction distant to the abdominal flap does not increase the incidence of seroma formation.

### The morel-lavallée lesion: pathophysiology, clinical presentation, imaging features, and treatment options [^6583dc26]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Morel-Lavallée lesions are posttraumatic hemolymphatic collections related to shearing injury and disruption of interfascial planes between subcutaneous soft tissue and muscle. We review the pathophysiology of Morel-Lavallée lesions, clinical presentation, and potential sites of involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for characterization. We present the MRI classification and highlight the key imaging features that distinguish the different types, focusing on the three most common: seroma, subacute hematoma, and chronic organizing hematoma. Potential mimics of Morel-Lavallée lesions, such as soft tissue sarcoma and hemorrhagic prepatellar bursitis, are compared and contrasted. Treatment options and a management algorithm are also briefly discussed.

### Lysine-derived urethane surgical adhesive prevents seroma formation in a canine abdominoplasty model [^964cf99a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Seroma formation is a common postoperative complication following many surgical procedures, including abdominoplasty. Several approaches have been investigated to prevent seroma formation by draining fluid or attempting to eliminate dead space, but these approaches have limited effectiveness.

Methods

A canine model of abdominoplasty was developed that reliably produced seroma formation. Bilateral subcutaneous pockets were created in the ventrolateral abdominal wall and additional tissue damage was inflicted using electrocautery. On one side, the tissue layers were treated with a lysine-derived urethane adhesive before closure, whereas the control side received no treatment before standard closure of the incision.

Results

Seroma formation (60 ± 45 ml) was observed on the control side, whereas the treated side had adherence between the tissue layers and minimal if any fluid accumulation (1.7 ± 1.4 ml) (p < 0.01) (n = 7). The adhesive invoked little or no cellular response, based on histologic examination of the tissue.

Conclusion

The urethane surgical adhesive was effective in preventing the formation of seroma in this canine abdominoplasty model.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^0a084ccf]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Most previous studies evaluating methods for reducing fluid-related complications have focused on the volume of fluid output from the drains, or on the time to drain removal. Neither of these measures has been shown to have clinical significance in terms of the recovery time of the patient or in their long-term risk of developing an intractable seroma requiring further medical attention. The current study took a different approach by evaluating the number of invasive procedures, which allowed a comparison across groups that directly addresses the frequency of clinical intervention and patient management during the recovery process. This approach also recognizes the fact that having an indwelling drain itself is an invasive procedure, and that drain removal can be perceived by patients to be equally if not more invasive than needle aspiration. This is a highly relevant point, since a seroma cannot be diagnosed in the presence of a drain, and a scoring system must be used that accounts for the presence of a drain to manage post-operative fluid and provides a fair comparison with a needle aspiration. As needle aspiration is a single, low-risk event, we considered a drain removal to be a similar single, low-risk event. A weakness of that measure is that drains present for a longer period time are scored as a single event when removed, despite more days of continuous discomfort for the patient and higher risk of infection. Indeed, a scoring system that accounts for discomfort and inconvenience due to drain maintenance would be useful but more difficult to validate and compare with singular self-limited procedures such as needle aspiration.

### Clinical evaluation of 310 abdominoplasties and measurement of scar level [^9da6b448]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 13
This 36-year-old woman underwent an abdominoplasty and liposuction of the lower body, arms, and axillae. Fifteen days after surgery, a seroma was aspirated from the upper abdomen after confirmation using ultrasound. A volume of 20 mL was obtained. She did not require any other aspirations.

A major focus has been on the elimination of drains. The author uses a single suction drain, which is removed 3 or 4 days after surgery regardless of drainage volume. In some cases, when there has been very little bleeding at surgery and minimal fluid accumulation in the suction bulb, the drain is removed earlier. The drain is well-tolerated by patients. The rationale for its use is to minimize the need for needle aspirations in the office. Forgoing a drain is a reasonable option; the minimal nuisance of a drain is traded for the increased likelihood of office seroma aspirations. It is not a weighty decision. Fibrin sealant has not been found to be effective in reducing seroma risk.

### Treatment of perigraft seroma in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts by sequential fibrin sealing of the outer graft surface [^33116a29]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The recommended standard for treatment of perigraft seroma (PS) is the graft removal and the reconstruction using an alternative prosthesis. We assumed that a fibrin sealing of the outer surface of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts would prevent leakage and used this technique in the treatment and prevention of PS.

Methods

Over a 10-year period, 24 patients were treated for PS after subcutaneous implantation of ePTFE grafts (14 arterial bypasses and 10 arteriovenous grafts). Affected graft segments were temporarily removed and underwent sequential fibrin sealing technique before reimplantation. In addition, an in vitro experiment was carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of fibrin sealing to prevent leakage through the ePTFE graft wall, after its hydrophobic barrier was destroyed by filling with saline solution under pressure.

Results

A cure of PS was observed in 20 patients (84%) at a follow-up period of 37 ± 18 months. A later graft infection was not seen in any patient. The patency rate of reconstructed grafts appears to be unaffected. In the performed experiment we have demonstrated an elimination of leakage through the graft wall by the fibrin sealing technique.

Conclusions

Sequential fibrin sealing of the outer surface is an effective way to treat PS in ePTFE grafts. However, failure of this treatment cannot be precluded. Further studies are necessary that may provide further insights into the causes and best treatment of PS and the possibly important role of PS in the aneurysm enlargement after complete endovascular exclusion with ePTFE endografts.

### Negative effect of seroma on breast balloon brachytherapy dosimetry [^d2ef7b82]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Balloon brachytherapy is commonly used to deliver Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI). Seroma interference is a relatively common phenomenon during APBI. The negative effect of seroma accumulation on the planning target volume evaluation (PTV_Eval) coverage is not well understood.

Methods and Materials

This is a dosimetric replanning study on 10 patients with evidence of seroma collection at time of initial computed tomographic simulation around the catheter. Total dose was 34 Gy given at 3.4 Gy twice a day over 5 treatment days. A total of 20 plans were generated, 10 plans without accounting for and 10 after subtracting the seroma. We then compared the changes seen in PTV_Eval between plans as a factor of the seroma volume.

Results

Median age was 62 years (51–83). Histology was invasive in 7/10 cases and in situ in 3/10. Median balloon to skin distance was 8.5 mm (3–14). Median balloon volume was 39 cc (30–104). Median seroma volume was 3.34 cc (1.13–13.71). For every 1 cc of accumulated seroma the percentage of PTV_Eval coverage by the 90% isodose line (V90) was found to decrease by 2.45% (P < .0001; confidence interval [CI] 1.87–3.03) and coverage by the 100% isodose line (V100) was decreased by 1.11% (P < .0001; CI, 0.81–1.41). Fifty percent (5/10) of previously acceptable plans with seroma not accounted for failed to meet the V90 ≥ 90% requirement after subtracting the seroma.

Conclusions

Accumulation of seroma was associated with a considerable negative impact on PTV_Eval dosimetry with a greater impact on V90 compared with the V100. Clinicians must be careful in detecting and accounting for such accumulation in treatment plans to prevent underdosing of the at risk target breast tissue.

### Improved perioperative seroma and complication rates following the application of a 2-layer negative pressure wound therapy system after inguinal lymphadenectomy for metastatic cutaneous melanoma [^5a45abcc]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The overall incidence of postoperative seroma was 52.9%, which was consistent with previously published data. When the factors for seroma formation were analysed (Table 2), the only significant association was the type of drainage system used (2-LNPWT 31.2% vs CSD 58.3%; p < 0.03; OR 3.0 [1.1–8.3]). Unlike previous studies, there was no association with body mass index, age, gender, ASA grade or smoking status. Interestingly, the data in Table 1 shows no difference in the number of seroma aspirations or mean seroma volume between the two drainage systems. This data would suggest that the optimal management of a seroma is to prevent it happening at all. Unfortunately, the duration of seroma formation (from clinical identification to clinical resolution) was not consistently recorded in our dataset, though it is clear from Table 1 that, once a seroma was established, it was not possible to reliably alter the clinical course of this complication, regardless of the initial drainage system that was employed postoperatively. These findings are consistent with previous studies. Of note, one study found that the use of sclerosants to reduce the clinical course of postoperative seromas paradoxically increased the duration of the drainage period. One conclusion that could be drawn from this data is that the outcome of seroma formation should, perhaps, be regarded as a common sequela to the procedure rather than a complication. According to Dindo and Clavien, a complication is defined as, "… any deviation from the normal postoperative course," whereas a sequela is defined as, "… an after-effect" of surgery that is inherent to the procedure. The data in this study shows that incidence of seroma formation, though common, can be modified by postoperative interventions, such as 2-LNPWT. Encouragingly, the data also shows that a seroma was not associated with a significant increase in other complications, when managed at our unit.

### Review of current accepted practices in identification of the breast lumpectomy tumor bed [^e1b57a68]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Seroma formation

Seroma (postoperative serous fluid accumulation) fills the cavity after lumpectomy and may be visualized on CT using the color difference between fluid and soft tissue. However, the formation of seroma is variable and not always localized to the tumor cavity as it can diffuse to other areas of the breast. The amount of seroma present depends on the individual patient's breast parenchyma density and time elapsed after surgery, as the amount reabsorbed into the cavity increases with time. Seroma formation also relies on how the excision cavity is closed. For example, less seroma volume forms in cases with full-thickness cavity closure. As a result, reliance on seroma formation alone often leads to imprecise localization of the tumor bed. According to Coles et al, where seroma formation on 30 patients was judged by 2 clinical oncology consultants, 8/30 patients had "highly visible" seroma formation, 10/30 had "visible" seroma formation, 6/30 had "subtle" seroma formation, and 6/30 had seroma formation that was "not visible" on CT after surgical closure of the breast after BCS. In another study, researchers found that seroma formation could be observed on CT for 65% of patients, with a median of 35 days between BCS and CT. Seroma formation is variable and unreliable when delineating the tumor cavity to plan clinical target volume (CTV) for radiation therapy, which includes the gross tumor volume plus an additional margin. Without any kind of fiducial markers, the tumor bed can be underdosed and healthy tissue can be unnecessarily dosed as a result of an inaccurately determined CTV.

### The efficacy of prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy for closed incisions in breast surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a6e9ed99]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a promising advance in the management of closed surgical incisions. NPWT application induces several effects locally within the wound including reduced lateral tension and improving lymphatic drainage. As a result, NPWT may improve wound healing and reduce surgical site complications. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic application of NPWT in preventing surgical site complications for closed incisions in breast surgery.

Methods

This systematic review was reported according to PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was published in PROSPERO (CRD42018114625). Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies which compare the efficacy of NPWT versus non-NPWT dressings for closed incisions in breast surgery. Specific outcomes of interest were total wound complications, surgical site infection (SSI), seroma, haematoma, wound dehiscence and necrosis.

Results

Seven studies (1500 breast incisions in 904 patients) met the inclusion criteria. NPWT was associated with a significantly lower rate of total wound complications [odds ratio (OR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.19–069; P = 0.002], SSI (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24–0.86; P = 0.015), seroma (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.13–0.59; P = 0.001), wound dehiscence (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32–0.72; P < 0.001) and wound necrosis (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.19–0.78; P = 0.008). There was no significant difference in haematoma rate (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.19–3.2; P = 0.75). Statistically significant heterogeneity existed for total wound complications, but no other outcomes.

Conclusion

Compared with conventional non-NPWT dressings, prophylactic application of NPWT is associated with significantly fewer surgical site complications including SSI, seroma, wound dehiscence and wound necrosis for closed breast incisions.

### Prevention of device-related infections in patients with cancer: current practice and future horizons [^bf424f29]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

Of note, acellular dermal matrices have been increasingly used for surgical reconstruction to allow for lower pole support of the breast implant, enhancing aesthetic outcomes while decreasing operative time. These biologic meshes are available in aseptic or sterile form, with no significant difference in the rate of infection between the two forms. However, they have been associated with increased incidence of seroma and hematoma and extended durations of surgical drains. These drains likely serve as microbial conduits for pathogens to migrate from the skin to the implant, with an overall risk ratio for infection of 2.47 (95% CI, 1.71–3.57; p = .01). Also, a seroma located between an acellular dermal matrix and an implant is relatively isolated from the host's immune system, likely further increasing the probability of infection. Therefore, the goal is to place these drains through a subcutaneous tunnel and then remove them as soon as possible in the presence of < 30 mL of daily output or even earlier, not surpassing 7–14 days of use.

Further infection preventive measures during the early postoperative period include (1) avoidance of extending postoperative antimicrobial use beyond 24 hours, although this is common practice because this does not reduce the rate of infection and leads to the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens –; (2) allowing adequate incisional healing before initiating adjuvant bevacizumab use or radiation therapy; (3) proceeding with early expansion of the TE to decrease the size of the seroma pocket but without significantly increasing the surface tension and causing a skin flap necrosis; (4) keeping the surgical bulb at gravity at all times to keep the drained fluid from re-entering the surgical pocket; and (5) consideration of additional techniques, such as using chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing at the exit drain site and exchanging it weekly along with a daily antiseptic solution within the surgical bulb to further decrease bacterial colonization (p = .03) and the likelihood of a secondary infection within 30 days (p = .13) and 1 year (p = .45).

### Superficial parotidectomy: impact of postoperative drainage [^8aed982a]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of suction drain after superficial parotidectomy (SP) is based on national consensus considered best practice, but there is no evidence on the effect of the treatment. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of drainage after SP by evaluating the rate of complications after SP in relation to the (ie, duration) of drainage and tumor size.

Methods

Retrospective analysis was performed involving data from all consecutive patients undergoing SP at the Ear, Nose, and Throat department, Regional Hospital West Jutland, Denmark, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017. Demographics including comorbidity, medication, tumor size, postoperative secretion through the drainage, as well as complications (hematoma, seroma, infection, fistulas, Frey syndrome, facial nerve palsy) were registered. Patients with secretion below 25 mL were compared to patients with secretion above 25 mL, that is, drainage less than 24 hours versus longer than 24 hours. Results: Two hundred five consecutive patients undergoing SP were enrolled. The overall risk of postoperative infection was 16.2%. Ten of 33 patients with infection were also diagnosed with an hematoma or seroma. The risk of infection increased with secretion above 25 mL (27.2%) compared to patients with less than 25 mL (13.1%; P = 0.0318). The same accounts for the risk of seromas/hematomas (P = 0.0055). We found no evidence that demographics or comorbidity correlated to the secretion in the drainage, but there is a tendency toward male gender having a higher risk off secretion above 25 mL (odds ratio 1.39).

Conclusion

Overall, the risk of complications after SP increased with secretion beyond 25 mL (ie, drainage for more than 24 hours). This applied in particular to infections and seromas/hematomas demanding treatment. The use of routine drainage after SP is questionable, and a randomized trial is warranted to unravel the necessity of postoperative drainage.

### Seromadesis following total hip resurfacing by aspiration and injection of doxycycline [^74140403]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Tetracyclines in solution form are used topically for chemical pleurodesis in chest surgery. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic. Some studies have reported successful topical use of tetracyclines in solution as a treatment in seroma, taking advantage of their sclerosing effect in cases of reconstruction following breast surgery, abdominal and hernia surgery. Prophylactic use of doxycycline has been attempted as prophylaxis in groin hernia repair although this is of no proven benefit. The common adverse effects of chemical pleurodesis are pain, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms. No such adverse effects were observed in this case. Tetracycline has been demonstrated to increase growth factor — like activity in mesothelial cells exposed to tetracycline. This leads to fibroblast proliferation and consequently fibrin formation that closes the dead space present in a seroma. In addition, the use of doxycycline in seroma provides local delivery of an antibiotic commonly used for skin and soft tissue infections; due to its efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There has also previously been a reported case of successful seromadesis in breast surgery using doxycycline while erythromycin has been used in seromadesis following hip replacement suggesting that treatment is not limited to doxycycline.

Learning points

It is crucial to exclude infection in arthroplasty-associated seroma treatment.
Multidisciplinary team involvement is fundamental.
Doxycycline is a safe and potentially curative treatment for seroma around the hip.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and management of seroma formation after breast approach endoscopic thyroidectomy [^c79a88f3]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Breast approach endoscopic thyroidectomy (BAET) allows surgeons to remove a thyroid tumor from a remote site while providing a scarless cosmetic appearance in the neck. However, seroma formation after subcutaneous dissection could lead to flap detachment, incision dehiscence, and wound infection. Chronic formation of seromas could substantially compromise the esthetic outcome of BAET. We evaluated the prevalence, risk factors, and treatments of seroma after BAET.

Methods

A total of 344 patients who underwent BAET between 2001 and 2008 at our institution were recruited; data were collected prospectively. The characteristics and outcomes of patients who developed seromas were compared with those of patients who did not. Regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for seroma formation. The frequency and volume of aspirations were noted until the seroma went into remission.

Results

The overall postoperative prevalence of seroma formation was 2.9%. There was a significant difference in seroma formation based on age, hypertension, body mass index (BMI), and area of subcutaneous dissection space (ASDS). Percutaneous aspiration alone or combined with external compression was extremely effective. The frequency and total volume of aspirations were 1–7 and 6–120 ml, respectively. As a result of prolonged seroma formation, one patient developed an expanding pseudo-bursa that created a tumor-like effect in the anterior chest wall.

Conclusions

Seroma formation was an uncommon minor complication after BAET. Four independent etiologic factors could predispose patients to postoperative seroma formation. Percutaneous aspiration appeared to be very effective. Prolonged seroma formation followed by development of a pseudo-bursa could be very problematic and could substantially impair the esthetic effect of BAET.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline: autologous breast reconstruction with DIEP or pedicled TRAM abdominal flaps [^5ed739fa]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Autologous breast reconstruction with DIEP versus pedicled TRAM — infection, seroma/hematoma, and wound dehiscence: A comparative study found similar infection rates (DIEP, 12.5 percent; pedicled TRAM, 17.0 percent) and wound dehiscence (DIEP, 12.5 percent; pedicled TRAM, 13.8 percent); two comparative studies found no statistically significant difference in seroma or hematoma; pooled seroma was 5.1 percent for DIEP versus 2.4 percent for pedicled TRAM and pooled hematoma 3.2 percent for DIEP versus 2.5 percent for pedicled TRAM; data on postoperative radiation are limited with neither technique superior, so clinicians should be flexible and the balance of benefits and harms regarding these complications is unclear.

### Clinical evaluation of 310 abdominoplasties and measurement of scar level [^c1a2925b]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Most recent publications on abdominoplasty focus on reducing the risk of complications, particularly seromas. – Outcome surveys have been published, documenting a high level of patient satisfaction and improved quality of life after traditional abdominoplasty, – especially when combined with liposuction. However, few studies assess aesthetic outcomes using measurements.

A panniculectomy is undertaken to remove a large pannus to improve function, including mobility and hygiene. An abdominoplasty is primarily an aesthetic procedure, undertaken to improve the appearance of the abdomen. Excess skin and fat are removed, and the muscle wall is usually tightened to improve the abdominal contour, while minimizing visible scarring and leaving a natural-appearing umbilicus. Although historically abdominoplasty patients have been hospitalized for 1 to 4 days, this procedure is frequently performed today on outpatients.

The main drawback of abdominoplasty is the scar, which typically runs from hip to hip. Many women considering this procedure are concerned about the appearance of such a long scar. Studies have shown that if the scar is located inferiorly, within the panty line, scar dissatisfaction is low (4.3%). Flexed positioning in surgery and deep fascial anchoring sutures assist in keeping the scar low and avoiding upward scar migration.

Numerous methods have focused on ways to reduce the incidence of seromas. Lipoabdominoplasty (ie, a limited abdominoplasty "tunnel" dissection with liposuction) has received a great deal of attention in the literature since its first publication 20 years ago. Scarpa fascia preservation is advocated by several authors. Many surgeons have adopted quilting (or progression tension) sutures. A largely overlooked alternative approach is to avoid electrodissection and reduce the potential for an inflammatory exudate to collect and create a seroma.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical outcome of a full abdominoplasty, in combination with liposuction and other procedures, including the seroma rate. In addition, the vertical level of the abdominoplasty scar was evaluated. The scar level was compared with measurements on published photographs from studies using other methods.

### Negative pressure wound therapy as effective and comfortable management after treatment of osmidrosis [^ea8c63b1]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Although osmidrosis has been widely discussed in respect to its treatment modalities, there has been no definite consideration of postoperative management after the treatment of osmidrosis. We have tested the 40–125 mmHg range of negative pressure. We present negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) of 70 mmHg for postoperative management in osmidrosis because NPWT has a role in removing fluid, such as blood or seroma, and diminishing the dead space between the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Patients who receive NPWT have shown successful treatment outcomes and no skin necrosis or hematoma formation. Additionally, NPWT could improve postoperative daily activity compared with conventional compressive dressings.

### Incidence and management of seroma after arteriovenous graft placement [^90e4e404]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Perigraft seromas are rare complications of insertion of PTFE hemodialysis grafts. They are often difficult to treat and recurrence is common. This study evaluates the incidence, potential etiologic variables, and management strategies for seromas after prosthetic arteriovenous graft (AVG) placement.

Study Design

A retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing AVG placement between August 2002 and December 2005 was performed to identify all patients diagnosed with seroma requiring surgical intervention. Multiple variables were analyzed to determine potential risk factors for seroma formation and outcomes of various forms of surgical management.

Results

In this interval, 535 AVG were inserted in 427 patients. Ten patients presented with a seroma and underwent surgical treatment. Overall incidence of seroma formation was 1.7%. There was no significant difference in seroma formation based on gender, age, diabetes, lower extremity versus upper extremity placement, or loop forearm versus straight forearm grafts. A statistically significant difference was found between upper arm (p = 0.007) and lower arm grafts (p = 0.04), with upper arm grafts more prone to seroma formation. Patients undergoing bypass of the seromatous segment of graft have not had a recurrence, compared with those who were simply evacuated and have had a mean patency of 402 days.

Conclusions

Seroma complications after AVG insertion are higher in patients with upper arm grafts. To minimize this complication, meticulous operative technique is required. If a seroma develops, the graft might still be salvageable with aggressive management, including bypass of the involved segment.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the surgical outcomes of progressive tension suturing compared to drains in abdominoplasty surgery [^268d4677]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Seroma formation after abdominoplasty is a common complication, although the pathophysiology is still unclear. Disruption of lymphatic channels, "dead space" formation, extensive undermining and advancement of abdominal flaps, and shearing forces have all been implicated. Although seroma formation may be self-limited, it also may be associated with complications such as wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, and infection. Untreated seromas may form a bursa or pseudocyst, which may need to be surgically removed. Although surgical closed suction drains have been placed for decades for prevention of seroma formation, drains are associated with an increase in postoperative pain and have a risk of retrograde bacterial migration and infection. Strategies to reduce seroma rates have been proposed over the years, but few studies have reported on systematically evaluated outcomes. Although a previously published meta-analysis has reported decreased seroma formation rate with "preventative measures" compared to conventional abdominoplasty procedures with drains, the preventative measures group was a heterogenous mixture of PTS, Scarpa's fascia preservation, tissue adhesives, and abdominal flap dissection. In this study, the subgroup analysis of the effect of PTS vs drains demonstrated borderline differences (0.36 [0.13, 1.02]; P = 0.05). Previous meta-analyses also reported decreased seroma formation rates in PTS vs drains (odds ratio [OR] 0.36; 95% CI 0.19–0.70; P = 0.002; I² = 9%). Additionally, there was no significant difference in postoperative seroma rates between PTS and PTS with drains (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.30–3.54; P = 0.96; I² = 0%). However, the failure of these studies to comply with AMSTAR 2 criteria limited the strength of their conclusions.

### Haemoblock hemostatic substance in reducing seroma formation post axillary lymph node dissection following breast conserving surgery [^9347ccd5]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer management, necessitates a nuanced understanding of complications that may impede treatment progression. This study scrutinize the impact of Haemoblock hemostatic solution, evaluation it's potential in reducing seroma complication by controlling lymph flow and obliterating axillary dead space.

Method

A prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled trial was conducted with 58 patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) and ALND, stratified into two groups: Group A (ALND + Haemoblock, n = 29) and Group B (ALND + placebo, n = 29). Postoperative drainage charts were monitored, with the primary endpoint being the time to drain removal, Additionally, patients were observed for surgical site infection (SSI).

Results

Group A exhibited a marginally higher mean total drain output (398 ± 205 vs. 326 ± 198) compared to Group B, this difference did not attain statistical significance (p = 0.176). Equally, the mean time to drain removal demonstrated no discernible distinction between the two groups (6 ± 3.0 vs. 6 ± 3.0, Group A vs. Group B, p = 0.526). During follow up, nine patients in Group A required seroma aspiration (mean aspiration 31 ± 73) as compared to Group B, 6 patients required aspiration (mean aspiration 12 ± 36), p = 0.222). No notable disparity in SSI rates between the groups was identified.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the administration of Haemoblock did not manifest a discernible effect in mitigating seroma production, hastening drain removal, or influencing SSI rates following ALND. The study underscores the intricate and multifactorial nature of seroma formation, suggesting avenues for future research to explore combined interventions and protracted follow-up periods for a more comprehensive understanding.

### Study details | NCT03305757 | Seroma reduction after mastectomy… [^5f3ec4bb]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

The use of electrocautery has been demonstrated to increase seroma formation following mastectomy, however no other surgical devices or substances have proven to be superior in seroma reduction. No prospective randomized controlled trials have been able to demonstrate which techniques are superior in reducing seroma and as a consequence patient discomfort in patients undergoing mastectomy. In a previous retrospective observational study these investigators demonstrated that mastectomy flap fixation significantly reduced seroma formation and the number of seroma aspirations. In a pilot study that was recently performed in one of the investigators hospitals, ARTISS tissue glue was used for skin flap fixation and showed promising results.

The investigators hypothesize that obliteration of the dead space following mastectomy will significantly reduce seroma formation, its complications and the discomfort it causes patients undergoing mastectomy. The use of electrocautery has been demonstrated to increase seroma formation following mastectomy, however no other surgical devices or substances have proven to be superior in seroma reduction. Seroma formation after axillary dissection for breast cancer cannot be avoided but hopefully it can be minimized by mechanical dead space closure. The investigators hypothesize that obliteration of the dead space following mastectomy will significantly reduce seroma formation. This study aims to reduce seroma formation after mastectomy, proving that obliteration of dead space following mastectomy is vital in preventing seroma formation and its sequelae.

The investigators current standard of treatment for patients undergoing mastectomy in Atrium Medical Centre Heerlen is flap fixation using interrupted Vicryl sutures and closed suction drainage. In Orbis Medical Centre Sittard current standard of wound closure in patients undergoing mastectomy is ARTISS Tissue Glue. A retrospective study has been conducted in our centre in which flap fixation seemed to be an effective surgical technique in reducing dead space and therefore seroma formation in patients undergoing mastectomy for invasive breast cancer. Patients undergoing flap fixation required fewer seroma aspirations and had fewer seroma related complications.
