## Question

What are the non-surgical treatment options for patients with chronic myelopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about non-surgical treatment options for chronic myelopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and severity stratification. Then, I should verify the overarching evidence-based principle that links severity to treatment choice. Next, I will examine non-surgical options for mild disease, followed by symptomatic management for moderate-to-severe disease when surgery is deferred or contraindicated. After that, I need to review interventional pain procedures and neuromodulation, and finally I should outline monitoring, follow-up, and counseling, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and correcting any misstatements as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and severity framework. Chronic myelopathy in this context most commonly reflects degenerative cervical myelopathy, the leading cause of adult spinal cord dysfunction, characterized by progressive cord compression from spondylosis, disc degeneration, and ligamentous hypertrophy or ossification, with diagnosis anchored by clinical signs correlated to MRI and severity commonly graded by the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score as mild (15–17), moderate (12–14), or severe (≤ 11) [^1161pkAJ] [^1156XKun] [^113VSiEE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-surgical care being broadly effective; I need to check the core principle. The best available guidance indicates that surgery is recommended for moderate-to-severe DCM because it halts progression and improves function, whereas non-surgical management may be considered in mild, stable disease with close surveillance, acknowledging that the natural history is unpredictable and a meaningful subset will deteriorate over time [^115GCexN] [^1161pkAJ] [^112TSoxC].

> Next, I should review the evidence for non-surgical management in mild DCM. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and quality of evidence. Systematic reviews and consensus statements suggest that for mild myelopathy, nonoperative care may yield outcomes comparable to surgery in some patients, but the evidence is low quality and heterogeneous, with one randomized trial suggesting equivalence and cohort data showing that many remain stable while a minority deteriorate, which means any non-surgical approach must be framed as a monitored trial with predefined triggers for escalation [^116qqVM9] [^112TSoxC] [^117QPG74].

> I will now examine what "structured non-surgical care" entails in mild DCM. Let me think about components with the best face validity and safety. Structured rehabilitation emphasizing neck and scapular stabilization, postural training, balance and gait work, and activity modification is reasonable, with the caveat that cervical manipulation is contraindicated due to risk of cord injury; preoperative physiotherapy should be directed by specialists, and comprehensive rehabilitation programs may augment function beyond surgery alone, though high-quality comparative trials are lacking [^115GCexN] [^11212C4Z] [^1116jymP].

> But wait, what about pharmacologic adjuncts in mild disease. I should confirm that no disease-modifying drugs exist for DCM. Symptom control can include NSAIDs for axial pain, neuropathic agents such as gabapentin or pregabalin for dysesthesias, and short-course muscle relaxants for spasm, recognizing that these treat symptoms rather than halt myelopathic progression and should be integrated with rehabilitation and surveillance rather than used in isolation [^115GCexN] [^1138nFAS].

> Now, for moderate-to-severe DCM, I need to ensure I am clear that non-surgical care is not curative; it is supportive and symptom-directed when surgery is deferred or contraindicated. Multidisciplinary pain management with careful medication selection, spasticity management with baclofen or tizanidine, bladder training or urologic referral, and fall-prevention strategies are appropriate, and early referral to pain clinics can help address neuropathic pain and disability, while acknowledging that progression risk remains and surgery should be reconsidered if feasible [^115GCexN] [^113VSiEE].

> Let me consider interventional procedures next, and I should double-check their role in myelopathy specifically. Epidural steroid injections and facet interventions have evidence for axial and radicular pain syndromes but not for reversing myelopathy; moreover, contemporary guidelines issue strong recommendations against epidural and facet injections for chronic axial and radicular pain due to small, short-lived benefits and potential harms, so these should not be used with the expectation of improving myelopathic deficits and, if considered at all, should be limited to carefully selected pain-control contexts with informed consent about limited evidence [^115oHuZg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated spinal cord stimulation with treatment of myelopathy itself; I should correct that. SCS has emerging evidence for refractory axial low back pain and some radicular pain syndromes, with randomized and prospective studies showing improved pain and function versus conventional medical management in selected non-surgical populations, but there is no evidence that SCS reverses or treats the underlying pathophysiology of cord compression in DCM; thus, SCS may be considered only for refractory pain after exhausting standard options and with clear counseling that it is not a substitute for decompression when indicated [^1117rQpx] [^112yRdMF].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up for patients managed non-surgically, because I need to ensure safety nets are explicit. Regular surveillance every 3–6 months with mJOA scoring, focused neurologic examination, and symptom review is prudent, with a low threshold to repeat MRI if new deficits emerge; deterioration by two or more mJOA points or new bowel/bladder involvement should prompt urgent surgical consultation, and patients should be counseled that roughly 13–20% of mildly affected individuals may deteriorate within 1–3 years, though risk stratification remains imprecise [^113WNVAX] [^114PfeNe] [^112TSoxC].

> I should confirm counseling points that align with evidence and guidelines. Patients must understand that DCM is typically progressive, that non-surgical care does not reverse cord compression, that surgery is the only intervention proven to halt progression in moderate-to-severe disease, and that delaying decompression risks irreversible deficits; shared decision-making should document goals, trade-offs, and a predefined plan for escalation if red flags or functional decline occur [^115GCexN] [^1161pkAJ] [^113VSiEE].

> Let me synthesize a practical, severity-based approach and verify internal consistency. For mild, stable DCM, a time-limited trial of structured rehabilitation with symptom control and close monitoring is reasonable, with predefined triggers for surgical referral; for moderate-to-severe DCM, prioritize surgical decompression when feasible, and if surgery is deferred or contraindicated, provide supportive multidisciplinary care focused on pain, spasticity, bladder, and falls, while avoiding interventions with limited or harmful benefit profiles; throughout, avoid cervical manipulation and maintain a high index of suspicion for progression [^115GCexN] [^1161pkAJ] [^11479iko].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The evidence base for non-surgical care in DCM remains limited and heterogeneous, with ongoing debates about optimal timing of surgery in mild disease and the potential role of neuroprotective or regenerative strategies; emerging imaging and electrophysiological biomarkers may refine risk stratification, and future trials comparing structured rehabilitation alone versus surgery are needed to clarify the non-surgical niche [^1161pkAJ] [^114mGYrE] [^1116jymP].

Non-surgical management of chronic myelopathy centers on **structured rehabilitation** [^1156XKun] with physical and occupational therapy to preserve function and reduce disability, and **symptom control** with NSAIDs, neuropathic agents, and short-term opioids for refractory pain [^1138nFAS]. Cervical collars are used short term for **pain or instability**, and epidural steroids may offer transient relief in select cases [^11479iko]. Close monitoring is essential [^115GCexN], with **regular neurological assessments** and MRI if deterioration is suspected; surgery is indicated for progression or moderate-to-severe deficits [^1161pkAJ]. Non-surgical care is best for mild, stable cases [^115GCexN], with **counseling on risks** and a low threshold to escalate care if worsening occurs [^112TSoxC].

## Non-surgical treatment options

### Pharmacological management

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: First-line for pain and inflammation; monitor GI, CV, and renal risks [^114TfHrp].

- **Neuropathic pain agents**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine for neuropathic pain; start low, titrate to effect, monitor sedation and dizziness.

- **Muscle relaxants**: Baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity; monitor sedation and withdrawal risk.

- **Opioids**: Short-term, low-dose for refractory pain after other options fail; use with caution due to addiction and respiratory risks [^notfound].

---

### Physical therapy and rehabilitation

- **Physical therapy**: Core of non-surgical care; emphasizes strength, flexibility, balance, and gait training to maintain function and reduce disability [^notfound].

- **Occupational therapy**: Adaptive strategies, assistive devices, and ergonomic training to preserve independence.

- **Cervical collars**: Short-term use for pain or instability; avoid prolonged use to prevent muscle deconditioning [^notfound].

---

### Interventional procedures

Interventional options include **epidural steroid injections**, which may provide short-term relief in select patients but offer limited evidence and should be used cautiously [^115oHuZg]. Spinal cord stimulation is **not standard for myelopathy** and is reserved for refractory pain syndromes after multidisciplinary care [^1134RhY5].

---

### Lifestyle modifications and patient education

Lifestyle measures include **weight management** to reduce mechanical spinal load and regular, low-impact aerobic exercise to improve function and quality of life. Patient education should cover the natural history of myelopathy, red flags for progression, and when to seek urgent care [^115GCexN].

---

## Evidence supporting non-surgical management

Evidence for non-surgical care is **limited and largely observational** [^116qqVM9]. Mild DCM may remain stable in many patients, but 13–20% deteriorate over 1–3 years, and non-surgical care does not reverse established deficits [^114PfeNe] [^112TSoxC]. Accordingly, non-surgical management is reasonable for mild, stable disease with close monitoring, while surgery is recommended for moderate-to-severe or progressive cases [^115GCexN] [^1161pkAJ].

---

## Risks and limitations

Non-surgical care carries risks of **neurological deterioration** — including permanent deficits — if disease progresses unchecked [^112TSoxC]. Prolonged collar use can cause muscle deconditioning, and medications may cause adverse effects such as GI bleeding, sedation, or dependence. Limited evidence means outcomes are uncertain and require careful patient selection and counseling [^116qqVM9].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up should include **neurological examinations** and patient-reported outcomes to detect deterioration early [^notfound]. MRI is indicated for new or worsening symptoms to reassess cord compression. Shared decision-making should incorporate patient preferences, comorbidities, and goals, with a low threshold to escalate care if progression occurs [^1156XKun].

---

Non-surgical management of chronic myelopathy is appropriate for mild, stable cases and focuses on **rehabilitation, symptom control, and close monitoring** [^115GCexN]. Surgery remains the definitive treatment for moderate-to-severe or progressive disease, and patients should be counseled on the risks and benefits of each approach [^1161pkAJ].

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy-update and future directions [^1161pkAJ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the ageing population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability. Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM, including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this Review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^111LCWJS]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ACOEM Low Back Disorders guideline — scope, evidence base, and grading for non-invasive/minimally invasive management — summarizes guidance for working-age adults and defines clinical timeframes as acute (up to 1 month duration), subacute (1 to 3 months' duration), and chronic (more than 3 months' duration), while excluding congenital disorders, malignancies, and specific intra-operative procedures. The evidence base identified 70 high-quality and 564 moderate-quality articles and produced 121 specific recommendations. Searches screened 1,134,216 articles, of which 1093 articles/abstracts were reviewed, yielding inclusion of 775 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 42 systematic reviews addressing non-invasive treatment. Recommendations were graded from (A) to (C) with expert consensus used for insufficient evidence (I). The guideline achieved 100% Panel agreement for all developed guidance in this article except systemic glucocorticosteroids for radicular pain and is planned for comprehensive updates at least every 5 years.

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy Spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression. With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### Nonoperative management of cervical myelopathy: a systematic review [^116qqVM9]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review investigating the evidence of (1) efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of nonoperative treatment of patients with cervical myelopathy; (2) whether the severity of myelopathy affects outcomes of nonoperative treatment; and (3) whether specific activities or minor injuries are associated with neurological deterioration in patients with myelopathy or asymptomatic stenosis being treated nonoperatively.

Summary Of Background Data

Little is known about the appropriate role of nonoperative treatment in the management of cervical myelopathy, which is typically considered a surgical disorder.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library for articles published between January 1, 1956, and November 20, 2012. We included all articles that compared nonoperative treatments or observation with surgery for patients with cervical myelopathy or asymptomatic cervical cord compression to determine their effects on clinical outcomes, including myelopathy scales (Japanese Orthopaedic Association, Nurick), general health scores (36-Item Short Form Health Survey), and pain (neck and arm). Nonoperative treatments included physical therapy, medications, injections, orthoses, and traction. We also searched for articles evaluating the effect of specific activities or minor trauma in neurological outcomes. Case reports and studies with less than 10 patients in the exposure group were excluded.

Results

Of 54 citations identified from our search, 5 studies reported in 6 articles met inclusion criteria. In 1 randomized controlled study, there was low evidence that nonoperative treatment may yield equivalent or better outcomes than surgery in those with mild myelopathy. For moderate to severe myelopathy, nonoperative treatment had inferior outcomes versus surgery in 2 cohort studies, despite the fact that surgically treated patients were worse at baseline. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether specific activities or minor trauma is a risk factor for neurological deterioration in those with myelopathy or asymptomatic cord compression.

Conclusion

There is a paucity of evidence for nonoperative treatment of cervical myelopathy, and further studies are needed to determine its role more definitively. In particular, for the patient with milder degrees of myelopathy, randomized studies comparing nonoperative with surgical treatment would be particularly helpful, as would trials comparing specific types of nonoperative treatments with the natural history of myelopathy. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation 1

Because myelopathy is known to be a typically progressive disorder and there is little evidence that nonoperative treatment halts or reverses its progression, we recommend not routinely prescribing nonoperative treatment as the primary modality in patients with moderate to severe myelopathy.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong.

Recommendation 2

If there is a role for nonoperative treatment as a primary treatment modality, it may be in the patient with mild myelopathy. However, it is not clear which specific forms of nonoperative treatment provide any benefit compared with the natural history. If nonoperative treatment is selected, we suggest care be taken to observe for neurological deterioration.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak.

Recommendation 3

In those with asymptomatic spondylotic cord compression but no clinical myelopathy, the available literature neither supports nor refutes the notion that minor trauma is a risk factor for neurological deterioration. We suggest that patients should be counseled about this uncertainty.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak. Recommendation 4: In those with a clinical diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy but no ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the available studies did not specifically address the issue of neurological deterioration secondary to minor trauma. However, in those with underlying ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, trauma may be more likely to cause worsening of existing myelopathy or even initiate symptoms in those who were previously asymptomatic. We suggest that patients should be counseled about these possibilities.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^115cU6Rh]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Rationale and importance — updating comprehensive evidence‑based guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain is based on escalating prevalence, health care costs, and the various procedures performed to manage chronic spinal pain and its impact on society, with IPM as an emerging specialty growing significantly. Many causes of spinal pain and other chronic conditions are described as recurrent with flare‑ups or as chronic diseases requiring long‑term treatment, and the importance of spinal interventional techniques is stated to be established based on advances in imaging, neuroanatomic findings, development of precision diagnostic and therapeutic injection techniques, and reported non‑operative treatment successes; numerous publications exist, but quality issues including conflicts of interest and inclusion or exclusion of significant literature have been noted.

### Analgesic effects of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised trials [^117WWSnr]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for adults with low back pain compared with placebo.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating non-surgical and non-interventional treatments compared with placebo or sham in adults (≥ 18 years) reporting non-specific low back pain.

Information Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to 14 April 2023.

Risk Of Bias

Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the 0 to 10 PEDro Scale.

Synthesis Of Results

Random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals on outcome pain intensity (0 to 100 scale) at first assessment post-treatment for each treatment type and by duration of low back pain-(sub)acute (< 12 weeks) and chronic (≥ 12 weeks). Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment (GRADE) approach.

Results

A total of 301 trials (377 comparisons) provided data on 56 different treatments or treatment combinations. One treatment for acute low back pain (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), and five treatments for chronic low back pain (exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) agonists) were efficacious; effect sizes were small and of moderate certainty. Three treatments for acute low back pain (exercise, glucocorticoid injections, paracetamol), and two treatments for chronic low back pain (antibiotics, anaesthetics) were not efficacious and are unlikely to be suitable treatment options; moderate certainty evidence. Evidence is inconclusive for remaining treatments due to small samples, imprecision, or low and very low certainty evidence.

Conclusions

The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo. The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain due to the limited number of randomised participants and poor study quality. Further high-quality, placebo-controlled trials are warranted to address the remaining uncertainty in treatment efficacy along with greater consideration for placebo-control design of non-surgical and non-interventional treatments.

Chronic thoracic pain — management for non-responsive cases states that patients non-responsive to facet joint and epidural interventions in the thoracic spine, in rare instances, may be considered for disc decompression or intrathecal implantables with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or intrathecal infusion systems; however, there is no evidence available for any of these modalities, so management is based on physician experience and patients' values and beliefs.

Indications and medical necessity for spinal interventional techniques — medical necessity must be established for each and every procedure and encounter, with documentation including complete initial evaluation including history and physical examination, physiological and functional assessment, as necessary and feasible, and a definition of indications and medical necessity that includes suspected organic problem, non-responsiveness to conservative modalities of treatment, pain and disability of moderate-to-severe degree, no evidence of contraindications such as severe spinal stenosis resulting in intraspinal obstruction, infection, or predominantly psychogenic pain, responsiveness to prior interventions with improvement in physical and functional status for repeat blocks or other interventions, and repeating interventions only upon return of pain and deterioration in functional status.

Cervical spinal stenosis — epidemiology and imaging reliability note that cervical spinal stenosis is a common disease that results in considerable morbidity and disability, and tandem spinal stenosis accounts for between 5% and 25% of all cases of stenosis. Cervical spinal stenosis has been detected in 26% of older asymptomatic individuals. For the past 4 decades, attempts to correlate clinical symptoms with the degree of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not yielded a validated methodology; however, measurements of maximum canal compromise, maximum spinal cord compression, and compression ratio were reported as reliable and correlated well with the clinical severity of cervical myelopathy.

### The role of comprehensive rehabilitation in the care of degenerative cervical myelopathy [^1116jymP]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitation of the study

A limitation of the present study is the lack of patients who received only surgical or only non-surgical treatment in the study sample. Our analyses circumvented this consequence of the prevailing approach to treating DCM.

Future research

To support our findings and their generalizability to all individuals with DCM, we recommend performing a study comparing patient groups after comprehensive rehabilitation alone and after surgery alone. To enable such a comparison, however, the guidelines for DCM care should be modified, as suggested in this article, at least for participants of the comparative study.

### Low back pain (chronic) [^112ph5E8]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over 70% of people in developed countries develop low back pain (LBP) at some time. But recovery is not always favourable: 82% of non recent-onset patients still experience pain 1 year later. Many patients with chronic LBP who were initially told that their natural history was good spend months or years seeking relief.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of oral drug treatments? What are the effects of injection therapy? What are the effects of non-drug treatments? What are the effects of non-surgical and surgical treatments? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 64 systematic reviews or RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, analgesics, antidepressants, back schools, behavioural therapy, electromyographic biofeedback, exercise, injections (epidural corticosteroid injections, facet joint injections, local injections), intensive multidisciplinary treatment programmes, lumbar supports, massage, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-surgical interventional therapies (intradiscal electrothermal therapy, radiofrequency denervation), spinal manipulative therapy, surgery, traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

Chronic spinal pain interventional techniques — evidence distribution shows that of the 8 diagnostic techniques assessed, good evidence is available for only 4 or 50% of diagnostic interventions, with fair evidence for one intervention and limited evidence for the remaining 3 interventions. Of the 42 therapeutic interventions assessed, good evidence is available for 17 or 40% of interventions, with the remaining 20 interventions showing fair evidence, and/or poor evidence. Overall, good to fair evidence is available for only half of the therapeutic interventions and 62% of the diagnostic interventions assessed.

### Commonly used interventional procedures for non-cancer chronic spine pain: a clinical practice guideline [^11479iko]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the comparative effectiveness and safety of commonly used interventional procedures (such as spinal injections and ablation procedures) for chronic axial and radicular spine pain that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy?

Current Practice

Chronic spine pain is a common, potentially disabling complaint, for which clinicians often administer interventional procedures. However, clinical practice guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations for their use.

Recommendations

For people living with chronic axial spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: joint radiofrequency ablation with or without joint targeted injection of local anaesthetic plus steroid; epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; joint-targeted injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; and intramuscular injection of local anaesthetic with or without steroids. For people living with chronic radicular spine pain (≥ 3 months), the guideline panel issued strong recommendations against: dorsal root ganglion radiofrequency with or without epidural injection of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic plus steroids; and epidural injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international guideline development panel including four people living with chronic spine pain, 10 clinicians with experience managing chronic spine pain, and eight methodologists, produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provided methodological support. The guideline panel applied an individual patient perspective when formulating recommendations.

The Evidence

These recommendations are informed by a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials and a systematic review of observational studies, summarising the current body of evidence for benefits and harms of common interventional procedures for axial and radicular, chronic, non-cancer spine pain. Specifically, injection of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination into the cervical or lumbar facet joint or sacroiliac joint; epidural injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination; radiofrequency of dorsal root ganglion; radiofrequency denervation of cervical or lumbar facet joints or the sacroiliac joint; and paravertebral intramuscular injections of local anaesthetic, steroids, or their combination.

Understanding The Recommendations

These recommendations apply to people living with chronic spine pain (≥ 3 months duration) that is not associated with cancer or inflammatory arthropathy and do not apply to the management of acute spine pain. Further research is warranted and may alter recommendations in the future: in particular, whether there are differences in treatment effects based on subtypes of chronic spine pain, establishing the effectiveness of interventional procedures currently supported by low or very low certainty evidence, and effects on poorly reported patient-important outcomes (such as opioid use, return to work, and sleep quality).

Prospective studies comparing the efficacy of surgical versus medical management are lacking. The indications and efficacy of pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments are reviewed. The use of anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, steroids, facet joint ablation, and physical therapy are reviewed. A rationale for the medical management of acute neck pain, chronic neck pain, radiculopathy, and myelopathy is presented.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^112sMBV8]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid guidelines — multimodal and multidisciplinary management is outlined with supporting evidence and CDC guidance. A randomized controlled trial of 521 patients with chronic low back pain showed that multi‑modal non‑pharmacological interventions (including cognitive therapy, mindfulness‑based stress reduction, and behavior therapy) produced reductions in pain and improvements in physical function, mood, and sleep disturbance. CDC guidelines support that multimodal therapies and multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation can reduce long‑term pain and disability, and they state that medications should ideally be combined with non‑pharmacologic therapies to enhance pain and function outcomes. CDC guidance also notes that less intense multidisciplinary rehabilitation can be as similarly effective as high intensity, and to consider combination of medications (such as 2 non‑opioid medications with different mechanisms of action or a non‑opioid with an opioid) as part of multidisciplinary management. Although short and intermediate outcomes have been indicative of clinical effectiveness, present evidence of long‑term efficacy of multidisciplinary pain care is limited, with a review reporting insufficient evidence for lumbar radiculopathy and a Cochrane review finding similar pain, disability, and work outcomes at 2-years between surgery and multi‑ or interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation.

Application — these interventional techniques guidelines are intended for interventional pain physicians and emphasize individualized care; it is stated that a provider should establish a plan of care on a case-by-case basis and that treatment different from that outlined could be warranted, so these guidelines do not represent a "standard of care". The goal is to provide patients, practitioners, regulators, and payers information to determine whether evidence supports a "standard" for interventional techniques, where "Standard" refers to what is applicable to the majority of patients with a preference for patient convenience and ease of administration without compromising treatment efficacy or morbidity, and it is essential to recognize the difference between "standard" and "standard of care".

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part I: introduction and general considerations [^113moCN7]. Pain Physician (2013). Low credibility.

In 2011, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) re-engineered its definition of clinical guidelines as follows: "clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefit and harms of alternative care options". This new definition departs from a 2-decade old definition from a 1990 IOM report that defined guidelines as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances". The revised definition clearly distinguishes between the term "clinical practice guideline" and other forms of clinical guidance derived from widely disparate development processes, such as consensus statements, expert advice, and appropriate use criteria. The IOM committee acknowledged that for many clinical domains, high quality evidence was lacking or even nonexistent. Even though the guidelines are important decision-making tools, along with expert clinical judgment and patient preference, their value and impact remains variable due to numerous factors. Some of the many factors that impede the development of clinical practice guidelines include bias due to a variety of conflicts of interest, inappropriate and poor methodological quality, poor writing and ambiguous presentation, projecting a view that these are not applicable to individual patients or too restrictive with elimination of clinician autonomy, and overzealous and inappropriate recommendations, either positive, negative, or non-committal. Consequently, a knowledgeable, multidisciplinary panel of experts must develop guidelines based on a systematic review of the existing evidence, as recently recommended by the IOM. Chronic pain is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon associated with significant economic, social, and health outcomes. Interventional pain management is an emerging specialty facing a disproportionate number of challenges compared to established medical specialties, including the inappropriate utilization of ineffective and unsafe techniques. In 2000, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) created treatment guidelines to help practitioners. There have been 5 subsequent updates. These guidelines address the issues of systematic evaluation and ongoing care of chronic or persistent pain, and provide information about the scientific basis of recommended procedures. These guidelines are expected to increase patient compliance; dispel misconceptions among providers and patients, manage patient expectations reasonably; and form the basis of a therapeutic partnership between the patient, the provider, and payers.

### The global spine care initiative: a summary of guidelines on invasive interventions for the management of persistent and disabling spinal pain in low-and middle-income communities [^115oHuZg]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to synthesize recommendations on the use of common elective surgical and interventional procedures for individuals with persistent and disabling non-radicular/axial with or without myelopathy, radicular back pain, cervical myelopathy, symptomatic spinal stenosis, and fractures due to osteoporosis. This review was to inform a clinical care pathway on the patient presentations where surgical interventions could reasonably be considered.

Methods

We synthesized recommendations from six evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and one appropriate use criteria guidance for the surgical and interventional management of persistent and disabling spine pain.

Results

Lower priority surgery/conditions include fusion for lumbar/non-radicular neck pain and higher priority surgery/conditions include discectomy/decompressive surgery for cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, cervical myelopathy, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Epidural steroid injections are less expensive than most surgeries with fewer harms; however, benefits are small and short lived. Vertebroplasty should be considered over kyphoplasty as an option for patients with severe pain and disability due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.

Conclusion

Elective surgery and interventional procedures could be limited in medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries due to a lack of resources and surgeons and thus surgical and interventional procedures should be prioritized within these settings. There are non-invasive alternatives that produce similar outcomes and are a recommended option where surgical procedures are not available.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^114mGYrE]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition, and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (ie, cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (eg, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [HLF]). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 yr old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these people become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 yr or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed by and large from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a large number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptomology. The latest clinical guidelines recommend surgery for patients with moderate and severe DCM, and nonoperative treatment with serial clinical follow-up for asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of cervical spinal cord compression. For patients with mild DCM, the guidelines suggest that either surgery or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation is reasonable initial management strategy; the less definitive nature of this suggestion likely reflects the paucity of clinical evidence surrounding the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild DCM. These patients present a conundrum to the surgeon. On one hand, if the disease is only causing mild symptoms, the risk-benefit scale may tip in favor of risk, with a lot to be lost, and little to be gained. The contrary view is that these patients stand to gain the most from intervention by halting progression of potentially irreversible neurological deficits early on in the course of the pathological process. Moreover, even "mild" DCM may be associated with a derangement in quality of life that patients consider unacceptable, and can perhaps be helped with operative intervention. To this end, the objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to evaluate quality of life in mild DCM compared to population norms and (2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with mild DCM following surgical intervention. We hypothesized that (1) patients would have significant derangement in quality of life, despite having what is considered only "mild" DCM and (2) surgery in these patients would halt progression of symptoms, and in fact lead to improved functional status and quality of life.

Over the years, some authors have recommended one injection for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes; others have preached 3 injections in a series irrespective of a patient's progress or lack thereof; others suggest 3 injections followed by a repeat course of 3 injections after 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals; and some propose an unlimited number of injections. Dose caps such as a limitation of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid or 210 mg per year in an average person and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid also have been advocated; however, with no scientific basis.

### An evidence-based consensus for the use of neurostimulation for the treatment of non-surgical low back pain: the NEURON group [^115H6GvD]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Taking this into consideration, NSLBP is a prevalent condition that is not limited to any specific demographic. It is associated with age, with the highest incidence in the third decade of life and increasing prevalence with age up to 60 to 85 years old.LBP is expected to rise in prevalence and incidence due to increasing sedentary behaviors and an aging population.

Despite many therapeutic advances for this common and life altering condition, there are still controversies that exist, and many questions arise in the field that merit being addressed in guidelines.
Is the use of neuromodulation an appropriate therapy for both mechanical/nociceptive and neuropathic pain, or is it more specific to pain of neuropathic origin?
Is the degree of spinal stenosis well defined in NSLBP? Should we implant those with severe spinal stenosis that is not correctable?
Do we need thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as surgical staging in all patients or only those scheduled for paddles in pre-surgical work-up?
What level of non-surgical scoliosis is appropriate for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in NSLBP or is this a medical judgement decision?

The objective of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) NEURON (neuroscience, education, utilization, risk mitigation, optimal outcomes, and neuromodulation) project for the treatment of NSLBP with neuromodulation is to provide evidence-based recommendations to address the appropriate utilization of this therapy in a group of patients who previously were treated on a case-by-case basis with no guidance. This guidance comes at a time of new peer-reviewed literature analyzed in this publication.

This guideline is intended to represent a comprehensive review of the neuromodulation options for those suffering from CLBP with NSLBP and offer recommendation based on the level of evidence and consensus. As this is a living document, this ASPN NEURON project is intended to be updated periodically to maintain relevance with the current treatment landscape and literature. The ASPN NEURON guidance does not necessarily represent a standard of care, but an expert driven assimilation of evidence to help develop patient centric treatment approaches and does not replace treatment based on an individual patient's need and the physician's professional judgement and experience. Further, this guideline is not intended to be used as the sole reason for denial or approval of treatment or services. See Table 1.

### Management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy with insights from metabolic imaging of the spinal cord and brain [^112F9sgW]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a potentially debilitating disorder primarily related to spinal cord injury caused by degenerative changes of the spine. As the population continues to age and live longer, it is likely that this disorder will be encountered with increasing frequency.

Recent Findings

Surgical management continues to be a mainstay of treatment of CSM patients, but some studies have indicated that nonoperative treatment may be equivalent to surgical management in some patients. Recent advances in neuroimaging of the spinal cord and brain have provided novel information regarding the pathogenesis of CSM, as well as compensatory mechanisms to preserve neurological function.

Summary

CSM is a complex disorder whose incidence is likely to increase in coming years. Prospective, randomized studies are required to help establish the optimal treatment paradigm. Recent advances such as novel neuroimaging techniques and the continued development of neural repair strategies to treat the secondary biological injury associated with this disorder are likely to play key roles in the future management of CSM.

### Multimodal non-invasive non-pharmacological therapies for chronic pain: mechanisms and progress [^1136ksnu]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain conditions impose significant burdens worldwide. Pharmacological treatments like opioids have limitations. Non-invasive non-pharmacological therapies (NINPT) encompass diverse interventions including physical, psychological, complementary and alternative approaches, and other innovative techniques that provide analgesic options for chronic pain without medications.

Main Body

This review elucidates the mechanisms of major NINPT modalities and synthesizes evidence for their clinical potential across chronic pain populations. NINPT leverages peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal mechanisms to restore normal pain processing and limit central sensitization. However, heterogeneity in treatment protocols and individual responses warrants optimization through precision medicine approaches.

Conclusion

Future adoption of NINPT requires addressing limitations in standardization and accessibility as well as synergistic combination with emerging therapies. Overall, this review highlights the promise of NINPT as a valuable complementary option ready for integration into contemporary pain medicine paradigms to improve patient care and outcomes.

### Spinal cord stimulation plus conventional medical management versus conventional medical management alone for severe, non-surgical, refractory back pain: a randomized clinical trial followed by crossover [^1117rQpx]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic low back pain is a major contributor to long-term disability. Many patients lack a clearly identifiable source for their pain on physical examination or imaging or present with multiple pain generators. This subset of patients, who do not have surgical pathology, relies on conservative medical management (CMM) in the absence of effective and lasting treatment alternatives. For those who fail to respond to CMM, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) should be considered as an effective adjunctive therapy for improving pain, disability and health-related quality of life.

Methods

SOLIS is a prospective, multicenter trial that randomized patients with non-surgical, refractory back pain (with or without leg pain) to receive either SCS combined with CMM or CMM alone. The primary endpoint at 3months compared the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% overall pain relief without an increase in mean daily opioid use between the SCS+CMMand CMM groups. Three months after treatment activation, patients initially randomized to receive CMM alone had the option to cross over and add SCS to their pain management regimen. Patients in both randomized groups underwent 12-month follow-up visits to assess long-term effects on pain relief, disability, health-related quality of life, global impression of change, and treatment satisfaction.

Results

147 patients were randomized to SCS+CMM (n = 79) or CMM alone (n = 68). At the 3-month follow-up, 89.5% of patients who received SCS+CMM (including subperception and paresthesia-based programming modalities) and 8.1% who received CMM alone were classified as study responders (≥ 50%pain relief without an increase in mean daily opioid use; modified intention-to-treat analysis, p < 0.0001). The level of disability due to low back pain improved significantly: the Oswestry Disability Index score decreased by -27.5 ± 15.9 points in the SCS+CMM group versus -7.2 ± 9.9 points in the CMM alone group (p < 0.0001). Health-related quality of life also improved at 3 months: the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level questionnaire index score increased by 0.247 ± 0.164 points in the SCS+CMM group versus 0.031 ± 0.151 points in the CMM alone group (p < 0.0001). The benefits of SCS were sustained until the 12-month visit. Seven patients experienced serious adverse events related to SCS, including 5 (3.6%) implant site infections resulting in explant.

Conclusion

SCS relieved pain and resulted in clinically significant improvements in functional disability and health-related quality of life in patients with non-surgical, refractory back pain with or without accompanying leg pain.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis [^115RgXi6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a debilitating condition associated with degeneration of the spine with aging.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different types of surgery compared with different types of non-surgical interventions in adults with symptomatic LSS. Primary outcomes included quality of life, disability, function and pain. Also, to consider complication rates and side effects, and to evaluate short-, intermediate- and long-term outcomes (six months, six months to two years, five years or longer).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registries up to February 2015. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings related to treatment of the spine.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical versus non-operative treatments in participants with lumbar spinal stenosis confirmed by clinical and imaging findings.

Data Collection and Analysis

For data collection and analysis, we followed methods guidelines of the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009) and those provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

Main Results

From the 12,966 citations screened, we assessed 26 full-text articles and included five RCTs (643 participants). Low-quality evidence from the meta-analysis performed on two trials using the Oswestry Disability Index (pain-related disability) to compare direct decompression with or without fusion versus multi-modal non-operative care showed no significant differences at six months (mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.12 to 2.80) and at one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to 2.66). At 24 months, significant differences favoured decompression (MD -4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96). Low-quality evidence from one small study revealed no difference in pain outcomes between decompression and usual conservative care (bracing and exercise) at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.59), four years (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.00 to 56.48) and 10 years (RR 4.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 17.58). Low-quality evidence from one small study suggested no differences at six weeks in the Oswestry Disability Index for patients treated with minimally invasive mild decompression versus those treated with epidural steroid injections (MD 5.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.83; 38 participants). Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) results were better for epidural injection at six weeks (MD -0.60, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.28), and visual analogue scale (VAS) improvements were better in the mild decompression group (MD 2.40, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.88). At 12 weeks, many cross-overs prevented further analysis. Low-quality evidence from a single study including 191 participants favoured the interspinous spacer versus usual conservative treatment at six weeks, six months and one year for symptom severity and physical function. All remaining studies reported complications associated with surgery and conservative side effects of treatment: Two studies reported no major complications in the surgical group, and the other study reported complications in 10% and 24% of participants, including spinous process fracture, coronary ischaemia, respiratory distress, haematoma, stroke, risk of reoperation and death due to pulmonary oedema.

Authors' Conclusions

We have very little confidence to conclude whether surgical treatment or a conservative approach is better for lumbar spinal stenosis, and we can provide no new recommendations to guide clinical practice. However, it should be noted that the rate of side effects ranged from 10% to 24% in surgical cases, and no side effects were reported for any conservative treatment. No clear benefits were observed with surgery versus non-surgical treatment. These findings suggest that clinicians should be very careful in informing patients about possible treatment options, especially given that conservative treatment options have resulted in no reported side effects. High-quality research is needed to compare surgical versus conservative care for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria myelopathy [^11489VtU]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with myelopathic symptoms may have a number of causative intradural and extradural etiologies, including disc degenerative diseases, spinal masses, infectious or inflammatory processes, vascular compromise, and vertebral fracture. Patients may present acutely or insidiously and may progress toward long-term paralysis if not treated promptly and effectively. Noncontrast CT is the most appropriate first examination in acute trauma cases to diagnose vertebral fracture as the cause of acute myelopathy. In most nontraumatic cases, MRI is the modality of choice to evaluate the location, severity, and causative etiology of spinal cord myelopathy, and predicts which patients may benefit from surgery. Myelopathy from spinal stenosis and spinal osteoarthritis is best confirmed without MRI intravenous contrast. Many other myelopathic conditions are more easily visualized after contrast administration. Imaging performed should be limited to the appropriate spinal levels, based on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^116GVSes]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future work

The survey was principally disseminated by two global spinal organisations; AO Spine and CSRS and it is noted that some groups may have been underrepresented. For example, Asia contributed 29% of responses, and Africa only 3%. Further the survey used a clinician's recollection of practice, making it vulnerable to recall bias. The overall large sample size, and the broad heterogeneity, with absence of trends event amongst subgroups, suggest this has not limited the findings.

The most pressing future work is to generate robust guidelines for non-operative patients.

This would benefit from a more detailed characterisation of DCM natural history, including the identification of any predictors of deterioration. Standardised patient follow-up is necessary to perform this analysis. A combination of clinician education and practical decision support tools may form first steps to ensure that this is conducted, using expect opinion to bridge known evidence gaps.

### An evidence-based consensus for the use of neurostimulation for the treatment of non-surgical low back pain: the NEURON group [^116sz8Yt]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Race/ethnicity: In the Medicare population, significant racial disparities were evident in the rates of SCS trials and placements. Caucasians led with the highest rates, with SCS trials increasing from 32 per 100,000 in 2009 to 72 in 2018, and placements from 19 per 100,000 to 47 in the same period. African Americans showed more moderate increases, with trials going from 21 to 35 per 100,000 and placements from 13 to 20 per 100,000. Other racial groups experienced the most substantial relative increase in placements, from 3 per 100,000 in 2009 to 10 in 2018, a 211% rise, compared to a 143% increase for Caucasians and 54% for African Americans.

Body mass index (BMI): As obesity rates rise, more obese patients are receiving SCS implants without a corresponding increase in hospitalization costs compared to their non-obese counterparts. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of 30-day readmission and mechanical complications following SCS implantation. For each increment in BMI, SCS effectiveness decreases by 2% vs 20% for underweight and/or normal patients (≤ 24.9), though pain scores improved at 6–12 months in both groups, respectively. Individuals having a BMI ≥ 36.5 kg/m² experienced less improvement at 6–12 months. Nevertheless, patients with a BMI of 40 or higher exhibit a mere 5.48% complication rate and a significant trial success rate of 93.3%, which is considerably higher than the 74.4% observed in those with a lower BMI.

Pregnancy: The published literature surrounding spinal cord stimulation and pregnancy is primarily presented in case reports and small retrospective case series. The majority of the patients did not experience any complications, however complications of intrauterine growth retardation, hypertension, and abortion were reported in singular case reports. Causality is not noted and may be unrelated, but additional study is indicated.

History of chronic bleeding disorders: As spinal cord stimulation has expanded in use, the management of complex medical comorbidities has become more common as well. This includes chronic bleeding disorders. These disorders differ extensively from the management of anticoagulation medications, as the risk for these patients extends beyond the perioperative time frame when anticoagulation medications have specific discontinuation and restart time periods. In patients with chronic bleeding disorders, the risk of bleeding is ever-present, and given the permanent implantation of spinal cord stimulation hardware, the pain physician must be ready to identify and co-manage bleeding complications.

### Treatment of chronic low back pain-new approaches on the horizon [^111FdEK3]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment

Given that many people with intervertebral lumbar disc herniation have a high likelihood of recovery spontaneously without surgical interventions, and the fact that some people are not good surgical candidates, there are many other methods that are used to manage pain from this condition. The areas of treatment can be divided into conservative management and invasive treatments. When starting conservative management, most people begin with a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Pharmacological interventions include acetaminophen, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, tramadol, corticosteroids, and even short courses of opioids for moderate-to-severe pain, in accordance with the World Health Organization's stepladder approach to managing chronic pain. Pharmacological strategies are mainly aimed at symptom control until pain abates. Non-pharmacological strategies include physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, or therapies such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation. The majority of people improve with conservative treatments exclusively or in conjunction with a multimodal analgesic regimen as mentioned previously.,

If conservative treatment does not provide symptom relief, more invasive treatments are generally considered. Epidural glucocorticoid injections have long been touted as the first step in invasive interventional management of symptomatic intervertebral herniated discs. Whether by a lumbar interlaminar, caudal, or transforaminal approach, epidural injections have been shown to reduce pain scores and disability mainly in the short term (usually at 2 weeks) as well as delay the need for surgical intervention for as long as 13–28 months. Patients may experience relief for a period of time but may require additional repeat injections following pain recurrence. Whereas the efficacy of steroids in epidural injections is controversial, a meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials of epidural injections for the treatment of radicular low back pain confirmed that epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroids resulted in significant improvement in pain and functionality, as well as decreased opioid consumption. However, epidural injections have not been shown to decrease the need for eventual subsequent surgery in patients with chronic pain secondary to herniated intervertebral disc. Are there any other treatment options for patients who fail both conservative and interventional procedures before undergoing surgical procedures (discectomy, disc arthroplasty, spinal fusion, etc.) in the management of symptomatic lumbar radicular low back pain (Figure 3)?

### Rehabilitation for degenerative cervical myelopathy: systematic review and scoping review of UK patient information [^112VEYCF]. Spinal Cord (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

While rehabilitation is a gold-standard in spinal cord injury care, the PID review indicates it is considered optional for DCM. This is likely due to a limited (or non-existent with respect to prehabilitation) evidence-base. Although currently based on low-quality evidence, post-operative rehabilitation following DCM surgery appears to show potential across a range of outcome domains such as function, pain and quality of life. Finding ways to enhance the benefits of surgery and reducing long-term disability and healthcare costs are global priorities. Robust clinical trials are imperative to establish effective rehabilitation strategies for DCM.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^111wxtCB]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial — conclusions and implementation guidance — emphasizes that patient selection for SCS therapy is crucial and has traditionally included a screening trial, but that this continues to be a challenge; these multisociety guidelines on various aspects of patient selection and the role and conduct of a trial are an evidence-based consensus framework. The document notes that these recommendations can guide practicing physicians and multiple stakeholders to facilitate a more uniform and consistent practice, while emphasizing that these should not be mistaken as practice standards that need to be enforced and that physicians should continue to make their best judgment based on individual patient considerations, incorporating the best possible evidence and patient values and preferences.

### Cervical myelopathy: diagnosis, contemporary treatment, and outcomes [^112ChgZq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cervical myelopathy is a clinical syndrome caused by compression of the spinal cord between the levels of the C1 and T1 vertebrae. Its clinical presentation can mimic other degenerative and neurological pathologies, making diagnosis challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate imaging studies carefully correlated with history and physical examination. Treatment options are focused on decompression of the spinal canal from an anterior, posterior, or combined anterior and posterior surgical approach depending on the location of compression and patient factors. Outcomes are favorable if treatment is performed prior to severe symptom onset.

### Surgery for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy [^117QPG74]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk.

Objectives

To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed pending persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to 1998 for the original review. A revised search was run in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (January 1998 to June 2008) to update the review. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) "medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without fusion) plus medical management" 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery".

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Two trials (N = 149) were included. In both trials, allocation concealment was inadequate and arrangements for blinding of outcome assessment were unclear. One trial (81 patients with cervical radiculopathy) found that surgical decompression was superior to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in the short-term for pain, weakness or sensory loss; at one year, there were no significant differences between groups. One trial (68 patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy) found no significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in three years following treatment. A substantial proportion of cases were lost to follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Both small trials had significant risks of bias and do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. It is unclear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by long-term benefits. Further research is very likely to have an impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it. There is low quality evidence that surgery may provide pain relief faster than physiotherapy or hard collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy; but there is little or no difference in the long-term. There is very low quality evidence that patients with mild myelopathy feel subjectively better shortly after surgery, but there is little or no difference in the long-term.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^1155Jfwv]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background — spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established therapy for the treatment of chronic refractory pain; however, long-term challenges remain, with nearly 30%–40% patients reporting inadequate relief beyond 24–36 months. Utilization has expanded, with around 50,000 SCS devices implanted annually across the world and an estimated annual sales value at US$1.8 billion in 2018 projected to grow to US$3.5 billion by 2026. Patient selection for SCS needs to consider appropriate pain indication and patient determinants (psychological/smoking/opioid use), and SCS therapy is not effective in all patients and appropriate patient selection is critical.

### ABCs of the degenerative spine [^111j9pMj]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

Conservative treatment is considered a first-line treatment for the majority of patients with degenerative spine disease, unless the disease presents with acute neurological symptoms such as myelopathy or cauda equine syndrome. When medical therapy fails, imaging and spinal surgery are considered as the next step of management. Depending on the prevalent degenerative pattern, different surgical approaches can be utilised. Patients with symptomatic disc herniations can benefit from microdiscectomy. If a degenerative process results in destabilisation and abnormal spinal motion, different types of surgical fusion can be used to stabilise the spine. Interbody fusion implants are widely used to restore disc height and support the anterior column. Spondylotic changes usually do not require surgery (Fig. 24).

Fig. 24
Surgical treatment options for degenerative changes. (a) Herniations. Herniations are often associated with pain and neurological symptoms and most commonly occur on the lumbar spine. Treatment options include conservative treatment if the herniation does not compress the nerves and surgical removal of the herniation if neural compression exists. (b) Spondylosis. Chronic longstanding disc degeneration results in slowly progressive mild-to-moderate disc space narrowing and gradual osteophyte formation without apparent disc displacement. Spondylosis is considered an adaptive reaction to stabilise motion in the presence of instability or a compensatory mechanism to limit the range of motion and prevent further degeneration. Altered disc biomechanics and narrowed intervertebral disc space subsequently lead to facet joint degeneration. This is probably the most favourable type of degeneration as it is essentially asymptomatic, may be seen at all levels of the spine and typically does not require treatment. (c) Disc collapse. Disc collapse leads to annular folding, anterior bulging of the flaval ligaments and posterior bulging of the posterior longitudinal ligament, with consequential narrowing of the central spinal canal. The decreasing disc height of the involved spinal segment leads to increased stiffness and may cause vertical degeneration of the adjacent vertebral segments. (d) Progressive structural failure of the disc to maintain the integrity of the functional spinal unit leads to segmental instability. This may progress to degenerative spondylolysthesis and require spinal instrumentation

### Long-term follow-up of inpatients with cervical myelopathy who received integrative Korean medicine treatment: a retrospective analysis and questionnaire survey study [^113ck6ba]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

It is believed that the combined effects of the various treatments used in this study helped the recovery of nerve damage caused by CM, pain reduction, and functional recovery, but it is not possible to distinguish how much each effect contributed.

It is difficult to treat and follow-up patients with CM continuously at a hospital that primarily focuses on conservative treatment, because CM is generally accepted as an indication for surgery. However, we performed a retrospective analysis of multicenter inpatient data for CM and performed a long-term follow-up of the patients over the telephone. The mean time from discharge to follow-up was 983.5 ± 423.4 days. Our findings in relation to the long-term effects of the treatments is one of the notable aspects of this study. Furthermore, given that 20 of the 21 patients who participated in the follow-up survey stated that their symptoms had improved, the results are promising. Of these 21 patients, 15 patients were recommended to undergo surgery, but only six underwent the surgery, and only four patients were receiving treatment for persistent pain that lasted for more than 3 months, which is a relatively low number considering the severity of the disease and the likelihood of exacerbation. Compared with other studies, surgery for CM, such as laminectomy (which is the most common surgical treatment) reduced NRS of pain (−2.0), and in this study, non-surgical inpatient treatment resulted in a decrease in NRS (−1.65 at discharge; −2.92 at follow-up). Although there was no control group in our study design, compared to the previous study, KM treatment was considered to have an effect comparable to that of the existing surgical treatment.

This study had some limitations. Because CM is a not a common condition, with a prevalence of about 1.6 per 100,000 population, and as there are cases in which conservative treatment cannot be selected, because surgery is indicated for cases with rapid progression of the acute phase, oriental medicine is rarely chosen as treatment. For this reason, the sample size was small, and only half of these patients were enrolled in the long-term follow-up, for reasons such as changes in contact numbers. The small sample size posed limitations in terms of the statistical analysis. Another limitation of this study was that we could not pinpoint the specific treatment that primarily led to the improvement of symptoms, because an integrative treatment approach was applied. The possibility of spontaneous regression of the disease cannot be completely eliminated since the study design lacked a control group.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^112miofS]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Implantable intrathecal drug administration systems — use and evidence in chronic pain — Intrathecal infusion systems are most commonly used in the treatment of recalcitrant chronic cancer or non-malignant pain after all other methods have failed including conservative and surgical treatment. In updated practice guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Task Force on Chronic Pain Management and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA), intrathecal injection or infusion for neuropathic pain were shown to provide up to 12 months of pain relief. For chronic non-cancer pain, Patel et al reported limited evidence for long-term pain relief, with evidence limited based on 4 observational studies and their recommendation was strong for the use of intrathecal infusion systems for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain. An update by Falco et al utilized 7 non-randomized studies and provided limited evidence for the effectiveness of intrathecal infusion systems in managing chronic non-cancer pain. The page notes a paucity of literature with a lack of randomized trials for long-term management of chronic non-cancer pain, and states that all of them conclude that there is effective pain relief. Nobel et al included 16 studies with 2,801 patients, reporting 25% relief in 56.3% and 50% relief in 40.8% of patients, with a reoperation rate of 9% to 42%.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^115GCexN]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How is it managed?

Often cord compression is an incidental finding and at least initially does not cause symptoms. Reassure the patient that no further management is required at this stage but advise them to report any symptoms promptly in the future.

Guidelines from AOSpinean international community of spine surgeons advise that all patients with DCM should be assessed by a specialist surgeon, who might fall under the remit of neurosurgery or orthopaedics. The guidelines use the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, which classifies patients as having mild or severe symptoms based on arm, leg, and bladder function. Surgery is recommended in patients with moderate or severe DCM and in those with disease progression. Treatment of symptoms (for pain, for example) and regular follow-up might be offered for patients with mild, stable DCM.

The AOSpine series showed that decompressive surgery can halt disease progression and enable meaningful, albeit limited, recovery across a range of measures including pain, function, and quality of life. The optimal timing of surgery is debatable because the progression of disease is poorly understood. Preoperative physiotherapy should only be advised by specialist services; neck manipulation is strictly contraindicated as it might cause further damage.

It is not possible to predict the long term outcome of surgery. Maximal recovery occurs at around 6–12 months. Residual symptoms beyond this are likely to be permanent and should be managed appropriately. Functional deficits are common, and include falls and reduced mobility, incontinence, depression, sleep deficits, and struggles with self-care, and often the most troublesome symptom is pain. Discuss with your patient that complete resolution of pain is unlikely. Neuropathic analgesia and anti-spasticity medication can be offered to manage the pain. Early referral to specialist pain clinics is often helpful.

### Outcome of patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy treated nonoperatively: an observational study from the Canadian spine outcome and research network [^114PfeNe]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults. The natural history of mild DCM is not fully understood, and both operative and nonoperative strategies have been proposed as treatment modalities. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of patients with mild DCM treated nonoperatively and identify risk factors for neurological deterioration and conversion to surgery.

Methods

All patients with mild DCM (modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association [mJOA] score 15–17), enrolled between 2015 and 2023, who were initially treated nonoperatively, as part of an ongoing prospective, multicenter observational cohort study were included. Neurological function (mJOA), patient-reported outcomes (neck disability index, EuroQol-5D, short form-12, numeric rating scale [NRS]), and radiographic findings at enrollment and 1 year were assessed. Progression of disease was defined as neurological deterioration by ≥ 2 mJOA. Conversion to surgery was a secondary end point.

Results

One hundred forty patients with mild DCM were initially treated nonoperatively. The mean mJOA score was 16.8 ± 0.8, with no clinically significant change after 1 year (16.5 ± 1.3; p = 0.031). Improved EuroQol-5D, relief in the NRS arm, and neck pain below the minimal clinically important difference level were noted after 1 year. A drop of ≥ 2 mJOA points occurred in 13.3% (n = 14). Seventeen patients (12.1%) crossed over to surgical treatment at an average time of 3.4 years. Patients who crossed over had lower baseline mJOA scores (16.2 ± 1.0 vs 16.7 ± 0.9; p = 0.03), but otherwise comparable patient-reported outcomes at baseline (P > .05). Delayed surgery improved NRS neck pain (5.0 ± 3.1 vs 1.9 ± 1.4; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Neurological deterioration or the need for surgery is relatively uncommon in patients with conservatively treated mild DCM. A deterioration rate of 13.3% at 1 year and a conversion rate of 12.1% over 3.4 years with no clear risk factors were noted. Crossover patients presented with worse mJOA. No other clinically significant parameter was found to be a risk factor for neurological deterioration nor a driver for crossover.

### A review of spinal cord stimulation systems for chronic pain [^1134RhY5]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction to chronic pain

Chronic pain affects up to 20% of the population in developed nations.–This represents a profound impact on individuals and their families alongside the sizeable burden on employers, health care systems, and society in general. When chronic pain occurs, it has the potential to become disease itself, and subsequently, chronic pain has emerged as a distinct phenomenon.

Management of chronic pain varies greatly between nations and even within nations. Literature supports a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care, although various health care systems may not always support this concept consistently.

The current standard of care for chronic, noncancer pain typically includes many disciplines with the clinician developing an individualized treatment plan with the options of utilizing surgical interventions, pharmacology, and psychological and physical therapies. Opioid analgesics are often prescribed, despite the lack of clinical evidence supporting their long-term use in the management of chronic pain. However, for many patients, this multidisciplinary approach is inadequate or ineffectual or is accompanied by the burden of side effects that are unacceptable and debilitating. Only at this late stage, referral for advanced neuromodulation techniques is considered and potentially trialed.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^112h45za]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In a large prospective cohort of patients, we found mild DCM to be associated with significant impairment in quality of life compared to the general population. Surgery in these patients was associated with improved functional, disability, and quality of life outcomes, including mJOA score, Nurick grade, SF-36v2 score, NDI, and SF-6D utility scores. To be meaningful, these findings of course need to be taken into context of the natural history of mild DCM. While the available data would suggest most patients younger than 75 yr of age with this condition remain stable without intervention over a 3-yr period, patients rarely improve, and a long period of quiescence is considered the best case scenario. Alternatively, many patients experience the typical slow, stepwise decline. Our findings hence lead us to favor surgical intervention in mild DCM, because the degree of impairment in quality of life is significant, meaningful gains in function and quality of life can be achieved with an operation, and the alternative of nonoperative management offers only stability at best.

Data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions for back schools, low-level laser therapy, patient education, massage, traction, superficial heat/cold, and lumbar supports. A systematic review of 41 RCTs found multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) improves pain and disability more than conventional care in the short and long-term but there is no evidence that it improves work outcomes; MBR also outperformed no MBR in the short-term and showed additional evidence of superiority over physical treatments for pain, disability, and work outcomes in the short and long-term.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^1156XKun]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is an umbrella term for symptomatic spinal cord compression, secondary to degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Symptoms are often debilitating and progressive, typically resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.

Disease severity is often quantified using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, an objective physician evaluation of neurological dysfunction. Moderate and severe DCM are defined as cases where mJOA ≤ 14 and surgery has been recommended for such patients, as outlined in the most recent clinical practice guidelines. Prior to surgery, many factors contribute to a delay in diagnosis in moderate/severe DCM. Nonetheless, there is a consensus amongst surgeons in support of operative management.

In contrast, there is weak evidence informing the management of mild DCM, most commonly defined in the literature as mJOA 15–17. Amongst mild DCM patients, there is a subpopulation that deteriorates and another which remains stable. An absence of prognostic biomarkers and symptoms means that there are no strong predictions to support decision making.

Guidelines therefore currently suggest surgical intervention or a trial of structured rehabilitation in mild DCM, with the latter escalating to the former in cases of deterioration. This tentative guidance is reflected in variable practice, as has been anecdotally reported by surgeons. There is no specification on what structured rehabilitation or surveillance should entail.

Similar heterogeneity is believed to exist in the management of ASCC, a precursor to DCM. In this case, the guidelines cite weak evidence supporting non-operative management, involving counselling and education. Likewise, what this should constitute remains undefined.

Whilst widespread underdiagnosis so far limits the number of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease in spinal clinics, this is estimated to be vast (one meta-analysis estimates 1 in 5 adults could have ASCC) and rising with aging. Initiatives to accelerate diagnosis are on-going, and anticipated to increase case ascertainment.

On this background of weak evidence and variable practice, and driven by projected demand, efforts to better inform care for mild DCM and ASCC are a critical priority. The objective of this study was to assess current practices in the assessment and management of mild DCM and ASCC. This work also aligns with two other research priorities of the AO Spine RECODE-DCM initiative: diagnostic criteria and assessment and monitoring. We hypothesise that there is substantial variability in the definition, assessment, and management of mild DCM and ASCC.

### WITHDRAWN: surgery for cervical radiculomyelopathy [^1136Jk69]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk. We sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery.

Objectives

To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed upon persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (between 1966 and 1998), Embase (between 1980 and 1998) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded truly or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) "best medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management" 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery".

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The short-term effects of surgery, in terms of pain, weakness or sensory loss were superior, however, at one year no significant differences between groups were present. One trial with 49 patients compared the effects of surgery with those of conservative treatment in patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy. No significant differences were observed between groups, up to two years following treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The available small randomised trials do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. It is not clear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by any long-term benefits.

### Looking ahead: chronic spinal pain management [^113rQvSP]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The health care literature convincingly reports that coordinated, multidisciplinary and multimodal care, at the right level, is desired to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients and is very likely to be cost-effective. The challenge now is to have persistent spinal pain fully acknowledged as a legitimate chronic condition by both health care providers and policy makers/payers and have evidence-informed, cost-efficient care delivered in the manner described in published frameworks and models of care. Despite the complexity of spinal pain and its management, as with most chronic diseases, the potential workforce and services can and must be made available with appropriate attention, planning and leadership, with a view to improving accessibility to appropriate care early in the development of the spinal pain condition. The consequences are a large population of chronic pain sufferers, worsened by age-related comorbidities, which will be a tremendous burden and cost to the health care system, not to mention the personal suffering of the individual and their carers.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^111315va]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Salvaging spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trials can involve trialing more than one technology or manufacturer during the same trial using an adapter, but it is unclear whether prolonging the duration (with the added risk of infection) or repeating an indeterminate SCS trial is likely to change the trial outcome.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^111FwDTy]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial — core domains and multidimensional assessment — states that patients should be evaluated for 'efficacy of therapy', 'tolerability of any induced sensations', and 'understanding and reasonable expectations of SCS technology and therapy as a long-term option', with evaluations either during or at the end of the trial as appropriate (Grade A; Level of Certainty: High). It specifies that therapeutic efficacy should be evaluated multidimensionally using validated measures for pain relief, functional improvement, stable or decreased analgesic use, and overall satisfaction (Grade B; Level of Certainty: Moderate). The guidance notes that a patient-reported percentage improvement in pain relief, assessed during or at the end of trial, may be preferred over an absolute difference between before and after trial pain scores (Grade C; Level of Certainty: Low), and that evaluation for functional improvement should be performed using an appropriate patient-specific activity or goal setting, or a disease-specific instrument (Grade B; Level of Certainty: Moderate).

### Multimodal non-invasive non-pharmacological therapies for chronic pain: mechanisms and progress [^112PrQGc]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms underlying how NINPT alleviate chronic pain is critical for optimizing their clinical application. To begin with, it helps establish the causal relationship between NINPT and their effects on chronic pain, clarifying their validity and reliability. Secondly, elucidating the mechanisms of NINPT action allows for optimized, individualized therapeutic regimens meeting the needs of each patient. This includes determining the optimal frequency, intensity, and duration for achieving the best outcomes. Thirdly, it spurs continued innovation in developing more effective and integrative NINPT modalities for chronic pain relief through emerging technologies. Lastly, establishing the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the effects of NINPT on chronic pain enables the development of evidence-based clinical guidelines on recommending appropriate NINPT options for different chronic pain conditions.

The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of various NINPT for chronic pain management, with a focus on their mechanisms of action and clinical applications. For each modality, we discuss how they modulate pain signaling across peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal levels. We also highlight limitations, challenges, and future directions for optimizing the use of NINPT. We aim to build a bridge between basic research on mechanisms of NINPT and their clinical implementation for chronic pain relief.

### Spinal stenosis: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^114cDxTV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed increasingly in older people as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the goal of treatment is pain relief and improved function, but there is little empiric evidence to support many of the common interventions used. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, and the result has been wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across geographic regions. Current practice recommendations are based on expert opinion that incorporates available evidence into existing clinical and biologic paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, medications to control pain, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment most commonly is considered in patients not improving with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. The addition of fusion with or without instrumentation is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or related to concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions, and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

### The role of comprehensive rehabilitation in the care of degenerative cervical myelopathy [^11212C4Z]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Comprehensive rehabilitation can significantly improve daily performance in persons with DCM, beyond the improvement achieved by spinal surgery, and irrespective of its contribution. Based on this understanding and on literature data challenging the extent of spine surgery benefits for persons with DCM, we suggest considering modifying the recommendations for DCM follow-up and care, as detailed above. This would contribute to reducing the overall disability of individuals with DCM, improve the validity of assessing DCM clinical severity, and allow a direct comparison of the effects of rehabilitation and surgery.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy surgical trial: randomized, controlled trial design and rationale [^117K3X7k]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the world. There are significant practice variation and uncertainty as to the optimal surgical approach for treating CSM.

Objective

To determine whether ventral surgery is associated with superior Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary outcome at the 1-year follow-up compared with dorsal (laminectomy/fusion or laminoplasty) surgery for the treatment of CSM, to investigate whether postoperative sagittal balance is an independent predictor of overall outcome, and to compare health resource use for ventral and dorsal procedures.

Methods

The study is a randomized, controlled trial with a nonrandomized arm for patients who are eligible but decline randomization. Two hundred fifty patients (159 randomized) with CSM from 11 sites will be recruited over 18 months. The primary outcome is the Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score. Secondary outcomes include disease-specific outcomes, overall health-related quality of life (EuroQOL 5-dimension questionnaire), and health resource use.

Expected Outcomes

This will be the first randomized, controlled trial to compare directly the health-related quality-of-life outcomes for ventral vs dorsal surgery for treating CSM.

Discussion

A National Institutes of Health-funded (1R13AR065834–01) investigator meeting was held before the initiation of the trial to bring multiple stakeholders together to finalize the study protocol. Study investigators, coordinators, and major stakeholders were able to attend and discuss strengths of, limitations of, and concerns about the study. The final protocol was approved for funding by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (CE-1304–6173). The trial began enrollment on April 1, 2014.

### Comparing conventional medical management to spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of low back pain in a cohort of DISTINCT RCT patients [^112yRdMF]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

DISTINCT was a multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) to Comprehensive Medical Management (CMM) in treating chronic, refractory axial low back pain in patients with no prior lumbar spine surgery and for whom surgery was not indicated. Patients whose primary diagnosis was chronic low back pain were included, and those randomized to CMM could cross over to SCS after primary endpoint analysis at 6 months.

In the clinical evidence hierarchy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard study design for minimizing bias and confounding factors. Their aim is to provide credible, unbiased evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between treatment and outcome within a target population. While RCTs offer high internal validity, their external validity may be restricted by stringent patient selection, limited duration, and strict clinical protocols. A crossover design compares treatment effects within individual patients, as each patient acts as both treatment and control minimizing inter-patient variability in group comparisons while reducing bias and the impact of covariates during outcome analysis.

Pain produces an unpleasant sensory experience imposing significant physiological and financial burdens. Conventional treatment options for pain include pharmacological, interventional and/or surgical approaches. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a long-accepted treatment for managing intractable pain in the trunk and/or limbs associated with conditions such as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities, and failed back surgery syndrome (now commonly referred to as Persistent Spinal Pain Syndrome - PSPS). PSPS-type 1 refers to patients with chronic pain without previous spinal surgery and PSPS-type 2 is chronic pain, persisting after spine surgery. More recently, SCS has also emerged as a potential option for non-surgical low back pain patients. The majority of SCS patients experience satisfactory pain relief. Over 70% of SCS patients report at least a 50% pain improvement in addition to improvements in disability and psychosocial symptoms.

Section 2: Benefits and limitations of SCS trials — The text notes that "As there is no accepted, standardized clinical approach that can be operationalized (including the domains and their thresholds) to screen patients, and as chronic pain and psychosocial characteristics influence each other, an approach that includes a trial has potential advantages". In comparative SCS studies, "randomization was often performed after the screening trial", and "enrichment design is suggested as one of the ways to overcome challenges in studying chronic pain therapies". Evidence use is common: "Our literature review indicates that a majority of published studies report the use of a trial phase". Typical reporting windows are specified: "Most RCTs and observational studies of SCS therapies report outcomes at time points between 6 and 12 months postimplantation", whereas registry/database reports "report outcomes between 2 and 5 years", and in those datasets " 'therapy success' is not directly captured and in the most 'explant rates' are reported".

### Cervical rotation-traction manipulation for cervical radiculopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials [^114TfHrp]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a major musculoskeletal problem worldwide, characterized by the intense radicular pain, numbness, paraesthesia, or muscle weakness, among other symptoms.CR is related to compression and/or irritation of one or more cervical nerve roots, and the majority of patients attributed to a combination of degenerative changes and a minority resulting from cervical disc herniations. The reported annual age-adjusted incidence of CR was 83.2 per 100,000 persons (107.3 for men and 63.5 for women). As a disabling disease, CR significantly hampers a person's physical function, daily activities, psychological well-being, and social participation, which are associated with the substantial burdens of personal life, the healthcare system, and the social economy. With the advent of an ageing society, the population of patients with CR is expected to rapidly increase. The widespread adoption of electronic work environments has also accelerated the trend of CR towards younger demographics. Therefore, the treatment and management strategies for this condition have sparked considerable interest among healthcare professionals and patients worldwide.

Conservative management is generally recommended as first-line treatment option for patients with CR. Several (inter)national clinical practice guidelinessuggest that effective non-surgical management strategies could predominantly include patient education, exercise therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), manual therapy, cervical steroid injection, and the use of cervical collar. The majority of patients report symptomatic improvement outcomes in pain, neck movement, and function by using the non-operative management. However, certain conservative treatment approaches have demonstrated significant drawbacks, leading to some side effects and constraints. The use of oral NSAIDs as a primary treatment for chronic pain conditions can notably impact the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems, and the risk of adverse reactions escalates with higher doses and prolonged usage. Furthermore, the peak incidence of CR appears in the fifth and sixth decade for both genders. There's a consistent rise in the number of patients experiencing multiple coexisting diseases simultaneously in the middle-aged and elderly population, which is gradually posing considerable challenges to pharmacotherapy for patients. And further investigation is warranted into the adverse reactions resulting from the concomitant use of various types of medications. Thus, there arises a need to explore non-pharmacological complementary therapies to augment the existing array of treatment options and meet clinical needs of different conditions.

### Increasing awareness of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a preventative cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^113icbMi]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Perspective

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) (historically termed "cervical spondylotic myelopathy" [CSM]) is the most common non-traumatic, progressive spinal cord disorder with an estimated 2% prevalence. The disorder is indeed imprecisely and insufficiently characterized by neck and radicular pain, fine motor dysfunction, gait instability, and bladder dysfunction and for most lacks common diagnostic criteria. If not recognized and treated timely, patients may eventually present as incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). This letter aims to raise awareness of these shortcomings in the neurological community and emphasize an ongoing initiative to improve clinical care and foster global research. The neurological field should not be left out in this effort.

Due to a variety of symptoms, patients eventually get referred to different specialists, commonly orthopedics, neurosurgeons, neurologists, or physiotherapists. While surgical decompression of the encroached spinal cord is recommended in patients experiencing already moderate/severe, or progressive symptoms, the goal of enabling earlier and/or preventative treatment has now been defined as a priority research need. In its early stages, DCM is frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral neuropathy, until patients develop more severe impairments of upper and lower limb function urging the consideration of incomplete cervical SCI. Given that DCM is a progressive but preventable neurological condition, the delayed diagnosis and late referral for evaluation of surgical decompression, can lead to poorer neurological outcomes. In addition, the pre-operative neurological status significantly influences post-operative recovery. Therefore, an early diagnosis is important to achieve good clinical results. The diagnosis of DCM is currently based on clinical signs and symptoms, eventually complemented by cervical spine MRI. However, there is still no consensus on diagnostic criteria for DCM, leading to ambiguous, descriptive clinical diagnoses, and heterogenous definitions of DCM applied in clinical studies. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the UK, DCM is rarely covered in the medical curriculum. AO Spine RECODE-DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) (aospine.org/recode) is an international, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM, which aims to accelerate knowledge discovery that can change outcomes. This has included the formation of research priorities such as the development of common diagnostic criteria. Alongside its importance for clinical care, a sensitive and specific set of diagnostic criteria is required to foster research, particularly for those studies aiming at investigating neuroprotective strategies. Diagnostic criteria for DCM can help to overcome several shortcomings in patient care and research (Fig. 1). The development of diagnostic criteria for DCM would benefit from the experiences of the neurological community; a UK cohort study identified 45% of cases are initially diagnosed by Neurologists, whilst Neurologists are familiar with their development and implementation. Common criteria will help the dialog between neurologists, general practitioners (primary care providers), and spine specialists, and propagate the knowledge of red flags in DCM that require timely and specific actions, before established SCI. The development of diagnostic criteria involves both comprehensive diagnostic criteria for research and spine specialists, as well as easily applicable algorithms that speed up referral to cervical spine MRI and spine specialists. We have established an initial working group to act upon this opportunity (AO Spine RECODE DCM Diagnostic Criteria Incubator). If you are interested in contributing to this process, please contact us.

### Treatment of cervical myelopathy in patients with the fibromyalgia syndrome: outcomes and implications [^113s16GG]. European Spine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Some patients with fibromyalgia also exhibit the neurological signs of cervical myelopathy. We sought to determine if treatment of cervical myelopathy in patients with fibromyalgia improves the symptoms of fibromyalgia and the patients' quality of life. A non-randomized, prospective, case control study comparing the outcome of surgical (n = 40) versus non-surgical (n = 31) treatment of cervical myelopathy in patients with fibromyalgia was conducted. Outcomes were compared using SF-36, screening test for somatization, HADS, MMPI-2 scale 1 (Hypochondriasis), and self reported severity of symptoms 1 year after treatment. There was no significant difference in initial clinical presentation or demographic characteristics between the patients treated by surgical decompression and those treated by non-surgical means. There was a striking and statistically significant improvement in all symptoms attributed to the fibromyalgia syndrome in the surgical patients but not in the non-surgical patients at 1 year following the treatment of cervical myelopathy (P ≤ 0.018–0.001, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test). At the 1 year follow-up, there was a statistically significant improvement in both physical and mental quality of life as measured by the SF-36 score for the surgical group as compared to the non-surgical group (Repeated Measures ANOVA P < 0.01). There was a statistically significant improvement in the scores from Scale 1 of the MMPI-2 and the screening test for somatization disorder, and the anxiety and depression scores exclusively in the surgical patients (Wilcoxon signed rank, P < 0.001). The surgical treatment of cervical myelopathy due to spinal cord or caudal brainstem compression in patients carrying the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can result in a significant improvement in a wide array of symptoms usually attributed to fibromyalgia with attendant measurable improvements in the quality of life. We recommend detailed neurological and neuroradiological evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia in order to exclude compressive cervical myelopathy, a potentially treatable condition.

### Surgery for cervical radiculomyelopathy [^113s3dMz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk. We sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery.

Objectives

To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed upon persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (between 1966 and 1998), Embase (between 1980 and 1998) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded truly or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) "best medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management" 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery".

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The short-term effects of surgery, in terms of pain, weakness or sensory loss were superior, however, at one year no significant differences between groups were present. One trial with 49 patients compared the effects of surgery with those of conservative treatment in patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy. No significant differences were observed between groups, up to two years following treatment.

### Surgical management of cervical degenerative disease: the evidence related to indications, impact, and outcome [^113wVG7Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Medium credibility.

AANS/CNS therapeutic effectiveness classification and recommendation levels define Class I as evidence provided by one or more well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials; Class II as evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g. case control and cohort studies); and Class III as evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports and studies with historical controls. Level I comprises generally accepted principles for patient management, which reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires class I evidence which directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials); Level II comprises recommendations for patient management which reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires class II evidence or a strong consensus of class III evidence); and Level III comprises other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion).

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a guide to diagnosis and management [^115rtJ4w]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a neurologic condition that develops insidiously over time as degenerative changes of the spine result in compression of the cord and nearby structures. It is the most common form of spinal cord injury in adults; yet, its diagnosis is often delayed. The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis, and management of CSM with a focus on the recommended timeline for physicians suspecting CSM to refer patients to a spine surgeon. Various processes underlie spondylotic changes of the canal and are separated into static and dynamic factors. Not all patients with evidence of cord compression will present with symptoms, and the progression of disease varies by patient. The hallmark symptoms of CSM include decreased hand dexterity and gait instability as well as sensory and motor dysfunction. magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice in patients with suspected CSM, but computed tomography myelography may be used in patients with contraindications. Patients with mild CSM may be treated surgically or nonoperatively, whereas those with moderate-severe disease are treated operatively. Due to the long-term disability that may result from a delay in diagnosis and management, prompt referral to a spine surgeon is recommended for any patient suspected of having CSM. This review provides information and guidelines for practitioners to develop an actionable awareness of CSM.

Interventional pain management definitions — The National Uniform Claims Committee (NUCC) defines interventional pain management as "the discipline of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of pain related disorders principally with the application of interventional techniques in managing subacute, chronic, persistent, and intractable pain, independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatment". The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) defines interventional pain management techniques as "minimally invasive procedures including, percutaneous precision needle placement, with placement of drugs in targeted areas or ablation of targeted nerves; and some surgical techniques such as laser or endoscopic discectomy, intrathecal infusion pumps and spinal cord stimulators, for the diagnosis and management of chronic, persistent or intractable pain".

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: recognition and management [^113VSiEE]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a collection of pathologic conditions that result in progressive spinal cord dysfunction secondary to cord compression. Patients are typically male (3: 1 male-to-female ratio), and the average age of presentation is 64 years. The exact incidence is unclear because of differences in terminology and because radiographic findings can be present in asymptomatic individuals. Common examination findings include neck pain or stiffness, a wide-based ataxic gait, ascending paresthesia in the upper or lower extremities, lower extremity weakness, decreased hand dexterity, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign, and bowel or bladder dysfunction in severe disease. Definitive diagnosis requires correlation of physical examination findings with imaging findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with and without contrast media is the preferred imaging modality. Cervical spine computed tomography, computed tomography myelography, and plain radiography are helpful in certain situations. Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms. Surgery is recommended for patients with moderate to severe symptoms or rapidly progressive disease. Conservative treatments with monitoring for progression may be considered in patients with mild to moderate disease. The evidence for the effectiveness of conservative treatments is scarce and of low quality, and outcomes can vary with individual patients. Primary care physicians play a vital role in recognizing the typical presentation of degenerative cervical myelopathy, coordinating treatment as indicated, and managing comorbidities.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^112zVXsi]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy — single-level versus multi-level surgical decompression long term results lack comparative evidence, as a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this comparison. After this review, most patients with true radiculopathy suffer from one level and occasionally two level disease, and the incidence of multilevel disease without the additional presence of myelopathy is rare, leading to the conclusion that there is likely little to gain and a low probability of generating meaningful data to answer this question. For research prioritization, the work group would not recommend further pursuit of this question.
