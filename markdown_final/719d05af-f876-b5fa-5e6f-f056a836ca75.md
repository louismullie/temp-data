## Question

What to do with deep open puncture wound?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do with a deep open puncture wound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and tetanus risk. Then, I should verify the approach to irrigation and debridement. Next, I will examine foreign body assessment and removal. After that, I need to decide on closure strategy and whether to use delayed primary closure. Then, I should review antibiotic prophylaxis indications. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, documentation, and follow-up, and I will double-check each step against guidelines and evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: control bleeding with direct pressure, assess for life threats, and address tetanus risk early because puncture wounds are tetanus-prone and management depends on immunization history and wound characteristics. I should verify the ACIP tetanus algorithm and ensure I apply it correctly, giving both tetanus toxoid and immune globulin when indicated for dirty wounds with unknown or incomplete immunization, and updating boosters as appropriate for clean versus dirty wounds and time since last dose [^caebc6de] [^03739a98].

> Wait, let me verify the irrigation parameters before I commit to specifics. High-pressure irrigation at roughly 6–12 psi using a 35 mL syringe and 19-gauge needle achieves effective mechanical debridement without excessive tissue damage, and timing matters: irrigation within about 3 hours of injury reduces bacterial load more effectively, with at least 1 liter of saline recommended for contaminated wounds; I initially thought higher pressure might be better, but pressures above about 15 psi can cause tissue injury and paradoxically increase rebound bacterial counts, so I should keep pressure in the 6–12 psi range and avoid additives like soap or antiseptics in routine irrigation [^937315e9] [^f701a1b5].

> I need to check the debridement approach next. Devitalized tissue should be removed judiciously, but in deep puncture wounds with questionable viability, it is safer to minimize debridement and favor delayed primary closure rather than forcing primary closure over uncertain tissue; if contamination is significant or tissue is clearly nonviable, leaving the wound open with packing is appropriate to reduce infection risk and allow serial reassessment [^fe71b4ae] [^6c7a06be].

> Hold on, I should verify the foreign body strategy. Retained foreign material, especially organic matter like wood or vegetative debris, substantially increases infection risk and mandates targeted exploration; radiography helps locate radiopaque objects, and ultrasound aids in finding radiolucent materials. I should set a time limit for exploration and have a low threshold to extend the wound or refer if the object cannot be safely retrieved, because missing a foreign body invites failure of therapy and persistent infection [^15e4a238].

> Next, I should review closure decisions. Primary closure is reasonable for low-risk, clean puncture wounds after thorough irrigation and debridement, but for deep, contaminated, or high-risk punctures — especially to the foot, hand, or in immunocompromised hosts — delayed primary closure at about 24–72 hours after reassessment and repeat irrigation is preferred to reduce infection; I should confirm that this approach is supported in both wilderness and surgical literature, and yes, DPC is a standard strategy for contaminated wounds with low infection rates when properly executed [^6c7a06be] [^76fc89ee].

> I will now examine antibiotic prophylaxis, and I need to be careful not to overgeneralize. Routine prophylaxis is not indicated for simple, clean puncture wounds after appropriate local care, but I should consider a short course when risk factors are present: contamination with soil or organic material, location on the foot or hand, immunocompromise, diabetes, delayed presentation beyond about 6–8 hours, or signs of early infection; if given, amoxicillin-clavulanate is a reasonable first-line choice for polymicrobial coverage, with adjustments for allergies and local resistance patterns, and I should document the rationale if I withhold antibiotics in higher-risk cases [^8b18d847] [^8045859e] [^452247e1].

> But wait, what if the puncture is to the hand or involves a clenched-fist injury? I should double-check that these carry a higher risk of deep space infection and often warrant empiric antibiotics and surgical consultation even without overt infection, given the propensity for polymicrobial flora and rapid progression; yes, hand infections from punctures, including flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries, generally merit antibiotics and early surgical evaluation [^8c530b5b].

> Let me consider special scenarios systematically. For plantar puncture wounds, I should maintain a high suspicion for Pseudomonas and consider fluoroquinolone coverage if there is a concerning history or early infection signs; for marine or aquatic exposures, I should broaden to cover Vibrio and Aeromonas; for animal bites, I should avoid primary closure of puncture wounds and use amoxicillin-clavulanate for prophylaxis when indicated; for immunocompromised patients, I should have a lower threshold for antibiotics, imaging, and specialist input; and for punctures near joints or tendons, I should assess for joint or sheath involvement and consider imaging to exclude septic arthritis or tenosynovitis [^50701446] [^452247e1] [^17c81145] [^8c530b5b].

> I should confirm documentation and follow-up elements. I need to record wound dimensions, contamination, foreign body risk, neurovascular status, immunization history, irrigation details, closure plan, and antibiotic rationale; I should provide clear return precautions for fever, spreading erythema, drainage, escalating pain, numbness, or functional loss; and I should arrange timely follow-up within 24–72 hours for high-risk wounds to reassess for infection and decide on closure or further debridement [^8045859e].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked any contraindicated topical products. Several over-the-counter creams and ointments explicitly warn against use on deep or puncture wounds, so I should advise patients to avoid applying such agents to the wound and stick to saline irrigation and appropriate dressings instead [^33b6614e] [^9aeb2041] [^3edb509f].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, risk-stratified approach: stabilize and address tetanus immediately, irrigate early with appropriate pressure and volume, debride judiciously with a bias toward delayed closure when contamination or devitalization is present, hunt for and remove foreign bodies, reserve antibiotics for higher-risk scenarios with clear documentation of rationale, and tailor decisions to anatomic location and host factors, with close follow-up to catch evolving infection or complications early [^937315e9] [^6c7a06be] [^8b18d847] [^8045859e].

For a deep open puncture wound, **irrigate thoroughly with saline at 6–12 psi** [^937315e9] using a 35 mL syringe and 19-gauge needle to reduce bacterial load [^937315e9], and **leave the wound open** [^6c7a06be] unless it is clean, recent, and low risk; if closure is needed, use delayed primary closure after 24–72 hours [^6c7a06be]. Do not use **routine antibiotic prophylaxis** [^8b18d847] unless the patient is immunocompromised, the wound is contaminated or high risk (e.g. foot, hand, animal bite) [^452247e1], or infection is present. Update **tetanus immunization** [^caebc6de] according to status, and arrange close follow-up for signs of infection or retained foreign body [^d4e83e07].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)**: Ensure hemodynamic stability and address life-threatening injuries first [^notfound].

- **Hemorrhage control**: Apply direct pressure, elevation, and tourniquet if necessary [^12138bad].

- **Neurovascular assessment**: Evaluate distal pulses, capillary refill, sensation, and motor function [^452247e1].

---

## Wound irrigation and debridement

- **Irrigation**: Use high-pressure saline (6–12 psi) [^937315e9] with a 35 mL syringe and 19-gauge needle; avoid very high pressure (> 15 psi) to prevent tissue damage [^937315e9].

- **Volume**: Irrigate with at least 1 liter of saline [^937315e9], increasing to 3–6 liters for heavily contaminated wounds.

- **Debridement**: Remove devitalized tissue and foreign bodies [^fe71b4ae]; minimize debridement if tissue viability is uncertain, favoring delayed primary closure [^fe71b4ae].

---

## Wound closure considerations

- **Primary closure**: Reserved for clean, recent, low-risk wounds after thorough irrigation and debridement [^6c7a06be].

- **Delayed primary closure**: Preferred for contaminated, high-risk, or deep wounds; close after 24–72 hours if no infection develops [^6c7a06be].

- **Leave open**: For grossly contaminated, infected, or high-risk wounds; manage with packing and secondary intention healing [^b5d6f16f].

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis

Routine prophylaxis is **not indicated** for uncomplicated puncture wounds [^8b18d847]. Indications include immunocompromised patients, contaminated or high-risk wounds (e.g. foot, hand, animal bites) [^452247e1], or when infection is present. First-line agents include **amoxicillin-clavulanate** for broad-spectrum coverage; tailor to culture results if infection develops [^452247e1].

---

## Tetanus prophylaxis

Update **tetanus immunization** according to ACIP guidelines [^caebc6de]:

| **Immunization status** | **Clean wound** | **Dirty wound** |
|-|-|-|
| Unknown or < 3 doses | Td/Tdap + TIG | Td/Tdap + TIG |
| 3+ doses, > 10 years | Td/Tdap | Td/Tdap + TIG |
| 3+ doses, 5–10 years | Nothing | Td/Tdap |

---

## Pain management

Provide **analgesia** with acetaminophen or NSAIDs; consider opioids for severe pain [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and patient education

Arrange **follow-up within 24–48 hours** to assess for infection, healing, and retained foreign body [^notfound]. Educate patients on signs of infection (erythema, warmth, swelling, purulence, fever) and when to seek care [^12138bad].

---

## Special considerations

- **Foreign body**: Suspect and remove if present; use imaging (ultrasound, X-ray) if needed [^15e4a238].

- **High-risk locations**: Hand, foot, and perineal wounds have higher infection risk and may require antibiotics and closer follow-up [^notfound].

- **Animal bites**: Avoid primary closure; use amoxicillin-clavulanate for prophylaxis; consider rabies prophylaxis if indicated [^452247e1] [^50701446].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

| **Step** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Irrigation | High-pressure saline (6–12 psi), ≥ 1 liter [^937315e9] |
| Debridement | Remove devitalized tissue and foreign bodies [^fe71b4ae] |
| Closure | Delayed primary closure or leave open [^6c7a06be] |
| Antibiotics | Only if indicated (immunocompromised, contaminated, high-risk, or infected) [^8b18d847] |
| Tetanus | Update per ACIP guidelines [^caebc6de] |
| Follow-up | Within 24–48 hours [^notfound] |

---

Deep open puncture wounds require **high-pressure saline irrigation**, selective debridement, and judicious closure decisions, with antibiotics reserved for high-risk scenarios and tetanus updated per guidelines. Close follow-up is essential to detect complications early.

### Managing the open abdomen: selecting an appropriate treatment strategy [^14cb27cf]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Significance: The laparotomy is a common surgical procedure with a wide range of indications. Ideally, once the goals of surgery were achieved, the incision edges could then be approximated and the abdomen primarily closed. However, in some circumstances, it may be impossible to achieve primary closure, and instead the abdomen is intentionally left open. This review discusses the indications and objectives for the open abdomen (OA), summarizes the most common techniques for temporary abdominal closure, and illustrates treatment algorithms grounded in the current recommendations from specialty experts. Recent Advances: Still a relatively young technique, multiple strategies, and technologies have emerged to manage the OA. So too have the recommendations evolved, based on updated classifications that take wound characteristics into account. Recent studies have also brought greater clarity on recommendations for managing infection and malnutrition to support improved clinical outcomes. Critical Issues: The status of the OA can change rapidly depending on the patient's condition, the wound quality, and many other factors. Thus, there is a significant need for comprehensive treatment strategies that can be adapted to these developing circumstances. Future Directions: Treatment recommendations should be continuously updated as new technologies are introduced and old techniques fall out of use.

Background

Shark bites are rare but sensational injuries that are covered in the lay press but are not well described in the medical literature.

Case Report

We present the case of a 50-year-old man who sustained two deep puncture wounds to his thigh from a great white shark in the waters surrounding Isla de Guadalupe off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, during a caged SCUBA dive. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We discuss our strategy of closing the wounds in a delayed primary fashion 24 hours after injury, our antibiotic choices, and the patient's course and review marine pathogens and appropriate antibiotic coverage.

Proper wound care has broad applications for all clinicians. Much of the future direction for enhancing wound repair focuses on key cells and growth factors, which is why possessing a strong understanding of the basic physiology of wound healing is imperative. This article first provides a thorough review of the phases of wound healing followed by a discussion on the latest wound management strategies. Wound conditions and surgical techniques are important components for optimizing wound healing and preventing complications. Special consideration has been given to the unique settings of contaminated wounds, open wounds, or avulsed tissue.

### Management of foreign bodies in the skin [^15e4a238]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Although puncture wounds are common, retained foreign bodies are not. Wounds with a foreign body sensation should be evaluated. The presence of wood or vegetative material, graphite or other pigmenting materials, and pain is an indication for foreign body removal. Radiography may be used to locate foreign bodies for removal, and ultrasonography can be helpful for localizing radiolucent foreign bodies. It is wise to set a time limit for exploration and to have a plan for further evaluation or referral. Injuries at high risk of infection include organic foreign bodies or dirty wounds. These should be treated with plain water irrigation and complete removal of retained fragments. In most cases, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. If a patient presents with an infected wound, the possibility of a retained foreign body should be considered. Tetanus prophylaxis is necessary if there is no knowledge or documentation of tetanus immunization within 10 years, including tetanus immune globulin for the person with a dirty wound whose history of tetanus toxoid doses is unknown or incomplete.

Irrigation — pressure, volume, and timing for basic wound management state that in the field, 8 psi can be exerted by fluid delivered by a 35-mL syringe through a 19-gauge needle; very high pressure irrigation (> 15 psi) is more likely to cause direct tissue damage and may result in a significantly greater rebound bacterial count at 48 hours when compared with low- or high-pressure irrigation; one study showed increasing volume of irrigant from 0.1 L to 1 L increased bacterial removal with no additional benefit with further increases up to 10 L; high-pressure, low-volume irrigation can be as effective as high-pressure, high-volume lavage at removing bacteria if performed within 3 hours of contamination; wounds that are small (< 1 cm), superficial, and not grossly contaminated likely would not benefit from irrigation; the use of high-pressure irrigation (6–12 psi) is recommended to lower wound infection rates, especially in the case of open fractures (Recommendation grade: 1A); irrigation should be performed as quickly as practical as there is a direct correlation between timing and effectiveness of irrigation (Recommendation grade: 1B); and irrigation should include at least 1 L of irrigant (Recommendation grade: 1C).

Practice guidelines for central venous access — selection of catheter insertion site and fixation include the following directives: Determine catheter insertion site selection based on clinical need. Select an insertion site that is not contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., burned or infected skin, inguinal area, adjacent to tracheostomy or open surgical wound). In adults, select an upper body insertion site when possible to minimize the risk of infection. Determine the use of sutures, staples, or tape for catheter fixation on a local or institutional basis. Minimize the number of needle punctures of the skin.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^960e717f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### Complications of deep venous stenting and their management [^fea8363d]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Access Site Complications

Access site complications including haematoma, pseudoaneurysm, iatrogenic arteriovenous (AV) fistula, lymphocele and infection may occur in up to 5% of patients. In most cases, this is related to suboptimal access technique. For chronic iliofemoral disease, femoral vein access is preferable, although in some cases of severe disease or IVC involement, jugular venous access may be required. In acute cases, restoration of flow in more distal vessels can be needed and popliteal venous access is advised. Access should always be gained with ultrasound guidance. In our centre's experience, using a micropuncture needle access kit, with sequential dilation of the tract starting with a 4F sheath and progressing to 6F and 9F as dictated by device requirements can help to minimise the potential risk associated with accidental arterial puncture. Compression is applied at the end of the procedure with a compression dressing over the access site, and with thigh-length compression stockings. When access is limited to 10F sheaths we have found that bleeding and haematoma are uncommon and closure devices are not needed.

Most access site haematomas will resolve with conservative management; however, haemoglobin should be monitored as transfusion or surgical evacuation for larger haematomas may be required in some cases. Anticoagulation will usually be continued to avoid the risk of in-stent-thrombosis, which is highest in the first 2-weeks postprocedure. Iatrogenic AV fistulas usually resolve spontaneously and are managed conservatively, since the increased flow through the stent system from the fistula can be helpful for maintaining stent patency. The risk of seromas and access-site infections is higher in patients requiring hybrid surgical procedures involving open endophlebectomy. Severe inflow disease or other complicating factors such as previous failed interventions are usually present in patients being considered for endophlebectomy, and a thorough discussion with the patient regarding the higher risks of stent occlusion and groin wound complications is necessary before intervention. If a hybrid procedure is considered appropriate, high-level compression (class 2 or above) would be appropriate to reduce the risk of seromas and lymphoceles. Early drain usage and surgical haematoma evacuation can also be helpful in such cases. Infections may be managed with antibiotics (which initially may be broad spectrum but should be targeted to the specific organisms once wound culture results are available) vacuum assisted closure (VAC) dressings and surgical wash-out in some cases.

Results

Definitions

At the end of the work the panel and the referees have reached an agreement on the following definitions of traumatic wounds:
Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin with no evidence of macroscopic contamination or signs of active infection (and likely low probability of infection).
Dirty Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin macroscopically contaminated. Among these wounds we include those with simultaneous perforation of a viscus; with presence of devitalized tissues; with foreign bodies; those that occurred in a contaminated environment (dung, marshes); animal bites; puncture wounds; wounds with a delayed treatment.
Infected Traumatic Wound: a wound or laceration of traumatic origin with signs of infection (secretions).

After completed that step, the panel reached consensus on a series of statements concerning the management of traumatic wounds. For each statement, selected references are provided. The statements are as follows:
STATEMENT 1 All traumatic wounds are to be considered contaminated at presentation in ED.

STATEMENT 2 It is useful to provide an initial stratification of the risk of infection for all the traumatic wounds. The risk assessment should be based on both the following: i) type of wound; ii) location of the wound; iii) characteristics of the wounded patient. With the aim of simplifying and optimizing the management of patients in the ED, the following fields of stratification of the risk of infection was identified: type of wound, location of the wound, characteristics of the patients. In Tables 2, 3, 4 the suggested items for risk assessment are summarized. Table 2 Infection risk assessment based on type of wound Table 3 Infection risk assessment based on the location of the wound Table 4 Infection risk assessment based on the characteristics of the patient 2A. Avoid antibiotic administration in low risk wounds (for all three variables considered). 2B. Consider antibiotic administration when one or two high risk variables are present. 2C. If the decision to avoid antibiotic administration in high risk wounds is made the reason must always be clearly stated. 2D. In every wound consider the risk of tetanus according to the patient's immunization status.

### Spine injury [^f37e61fc]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Stab and puncture injuries to the spinal cord — indications and wound care: In the U.S., stab injuries occur less frequently than ballistic injuries. Surgical intervention may be considered for indications including removal of a retained foreign body, infection and sepsis, acute cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, hematoma formation, cord compression from a bony fragment or soft tissue, progressive neurological deterioration, and persistent chronic CSF leakage; implement local wound debridement, tetanus prophylaxis, and a short course of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent meningitis or local infection.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1c7dbd6f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

An incisional SSI should be sampled if there is a clinical suspicion of infection. Lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic microbiology of SSIs present a challenge to monitor the global epidemiology of surgical site infection. Emergence of antibiotic resistance has made the management of SSIs difficult. Moreover, rapidly emerging nosocomial pathogens and the problem of multidrug resistance necessitates periodic review of isolation patterns and their sensitivity.

Adequate treatment of incisional SSIs should always include:
Surgical incision and drainage of abscess.
Debridement of necrotic tissue, if present.
Appropriate wound care.
Resuscitation to improve perfusion when sepsis is present.
Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy when indicated.
De-escalation when antibiogram is available.

Incisional SSIs should always be drained, irrigated, and if needed, opened and debrided. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should always be performed. Percutaneous drainage, wound irrigation, and negative pressure-assisted wound management are new and effective options that reduce the need for open management of wound infections. In cases where open management is needed, once the infection has cleared, the wound can be closed.

Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics.

In patients with incisional SSIs with the presence of any systemic inflammatory response criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started with coverage for Gram-positive cocci and/or the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antibiotic treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of gram stain, wound culture, and antibiogram.

### Acute hand infections [^8c530b5b]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute hand infections are often caused by puncture wounds and are generally classified into superficial or deep infections. Superficial infections occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas deep infections can involve the tendon sheaths, adjacent anatomic compartments, deep fascial planes, bursae, joint spaces, and bones. Superficial hand infections are more common than deep infections and are typically managed with elevation, warm soaks, splinting in the position of function, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics when indicated. Paronychia, which can be acute or chronic, is an infection or inflammation of the nail fold. Treatment involves warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and abscess drainage, if indicated. A felon is an infection of the distal pulp of the finger. Treatment often involves surgical drainage and empiric oral antibiotics. Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes simplex virus and typically resolves without intervention. Deep hand infections include pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist bite wounds. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection of the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand, most commonly caused by a penetrating injury to the finger. Clenched-fist bite wounds result from direct contact of the fist on incisor teeth and are associated with polymicrobial infections. Empiric antibiotics and prompt surgical consultation are indicated to reduce long-term morbidity.

### Bush animal attacks: management of complex injuries in a resource-limited setting [^4d42eb7f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Aside from causing internal organ injury and soft tissue damage, animal attacks also may transmit infectious diseases. Vervet monkeys have been shown to carry multiple parasitic and bacterial diseases, as well as viruses transmissible to humans. These include Rabies, Ebola Reston, Herpes B Virus, Monkeypox, Yellow Fever, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, and tuberculosis. Rabies is the most commonly acknowledged disease transmitted from cats or dogs to humans, and this extends to hyenas. Crocodile mouths may harbor Aeromonas hydrophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus, and Salmonella.

Principles of managing these attacks in the resource limited setting include using a systematic survey to rule out major traumatic injury; once these injuries have been addressed, then focus turns to soft tissue and prevention of local and/or systemic infection. This is achieved through careful cleaning with soap and water and an anti-infective such as betadine. Tetanus and rabies vaccines also should be administered to patients who suffered unprovoked attack from any wild animal. Prophylactic antibiotics are used in our setting, though they remain controversial in general. One study has proven that post-bite infection may be reduced to < 2.0% in domestic cat and dog bites when prophylactic antibiotics are used, and suggests that antibiotics may be prudent in wild animal attacks. Further argument for prophylactic antibiotics in our setting include the following: the rural location of many attacks, poor transport systems, and subsequent late presentation of injuries; puncture-type wounds; and, high rate of immunodeficiency in the East African population. Regarding the surgical management of these wounds, it is most ideal to attempt primary closure of facial injuries for cosmetic purposes. However, in the clinical setting of immunodeficiency or high risk for infection in a cat, dog, monkey, or livestock wound, we emphasize that delayed primary closure represents the most appropriate surgical management.

### Coverage of complex tissue defects following open cervicothoracic spine surgery with a lower trapezius island myocutaneous flap-an interdisciplinary approach [^8fb1cd8c]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

The study design is a clinical case series. The objective of this study was to present the concept and efficacy of the lower trapezius island myocutaneous flap (LTIMF) for management of complex wound healing disorders following open cervicothoracic spine surgery. Wound healing disturbances with myocutaneous defects after open spine surgery at the cervical and upper thoracic spine are well-described complications. In severe cases, plastic reconstructive coverage is often required as a last resort. A review of all adult patients with deep wound dehiscence and tissue defects following open cervicothoracic spine surgery, who were managed with plastic surgery reconstruction using a LTIMF at our institution, was conducted. Synopses of these cases are presented. Seven patients with a mean age of 73 years ± 13 (range 50 to 89 years) were included in this case series. Six out of seven patients had instrumented posterior fusion added to their decompression. All patients were managed with a LTIMF for wound coverage. No spinal implants were removed prior to LTIMF surgery. The mean follow-up was 5.2 months (± 5.4 months). No major flap failure occurred, and all patients presented with satisfactory cosmetic results. The only minor complication was development of a sterile subcutaneous seroma in two patients, which were successfully managed by puncture and aspiration. The LTIMF is an effective and reliable salvage treatment option for spine surgery patients offering stable coverage of deep tissue defects resulting from complex wound healing disorders at the cervical and upper thoracic spine.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^f6372176]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

For the purpose of the guideline, the GWG defines a wound as any area of skin that is torn, cut, punctured or ulcerated, and ulceration as a non-healing wound. Contemporaneous prevalence estimates for foot ulceration in IA are lacking; however, a 2008 survey found a point prevalence of 3.39% and an overall prevalence of 9.73%.

There is no direct evidence for the management of foot ulceration in IA; recommendations are based on evidence for managing foot ulceration generally and on expert opinion. Qualitative research has indicated that people with RA foot ulceration may lack knowledge regarding whom to see, and how and when to seek help, ultimately leading to delays in accessing treatments. Patients with or at high risk of foot ulceration should be advised how and when to access a health professional. Additionally, timely communication between the health professional who first identifies a wound and the rheumatology MDT, with regards to wound management, is important to ensure ulceration is not being managed in isolation.

Foot ulceration in RA usually occurs on the pressure-vulnerable bony sites in the forefoot. Common causes of foot ulceration in IA include mechanical trauma/pressure, PAD, neuropathy, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes) and vasculitis. The principles of foot ulcer management therefore include offloading, particularly accommodation and offloading of the bony sites often involved to aid healing, restoration of tissue perfusion, treatment of infection, treatment of comorbidities, local ulcer care, patient education and ulcer prevention.

The management of foot infection in people with IA who are immunocompromised due to systemic drug treatment can be complicated as signs of infection may be masked. Collection of a wound sample can be considered where infection is clinically suspected. Stopping csDMARDs and bDMARDs in the presence of infection should be discussed with the rheumatology MDT, with further guidance available in the BSR guidelines for biologic DMARD safety and prescribing and monitoring of non-biologic DMARDs. Suspension of systemic drugs can increase disease activity and delay wound healing, therefore liaising with the rheumatology MDT around disease management is important.

### Caring for cuts, scrapes, and wounds… [^12138bad]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

How should I clean a cut, scrape, or wound. The best way to clean a cut, scrape, or puncture wound is with cool water. You can hold the wound under running water or fill a tub with cool water and pour it from a cup over the wound. If your wound is on an arm or leg, raising it above your heart also will help slow the bleeding. Should I use a bandage. Leaving a wound uncovered helps it stay dry and helps it heal. If the wound isn't in an area that will get dirty or be rubbed by clothing, you don't have to cover it. If the wound is in an area that will get dirty or be irritated by clothing, cover it with an adhesive bandage, or with a piece of sterile gauze and adhesive tape, or use a skin adhesive. Change the adhesive strip or gauze each day to keep the wound clean and dry.

Certain wounds, such as scrapes that cover a large area of the body, should be kept moist and clean to help reduce scarring and speed healing. Bandages used for this purpose are called occlusive or semiocclusive bandages. You can buy them in drug stores without a prescription. Your family doctor will tell you if this type of bandage is best for you. Call your family doctor if any of the following things happen: The wound is jagged. The wound is on your face. The edges of the cut hang open. The cut has dirt in it that won't come out. The cut becomes tender or inflamed. The cut drains a thick, creamy, grayish fluid. You start to run a temperature higher than 100°F. The area around the wound feels numb. You can't move comfortably. Red streaks form near the wound. It's a puncture wound or a deep cut, and you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past five years.

The cut bleeds in spurts, blood soaks through the bandage, or the bleeding doesn't stop after 10 minutes of firm, direct pressure.

### Heel pressure injuries: consensus-based recommendations for assessment and management [^d834d0cd]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

The heel is frequently affected by pressure woundswith a deep impact on relevant clinical outcomes including mortality.

Despite that, our study confirms that very few and low-quality evidence from primary research, nor recommendations coming from guidelines able to inform clinical practice are available nowadays.

As a consequence, clinical diagnostic and therapeutic behaviors are characterized by wide heterogeneity and empirical approach with obvious and unacceptable fallout on patient outcomes and wasting of resources.

Paucity of reliable trials on this topic relies on intrinsic characteristics of HPIs, such as lack of validated diagnostic and classification criteria for complex wounds, the need of multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approach, clinical variability in course and outcome, controversies in methods for measuring end-points and other methodological barriers (i.e. difficulties in maintaining blinding, high risk of "trial effect", and so on).

A solid clinical expertise, therefore, represents the only reliable guide for clinical practice. However, many factors limit transferability of specialists' opinion and its use in defining the "good clinical practice". Different background (surgical, medical, nursing, podiatry, etc.), as well as specific case mix and even individual attitudes or interests, contributes to create a great heterogeneity in experts' approaches, which often reflects in nonsystematic reviews and other informal consensus-based documents.

Many of these flaws can be addressed by more systematic consensus development methods. Our project aimed to avoid bias among discussants, through the adoption of a rigid methodological frame and involvement of an international, largely representative, panel. Furthermore, formal consensus conferences allow reasons of controversies to become explicit, avoiding disagreements strictly related to misunderstandings over terms or definitions. Clear measure of grade of consent, identification of most urgent gray areas to propone for future research, and trading off of interests coming from different specialties and professions are other relevant benefits of these initiatives.

Lacerations — summary recommendations in the wilderness: Most lacerations can be safely closed in the wilderness. Grossly contaminated wounds should be left open and packed with wet to dry dressings. A clean, but not sterile, field is adequate for wound care. Obvious devitalized tissue should be debrided if it can be done so safely. Foreign debris should be removed, although the wound should not be extended for the purpose of retrieving foreign bodies not visible on gentle exploration of the wound. Wounds should be irrigated early with potable water. No additive should be added to the irrigation fluid or applied to the wound. Tissue adhesives are effective in wounds requiring a low-tension closure. Sutures or staples should be considered in more complex wounds requiring closure under tension. Staples should never be used on the face.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^8b18d847]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Stab wounds

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of stab wounds?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested in simple stab wounds that involve only soft tissue. The exceptions to this recommendation are specific wound-related concerns or underlying patient factors that would increase the risk in which 24 hours or less of antibiotics would be appropriate (table 2).

Discussion: Stab wounds can range from small but deep lacerations to more shallow wounds akin to simple lacerations. They are caused by objects of variable cleanliness. Like all wounds, irrigation and debridement of any devitalized tissue are paramount for infection prevention. Adequate irrigation of the deepest portions of stab wounds can be challenging without extension of the skin defect, and opening the wound further may require sedation or a trip to the operating room. This added morbidity must be weighed against potential benefit. Deeper wounds are at higher risk of infection. The nature of the penetrating object, if known, as well as the extent and type of contamination, might sway a clinician's decision about antibiotics if there is a particular concern (eg, contamination with soil or aquatic microbes). Stab wounds that communicate with deeper body cavities or structures are generally managed based on the underlying injury. As mentioned above, tetanus status should be queried and addressed.

DPC is a standard technique used in war wounds, all of which are considered to be markedly contaminated, and has been shown to result in a very low risk of wound infection, including an infection rate of only 2% in punji stake wounds treated with DPC. Most wounds can be treated safely with acute primary closure, while grossly contaminated wounds should be packed open to allow for closure by secondary intention or delayed primary closure (Recommendation grade: 1B).

### Dog and cat bites: rapid evidence review [^452247e1]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Animal bites are a significant burden to health care systems worldwide. In the United States, dog bites account for an average of 337,000 emergency visits and generate medical costs of up to $2 billion per year. Most animal bites in adults and children are from a dog, and most bite patients are children who have been bitten by animals known to them. Dog bites may cause crush and soft-tissue avulsion, whereas cat bites usually cause deeper puncture-type wounds. Children most often present with dog bites on the head and neck, and adolescents and adults usually present with dog bites on the extremities and hands. Bite wounds should be examined, cleaned, and irrigated with warm water or normal saline solution, and any foreign bodies and devitalized tissue should be removed. Neurovascular function (e.g., pulses, sensation) and range and movement of adjacent joints should be examined and documented. Antibiotic prophylaxis, with amoxicillin/clavulanate as the first-line choice, should be considered for all bites, particularly for those at increased risk of infection. Imaging and laboratory studies are usually not required unless there is suspicion of a retained foreign body, damage to underlying structures, infection, or extensive injury. Primary closure of bite wounds may be performed if there is low risk of infection. The need for tetanus vaccination and rabies postexposure prophylaxis should be evaluated for each patient; bites that do not break the skin generally do not require rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

### Timing and management of surgical site infections in patients with open fracture wounds: a fluid lavage of open wounds cohort secondary analysis [^c98cfb7c]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Many studies report on the incidence or prevalence of fracture-related surgical site infections (SSIs) after open fractures; however, few studies report on their timing and management outcomes. To address this gap, we used data from the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds trial to determine timing of diagnosis, management, and resolution of SSIs.

Methods

All participants included in this analysis had an SSI after an open fracture. Participants were assigned to a group based on the type of SSI as follows: (1) those who developed a superficial SSI and (2) those who had either a deep or organ/space SSI. Descriptive statistics characterized the type, timing, and management of each SSI.

Results

Of the 2445 participants in the Fluid Lavage of Open Wounds trial, 325 (13.3%) had an SSI. Superficial SSIs were diagnosed significantly earlier [26.5 days, interquartile range (IQR) 12–48] than deep or organ/space SSIs (53 days, IQR 15–119). Of the 325 patients with SSIs, 174 required operative management and 151 were treated nonoperatively. For SSIs managed operatively, median time for infection resolution was 73 days (IQR 28–165), and on average, 1.73 surgeries (95% confidence interval 1.58–1.88) were needed during the 12 months follow-up. There were 24 cases whose SSIs were not resolved at the time of the final follow-up visit (12 months).

Conclusions

Based on this study's findings and in contradistinction to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, after an open fracture, superficial SSIs were diagnosed at one month and deep/organ/space SSIs at 2 months. This information can allow for earlier infection detection. In addition, the knowledge that approximately 50% of the SSIs in our study required a reoperation and 3 months at a minimum to resolve will assist orthopaedic surgeons when counseling their patients.

Pre-septal cellulitis — clinical features, common sources, and likely organisms are described: Pre-septal cellulitis is characterized by inflammation of the eyelids, conjunctiva, and surrounding skin without involvement of deeper tissues and no pain with eye movements, with symptoms including eyelid erythema, warmth, tenderness and fluctuant lymphedema or swelling that can extend over the nasal bridge to the opposite eyelids usually accompanied by low-grade fever and elevated white blood cell count. Often there is a history of sinusitis, insect bite, dacryocystitis, local skin abrasion, laceration, dental abscess, or puncture wound. Culture of open wounds, weeping vesicles, purulent nasal drainage, and conjunctival discharge often yield S. aureus, β-hemolytic streptococci, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and/or P. aeruginosa, and rapid treatment often yields a good outcome.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^2df8a529]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — Open wound closure — Closing an open wound when it is feasible to without any gross contamination is recommended, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Two high quality and four low quality studies have addressed primary closure and concluded it is safe in selected wounds after adequate formal operative debridement by an experienced surgeon(s). In a series of 349 Type 1/2/3A lower extremity injuries, the rate of infection was more than four times higher in those managed with delayed primary closure compared to those closed immediately. Only the Russell (1990) study reported a higher risk of deep infection following primary closure of Type 1/2/3A injuries (14%) compared to delayed closure of similar wounds (0%). After thorough operative debridement by an experienced surgeon, primary closure of many open fractures can be considered safe and effective; this action very likely decreases the risk of deep infection, and is associated with a shorter length of stay, fewer procedures during the initial hospitalization, and a reduced risk of later developing further complications. Minimizing the possibility of infection is extremely important because infection almost always leads to additional surgery and prolonged hospitalization.

### Management of presumed benign giant ovarian cysts: a minimally invasive technique using the alexis laparoscopic system [^5d6f8d6a]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate a minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of presumed benign giant cysts using the Alexis Laparoscopic System (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA), which includes a wound protector/retractor and a laparoscopic "cap".

Design

Step-by-step explanation of the procedure using videos.

Setting

The incidence of presumed benign giant ovarian cysts is rare. The standard surgical treatment traditionally requires gaining access by a midline laparotomy to facilitate retrieval of the resected specimen and minimize the risk of cyst spillage. Various minimally invasive techniques (ultrasound-guided or laparoscopic-guided intracystic aspiration methods) have been described in the last few decades to reduce morbidity associated with open surgery. Nonetheless, these techniques are poorly standardized and have not seen widespread use. They have been shown to be fairly technically complex to perform, and are sometimes unreliable in cases of unexpected malignancy.

Interventions

We propose a standardization of the minimally invasive surgical treatment of presumed benign giant ovarian cysts using the Alexis Laparoscopic System. We were driven by the advantages provided by the Alexis wound protector/retractor used in other surgical disciplines. This device allows for better surgical exposure and oncologic safety. The preoperative criteria for selection are very strict, to minimize the risk of unexpected malignancy.

Conclusion

The use of the Alexis Laparoscopic System for the surgical management of presumed benign giant ovarian cysts offers excellent exposure and control, representing a safe alternative over other minimally invasive surgical procedures. This reproducible technique allows for reduced risk of intestinal or vascular injury by avoiding blind punctures; reduced risk of parietal tumoral seeding with use of the wound protector; reduced risk of intra-abdominal cyst spillage due to appropriate surgical exposure with the wound retractor, which allows tight closure of the puncture site; the possibility of converting the open surgery access into a standard laparoscopy using a laparoscopic "cap" that maintains pneumoperitoneum without tricks.

### Pressure injuries: prevention, evaluation, and management [^e2c2c82e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pressure injuries are localized damage to skin or soft tissue. They commonly occur over bony prominences and often present as an intact or open wound. Pressure injuries are common and costly, and they significantly impact patient quality of life. Comprehensive skin assessments are crucial for evaluating pressure injuries. Staging of pressure injuries should follow the updated staging system of the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel. Risk assessments allow for appropriate prevention and care planning, and physicians should use a structured, repeatable approach. Prevention of pressure injuries focuses on assessing and optimizing nutritional status, repositioning the patient, and providing appropriate support surfaces. Treatment involves pressure off-loading, nutritional optimization, appropriate bandage selection, and wound site management. Pressure injuries and surrounding areas should be cleaned, with additional debridement of devitalized tissue and biofilm if necessary. All injuries should be monitored for local infection, biofilms, and osteomyelitis. Appropriate wound dressings should be selected based on injury stage and the quality and volume of exudate.

WHAT TO EXPECT

Do not be discouraged if you do not see immediate improvement.

Do not stop treatment at the first sign of improvement.

While using Panretin®gel, you may experience some local effects such as redness, discomfort, itching, and skin peeling or flaking at the area of application. Other possible local skin effects include: rawness, surface or deep cracking, scabbing, crusting, drainage, oozing, or infection. Should these or other effects become troublesome to you, consult your health care provider. He or she can provide information on how to manage these effects.

HOW QUICKLY CAN I EXPECT PANRETIN® GEL TO WORK?

Be patient. Panretin®gel takes time to work, up to 14 weeks or more of treatment. In clinical trials, few patients experienced the onset of response as early as two (2) weeks; most patients who responded required at least four (4) to eight (8) weeks of treatment, and some patients did not experience significant improvement until 14 or more weeks of treatment. Continue to use Panretin®gel as instructed by your health care provider.

Evacuate

If the patient shows signs of airway compromise due to suspected haematoma, a systematic approach should be taken to open the wound at the bed‐side, ensuring the superficial and deep layers (strap muscles) are opened to prevent ongoing haematoma formation. For this we recommend using the following 'SCOOP' approach: skin exposure; cut sutures; open skin; open muscles; pack wound (Grade D; Fig. 3). The SCOOP approach was originally developed in response to a patient incident and has been adopted by several organisations since introduction. Local anaesthetic infiltration is not required when opening the wound (Grade D).

Should haematoma evacuation fail to stabilise the patient, with no resolution of airway compromise and/or further patient deterioration, tracheal intubation is indicated. Operating theatre staff should be made aware of the patient to arrange a timely return to theatre (Grade D). Local procedures may require this to be done separately to informing the anaesthetist.

### Hospital level under-utilization of minimally invasive surgery in the United States: retrospective review [^48df71b6]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Surgical complications

As a secondary analysis, we measured complications associated with minimally invasive surgery compared with open surgery for each procedure type using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality patient safety indicators for surgical care. These included wound infection, wound dehiscence, deep vein thrombosis, pneumonia, sepsis, postoperative hemorrhage or hematoma, postoperative metabolic derangements, accidental puncture or laceration, and in-patient death during the index hospitalization. The generalized linear mixed logistic regression model used to identify the incidence of complications by procedure type used the same hospital and individual level predictors as the above described model to predict utilization of minimally invasive surgery with the addition of minimally invasive surgery as a predictor rather than as the outcome.

The spotted deer Axis axis is a Cervidae mammal that lives in most parts of Southeast Asia. Spotted deer attacks on humans are scarcely reported in the literature and are a rare phenomenon. A 31-y-old man was attacked by an unprovoked male spotted deer while supervising maintenance inside a deer enclosure. The victim received deep lacerations in the lower limbs and puncture wounds in the chest and abdomen. The victim made a full recovery after prompt management at a tertiary care hospital. The potential factors leading to this uncommon attack are discussed.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^3be86197]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — incidence, classification, and timing: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common adverse events affecting hospitalized surgical patients, with an average incidence of SSI of 2.6%, accounting for 38% of nosocomial infections in surgical patients. SSIs are divided into the categories of superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ/space SSI. Superficial incisional SSIs involve only the subcutaneous space between the skin and underlying muscular fascia, occur within 30 days of the surgery, and are documented with at least 1 of the following: purulent incisional drainage; positive culture of aseptically obtained fluid or tissue from the superficial wound; local signs and symptoms of pain or tenderness, swelling, and erythema after the incision is opened by the surgeon; or diagnosis of SSI by the attending surgeon or physician. A deep incisional infection involves the deeper soft tissue and occurs within 30 days of the operation or within 1 year if a prosthesis was inserted, and an organ/space SSI has the same time constraints and evidence for infection and may involve any part of the anatomy other than the original surgical incision. Flat, erythematous skin changes can occur around or near a surgical incision during the first week without swelling or wound drainage, most resolve without any treatment, and the cause may relate to tape sensitivity or other local tissue insult not involving bacteria. Antibiotics begun immediately postoperatively or continued for long periods after the procedure do not prevent or cure this inflammation or infection; therefore, the suspicion of possible SSI does not justify use of antibiotics without a definitive diagnosis and measures such as opening the wound. SSIs rarely occur during the first 48 hours after surgery and are almost always due to S. pyogenes or Clostridium species when they do; after 48 hours, SSI is a more common source of fever and, by 4 days after surgery, a fever is equally likely to be caused by an SSI or by another infection or other unknown sources.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons appropriate use criteria: prevention of surgical site infections after major extremity trauma [^2a126c5d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

High-energy extremity trauma rates can be difficult to precisely state given the complexity of contributing combined mechanisms; however, the rate of open fractures in the United States is 11.5 to 13 per 100,000 people. The management of high-energy extremity fractures presents many challenges for treating surgeons, including elevated risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). In recent studies, higher risk closed injuries are associated with deep SSI rates as high as 19% after surgical treatment and for severe open injuries, which rate surpasses 30%. Fracture-related infections are associated with notable costs and decreased long-term functional outcomes. Identified risk factors for the development of deep SSIs are primarily related to the severity of injury and its location. The quality of the vast literature identifying available interventions to decrease the risk of developing SSIs is highly variable, and it is unclear how consistently these interventions are applied.

### Effect of negative pressure wound therapy vs standard wound management on 12-month disability among adults with severe open fracture of the lower limb: the WOLLF randomized clinical trial [^5dd50d84]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Open fractures of the lower limb occur when a broken bone penetrates the skin. There can be major complications from these fractures, which can be life-changing.

Objectives

To assess the disability, rate of deep infection, and quality of life in patients with severe open fracture of the lower limb treated with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) vs standard wound management after the first surgical debridement of the wound.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter randomized trial performed in the UK Major Trauma Network, recruiting 460 patients aged 16 years or older with a severe open fracture of the lower limb from July 2012 through December 2015. Final outcome data were collected through November 2016. Exclusions were presentation more than 72 hours after injury and inability to complete questionnaires.

Interventions

NPWT (n = 226) in which an open-cell solid foam or gauze was placed over the surface of the wound and connected to a suction pump, creating a partial vacuum over the dressing, vs standard dressings not involving application of negative pressure (n = 234).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Disability Rating Index score (range, 0 [no disability] to 100 [completely disabled]) at 12 months was the primary outcome measure, with a minimal clinically important difference of 8 points. Secondary outcomes were complications including deep infection and quality of life (score ranged from 1 [best possible] to -0.59 [worst possible]; minimal clinically important difference, 0.08) collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

Results

Among 460 patients who were randomized (mean age, 45.3 years; 74% men), 88% (374/427) of available study participants completed the trial. There were no statistically significant differences in the patients' Disability Rating Index score at 12 months (mean score, 45.5 in the NPWT group vs 42.4 in the standard dressing group; mean difference, -3.9 [95% CI, -8.9 to 1.2]; P = 0.13), in the number of deep surgical site infections (16 [7.1%] in the NPWT group vs 19 [8.1%] in the standard dressing group; difference, 1.0% [95% CI, -4.2% to 6.3%]; P = 0.64), or in quality of life between groups (difference in EuroQol 5-dimensions questionnaire, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.05 to 0.08]; Short Form-12 Physical Component Score, 0.5 [95% CI, -3.1 to 4.1] and Mental Health Component Score, -0.4 [95% CI, -2.2 to 1.4]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with severe open fracture of the lower limb, use of NPWT compared with standard wound dressing did not improve self-rated disability at 12 months. The findings do not support this treatment for severe open fractures.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2024 update [^6d0ae315]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Frostbite hospitalization — triage and setting: Hospital admission and discharge are determined on an individual basis, considering severity of the injury, coexisting injuries, comorbidities, and need for hospital-based interventions (tPA, vasodilators, surgery) or supportive therapy, as well as ease of access to appropriate community medical and nursing support. Significant swelling should prompt evaluation for compartment syndrome and admission for observation. Patients with superficial frostbite can usually be managed as outpatients or with brief inpatient stays followed by wound care instructions, and initially deep frostbite should be managed in an inpatient setting. Recommendation: Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Management of the no-option foot: deep vein arterialization [^66752415]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of peripheral artery disease continues to rise worldwide, with a concomitant rise in the subset of patients who manifest with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). A mainstay of CLTI treatment is revascularization through open surgical bypass, endovascular therapy, or hybrid approaches combining the two modalities. However, a significant proportion of these patients are considered to have nonreconstructable, or no-option, CLTI. This is related to either significant pedal arterial occlusive disease or lack of a bypass conduit. Deep vein arterialization has been used as a potential treatment option for this cohort of patients. We explore the various described methodologies of deep vein arterialization, including open, hybrid, and totally percutaneous. These studies suggest that deep vein arterialization is a promising treatment paradigm for patients with no-option CLTI, with encouraging results in terms of technical feasibility, wound healing, and ultimately limb salvage. However, further study of appropriate patient selection, standardization of techniques, and long-term follow-up are needed.

### Challenges and management of surgical site occurrences [^6af23ff7]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Postoperative complications such as surgical site infections, dehiscence, seromas, and hematomas prolong wound care and impose significant cost increases to patients and healthcare providers. Clinicians aiming to reduce the incidence of these complications should be aware of risk factors associated with surgical type, procedures used, patient characteristics, and postoperative care. Today, improved guidelines and general practices for managing surgical incisions have reduced the incidence of complications to historic lows. In addition to these standard care options, advanced wound care approaches have been extensively studied and exist as options for clinicians to provide adjunctive postoperative support and facilitate wound healing. These systems include advanced wound dressings and closed-incision negative-pressure therapy. Advanced wound care is not appropriate in all settings, and healthcare providers must assess each case for specific needs to be addressed by the available incision management plans. Emerging therapies that are intended to improve the continuum of postoperative care should continue to be evaluated in controlled clinical trials to determine their effectiveness under different circumstances and to support the creation of more robust guidelines for their use.

### Deep sternal wound infection after cardiac surgery [^86d56bd5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The incidence of deep sternal wound infection after open heart surgery was 1.8% in JACVSD registry from 2004 to 2009. Once, deep sternum infection occurs, it showed high mortality. Especially, more invasive procedure showed higher mortality. When re-exploration due to bleeding was required, the mortality elevated extremely high. DSWI is severe complication after open heart surgery. Prevention of DSWI, avoiding to re-exploration for bleeding, earlier decision for re-exploration for bleeding, contrivance of appropriate means of wound closure, and development of the appropriate treatment for DSWI are important to improve the prognosis of cardiac surgery.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^caebc6de]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Prevention of Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated more than ten years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk of neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unimmunized woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; one of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to the current guidance. She should complete the 3-dose primary series at the recommended intervals.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management

ACIP has recommended administering tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) when indicated as part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus (Table 6). A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated as part of wound management if more than five years has passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous vaccination with Tdap, Td should be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated and Td is unavailable, Tdap may be administered.

Abbreviations: DTaP = diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine; Tdap = tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis; Td = tetanus and diphtheria toxoids; TIG = tetanus immune globulin.

* Such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, and saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; and wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, and frostbite.

† DTaP is recommended for children aged < 7 years. Tdap is preferred to Td for persons aged ≥ 11 years who have not previously received Tdap. Persons aged ≥ 7 years who are not fully immunized against pertussis, tetanus or diphtheria should receive one dose of Tdap for wound management and as part of the catch-up series.

### Device evaluation, treatment, and explantation recommendations (DETER): review and best practices for managing neuromodulation device infections [^7c504c0a]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Assessment and Management of Infection

Even with the best surgical technique, a post-surgical infection may still occur. There are three SSI categories – superficial, deep, and organ/space (see Figure 2). The main differences between superficial and deep SSI are location and the presence of an abscess. Abscesses are more likely to be caused by deep infections and can track into the neuraxis. The focus for neuromodulatory devices will be on superficial and deep SSIs, as organ/space infections are uncommon in SCS procedures. Appropriate treatment of superficial and deep infections should prevent more severe systemic infections like sepsis.

The initial step in managing suspected infection is completing an in-person history and physical exam. Patient vitals should be obtained, and the wound should be directly visualized and examined for rubor (erythema), calor (warmth to touch), dolor (pain to touch), and tumor (edema of surrounding tissues). Hyper- or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, night sweats, chills, and other constitutional signs should be assessed. Localized pruritus, purulent discharge, and wound dehiscence are all concerns for underlying infection. If the patient appears well and vital signs are within normal limits, an attempt should be made to collect a wound culture from purulent drainage for microbial analysis and baseline labs. Depending on the severity and depth of the infection, frequent in-person wound checks, as well as intermittent labs, are recommended. Recent data for SSI with SCS devices has demonstrated increased salvage rates with appropriate and aggressive initial intervention.

### Device evaluation, treatment, and explantation recommendations (DETER): review and best practices for managing neuromodulation device infections [^fd98f874]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Decision to Explant - Recommendations and Strategies

When an infection is suspected, swab or blood microbial cultures are crucial in choosing appropriate antibiotics. However, initiating empirical antibiotics should not be delayed due to pending culture results and can be adjusted based on culture sensitivity. There is unequivocal evidence that intraoperative incision and drainage of an abscess are superior to targeted antibiotic treatment alone.

When there is a deep infection or unsuccessful treatment of a superficial infection, the entire implanted system should be removed entirely. This includes the ITP and catheter or pulse generator and leads, regardless of whether the lead is percutaneous or paddle-type. Partial explantation is not advised as it can lead to delayed spinal infections, which pose significant risks. Comprehensive explantation is essential to ensure effective infection management and prevent serious complications.

After removing infected tissue and purulent material, copious low-pressure irrigation is recommended. As discussed earlier in this review, while the current pain-specific literature has not found strong evidence supporting the use of antibiotic irrigation in neuromodulation procedures, some practitioners have adopted its use based on its demonstrated utility in neurosurgical practice. Achieving adequate hemostasis before wound closure is crucial, as blood or venous fluid can impede wound healing and serve as a nidus for bacterial growth and infections.

Depending on the severity of the infection, there are various ways to close the incisions. The NACC guideline recommends using triclosan-coated Vicryl and PDS II sutures for contaminated wounds. For mild cases, the incisions can be closed primarily. For complicated infections, consideration should be given to closing via secondary intention with serial packing or drain placement.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has demonstrated benefits in reducing wound complications in high-risk surgeries, such as oncoplastic breast surgery and cardiac procedures. For example, a multicenter breast surgery study found a 5.6% wound infection rate with NPWT, significantly lower than the 25% reported in larger studies. Similarly, cardiac surgery data show a 40% reduction in deep surgical site infections. The evidence supporting NPWT's routine use for neuromodulation patients is limited. More data are needed to establish its effectiveness in reducing infection risks in this specific population. Consultation with a general surgeon may be obtained if the wound closure is complicated. Close follow-up with the surgeon, infectious disease, and wound care specialists are recommended.

Access site management for EVAR — complications and percutaneous versus open access: Early open femoral exposure had a high rate of access site-related complications (13%) including arterial dissection or perforation (1.4%); bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm (6.6%); arterial thrombosis (2.2%); embolization (1.1%); wound infection, skin necrosis, or lymphocele (1.4%); and amputation (0.1%). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, percutaneous access was superior to open femoral artery access with a shorter procedure time (107 vs 141 minutes; P = 0.004) and fewer access complications (6% vs 10%; P = 0.005), with a 96% technical success rate. A systematic review and NSQIP review found shorter operative time (135 vs 152 minutes), shorter length of stay (1 vs 2 days) and fewer wound complications (1% vs 2.1%; P = 0.02). Percutaneous access may not be appropriate for small vessels, high femoral artery bifurcation, calcification or a femoral aneurysm; prior groin surgery and obesity may reduce success rates, and ultrasound guidance improves large-sheath access.

This includes S. aureus, α-, β-, and γ-hemolytic streptococci, several genera of gram-negative organisms, and several anaerobes. Pasteurella multocida infection classically occurs after cat bites but can also occur after dog bites; lesions caused by this organism develop quickly and are often painful. Patients lacking spleens are at particular risk for severe cellulitis and sepsis due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection after dog bites. Management of cat and dog bites includes consideration of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as tetanus immunization and antibiotic treatment. Avoid primary closure of dog bites to the hand or puncture wounds anywhere on the body.

### Wound management in disaster settings [^418808ce]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Few guidelines exist for the initial management of wounds in disaster settings. As wounds sustained are often contaminated, there is a high risk of further complications from infection, both local and systemic. Healthcare workers with little to no surgical training often provide early wound care, and where resources and facilities are also often limited, and clear appropriate guidance is needed for early wound management.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review focusing on the nature of wounds in disaster situations, and the outcomes of wound management in recent disasters. We then presented the findings to an international consensus panel with a view to formulating a guideline for the initial management of wounds by first responders and subsequent healthcare personnel as they deploy.

Results

We included 62 studies in the review that described wound care challenges in a diverse range of disasters, and reported high rates of wound infection with multiple causative organisms. The panel defined a guideline in which the emphasis is on not closing wounds primarily but rather directing efforts toward cleaning, debridement, and dressing wounds in preparation for delayed primary closure, or further exploration and management by skilled surgeons.

Conclusion

Good wound care in disaster settings, as outlined in this article, can be achieved with relatively simple measures, and have important mortality and morbidity benefits.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic timing and dosage — Prophylactic antibiotic agents are, by definition, those that are administered before creation of an incision or puncture wound. Recommendations from The Joint Commission specify that intravenous (IV) antibiotic agents be administered within 1 hour of an incision, and a recent large surgical study reiterated support for the 60-minute time frame and found no evidence to narrow the window. A repeat dose of antibiotic agents should be administered if a period of 2 hours has lapsed from initial dose. Administration after a procedure has been associated with 4 times the number of infectious complications, equivalent to rates encountered when no prophylaxis is administered.

Rabies exposure management in wilderness wound care — After rabies virus exposure in previously unvaccinated persons, prompt postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is nearly universally effective in preventing human rabies, and PEP combines local wound care, infiltration with human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) into and around the wound, and multiple doses of rabies cell-culture vaccine. Rabies PEP is effective in preventing human rabies. Recommendation grade: 1B. In the wilderness setting, the one critical intervention that can be performed in the field is appropriate wound cleansing; this should be done with soap and water or, if available, irrigation with a virucidal agent (ie, povidone-iodine; or the more commonly available chlorine dioxide), and local wound care may significantly decrease rabies risk. Wounds that might require suturing should undergo delayed primary closure at 4 days, and wounds with a risk of rabies exposure should be irrigated, preferably with a virucidal agent, and closure should be delayed for 4 days. Recommendation grade: 1C. All bites, regardless of body site or evidence of gross trauma, represent a potential risk, and prophylaxis for suspected rabies exposure is a medical urgency, but not an emergency.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^45019861]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

### Puncture wounds… [^e2e88a62]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Puncture wounds are a common and usually innocuous form of minor trauma in children. In selected cases, especially those involving the plantar surface of the foot, serious complications can arise. The focus of this article is a practical approach to puncture wounds in general and plantar wounds in particular. Wounds involving the chest, abdomen, neck, and eye are potentially serious forms of penetrating trauma and, therefore, are beyond the scope of this article. Puncture wounds account for 3% to 5% of all traumatic injuries presenting to pediatric emergency departments and are more common in summer months. The majority involve the plantar surface of the foot. Other common sites include the legs, arms, hands, and less commonly, the trunk and head. Plantar puncture wounds commonly are caused by nails, although wood, metal, plastic, and glass are relatively common causes. Comments

### Clinical application of the intersphincteric approach with internal incision combined with counter-drainage for deep perianal abscess [^3225bf77]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Control group

The abscess was aspirated from the most prominent area for bacterial culture. A radial incision was made at the aspiration site, extending through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and abscess wall. The index finger was used to separate septa within the abscess cavity, ensuring complete drainage of the pus. Infected necrotic tissue inside the cavity was scraped and cleared. For excessively large abscess cavities, multiple rubber band drains were used, while rubber tube drains were placed for deep cavities. The abscess cavity was thoroughly irrigated with hydrogen peroxide, and Vaseline gauze was used to pack the cavity. The packing was removed 24 h postoperatively.

Treament group

IAICD involves the excision of the internal opening and drainage of the pus cavity. The specific surgical procedures are as follows: preoperative transrectal ultrasound or MRI was used to determine the position of the internal opening. The puncture and pus aspiration methods were the same as those in the control group. A radial incision was made at the puncture site, serving as the main drainage opening. For patients with a preoperatively identified internal opening, a spherical probe was inserted into the abscess cavity and guided to exit at the dentate line corresponding to the internal opening. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa, and internal sphincter overlying the probe were sequentially incised from the intersphincteric space to the internal opening, creating a V-shaped incision with a broad inner base and a narrow external opening, which facilitated effective postoperative wound drainage (Fig. 2 A). In cases where the internal opening could not be accurately located, prophylactic resection of the anal recess was performed at the thinnest point of the dentate line, as described above.

Data extraction and management

We extracted and summarised details of the eligible studies using a data extraction sheet. Two review authors (two of CR, TS, GN, RA and AR) extracted data independently and resolved disagreements by discussion, drawing on a third review author (JD) where required. Where key data were missing from reports, we attempted to contact the study authors to obtain this information. Where a study with more than two intervention arms was included, we only extracted data from intervention and control groups that met the eligibility criteria.

We extracted the following data, where possible, by treatment group for the prespecified interventions and outcomes in this review. We planned to collect outcome data for relevant time points, as described in Types of outcome measures; in practice most studies reported only one time point.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^f7ae66ab]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 5.1.7

In blunt chest trauma, antibiotics showed no protective effect against empyema or pneumonia.

(QoE C low).

Statement 5.1.8

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in blunt chest trauma when inserting a chest drain is required, and mostly in chest penetrating trauma to reduce the risk of empyema and pneumonia. (QoE A high).

Statement 5.1.9

The use of antibiotics for preventing infection in open limb fractures is recommended (QoE A high).

Statement 5.1.10

In soft tissue penetrating injuries, broad spectrum, empirical, intravenous antibiotic therapy should be commenced once deep samples have been obtained, and then tailored once organisms and sensitivities are known. A short course, single agent regimens using cephalosporins in order to prevent adverse outcomes in soft tissue injuries associated with bony injury (open fractures) is recommended. Hand fractures do not require routine prophylaxis. (QoE B moderate).

Statement 5.1.11

A specific antibiotic or preferred dosing when employing local antibiotics in the management of fracture related infections cannot be recommended. (QoE C low).

Statement 5.1.12

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis as a protective factor for SSI after open reduction and internal fixation of ankle and closed extremity fractures is recommended (QoE A high).

Statement 5.1.13

In severely burned patients, the role of an adequate source control including the surgical removal of contaminated material and areas of necrosis and protection of the exposed lesion is crucial in decreasing infectious complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis could protect against septic complications in the high risk patients (QoE C low).

Recommendations 5.1

We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis in penetrating (abdominal, thoracic) trauma, in severely burned and in open fractures in elderly patients to decrease septic complications [Strong recommendation based on a high-moderate quality level of evidence 1A].

Surgical site infection — procedural management and systemic therapy indicate that suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections associated with a significant systemic response, such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5°C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/mL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low).

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).
