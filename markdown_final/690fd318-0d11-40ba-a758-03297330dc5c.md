## Question

Ketones in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what ketones in the urine signify, when and how to test for them, and how to use those results in diagnosing and managing diabetic ketoacidosis and related ketotic states. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to suspect DKA and which baseline labs to obtain. Then, I should decide between blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine ketone testing and review the biochemical limitations of urine dipsticks. Next, I will check preanalytical pitfalls and medication interferences. After that, I should interpret urine ketone findings in clinical context and compare diagnostic accuracy with blood testing. Finally, I will apply special population considerations and integrate all of this into practical recommendations for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up, ensuring my conclusions align with contemporary guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame for DKA recognition and initial labs. Classically, DKA is defined by hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis with low pH and bicarbonate, along with an elevated anion gap, but I need to be careful not to over-rely on glucose because SGLT2 inhibitors can produce euglycemic DKA, so capillary or venous glucose, venous blood gas, electrolytes, renal function, and anion gap should be obtained up front while assessing ketones as an adjunct rather than a replacement for acid-base assessment, especially if ketone measurement is delayed or unavailable, in which case anion gap becomes even more pivotal [^113KospR] [^111f8ug3] [^114mmSiF].

> Hold on, I should verify the best testing method for ketones. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred when available because it directly measures the predominant ketone in DKA, is quantitative, and tracks treatment response more reliably than urine tests, a position endorsed by recent ADA and AAFP guidance and supported by clinical reviews showing improved operational outcomes with blood testing compared with urine acetoacetate methods [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^112H9My1].

> Now, I need to check the biochemistry and limitations of urine ketone dipsticks. Urine dipsticks use the nitroprusside reaction to detect acetoacetate and, variably, acetone, but they do not detect β-hydroxybutyrate, which predominates during DKA; as DKA resolves, β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized back to acetoacetate, so urine ketones can paradoxically rise despite clinical improvement, risking misinterpretation if used for monitoring, hence urine ketone testing is acceptable for screening only when blood testing is unavailable, with caution about its inability to quantify severity or monitor therapy reliably [^113eLXyY] [^114o9ADe] [^116xm6bK] [^116bcBjA].

> Wait, let me verify preanalytical pitfalls for urine testing so I do not jump to conclusions from a misleading result. False negatives can occur with degraded or expired strips exposed to air, highly acidic urine such as after ascorbic acid ingestion, loss of ketones in unsealed specimens due to acetone volatility, or microbial consumption in stale samples, whereas false positives can occur with highly pigmented urine; therefore, I should ensure fresh specimens, sealed containers, in-date strips, and awareness of urine color and pH before interpreting a dipstick [^113eLXyY].

> I should also double-check medication interferences that can skew urine ketone dipsticks and pivot to blood β-hydroxybutyrate if these are present. Sulfhydryl-containing agents such as mesna, succimer, and carbidopa-levodopa can cause false-positive urine ketones with nitroprusside tests, cefiderocol can produce false-positive urine ketones necessitating alternate confirmation, ACE inhibitors have also been implicated, and drugs that acidify urine, such as methenamine hippurate, can promote low pH that reduces nitroprusside reactivity, so a careful medication history is essential before trusting urine results [^112CTDSo] [^116qzp3b] [^116FgpG8] [^1146VvrK] [^113eLXyY] [^112WSnfX].

> Next, I need to ensure interpretation is anchored to acid-base status and the clinical picture. Positive urine ketones indicate ketosis but cannot alone confirm DKA or its severity, and negative urine ketones do not exclude DKA, particularly early in the course or in β-hydroxybutyrate–predominant states; therefore, I should correlate with venous pH, bicarbonate, and anion gap and avoid ruling out DKA solely on a negative urine dip, as emphasized by national guidance [^114o9ADe] [^11423GKR].

> Let me review comparative accuracy so I do not overstate urine dip utility. Prospective ED data show that urine dipsticks and point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate have similar sensitivity for DKA detection around 98 percent, but β-hydroxybutyrate is far more specific at roughly 79 percent compared with about 35 percent for urine, meaning blood testing substantially reduces false positives and unnecessary DKA workups among hyperglycemic patients [^111GPjM9].

> Now, I will examine special populations where my threshold to test and interpret should shift. For patients on SGLT2 inhibitors, I should assess for ketoacidosis whenever symptoms suggest metabolic acidosis regardless of glucose, discontinue the agent, treat promptly, and only restart after complete resolution; in pregnancy, up to about a third of first-morning samples can show ketonuria due to fasting, so I should interpret urine ketones cautiously and prefer blood testing if symptomatic; in preschool children, ISPAD advises blood β-hydroxybutyrate as the primary method because rapid quantitative monitoring is crucial; and in alcoholic or starvation ketoacidosis, glucose can be normal or low and urine ketones may be present, but differentiation from DKA requires full acid-base and metabolic evaluation [^114mmSiF] [^114yDprM] [^114o9ADe] [^114orqys] [^115jrcye].

> Let me integrate this into diagnostic and monitoring steps, being careful with thresholds. For diagnosis, if urine ketones are positive and the clinical picture suggests DKA, I should obtain blood β-hydroxybutyrate and a blood gas to confirm, and if urine ketones are negative but suspicion remains high, I must still obtain blood β-hydroxybutyrate and acid-base studies and not delay treatment; for monitoring confirmed DKA, I should not use urine ketones, and instead trend blood β-hydroxybutyrate with serial acid-base assessment, recognizing that while levels above about 2.5–3.0 mmol per liter often align with DKA in many programs, recent data question the universality of a 3.0 mmol per liter cutoff and underscore that pH and bicarbonate must be measured regardless of β-hydroxybutyrate values, so I will act early when β-hydroxybutyrate is between roughly 1.5 and 3.0 mmol per liter if the clinical picture is concerning and always confirm with acid-base status [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^114QEcyy] [^1112kAyE] [^117Vb2Nc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I started to assert that blood ketone use improves outcomes; let me verify that with evidence. Systematic review data, albeit limited and heterogeneous, suggest that blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing compared with urine testing can reduce hospitalizations, shorten time to DKA resolution, and improve satisfaction and costs, which supports using blood testing as standard of care whenever feasible in both diagnosis and monitoring, while reserving urine ketones for initial screening when blood assays are not accessible [^112H9My1].

Ketones in urine (ketonuria) indicate increased fat metabolism due to low insulin or carbohydrate availability [^116QT6D3] [^113cqDiA]. Urine ketone testing is **rapid and inexpensive** but detects acetoacetate, not β-hydroxybutyrate, and can give false results [^113eLXyY] [^112CTDSo]. Blood **β-hydroxybutyrate testing** is preferred for diagnosing and monitoring DKA [^111N7noh] [^113KospR], especially with SGLT2 inhibitors or euglycemic DKA [^114mmSiF]. Ketonuria can occur in diabetes, fasting, ketogenic diets, pregnancy, and with certain drugs; persistent or high ketones need prompt evaluation to prevent complications [^114o9ADe].

---

## Physiological basis of ketone production

Ketone bodies are produced in the liver from fatty acids during low-insulin or low-carbohydrate states [^116QT6D3]. The primary ketone bodies are **acetoacetate**, **β-hydroxybutyrate**, and **acetone** [^113cqDiA]. In **insulin deficiency**, increased lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation drive ketogenesis [^113cqDiA] [^116QT6D3].

---

## Clinical significance of ketones in urine

Ketonuria signals increased fat metabolism and may reflect normal or pathological states. It commonly occurs with **diabetes, fasting, ketogenic diets** [^113cqDiA], **pregnancy** [^111HdnKv], and **certain medications** [^114jJqrA].

---

## Conditions associated with ketonuria

| **Condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Diabetes mellitus (DKA) | Insulin deficiency increases lipolysis and ketogenesis [^113cqDiA] [^113KospR] |
| Fasting/starvation | Low carbohydrates increase fat metabolism [^113cqDiA] [^115jrcye] |
| Ketogenic diets | Low carbohydrates increase fat metabolism [^113cqDiA] [^112ZueNY] |
| Pregnancy | Increased energy needs and insulin resistance [^111HdnKv] |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Increased ketogenesis and euglycemic DKA risk [^114jJqrA] [^114mmSiF] |

## Methods for detecting ketones in urine

Urine ketones are typically detected with dipsticks using the nitroprusside reaction, which detects acetoacetate and some acetone but not β-hydroxybutyrate [^113eLXyY] [^116bcBjA]. This method is rapid, inexpensive, and **widely available** [^113eLXyY].

---

## Accuracy and reliability of urine ketone testing

Urine ketone testing is sensitive but has **important limitations**:

- **False positives**: Highly pigmented urine, sulfhydryl drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors, mesna), and certain antibiotics (e.g. cefiderocol) [^113eLXyY] [^112CTDSo] [^1146VvrK] [^116FgpG8] [^116qzp3b].
- **False negatives**: Highly acidic urine, ascorbic acid, and reagent deterioration [^113eLXyY].
- **Lag time**: Reflects past ketone excretion, not current levels [^113eLXyY].

---

## Clinical implications of persistent ketonuria

Persistent **ketonuria** may indicate serious conditions, such as diabetic ketoacidosis — a life-threatening state of insulin deficiency [^113KospR] — starvation ketosis from prolonged fasting or malnutrition [^115jrcye] [^113cqDiA], and alcoholic ketoacidosis due to chronic alcohol use with poor nutrition [^116QT6D3].

---

## Management strategies for elevated ketones in urine

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **DKA**: Insulin, fluids, electrolytes, and treat precipitating factors [^113cqDiA] [^113KospR] [^1135r4eb].
- **Starvation ketosis**: Gradual refeeding and hydration [^113cqDiA] [^115jrcye].
- **Alcoholic ketoacidosis**: Glucose, thiamine, and hydration.

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Preventive strategies include **regular ketone monitoring** during illness, stress, or high glucose [^113cqDiA] [^113KospR], and maintaining a balanced diet to avoid prolonged fasting or extreme low-carb diets [^113cqDiA] [^115jrcye]. Consistent adherence to insulin or other antidiabetic therapy is also recommended [^113cqDiA] [^114mmSiF].

---

## Potential complications of untreated ketonuria

Untreated ketonuria can lead to **diabetic ketoacidosis**, with severe metabolic acidosis and electrolyte disturbances, particularly potassium and sodium [^113cqDiA] [^113KospR]. It can also cause dehydration from osmotic diuresis [^113cqDiA] [^116dywr1].

---

## Recent advancements in ketone detection

Recent advances in detection include:

- **Blood ketone meters**: Rapid β-hydroxybutyrate measurement [^111N7noh] [^114QEcyy].
- **Continuous ketone monitoring**: Real-time interstitial ketone tracking [^112593dJ].
- **Breath ketone analyzers**: Noninvasive acetone measurement [^112ZueNY].

---

Ketones in urine reflect increased fat metabolism from low insulin or carbohydrate availability. Urine testing is convenient but limited; **blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred** for DKA diagnosis and monitoring. Persistent ketonuria needs prompt evaluation to prevent complications [^113KospR] [^112H9My1].

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113eLXyY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Urine ketones**:
	1. **Preanalytical**: The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

	2. **Analytical**: Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

### Mesnex [^112CTDSo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

- **Laboratory test interferences**: MESNEX can cause various test interferences.

	- **False-positive urine tests for ketone bodies**: A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with MESNEX when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests, including dipstick tests. Adding glacial acetic acid can differentiate between a false positive result, which produces a cherry-red color that fades, and a true positive result, which produces a red-violet color that intensifies.

	- **False-negative tests for enzymatic CPK activity**: MESNEX may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests utilizing a thiol compound, such as N-acetylcysteine, for CPK reactivation. This interaction can result in a falsely low CPK level.

	- **False-positive tests for ascorbic acid**: MESNEX may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

- **Use in patients with a history of adverse reactions to thiol compounds**: MESNEX is a thiol compound, characterized by a sulfhydryl (SH) group. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It remains unclear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to one thiol compound are at an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to MESNEX.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on blood and breath ketones during supervised insulin withdrawal in adults with type 1 diabetes: A randomized crossover trial [^114jJqrA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors increase ketoacidosis risk, limiting their use in type 1 diabetes. To better understand the pathophysiology of SGLT2 inhibitor-mediated ketoacidosis, we measured blood glucose, capillary blood and plasma β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), and breath acetone (BrACE) during supervised insulin withdrawal in adults with type 1 diabetes with and without dapagliflozin treatment.

Twenty adults with type 1 diabetes underwent supervised insulin withdrawal twice in a randomized crossover design: during usual care and after treatment with dapagliflozin (10 mg daily for 2 weeks plus the test day). After insulin withdrawal, capillary blood glucose, BOHB, and BrACE measurements were obtained at least hourly until stopping rules were met: either more than 8 hours had elapsed, symptoms of ketosis appeared, blood glucose exceeded 400 mg/dL, BOHB exceeded 4 mmol/L, or the participant requested to stop.

The peak BOHB and BrACE values achieved during supervised insulin withdrawal were both greater with dapagliflozin than with usual care. Throughout the insulin withdrawal study, dapagliflozin treatment was associated with significantly greater BOHB and BrACE concentrations. The proportions of participants reaching BOHB > 1.5 mmol/L and > 2.5 mmol/L during supervised insulin withdrawal were greater in the dapagliflozin arm. Blood glucose reached a lower peak in the dapagliflozin arm.

In conclusion, in adults with type 1 diabetes undergoing supervised insulin withdrawal, dapagliflozin treatment compared to usual care was associated with greater blood and breath ketone concentrations.

### Feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring in subcutaneous tissue using a ketone sensor [^111yp3sg]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Measuring urine or blood ketone levels using strip-based technology has its limitations; it provides episodic information that confirms an already ongoing ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) event. Early identification of ketone production may warn of impending ketoacidosis, which could reduce the complications of DKA and perhaps even prevent it. Real-time continuous ketone monitoring could also help clinicians manage ketoacidosis. For individuals who are on low carbohydrate diets, the sensor may serve as a tool to monitor the effectiveness of their diet and indicate the effect of diet or exercise on ketone levels.

Blood ketone test strips typically have a measurement range of 0–8 mM. The appropriate measurement range for a ketone sensor is to be determined based on its use scenario. The in vitro performance of the sensor has been demonstrated up to 8 mM, showing that the sensor responds linearly to changes in the concentration of ketones and with minimal variation between sensors. In an in vitro setting, the sensor responds to changes in ketone concentration quickly, with a response time of less than 4 minutes across the measurement range.

Unlike glucose, baseline ketone levels are typically very low, and calibrating the sensor at these concentration levels may not be effective. Therefore, operational stability is critical for a ketone sensor. Achieving operational stability for over 14 days for a NAD+ dependent chemistry is even more challenging, as NAD+ is a free molecule that is difficult to retain in the sensing chemistry.

### Jardiance [^114mmSiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and those at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of severe metabolic acidosis, regardless of blood glucose levels. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Jardiance, promptly evaluate, and treat if confirmed. Ensure ketoacidosis resolution before restarting Jardiance.

Withhold Jardiance in temporary clinical situations that predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume use when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct them to discontinue Jardiance and seek medical attention immediately if symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Jardiance can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Post-marketing reports include cases of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or those on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension.

### Low urine pH: A novel feature of the metabolic syndrome [^112WSnfX]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, decreased urine pH can be caused by acute diarrhea, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute starvation, respiratory acidosis, and renal tubular acidosis. In addition, decreased urine pH can be caused by medications such as methenamine hippurate, diazoxide, vitamin C, and corticotropin repository.

---

### Dhivy [^116FgpG8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Laboratory tests**: DHIVY may cause a positive Coombs test or a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for the determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa-levodopa therapy have been reported. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa levodopa therapy.

- **Depression/suicidality**: All patients taking DHIVY should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^1125mN4N]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation but require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, including kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### The effect of blood ketone concentration and exercise intensity on exogenous ketone oxidation rates in athletes [^113ETCzk]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Low credibility.

After completion of baseline measurements, participants consumed a 400-mL bolus study drink: (i) a calorie-free control drink ("control", bitter flavored water), (ii) a "low"-dose KME drink ("low ketosis"; target blood ketone concentration of 2–3 mM), or (iii) a "high"-dose KME drink ("high ketosis"; target blood ketone concentration of > 4 mM). The order in which participants completed the three study conditions was randomly controlled, and participants were blinded to the condition they were undertaking. Participants then rested for 60 minutes before commencing exercise. After consumption of study drinks, subjects were asked to collect all urine in a provided container.

At t = 0 min, all baseline measurements (as described previously) were repeated. Participants then undertook 60 minutes of continuous ergometer cycling exercise, comprising 20-minute intervals at 25% W Max (t = 0–20 min), 50% W Max (t = 20–40 min), and 75% W Max (t = 40–60 min) exercise intensities. Participants were instructed to maintain a cadence of 80–100 rpm, and the bicycle ergometer was set to the rpm-independent mode. Room temperature and airflow were consistent across study visits. Participants consumed water ad libitum. During exercise, indirect calorimetry (\(\dot{V}O_2, \dot{V}CO_2, \dot{V}E \)), RPE, HR, and gastrointestinal discomfort measurements were made at t = 15, 20, 35, 40, 55, and 60 minutes. Breath and blood samples were collected at t = 20, 40, and 60 minutes. To ensure blood βHB concentrations remained stable throughout exercise, 100-mL study drinks were administered at the end of the 25% W Max and 50% W Max exercise intervals.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113oCyb2]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available, yet there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic due to variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis.

The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement. However, whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB, and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis.

In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis, and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity, and resolution of ketoacidosis.

### Point-of-care capillary blood ketone measurements and the prediction of future ketoacidosis risk in type 1 diabetes [^116oyT6h]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

Rather than during illness while diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is developing, we aimed to determine if levels of routine point-of-care capillary blood ketones could predict future DKA.

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from placebo-assigned participants in an adjunct-to-insulin medication trial program that included measurement of fasted capillary blood ketone levels twice per week in a 2-month baseline period. The outcome was 6- to 12-month trial-adjudicated DKA.

- **Results**: DKA events occurred in 12 of 484 participants at a median of 105 (interquartile range 43, 199) days. Maximum ketone levels were higher in patient cases compared with control patients (0.8 [0.6, 1.2] vs. 0.3 [0.2, 0.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002), with a nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88). Ketone levels ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 78%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.9 and 0.5, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This proof of concept that routine capillary ketone surveillance can identify individuals at high risk of future DKA implies a role for future technologies, including continuous ketone monitoring.

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^114aDuhq]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

As part of an in-home randomized trial assessing an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system, blood and urine ketone levels were measured each morning, irrespective of the blood glucose level, in individuals with type 1 diabetes who were between 15 and 45 years of age. This provided a large data set with standardized data collection for assessing the frequency of morning blood and urine ketone levels and their relationship to the blood glucose level. The measurements from the control mornings provide a relatively unique opportunity to determine the frequency of elevated ketone levels according to the blood glucose level, which can be useful for informing patients as well as for serving as a benchmark for studies involving automated suspension of insulin delivery.

Overall, the frequency of elevated ketone levels was similar after intervention and control nights. Even after ≥ 2 hours of overnight suspension of insulin delivery, the presence of blood ketone levels ≥ 0.6 mmol/L, or moderate or large urine ketone levels was very uncommon (∼1%) and was no higher than it was after intervention nights with no pump suspension or control nights. Moderate elevation of the morning fasting blood glucose level (200–300 mg/dL) increased the likelihood that ketones would be present only slightly and, thus, was not a good predictor of the presence of ketones. There were too few mornings (7 of 977 mornings [0.7%]) with a fasting glucose level > 300 mg/dL and a prolonged pump suspension to assess with reasonable precision the association of these factors with elevated ketone levels.

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report, we illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case demonstrates that while hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably suggest a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and must be excluded. We emphasize the clinical and therapeutic significance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### Continuous ketone monitoring consensus report 2021 [^116hRGBD]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2022). Low credibility.

This article is the work product of the Continuous Ketone Monitoring Consensus Panel, which was organized by the Diabetes Technology Society and met virtually on April 20, 2021. The panel consisted of 20 US-based experts in the use of diabetes technology, representing adult endocrinology, pediatric endocrinology, advanced practice nursing, diabetes care and education, clinical chemistry, and bioengineering. The panelists were from universities, hospitals, freestanding research institutes, government, and private practice.

- **Physiology of ketone production**: Panelists reviewed the medical literature pertaining to ten topics including the physiology of ketone production.
- **Measurement of ketones**: They examined the measurement of ketones and the performance of the first continuous ketone monitor (CKM) reported to be used in human trials.
- **Demographics and epidemiology**: The demographics and epidemiology of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), atypical hyperketonemia, and prevention of DKA were discussed.
- **Non-DKA states**: Review included non-DKA states of fasting ketonemia and ketonuria.
- **Integration with technology**: The potential integration of CKMs with pumps and automated insulin delivery systems to prevent DKA and clinical trials of CKMs were considered.
- **Future of CKMs**: Finally, the future of CKMs was a point of discussion.

The panelists summarized the medical literature for each of the ten topics in this report. They also developed 30 conclusions (amounting to three conclusions for each topic) about CKMs and voted unanimously to adopt these conclusions. This report is intended to support the development of safe and effective continuous ketone monitoring and to apply this technology in ways that will benefit people with diabetes.

### Effects of intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring on blood glucose control and the production of urinary ketone bodies in pregestational diabetes mellitus [^111ck7xT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Traditional methods are unable to fully assess patients' blood glucose levels, which may lead to incorrect assessment and improper clinical treatment. Compared with traditional monitoring methods, intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) can predict and adapt to the dynamic changes of patients' blood glucose throughout the day.

Through the study of different monitoring methods, we found that, compared with traditional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) methods, the lowest blood glucose in patients in the isCGM group mainly appeared between 0:00–5:59, suggesting that low blood glucose is more common at night. Using SMBG to monitor blood glucose, we found that the minimum blood glucose was mainly distributed before meals, and only 8.3% of the minimum blood glucose levels occurred at nighttime. This indicated that the presence of nighttime low blood glucose could not be detected by SMBG alone.

IsCGM monitoring of blood glucose can more accurately decipher hypoglycemia at night and hyperglycemia after breakfast, which can guide clinical medication to better control blood glucose and consequently reduce the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to hyperglycemia.

Our study also has its limitations. First, the study time was limited, and there was a lack of long-term follow-up. Second, the level of blood ketones was not detected in our study, only urine ketones, and many other factors influence urine ketone body formation. Finally, we observed that women in the CGM group had more unplanned exposure than those in the control group, as patients often encountered problems when using CGM, which increased patient contact.

Chemet may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests.

- **Drug interactions**: Chemet may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests.

- **Laboratory test interference**: In vitro studies have shown that Chemet can cause false positive results for ketones in urine when using nitroprusside reagents. It can also falsely decrease measurements of serum uric acid and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).

- **Use with other chelation therapies**: The concomitant administration of Chemet with other chelation therapy, such as CaNa2EDTA, is not recommended.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116414cU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Although not widely available clinically, ketones can also be measured by breath testing. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, which is volatile and exhaled. Advantages include the painless assessment of ketone levels and no necessity for blood exposure or urine collection. Additionally, changes in acetone are dynamic and may provide an early signal of change in a person's metabolic state.

Conversely, breath ketone meters are expensive, the test needs to be user-initiated, and the person is required to carry an additional device. A proof-of-concept study evaluating a breath ketone analyser (Ketonix, Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with T1D concluded that the device could be used to rule out ketosis in adults, but not in children. However, in general, there is a lack of an evidence base for the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for those with T1D because they have generally been developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets instead of for medical use.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114o9ADe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Interpretation**: Ketones measured in urine or blood in the home setting by patients with diabetes and in the clinic/hospital setting should be considered only an adjunct to the diagnosis of DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) GPP.

- **Urine ketone measurements**: The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes, or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia, suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

- **Blood ketone measurements**: Blood ketone determinations that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used only as an adjunct to diagnose DKA and should not be used to monitor DKA treatment. Specific measurement of βHBA in blood can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of DKA. Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy because AcAc and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy.

On screening for carbohydrates, the sample tested negative. However, using the battery of tests for amino acid screening, the urine was positive for ketone bodies, along with a positive ferric chloride test and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine test, indicating the presence of branched-chain amino acids in urine. Following this, the patient's urine sample was sent for amino acid screening to a reference laboratory, which indicated increased concentrations of branched-chain amino acids:

- **Leucine**: 1702 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 37–253 µmol/g creatinine)
- **Isoleucine**: 1661 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 22–159 µmol/g creatinine)
- **Valine**: 1095 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 60–280 µmol/g creatinine)
- **Threonine**: 2858 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 67–1380 µmol/g creatinine)

Additionally, there was a decrease in:

- **Alanine**: 281 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 608–2918 µmol/g creatinine)
- **Glutamic acid**: 61.6 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 65–1155 µmol/g creatinine)
- **Tryptophan**: 56.6 µmol/g creatinine (Ref: 76–388 µmol/g creatinine)

These values were obtained using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique.

### Starvation ketosis and the kidney [^115jrcye]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The remarkable ability of the body to adapt to long-term starvation has been critical for the survival of primitive humans. An appreciation of these processes can provide clinicians with better insight into many clinical conditions characterized by ketoacidosis.

The body adapts to long-term fasting by conserving nitrogen, as the brain increasingly utilizes ketoacids, sparing the need for glucose. This shift in fuel utilization decreases the need for mobilization of amino acids from the muscle for purposes of gluconeogenesis. Initially, the loss of urinary nitrogen is in the form of urea when hepatic gluconeogenesis is dominant and later as ammonia, reflecting increased glutamine uptake by the kidney. The carbon skeleton of glutamine is utilized for glucose production and the regeneration of consumed HCO3-. The replacement of urea with NH4+ provides the osmoles needed for urine flow and waste product excretion. Over time, the urinary loss of nitrogen is minimized as kidney uptake of filtered ketone bodies becomes more complete. Adjustments in urine Na+ serve to minimize kidney K+ wasting and, along with changes in urine pH, minimize the likelihood of uric acid precipitation. There is a sexual dimorphism in response to starvation.

- **Key message**: Ketoacidosis is a major feature of common clinical conditions, including diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, salicylate intoxication, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, and calorie-sufficient but carbohydrate-restricted diets. Familiarity with the pathophysiology and metabolic consequences of ketogenesis is critical, given the potential clinical occurrences.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116MTGQQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, exhibit hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are frequently used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish how effective blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements are in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial emergency department results on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 females, 53 males, age range 14–89 years) were collected, containing a complete dataset of D (glucose), K (BOHB), and A (bicarbonate [HCO3] and pH) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). Although BOHB showed a better correlation, it was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p = 13.9mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5).

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, this highlights that, regardless of their results, pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114QEcyy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Blood testing for ketones in Australia is best performed using finger-prick capillary blood with a handheld meter and ketone testing strips. Blood ketone testing measures β-hydroxybutyrate, the major circulating ketone body. Although there is no clear consensus in the literature on thresholds for significantly elevated blood ketone levels, generally, levels below 1.0–1.5 mmol/L are considered to exclude diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), while those above 2.5–3.0 mmol/L suggest a diagnosis or indicate the need for urgent medical review.

Blood testing for ketones has greater sensitivity and specificity for DKA compared to urine testing. Blood samples are usually readily available and provide quick measurements, minimizing diagnostic delays. Despite variability in accuracy among manufacturers, ketone meters are generally mature technologies, with many combining blood glucose and ketone testing, eliminating the need for additional devices. However, ketone meters and blood strips are expensive, with ketone strips having a short shelf-life of typically 12 months. Testing is also painful and involves blood exposure. Similar to urine ketone measurements, the presence of interfering substances can affect specificity.

Real-world experience with ketone testing options indicates that continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provision has led to a reduction in DKA. This improvement is likely due to better insulin administration facilitated by CGMs.

### Ketone bodies: From enemy to friend and guardian angel [^115YM8PQ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Theoretical risks of ketoacidosis involve nutritional ketosis or supplementing ketone body salts or esters. In this situation, the concentrations of ketone bodies may reach 25 mmol/L, overpowering the body's capacity to buffer ketotic acids and maintain a blood pH of around 7.4. This occurs in the context of severe hyperglycemia and glucosuria, alongside concomitant renal loss of sodium and potassium required for buffering ketotic acids. The acidic milieu in the blood may reach a pH below 7.30 or even below 7.10. This association of enhanced ketone body production and decreased buffering capacity in the blood may also lead to ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. It can even occur in the absence of hyperglycemia, such as during alcohol abuse or treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.

In metabolically healthy individuals, systemic concentrations of ketone bodies may reach 5–7 mmol/L after prolonged fasting or up to 5 mmol/L during a ketogenic diet. However, the buffering ability during a healthy metabolic state can handle such amounts of ketotic acids, maintaining a normal blood pH. Higher levels of circulating ketone bodies do not occur during starvation because fasting blood insulin levels remain within the low normal range, which is sufficient to prevent an unrestricted increase in lipolysis. Partial inhibition of lipolysis and stimulation of some lipogenesis are properties of insulin, even at normal blood insulin levels.

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies — mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which becomes the predominant ketone in the urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might be increasing even as DKA is resolving.

Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently, no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid.

- **Applications of ketone measurement**: Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets; assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use; in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA; and to identify DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes.

### Near patient blood ketone measurements and their utility in predicting diabetic ketoacidosis [^112ohSCr]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to assess the utility of near patient blood ketone measurements in predicting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among hyperglycemic patients presenting to a hospital emergency department.

- **Methods**: Near patient blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) testing has recently been introduced as a new tool in our hospital Accident and Emergency department (A&E) for patients with a finger-prick glucose of > 11 mmol/l. We reviewed the records of the first 50 patients to have a beta-OHB measurement to establish if they developed DKA or received treatment with intravenous insulin within 48 hours of presentation. We then compared the diagnostic power of beta-OHB measurements with other clinical, physiological, and biochemical markers of DKA.

- **Results**: Nine patients had DKA, eight had a compensated metabolic acidosis secondary to raised serum ketones, and 33 showed no evidence of DKA during the following 48 hours. The median (range) beta-OHB levels in each group were 6.0 (3.1–6.0) mmol/l, 3.4 (1.2–5.7) mmol/l, and 0.1 (0.0–1.2) mmol/l, respectively. A beta-OHB level of ≥ 3.0 mmol/l demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% for DKA. All patients with beta-OHB levels > 3.0 mmol/l required treatment with intravenous insulin.

- **Conclusion**: Measuring beta-OHB when a hyperglycemic patient is identified could offer a simple method of identifying, at an early stage, those patients at highest risk of DKA (beta-OHB > 3.0 mmol/l), and redirecting the search for a diagnosis in others (beta-OHB < 1.0 mmol/l).

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^117JvfCe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The rationale behind the use of continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) in an ambulatory setting would be to pre-empt diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rather than to recognize and manage the fully established condition. In support of this approach, Song et al. reported that maximum fasted blood ketone levels of 0.8 mmol/L or higher, as determined by point-of-care testing, predicted future DKA. It should also be noted that in the EASE, DEPICT, and TANDEM studies, levels of up to 0.8–1.0 mmol/L were not uncommon. Indeed, these minor elevations in ketones may provide part of the protective effect of SGLT-inhibitor therapies.

Therefore, we suggest that responses to CKM data should be initiated early at ketone levels of either 1.0 or 1.5 mmol/L, as levels below these thresholds effectively exclude DKA. Conversely, ketone levels of more than 3.0 mmol/L are consistent with a diagnosis of DKA. Levels between 1.5 and 3.0 mmol/L represent an intermediate 'transition zone', providing a window of opportunity to avert DKA. It should be noted that until these CKM devices are approved for non-adjunctive use, confirmation with a finger-prick ketone measurement would be recommended.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empiric treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H(2)O(2) (3%) 1:9 (H(2)O(2):urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO(3) sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H(2)O(2) improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with elevated acetone in a patient taking a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor [^112pt6Sb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor medications are a class of antihyperglycemic agents that increase urinary glucose excretion by interfering with the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubules. In May of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a warning concerning a potential increased risk of ketoacidosis and ketosis in patients taking these medications.

- **Case report**: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2 days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168 mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose > 500 mg/dL and ketones of 80 mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36 hours. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis. Acetone is one of the three main ketone bodies formed during DKA, and it may be present at considerable concentrations, contributing to the condition.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^1112kAyE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, exhibit hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish how effective blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements are in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results were analyzed from 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 F, 53 M, age range 14–89 years) containing a complete dataset of glucose (D), BOHB (K), and bicarbonate (HCO3) and pH (A) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). Though BOHB was a better predictor, it was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001) and HCO3 (r = -0.41, p < 0.0001). Surprisingly, among non-acidotic patients (pH > 7.30, n = 22), five were hyperglycemic (glucose > 13.9 mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3 mmol/L, n = 9), or both (n = 5).

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3 mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, this highlights that, regardless of their results, pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^116FiRXu]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, our results indicate that routine measurement of blood or urine ketone levels during the use of an automated pump suspension system using CGM, whether threshold-based or predictive, is not necessary. The measurement of urine ketone levels provided no significant clinical information that was not provided by the measurement of serum ketone levels. The risk of development of morning ketosis and DKA using these systems to suspend insulin delivery overnight is not increased in individuals who are 15–45 years old, even when insulin delivery is suspended for up to 2–3 hours. Recommendations for checking ketone levels should be no different when a patient is using a system with automated insulin suspension than it is for conventional diabetes self-management. The conventional recommendations are to check serum ketone levels if the fasting glucose level is > 250 mg/dL, or if the blood glucose level is > 300 mg/dL at any time during the day, when there is illness (especially with nausea or emesis), or when an insulin infusion site failure is suspected.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^114mDkrT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Ketonuria (on standard urine testing) is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advent of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

- **Hypothesis**: Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information on severity of illness in children and risk of hospital admission.

- **Methods**: A prospective study using POCT of blood ketone levels in a convenience sample of children 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. Ketone levels correlated well with decreased oral intake (R2 = 0.25; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake, and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: Managing diabetes in preschoolers [^114orqys]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Low credibility.

Ketoacidosis is a life-threatening acute complication of diabetes. Six percent of children younger than 6 years in the United States and 4% of children in Germany and Austria have suffered from ketoacidosis during the past year (data from the T1D Exchange clinic registry and the Prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry: DPV). Education of families on the prevention of ketoacidosis is an essential part of diabetes care, especially as young children are physiologically prone to develop ketosis. See the ISPAD Guidelines on Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Chapter 13, for further advice.

The high incidence of gastroenteritis with vomiting and the risk of misinterpreting vomiting due to insulinopenia make monitoring ketones important in this age group. Measuring ketone bodies in blood (betahydroxybutyrate, BOHB) should be the primary method of detecting and monitoring ketosis in preschool children with T1D; see the ISPAD Guidelines, Chapter 12, on Sick Days. Blood ketone checks provide caregivers and healthcare professionals timely information regarding ketone levels and their rise or fall, enabling them to offer advice over the phone or in the emergency room.

Ketones should be monitored when there is suspicion of lack of insulin, raised either by high blood glucose (two values above 14 mmol/L [252 mg/dL] within 2 hours that do not decline with an extra insulin dose) or when the child shows symptoms suggestive of ketosis (vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, or unclear illness). It is important to educate and remind caregivers of young children that insulin should always be given by subcutaneous injection.

### Monitoring of ketogenic diet for carnitine metabolites by subcutaneous microdialysis [^113MSqoJ]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

The ketogenic diet (KD) provides ketones from the degradation of free fatty acids for energy metabolism. It is a therapeutic option for pharmacoresistant epilepsies. Carnitine is the carrier molecule that transports fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for degradation into ketones. The integrity of this transport system is a prerequisite for an adequate ketogenic response. For monitoring of tissue metabolism with KD, we used the sampling method of subcutaneous microdialysis (MD), which permits minimally invasive, frequent, and extensive metabolic monitoring independent of blood tests.

By using this new method, we monitored changes in carnitine metabolism induced by KD, particularly in free carnitine (C0), acetylcarnitine (C2), and hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4OH). The correlation of microdialysate and tissue concentrations for carnitines in vitro was about 85%. Carnitine metabolism was monitored in seven children started on a KD for pharmacoresistant epilepsy following a conventional initial fasting period. Detected metabolic changes consisted of a slight decrease in subcutaneous C0 and a marked increase in C2/C0 and C4OH/C0 levels. The levels of subcutaneous C4OH strongly correlate with beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) levels in plasma, providing an additional parameter for the carnitine reserve of the body and reflecting an optimal ketogenic energy supply. Subcutaneous MD allows close and extensive monitoring of metabolism with a KD.

### Feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring in subcutaneous tissue using a ketone sensor [^112593dJ]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2021). Low credibility.

Ketones produced during ketosis or ketoacidosis are water-soluble ketones, namely acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and the spontaneous breakdown product of acetoacetate, which is acetone. In a setting of acidosis, acetoacetate is converted into BHB. With the resolution of ketoacidosis, BHB levels fall, with an increase in the conversion of BHB to acetoacetate that remains detectable in the urine. Therefore, BHB is the primary ketone body that indicates the onset and resolution of ketoacidosis, and levels are commonly sampled over time in the critical care setting to help guide therapy.

Currently, measurement of ketone levels is most frequently performed using urine or blood ketone test strips. Assays using blood are based on BHB utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) dependent β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (β-HBDH) enzyme. These measurements do not indicate the onset of ketosis or ketoacidosis but rather confirm if ketosis or ketoacidosis is already in progress and may require medical attention.

In real-world clinical care, patients seldom check their ketone levels as recommended by health care professionals due to the lack of availability of in-date strips at the time of need, and the fingerstick blood testing requires a conscious action by the patient. Under multiple scenarios, such as failure of insulin delivery, sick days, low carbohydrate intake, use of SGLT2 inhibitors, high-risk patients such as people with T1D, or recurring DKA, and so on, patients would benefit from a continuous ketone sensor.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL (until April 2012, with no language restrictions and studies in humans) were searched for experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and contact with experts in the field.

- **Results**: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centers. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing compared with urine testing was associated with a reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in study design and published data.

- **Conclusions**: There is evidence suggesting the benefits of blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing over urine acetoacetate testing in managing diabetic ketoacidosis, although no study specifically assessed its role in prevention.

### New-onset diabetes in an obese adolescent: Diagnostic dilemmas [^114wfjr5]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008).

A 14-year-old obese African American boy presented to his pediatrician with polyuria, polydipsia, and a significant unintentional weight loss. He was dehydrated, with high levels of blood sugar and urinary ketones. He had no history of previous illnesses and was not taking any medications. The patient had a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

- **Investigations**: Physical examination included assessing stigmata of insulin resistance and measuring blood pressure, pulse, and BMI. Blood samples were obtained for measurement of venous blood pH, bicarbonate, serum glucose, electrolytes, HbA(1C), aminotransferases, and lipids. Urine was sampled for measurement of ketones. Subsequently, measurements of fasting C-peptide and immunoassays for insulin autoantibodies (IAA), islet-cell autoantibodies (ICA-512), and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD-65) were performed.

- **Diagnosis**: New-onset diabetes mellitus with diabetic ketoacidosis, initially diagnosed as type 2 diabetes mellitus, but later determined as type 1 diabetes mellitus.

- **Management**: After treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis with hydration and insulin infusion, the patient was discharged on subcutaneous insulin. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and was transferred to oral insulin-sensitizing agents. He returned 18 months later with an insulin requirement during an asthma exacerbation treated with steroids. Due to the worsening of his diabetic symptoms, the patient was tested for islet autoantibodies and was found to be positive for GAD-65 and IAA, which is diagnostic of type 1 diabetes.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116bcBjA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Urine testing for ketones is a method that has been available for a long time; it is relatively inexpensive and painless, does not require the user to carry a meter, and involves minimal technical skill to implement. However, many patients prefer to avoid doing urine tests. The color-coded, strip-based test uses a nitroprusside reaction, which provides a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and, with some brands, acetone. The test represents an average of ketones excreted in the urine since the last void, which may delay recognition of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or its resolution.

Importantly, with treatment, the circulating pool of β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which may cause urine ketone readings to rise while blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are falling. The paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate gives the false impression that the condition is not improving. Additionally, acetoacetate accounts for approximately only 20% of circulating ketone bodies, impacting the sensitivity of urine testing. False positive results can result from highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, including levodopa and drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free-sulfhydryl compounds.

Finally, it requires the person to recognize an increased risk of DKA to then initiate testing. This may be difficult because of oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure or in the absence of a private environment where a urine sample may be obtained.

### A case of lactation "bovine" ketoacidosis [^113AWoBd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old postpartum lactating woman presented with dyspnea and was found to be in non-diabetic ketoacidosis (pH 7.24, HCO3 10 mmol/L, urine ketones > 80 mg/dL). Rapid clinical and laboratory resolution occurred after intravenous dextrose and enteral feeding, along with discontinuation of lactation. This represents a rarely reported case of lactation "bovine" ketoacidosis in humans. We review the historical precedence for the diagnosis and detail the underlying physiology.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^1141ZnRR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and the inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, is not well characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Steglatro [^114yDprM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglatro, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglatro. Withhold Steglatro, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglatro when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Steglatro and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Lower limb amputation**: In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, Steglatro 5 mg, and Steglatro 15 mg treatment arms, respectively. Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent (81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations). Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs. Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: Etiologies, evaluation, and management [^1152Ag4y]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is an endocrine emergency. A subset of diabetic patients may present with relative euglycemia with acidosis, known as euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA), which is often misdiagnosed due to a serum glucose < 250 mg/dL.

- **Objective**: This narrative review evaluates the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of EDKA for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: EDKA is comprised of serum glucose < 250 mg/dL with an anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketosis. It most commonly occurs in patients with a history of low glucose states such as starvation, chronic liver disease, pregnancy, infection, and alcohol use. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which result in increased urinary glucose excretion, are also associated with EDKA. The underlying pathophysiology involves insulin deficiency or resistance with glucagon release, poor glucose availability, ketone body production, and urinary glucose excretion. Patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, malaise, or fatigue. The physician must determine and treat the underlying etiology of EDKA. Laboratory assessment includes venous blood gas for serum pH, bicarbonate, and ketones. Management includes resuscitation with intravenous fluids, insulin, and glucose, with treatment of the underlying etiology.

Clinician knowledge of this condition can improve the evaluation and management of patients with EDKA.

### Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system [^111f82v3]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The morning fasting blood glucose level was not a good predictor of the presence of blood ketones. The fasting blood glucose level was ≥ 300 mg/dL on only 9 of the 977 intervention mornings (0.9%), and on only 2 of the 9 mornings (22%) was the blood ketone level ≥ 0.6 mmol/L (blood glucose level 334 mg/dL, small urine ketone levels; and blood glucose 348 mg/dL, moderate urine ketone levels on the two mornings).

Similarly, among the 977 control mornings, the fasting blood glucose level was ≥ 300 mg/dL on 17 mornings (1.7%), and on only 3 of 17 mornings (18%) was the blood ketone level ≥ 0.6 mmol/L (blood glucose 307 mg/dL, moderate urine ketone levels; blood glucose level 323 mg/dL, small urine ketone levels; and blood glucose level 359 mg/dL, large urine ketone levels on the 3 mornings).

After both intervention and control nights, the probability of a blood ketone level ≥ 0.6 mmol/L was low even with elevated fasting blood glucose levels.

### Ketone bodies: From enemy to friend and guardian angel [^113cqDiA]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The breakdown of fatty acids occurs in the mitochondria through beta oxidation, yielding ATP and acetyl-CoA. In the absence of sufficient glycolysis-derived oxaloacetate, combined with the consumption of oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis and other less-researched metabolic factors, hepatocytes channel only a small amount of acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle for terminal oxidation and further ATP production. Instead, acetyl-CoA accumulates and is converted to acetoacetate via acetoacetyl-CoA (by mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase) and hydroxy methylglutaryl-CoA (by HMG-CoA synthase), from which acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA are cleaved (by HMG-CoA lyase). A small proportion of acetoacetate spontaneously decarboxylates to acetone and CO2, while a larger portion is reduced to βOHB by mitochondrial βOHB dehydrogenase (BDH1).

The three "ketone bodies" (acetoacetate, βOHB, acetone) are secreted into the venous circulation, followed by uptake in extrahepatic tissues, excretion by the kidneys, or exhalation (acetone) via the lungs. Acetoacetate may also be utilized in the cytosol for cholesterol synthesis and possibly lipogenesis. The term "ketone body" usually includes βOHB, despite its keto group being reduced to a hydroxyl group.

Significant amounts of ketone bodies are produced even during a non-ketogenic diet, resulting in blood levels of approximately 0.05 mmol/L for acetoacetate, 0.05–0.4 mmol/L for βOHB, and 0.02–0.05 mmol/L for acetone. These levels vary throughout the day, decreasing with carbohydrate intake and increasing between meals or due to prolonged muscle activity.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111GPjM9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis were compared with those of the urine dipstick.

Emergency-department patients with blood glucose levels ≥ 250 mg/dL underwent urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association criteria.

Of the 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick demonstrated a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^113WvZ3V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes, such as protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones.

- **Objective**: The objective was to explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells due to urine strip shortages.

- **Design**: During shortages, an automated algorithm was implemented which triggered the sending of urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose. It also ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed two labels so that nursing staff could collect two specimens. The turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification was monitored, ensuring the culture reflex order was triggered. Complaints by physicians regarding not having usual urinalysis results were tracked. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was deemed acceptable.

- **Results**: The algorithm was implemented twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was performed with the strips. However, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period, there was only one complaint from a physician wanting additional urinalysis results.

### Urine specific gravity and other urinary indices: Inaccurate tests for dehydration [^111GmpgW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Urine output, specific gravity, and ketones (urinary indices) are commonly used as objective means to assess dehydration and gastroenteritis severity. However, their utility has not been established. This study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of urinary indices as diagnostic tests to identify acute dehydration.

We completed a prospective cohort study in the emergency department of an urban pediatric hospital. Seventy-nine subjects aged 3 months to 36 months with gastroenteritis, clinically suspected moderate dehydration, and the need for intravenous rehydration were enrolled in the trial. Urine specific gravity and urine ketone levels were determined with bedside calorimetric (dipstick) testing, and urine output during rehydration and observation was measured using commonly used techniques. An internally validated, weight-based criterion standard for the percent dehydration upon enrollment was used to identify the cohort of dehydrated subjects. Correlation statistics were calculated for urine output, specific gravity, and ketones. In addition, multilevel tables were created to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio at varying test cutoff values to detect 3% and 5% dehydration.

Urine specific gravity (r = -0.06, P = 0.64), urine ketones (r = 0.08, P = 0.52), and urine output during rehydration (r = 0.01, P = 0.96) did not correlate with the initial degree of dehydration present. Clinically useful cutoff values for urine specific gravity and ketones to increase or decrease the likelihood of dehydration at the time of…

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^112P8N72]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a relatively common and potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, traditionally diagnosed through the identification of hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis, often in that order. The recommended thresholds for diagnosis vary among different organizations. Values most commonly used are plasma glucose > 11 or > 13.9 mmol/L, arterial pH < 7.3, bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, and blood ketone concentrations > 3 mmol/L.

However, the increasing prevalence of euglycemic ketoacidosis, due in part to the use of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, has highlighted a lack of evidence confirming the 3 mmol/L diagnostic threshold for blood ketones (BOHB). Therefore, a study verifying ketone thresholds and assessing the reliability of glucose and BOHB testing in this clinical context is warranted. The study aimed to utilize real-world data from patients admitted to an Emergency Department with presumptive DKA to validate blood ketone concentration thresholds and to explore the effectiveness of blood glucose and BOHB measurements in identifying patients with significant acidosis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^117PnUxn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL had urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Pathophysiology of ketoacidosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117YFLDR]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Despite an increasing number of reports of ketoacidosis in populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the pathophysiology of ketoacidosis in these patients remains unclear. We, therefore, tested the roles of three possible mechanisms: elevated stress hormones, increased free fatty acids (FFA), and suppressed insulin secretion.

Forty-six patients who presented to the Emergency Department with decompensated diabetes (serum glucose > 22.2 mmol/l and/or ketoacid concentrations ≥ 5 mmol/l) had blood sampled prior to insulin therapy. Three groups of subjects were studied: ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes (KPDM2, n = 13) with ketoacidosis, non-ketosis-prone subjects with type 2 diabetes (DM2, n = 15), and ketotic type 1 diabetes (n = 18).

All three groups had similar mean plasma glucose concentrations. The degree of ketoacidosis (plasma ketoacids, bicarbonate, and anion gap) in type 1 and type 2 subjects was similar. Mean levels of counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine), and FFA were not significantly different in DM2 and KPDM2 patients. In contrast, plasma C-peptide concentrations were approximately three-fold lower in KPDM2 compared to non-ketotic DM2 subjects (P = 0.0001). Type 1 ketotic subjects had significantly higher growth hormone (P = 0.024) and FFA (P < 0.002), and lower glucagon levels (P < 0.02) than DM2.

At the time of hospital presentation, the predominant mechanism for ketosis in KPDM2 is likely to be greater insulinopenia.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^116QT6D3]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are usually present in urine and blood, but in very low concentrations (e.g. total serum ketones, < 0.5 mmol/L). Increased ketone concentrations detected in patients with known diabetes, or in previously undiagnosed patients presenting with hyperglycemia, suggest impending or established diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a medical emergency. The two major mechanisms for high ketone concentrations in patients with diabetes are increased production from triglycerides and decreased utilization in the liver, both of which are due to an absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased counter-regulatory hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, glucagon, and growth hormone.

The principal ketone bodies, β-hydroxybutyrate (βHBA) and acetoacetate (AcAc), are typically present in approximately equimolar amounts. Acetone, usually present in only small quantities, is derived from the spontaneous decarboxylation of AcAc. The equilibrium between AcAc and βHBA is shifted towards βHBA formation in any condition that alters the redox state of hepatic mitochondria to increase NADH concentrations, such as hypoxia, fasting, metabolic disorders (including DKA), and alcoholic ketoacidosis. Thus, assay methods for ketones that do not include βHBA measurement may provide misleading clinical information by underestimating total ketone body concentration.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1135r4eb]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically concerning potassium replacement, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend establishing adequate renal function, defined as a urine output of approximately 0.5 mL/kg/h, and monitoring serum potassium levels for appropriate potassium replacement:

- **Serum potassium < 3.5 mmol/L**: Faster potassium replacement will require central venous access.
- **Serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mmol/L**: Administer 10–20 mmol/L potassium in each liter of IV fluid as needed to keep serum potassium at 4–5 mmol/L.
- **Serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L**: Start insulin, but do not administer potassium. Assess serum potassium every 2 hours.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115uU7Uc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Blood ketones**: Serum/plasma ketones can be measured with the tablets or dipsticks routinely used for urine ketone measurements. Although samples can be diluted with saline to "titer" the ketone concentration (results are typically reported as "positive at a 1/x dilution"), βHBA, the predominant ketone body in DKA, is not detected, as with urine ketone testing.

For specific βHBA measurements, sample requirements differ among methods. In general, blood samples can be collected into tubes containing heparin, EDTA, fluoride, citrate, or oxalate. Ascorbic acid interferes with some assay methods. AcAc interferes with some assay methods unless the samples are highly dilute. Sample stability differs among methods, but whole-blood samples are generally stable at 4°C for up to 24 hours. Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 1 week at 4°C and for at least several weeks at −20°C, although long-term stability data are not available for most assay methods.

- **Analytical methods**: Although several different assay methods (e.g. colorimetric, gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and enzymatic) have been described for blood ketones, including specific measurement of βHBA, enzymatic methods appear to be the most widely used for the quantification of βHBA for routine clinical management. The principle of the enzymatic methods is that β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, in the presence of NAD+, converts βHBA to AcAc and NADH. Under alkaline conditions (pH 8.5–9.5), the reaction favors the formation of AcAc from βHBA. The NADH produced can be quantified.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^117Vb2Nc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

The collection of the three components required to meet a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) diagnosis — namely, increased glucose, increased blood ketones, and metabolic acidosis — is not consistently gathered. This inconsistency could be detrimental if it prevents clinical staff from assessing the acid-base status of a patient because their blood glucose and/or ketones have not reached their respective diagnostic thresholds. Such a situation could delay a diagnosis or result in the patient re-presenting later with more severe illness. One approach to tackle this situation is the recommendation to reduce the threshold level for acting on blood ketones, by considering intermediate blood ketone concentrations such as 1.6–3 mmol/L or even lower.

From our data, we include patients with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) values of 1.6 to 18 mmol/L. Euglycemic DKA, believed to comprise up to 10% of DKA presentations even before the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors, similarly limits lowering glucose cut-offs like BOHB. Indeed, this is the reason some guidelines have removed blood glucose altogether as a diagnostic criterion. Additionally, exogenous ketone bodies are known to have a hypoglycemic effect, which could influence the association between endogenous BOHB and acidosis.

### Ketones in pregnancy: Why is it considered necessary to avoid them and what is the evidence behind their perceived risk [^111HdnKv]. Diabetes Care (2021). Low credibility.

Dietary advice for women with gestational diabetes mellitus is to avoid diets that result in elevated ketone levels. This guidance stems from a concern that maternal ketones are associated with poor fetal and childhood outcomes, including reduced childhood intelligence quota. The evidence behind these guidelines is conflicting and inconsistent. Given that dietary counseling is the initial treatment strategy for women with diabetes in pregnancy, it is important that clinicians understand the concern regarding maternal ketones. This review examines the physiology of ketogenesis in pregnancy, the prevalence of elevated maternal ketone levels, and the relationship between maternal ketones and fetal and childhood outcomes.

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^112ZueNY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that the maintenance of ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand how ketosis and seizure protection are related, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

- **Design**: After fasting overnight for 12 hours, 12 healthy adults consumed 4 ketogenic meals over 12 hours. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

- **Results**: By the end of the 12-hour dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R² = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

- **Conclusions**: Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as is urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone is reliable.
