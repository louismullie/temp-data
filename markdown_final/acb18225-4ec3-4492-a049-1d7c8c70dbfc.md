## Question

propranolol after acute trauma to reduce risk of developing ptsd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether propranolol given after acute trauma reduces the risk of developing PTSD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise prevention target and timing (universal prevention right after trauma versus indicated prevention in acute stress symptoms), and what major guidelines say. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale and practical timing constraints. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence from guidelines and Cochrane reviews, followed by systematic reviews and key individual studies. After that, I need to check safety and feasibility, compare with alternative evidence-based strategies, and finally formulate a clear clinical recommendation and research directions, ensuring I self-check each step against the citations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame so I don't conflate treatment with prevention. We're addressing primary pharmacologic prevention soon after trauma, not treatment of established PTSD or augmentation of psychotherapy, and not limited to patients meeting acute stress disorder criteria; guidelines emphasize there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against pharmacotherapy for universal prevention in trauma-exposed individuals and likewise insufficient evidence for pharmacotherapy in acute stress reactions or ASD, whereas trauma-focused CBT is suggested for patients who meet ASD criteria, so I should keep those distinctions clear [^112KzRee] [^111wkPXq] [^112cMhQo].

> Now, the theoretical rationale: propranolol is a lipophilic nonselective β-blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier; in theory it could blunt noradrenergic enhancement of memory consolidation within a short post-trauma window and may disrupt reconsolidation upon memory reactivation, but wait, I need to verify the pharmacokinetic reality — the consolidation window is thought to be within roughly 6 hours and propranolol's oral absorption takes about 60–90 minutes, which complicates hitting effective CNS levels in time, and even where physiologic responses (like heart rate during trauma script imagery) are reduced, symptomatic PTSD outcomes have been inconsistent [^112h88F7] [^113esdFU] [^112Fns4V] [^113B3LGy].

> Next, I should review guideline authority before drilling into trials. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I cross-check multiple bodies: the VA/DoD 2023 guideline states insufficient evidence to recommend pharmacotherapy for prevention either universally after trauma exposure or for acute stress reactions/ASD, and it does not endorse propranolol in prevention algorithms; APA guidance similarly lists several medications with insufficient evidence in PTSD management, reinforcing the absence of a role for propranolol in prevention pathways or treatment recommendations [^112KzRee] [^111wkPXq] [^113Lx4nn].

> I will now examine the systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A 2022 meta-analysis on propranolol for reconsolidation impairment found no beneficial effect on PTSD symptoms and minimal physiologic impact beyond modest heart rate reductions; wait, I initially read the standardized mean difference as positive but the confidence interval crosses zero, so I need to correct myself — this is a null finding for clinical symptoms, not a benefit, which aligns with earlier PTSD-focused propranolol reviews that found no convincing effect on symptom severity, and a 2018 prevention review also failed to show an effect in emergency department studies while highlighting the practical timing problem; importantly, Cochrane reviews on universal early pharmacotherapy and on indicated early pharmacotherapy do not support propranolol for prevention in adults after trauma exposure [^112Fns4V] [^112KdgLo] [^113m9Qyv] [^113esdFU] [^115wBjyp] [^116ccmry].

> Let me consider individual signal studies to ensure I'm not missing a subgroup. The most consistent pharmacologic preventive signal comes from morphine exposure during early trauma care in combat injury, which was associated with a substantially lower subsequent PTSD risk in a large cohort, while hydrocortisone showed promising results in a small RCT of trauma survivors; by contrast, β-blocker observations in perioperative or cardiac populations suggest possible sex-specific effects but are small and not generalizable to acute civilian trauma, and an early pharmacotherapy cohort after civilian trauma pointed again toward opiates rather than β-blockers for reduced early PTSD symptoms, so propranolol specifically lacks robust prevention evidence here [^11636iWr] [^112h88F7] [^115Hwk2r] [^113EaBKZ].

> I should double-check methodological limitations that could explain discrepancies. Studies are generally small, underpowered, and heterogeneous in trauma type and dosing; the absorption–consolidation window mismatch is a recurring issue, and risk of bias is high across many acute intervention studies, with problems in allocation, blinding, and selective reporting; crucially, there are no adequately powered multicenter RCTs of propranolol for primary prevention post-trauma, which constrains inference even if the mechanism remains attractive in principle [^113esdFU] [^116ccmry] [^115wBjyp].

> Next, I should review safety and feasibility, since even neutral efficacy tilts the balance if adverse effects are nontrivial. Propranolol carries risks of hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchospasm, which matter in trauma care settings and can offset any theoretical benefit, and But wait, what if class effects differ across cardiovascular drugs — observational UK Biobank data intriguingly associate RAS blockers with a lower risk of probable PTSD while noting β-blocker use associated with higher PTSD risk, so I should be cautious about extrapolating a preventive signal to propranolol or the β-blocker class outside trials and remember these are observational associations prone to confounding [^116MQuxa] [^115fAhcJ] [^116FRXJP].

> I will now compare with alternative, guideline-concordant strategies. For universal prevention, focus on early support, psychoeducation, and avoiding potentially harmful agents; for indicated prevention in ASD, offer trauma-focused CBT, and for pharmacologic considerations in acute care, adequate analgesia with morphine has the strongest observational preventive signal while hydrocortisone may help in select settings, whereas benzodiazepines are linked to increased PTSD risk and should be avoided when possible, particularly in TBI populations where guidelines advise against their use and suggest sleep-focused adjuncts like prazosin when clinically warranted [^112cMhQo] [^11636iWr] [^112h88F7] [^111bHSDp] [^111Ps1qM] [^111hZ183] [^112JfH8q].

> Given this, I need to ensure the recommendation aligns with evidence hierarchy. Primary recommendation: do not routinely administer propranolol after acute trauma to prevent PTSD outside a research protocol, because major guidelines find insufficient evidence to support pharmacologic prevention, meta-analyses show no consistent clinical benefit for propranolol, and practical timing and safety considerations undermine feasibility in real-world emergency settings, so regular use is not justified [^112KzRee] [^111wkPXq] [^115wBjyp].

> Hold on, I should verify the edge cases and research stance. In carefully designed trials with rapid administration and precise reactivation protocols, propranolol could still be studied to address mechanistic questions and possible subgroups such as sex-specific effects, but until adequately powered multicenter RCTs overcome timing and dosing limitations and identify responders with biomarkers, clinical practice should favor established nonpharmacologic approaches and the more evidence-supported pharmacologic signals seen with morphine and hydrocortisone in appropriate contexts [^113esdFU] [^112Fns4V] [^115wBjyp] [^112h88F7] [^11636iWr].

> Bottom line, after rechecking all tiers of evidence and feasibility: propranolol should not be used for routine prevention of PTSD after acute trauma, given insufficient supportive evidence, inconsistent clinical effects, and nontrivial safety and timing challenges; instead, adhere to guideline-endorsed early care, offer trauma-focused CBT for ASD, ensure adequate analgesia, avoid benzodiazepines, and consider hydrocortisone selectively, reserving propranolol for research settings exploring reconsolidation mechanisms and clearly defined protocols [^112KzRee] [^111wkPXq] [^112cMhQo] [^112Fns4V] [^115wBjyp] [^111bHSDp] [^112h88F7] [^11636iWr].

Propranolol is not recommended after acute trauma to prevent PTSD because evidence is insufficient [^112KzRee] and guidelines advise against routine use [^111wkPXq]. Early propranolol does not reliably reduce PTSD incidence or severity [^113esdFU], and any effects are small and inconsistent [^112Fns4V]. Current VA/DoD guidelines [^112KzRee] state there is insufficient evidence [^111wkPXq] to recommend propranolol or any pharmacotherapy for PTSD prevention after trauma [^115wBjyp]. Propranolol may be considered only in research settings or select high-risk cases with careful monitoring, and trauma-focused CBT remains the preferred early intervention [^112cMhQo].

---

## Mechanism of action and theoretical rationale

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist [^116MQuxa] that crosses the blood-brain barrier and reduces central noradrenergic activity, a pathway implicated in fear conditioning and emotional memory consolidation [^115TrQDS]. The rationale for post-trauma use is its potential to disrupt memory consolidation and reconsolidation [^117TxqFv], thereby reducing the emotional intensity and physiological arousal associated with traumatic memories [^115TrQDS].

---

## Clinical evidence for propranolol in PTSD prevention

Several studies have evaluated early propranolol after trauma to prevent PTSD, and results have been mixed and generally inconclusive [^115wBjyp]:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: A meta-analysis of seven studies [^112Fns4V] found no significant beneficial effect of propranolol on PTSD symptoms or physiological responses, although a modest reduction in heart rate during trauma recall was observed.

- **Early administration studies**: Studies administering propranolol within hours of trauma exposure [^113esdFU] have generally failed to demonstrate significant reductions in PTSD incidence or severity.

- **Reconsolidation blockade studies**: While some studies have shown reduced physiological responses during trauma recall [^113B3LGy], these effects have not consistently translated into clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms [^112Fns4V] [^114wiVxZ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines, including those from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) [^112KzRee], state there is **insufficient evidence** [^111wkPXq] to recommend propranolol or any pharmacologic intervention for PTSD prevention after acute trauma [^116ccmry]. They emphasize the need for further research and caution against routine use.

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Propranolol is generally well tolerated but carries **potential risks** [^116MQuxa], particularly in trauma patients with underlying medical conditions:

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Bradycardia, hypotension, and potential cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve [^116MQuxa].

- **Respiratory effects**: Bronchospasm, particularly in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

- **Central nervous system effects**: Fatigue, dizziness, and sleep disturbances.

Given these risks [^116MQuxa], **careful patient selection and monitoring are essential** if propranolol is considered.

---

## Comparison with other pharmacological interventions

Other pharmacologic agents, such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants, have also been studied for PTSD prevention [^11636iWr] [^115wBjyp]. Benzodiazepines have been associated with an increased risk of PTSD and are **not recommended** [^111Ps1qM] [^1126zj4s]. Antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs) are recommended for established PTSD treatment, not for prevention [^116qJmRp] [^115wBjyp].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Despite the theoretical rationale, **significant research gaps remain** [^112SfizL]:

- **Optimal dosing and timing**: The effective dose and timing of propranolol administration remain unclear [^113MD7wq].

- **Patient selection**: Identifying individuals who may benefit from propranolol prophylaxis is not well-established [^115m2J2t].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Long-term efficacy and safety data are limited [^112SfizL].

Future research should prioritize **well-designed randomized controlled trials** to address these gaps and clarify the potential role of propranolol in PTSD prevention [^116ccmry].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, current evidence **does not support routine use** [^115wBjyp] of propranolol after acute trauma to prevent PTSD, and guidelines state there is **insufficient evidence** to recommend propranolol or any pharmacologic intervention for this purpose [^112KzRee]. Propranolol may be considered in specific high-risk cases or research settings, but careful patient selection and monitoring are essential. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) remains the **preferred early intervention** for individuals exposed to traumatic events [^112cMhQo].

### Effects of propranolol on the modification of trauma memory reconsolidation in PTSD patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Fns4V]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops after exposure to a life-threatening event and is characterized by intrusive memories. According to memory reconsolidation theory, retrieval of memory under certain conditions leads to its labilization and subsequent re-storage, which could be disrupted by drugs. Propranolol has been the most commonly investigated drug for memory reconsolidation therapy in clinical trials. Interventions with propranolol have shown mixed results in PTSD patients, with some studies showing improvement in symptoms while others fail to replicate these findings.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of trauma memory disruption by propranolol on PTSD symptoms and physiological responses in PTSD patients. A total of 3224 publications were assessed for eligibility. Seven studies on the effects of propranolol on PTSD symptoms and three studies on the effects of propranolol on physiological responses were included in the meta-analyses.

Overall, results indicate that propranolol did not show a beneficial effect on PTSD symptoms (standardized mean difference: 1.29; 95% CI = -2.16 to 0.17). Similarly, propranolol did not influence skin conductance (standardized mean difference: 0.77; 95% CI = -1.85 to 0.31) or EMG response (standardized mean difference: 0.16; 95% CI = -0.65 to 0.33). However, propranolol significantly reduced heart rate after trauma memory recall compared to placebo (standardized mean difference: 0.67; 95% CI = -1.27 to -0.07).

This study finds a lack of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol on traumatic memory disruption.

### Memory and forgetting [^113esdFU]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Preventive and treatment interventions aimed at traumatic memories explore various strategies to mitigate the impact of traumatic experiences.

- **Prevention**: Based on the idea that overconsolidation of the traumatic memory is causally involved in PTSD, several studies have attempted to block consolidation by administering the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol to patients admitted to the emergency room in the hours immediately following a traumatic event. A meta-analytic review of five studies failed to demonstrate an overall effect on reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms. Despite these negative results, it is important to note that propranolol is not fully absorbed for 60–90 minutes, and most studies did not achieve adequate propranolol concentrations within the six-hour window during which most consolidation is thought to occur. The studies also faced considerable difficulties in recruitment. Thus, although the proposed mechanism has not yet been fully tested, practical considerations suggest that this intervention is unlikely to make a substantial impact in practice.

An alternative to pharmacological intervention is the use of competing tasks hypothesized to interfere with the consolidation of the sensory aspects of trauma memories. A recent study compared a trauma reminder followed by 20 minutes of playing a computer game with high visuospatial demands (Tetris) with an attention-placebo control in patients admitted to an emergency department within six hours of a motor vehicle accident. Patients who played Tetris reported finding this easy and helpful, experiencing fewer intrusive trauma memories subsequently.

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117XhuQi]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis was conducted using pooled summary statistics, provided that the trials were combinable. This condition was met if participants shared the same anxiety disorder and the treatment effects were expressed using a common variable.

- **Data analysis and synthesis**: For dichotomous treatment outcomes, relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) served as the summary statistic. Continuous data results were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% CIs. These data were pooled across studies using invariance weighting and combined via a random effects model to prevent overstated precision of final estimates, even when statistical heterogeneity was low (I² < 0.10). Only data from the first treatment period of crossover trials were included in the summary statistics if insufficient data were available for paired analysis. When trial reports provided correlations between participant responses across different phases, data from both periods were included.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the potential influence of bias on the meta-analysis findings when deemed appropriate.

### Cytokine fluctuation during acute stress is correlated to life trauma [^116izyPG]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma- and stress-associated psychiatric disorder that can develop in an individual after being involved in or witnessing an event perceived as traumatizing or extreme. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including flashbacks, severe anxiety, dissociative episodes, and fleeing or combative behaviors. Interestingly, not everyone who experiences or witnesses the same event will go on to develop PTSD, suggesting an underlying, possibly immune-modulated, risk profile toward the development of PTSD that has yet to be fully elucidated.

Although PTSD is primarily recognized as a psychiatric disorder, it also manifests with physiological dysfunctions, especially regarding the immune system. In 2015, a large-scale retrospective study on 666,269 Iraq war veterans discovered a twofold increase in the risk of autoimmune diseases in individuals with PTSD compared to those without any psychiatric illness, and a 51% increased risk compared to individuals with other psychiatric illnesses. This strongly suggests a significant connection between trauma, whether from a chronic or acute stressor, and immune system dysregulation.

To quantitatively describe this relationship between stress, inflammatory cytokines/biomarkers, and the immune system, we used the Life Events Checklist 5 (LEC-5) survey. The LEC-5 is a tool used to determine the number and severity of life trauma events individuals have experienced, allowing for the establishment of their exposure to PTSD.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: a retrospective cohort study [^115fAhcJ]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The association between RAS blocker use and probable PTSD was examined over a total follow-up time of 119,664 person-years, with each participant followed for an average of 7.5 ± 0.8 years (range: 5.9–10.2) from the initial assessment. By the end of follow-up, 1,249 out of 15,954 (7.8%) participants were identified as having probable PTSD. After applying the IPW, RAS blocker use was associated with a lower risk of probable PTSD (OR = 0.84 [95% CI: 0.75–0.94]). Other classes of antihypertensive medications were not linked to a decreased risk of probable PTSD (users vs. non-users; CCBs, OR = 0.99 [95% CI: 0.88–1.11]). Interestingly, the use of beta-blockers or thiazide-related diuretics was associated with an increased risk of probable PTSD (users vs. non-users; beta-blockers, OR = 1.20 [95% CI: 1.08–1.34]; thiazide-related diuretics, OR = 1.15 [95% CI: 1.03–1.29]).

We further examined the subgroup of participants using RAS blockers. The estimated associations between ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and probable PTSD (OR = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75–0.96]), and between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and probable PTSD (OR = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.69–0.93]), were broadly consistent. There was no statistically significant difference observed between ACEi and ARB users regarding their association with probable PTSD (ACEi vs. ARB, OR = 1.00 [95% CI: 0.86–1.18], p for difference = 0.96).

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^112SfizL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Interventions' taxonomy: Individuals' reactions to traumatic events follow diverging trajectories. From quasi-universal disarray and distress shortly after exposure, some survivors develop very few symptoms; others show transient and reversible initial symptoms, and a substantial minority continues to express severe non-remitting symptoms. These findings define two primary goals for early interventions: firstly, to mitigate the development of early symptoms and, secondly, to increase the likelihood of remission in those who develop symptoms, with special focus on the non-remitting subgroup.

Interventions addressing the first goal include attempts to reduce the stressfulness of the traumatic event, such as 'stress management' and 'need-based assistance', and interventions meant to reduce participants' initial responses to the event or its encoding in memory. Studies addressing the second goal include specific intervention protocols delivered at different time intervals from the traumatic event to survivors identified as being at high risk for PTSD. The efficacy of the latter, therefore, hinges on proper risk detection in the early aftermath of trauma exposure. Individual risk prediction, however, is currently far from perfect.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^115m2J2t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

From a risk assessment perspective, PTSD is likely multi-causal, and as such, individuals with differing vulnerabilities and different exposure and post-exposure circumstances may come to express the PTSD symptom complex through individual-specific pathways and be responsive to individual-specific interventions. One way to advance the prevention of PTSD is to better map the variety of paths leading to this condition and map those paths into subsets of trauma-exposed individuals. Once such knowledge becomes available, personalized target-specific early interventions might replace generic treatment protocols, which in practice are effective for some but not for all.

Several steps should be taken in future studies. We need to step beyond diagnosis-based screenings and develop more complex, accurate methods to predict individual risks of expressing debilitating symptoms and impairment after traumatic events. By enhancing prediction models, intervention studies can take the important step to select the most relevant sample for a more rigorous study design and the best clinical interest. At the same time, researchers need to continue exploring and confirming the underlying mechanisms of post-traumatic pathogenesis and, thereby, suggest new targets for novel interventions. These targeted intervention methods can allow clinicians to focus on both specific populations and specific pathological processes.

### Identifying and managing posttraumatic stress disorder [^1126zj4s]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in an estimated 8% of men and 20% of women who are exposed to traumatic events. PTSD is a trauma- and stress-related disorder associated with significant psychosocial morbidity, substance abuse, and other negative physical health outcomes. The hallmarks of PTSD include exposure to a traumatic event; reexperiencing the event or intrusion symptoms; avoidance of people, places, or things that serve as a reminder of the trauma; negative mood and thoughts associated with the trauma; and chronic hyperarousal symptoms.

Self-report questionnaires can assist clinicians in identifying anxiety problems associated with traumatic events. For patients who meet criteria for PTSD, trauma-focused psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy improve symptoms. Benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics are not recommended because studies have shown that adverse effects outweigh potential health benefits.

Primary care physicians should monitor patients with PTSD for comorbid conditions such as substance abuse, mood disorders, and suicidality, and should refer patients to behavioral health specialists and support groups when appropriate.

### Pharmacological blockade of memory reconsolidation in posttraumatic stress disorder: three negative psychophysiological studies [^114wiVxZ]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may involve over-consolidated emotional memories of the traumatic event. Reactivation can return a memory to an unstable state, from which it must be reconsolidated if it is to persist. Pharmacological agents administered while the memory is unstable have been shown to impair reconsolidation. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) partial agonist d-cycloserine (DCS) may promote memory destabilization.

In the three studies reported here, we investigated whether the β-adrenergic blocker propranolol or the glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone, given at the time of traumatic memory reactivation, could reduce PTSD symptoms and physiological responses during subsequent traumatic imagery.

- **Study one**: Participants were randomized to receive propranolol with memory reactivation (n = 10) or without reactivation (n = 8).
- **Study two**: Participants received reactivation mifepristone (n = 13), non-reactivation mifepristone (n = 15), or double placebo (n = 15).
- **Study three**: Participants received reactivation mifepristone plus d-cycloserine (n = 16) or two placebos (n = 15).

Subjects underwent memory retrieval by describing their traumatic event. A week later, they engaged in script-driven traumatic mental imagery while heart rate (HR), skin conductance (SC), and facial electromyogram (EMG) responses were measured. There were no significant group differences in physiological responsivity or change in PTSD symptoms in any of the studies. These results do not support successful blockade of reconsolidation of traumatic memories in PTSD.

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KdgLo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The effects of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders have not been systematically evaluated previously. The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials, addressing the efficacy of oral propranolol versus placebo or other medication as a treatment for alleviating either state or trait anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies concerned panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (four studies, total n = 130), specific phobia (two studies, total n = 37), social phobia (one study, n = 16), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (one study, n = 19).

Three out of four panic disorder trials qualified for pooled analyses. These meta-analyses found no statistically significant differences between the efficacy of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Also, no evidence was found for the effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity through inhibition of memory reconsolidation. In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol at present is insufficient to support the routine use of propranolol in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.

The internal validity of each trial included in this review was critically evaluated for bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias, which covers sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete data, selective reporting, and other biases. Two independent investigators assessed the potential risk of bias from extracted information, categorizing it as "high risk", "low risk", or "unclear risk". We used RevMan 5.3 to create a graphic representation of potential bias.

### Noradrenergic dysfunction and the psychopharmacology of posttraumatic stress disorder [^115TrQDS]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

The catecholamine norepinephrine is a critical effector of the mammalian stress response and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a syndrome intrinsically related to the experience of extraordinary stress. Symptom-linked hypernoradrenergic derangements have been observed in PTSD, and several studies have examined the potential therapeutic effects of agents that dampen the centrally hyperactive noradrenergic state. These agents include compounds that decrease norepinephrine release (e.g. centrally acting alpha(2) agonists such as clonidine) and those which block post-synaptic norepinephrine receptors (e.g. centrally acting alpha(1) or beta receptor antagonists such as prazosin or propranolol).

In this article, we review studies of central noreadrenergic hyperactivity under both basal and challenge conditions and explore the evidence for these derangements as potential psychopharmacologic targets in patients with PTSD. Given the significant involvement of CNS norepinephrine hyperactivity in PTSD and its link to intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms, it is not surprising that interventions directed at this system have therapeutic potential in PTSD. The utility of these anti-adrenergics in the clinical treatment of PTSD remains to be determined, though it is possible that they may prove to have primary roles in a disorder that is only modestly responsive to antidepressant treatment.

### Early pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^115wBjyp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and debilitating condition. Several pharmacological interventions have been proposed with the aim to prevent or mitigate it. These interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability, given that not all individuals exposed to a traumatic event will develop PTSD. There are different possible approaches to preventing PTSD; universal prevention is aimed at individuals at risk of developing PTSD on the basis of having been exposed to a traumatic event, irrespective of whether they are showing signs of psychological difficulties.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological interventions for universal prevention of PTSD in adults exposed to a traumatic event.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 13 November 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. In a random-effects model, we analyzed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^114NN1WV]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may affect 10% of women and 5% of men at some stage, with symptoms that may persist for several years. Risk factors include major trauma, lack of social support, peritraumatic dissociation, and previous psychiatric history or personality factors.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent PTSD? What are the effects of interventions to treat PTSD? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 46 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions:
	- **Therapeutic interventions**:
		- Affect management, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), drama therapy
		- Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, group therapy, hypnotherapy
		- Inpatient treatment programs, Internet-based psychotherapy
	- **Pharmacological interventions**:
		- Antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, benzodiazepines
		- Brofaromine, fluoxetine, hydrocortisone, mirtazapine
	- **Comprehensive approaches**:
		- Multiple-session CBT, multiple-session collaborative trauma support

### Human amygdala reactivity is diminished by the β-noradrenergic antagonist propranolol [^117TxqFv]. Psychological Medicine (2010).

Animal models of anxiety disorders emphasize the crucial role of locus ceruleus-noradrenergic (norepinephrine, NE) signaling, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and their interactions in the expression of anxiety-like behavioral responses to stress. Despite clinical evidence for the efficacy of a β-noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol in the alleviation of anxiety symptoms and the secondary prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder, preclinical evidence for a β-noradrenergic modulation of BLA activity in humans is missing.

- **Method**: We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy volunteers with probabilistic mapping of intra-amygdalar responses to fearful, neutral, and happy facial expressions to test the hypothesis that a β-noradrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol would inactivate the BLA.

- **Results**: Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, propranolol diminished BLA responses to facial expressions, independent of their emotional valence. The absence of activity changes in probabilistically defined visual control regions underscores the specific action of propranolol in the BLA.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings provide the missing link between the anxiolytic potential of propranolol and the biological basis of β-noradrenergic activation in the human BLA as a key target for the pharmacological inhibition of anxiety neurocircuitry. Moreover, our findings add to emerging evidence that NE modulates both the reactivity (sensitivity) and the operating characteristics (specificity) of the BLA via β-noradrenergic receptors.

### Morphine use after combat injury in Iraq and post-traumatic stress disorder [^11636iWr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common adverse mental health outcome among seriously injured civilians and military personnel who are survivors of trauma. Pharmacotherapy in the aftermath of serious physical injury or exposure to traumatic events may be effective for the secondary prevention of PTSD.

- **Methods**: We identified 696 injured U.S. military personnel without serious traumatic brain injury from the Navy-Marine Corps Combat Trauma Registry Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database. Complete data on medications administered were available for all personnel selected. The diagnosis of PTSD was obtained from the Career History Archival Medical and Personnel System and verified in a review of medical records.

- **Results**: Among the 696 patients studied, 243 received a diagnosis of PTSD and 453 did not. The use of morphine during early resuscitation and trauma care was significantly associated with a lower risk of PTSD after injury. Among the patients in whom PTSD developed, 61% received morphine; among those in whom PTSD did not develop, 76% received morphine (odds ratio, 0.47; P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for injury severity, age, mechanism of injury, status with respect to amputation, and selected injury-related clinical factors.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that the use of morphine during trauma care may reduce the risk of subsequent development of PTSD after serious injury.

### Predicting post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans: Interaction of traumatic load with COMT gene variation [^111EN21E]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Because post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by definition can occur only after exposure to a traumatic event, military veterans who are at high risk for trauma exposure are a particularly relevant population for studying the interaction of trauma with genetic factors that may predispose individuals to the disorder. A number of studies have implicated specific genes as possible risk factors in developing PTSD, including the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT).

- **Methods**: Data from Iraq War veterans (n = 236) were used to examine the interaction between COMT and traumatic experiences in predicting later development of PTSD symptoms. Subjects were assessed for exposure to traumatic events both before and during deployment.

- **Results**: The interaction between trauma load and COMT was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms. Those with the heterozygous genotype (Val/Met) showed fewer symptoms associated with trauma exposure compared to those with either homozygous genotype. This interaction remained significant after controlling for other risk factors for PTSD, including personality dimensions of internalizing and externalizing.

- **Conclusions**: COMT genotype affects risk for development of PTSD symptoms following exposure to trauma.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: a retrospective cohort study [^111jkedP]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Regular use of RAS blockers was associated with a lower risk of probable PTSD following a mean follow-up of 7.5 years among middle-aged adults under antihypertensive treatment. The findings of this study may have implications for the choice of antihypertensive medications for the primary prevention of PTSD. This added benefit of RAS blockers should be considered in the selection of antihypertensive treatment, particularly for people at risk of trauma exposure and/or developing PTSD.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^111bHSDp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Induced by the traumatic experience of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as a life-threatening disease, 13 patients develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 4% and clinically significant PTSD symptoms (PTSS) in 12% after 1 to 12 months. Typical PTSS may include re-experiencing aspects of ACS in thoughts or dreams, avoidance of activities that remind one of ACS, and hyperarousal symptoms.

Notwithstanding their short-term antianxiety effects, benzodiazepines could be a risk factor for the development of ACS-induced PTSS, as observed in critical illness survivors exposed to benzodiazepines in the intensive care unit. Moreover, benzodiazepines increase the risk of developing PTSD at least twofold in patients who experience trauma because they could interfere with the acute physiological stress response and memory-related processes necessary to cope with PTSS. On the other hand, a decrease in both pain and fear conditioning could explain less severe PTSS at follow-up in civilian and military patients who received morphine within hours of trauma. Pain and fear of dying during ACS are risk factors for the development of PTSS, but effects of morphine use on ACS-induced PTSS have not yet been investigated.

Currently, there is no meta-analytic evidence that antidepressants or the β-blocker propranolol prevents the development of PTSS following a traumatic event. However, one previous study observed lowered PTSS at one month in patients with β-blockers during emergency department evaluation for ACS.

On the basis of the evidence, the primary aim of our observational study…

### Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in severely burned patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QHXij]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

**Risk of bias**: Seven (70%) and ten trials (100%) were rated as unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively; the remaining three trials (30%) from the random sequence generation domain were rated at low risk of bias. Only one trial (10%) reported masking of study participants, and the remaining nine trials (90%) were rated at unclear risk of bias for this domain. All trials were rated at unclear risk of bias in terms of blinding of outcome assessors. Three trials (30%) were rated as high risk of attrition bias due to losses to follow-up. High risk of selective reporting was found in eight trials (80%); thus, a dangerous quantity of reporting bias could have been introduced from those trials, although it was difficult to estimate the likely magnitude and direction of this bias. High risk of other biases was identified in six trials (60%) due to small sample sizes. Five trials (50%) reported receiving funding for the research, with none funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Finally, none of the trials posted results on clinical trial websites, and six trials reported receiving ethical approval. The overall risk of bias of the included RCTs is best represented in Figures 2 and 3.

### A beta-adrenergic antagonist reduces traumatic memories and PTSD symptoms in female but not in male patients after cardiac surgery [^115Hwk2r]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Epinephrine enhances emotional memory, whereas beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers, BBs) impair it. However, the effects of BB administration on memory are sex dependent. We predicted differential effects of epinephrine and the BB metoprolol given to male and female patients after cardiac surgery (CS) on traumatic memories and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.

- **Method**: We performed a prospective observational study and determined the number of standardized traumatic memories (NTRM) and PTSD symptom intensity in cardiac surgical patients at 1 day before surgery, and at 1 week and 6 months after the procedure. PTSD symptoms and NTRM were quantified using validated questionnaires. Metoprolol could be administered any time post-operatively.

- **Results**: Baseline NTRM was not significantly different between male (n = 95) and female patients (n = 33). One week after CS, the NTRM in male patients was significantly higher. Metoprolol had no significant effect in either sex. At 6 months, females with metoprolol (n = 18) showed a significantly lower NTRM and significantly lower PTSD symptom scores than females without BBs (n = 15, p = 0.02). By contrast, the total dosage of epinephrine administered correlated with NTRM in males (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) but not in females (r = 0.21, p = 0.29).

- **Conclusions**: Beta-adrenergic stimulation with epinephrine enhances memory for adverse experiences in males but not in females, whereas beta-blockade selectively reduces memory for post-operative adverse events and PTSD symptoms in females.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^113Lx4nn]. APA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for posttraumatic stress disorder, specifically concerning other medications, the APA 2025 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of hypnotics (such as eszopiclone), MAOIs (such as brofaromine and phenelzine), norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (such as bupropion), serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (such as nefazodone), ganaxolone, nepicastat, orvepitant, or augmentation with D-cycloserine or eszopiclone in patients with PTSD.

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m9Qyv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

The effects of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders have not been systematically evaluated previously. The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, addressing the efficacy of oral propranolol versus placebo or other medication as a treatment for alleviating either state or trait anxiety in patients suffering from anxiety disorders.

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies concerned panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (four studies, total n = 130), specific phobia (two studies, total n = 37), social phobia (one study, n = 16), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (one study, n = 19).

Three out of four panic disorder trials qualified for pooled analyses. These meta-analyses found no statistically significant differences between the efficacy of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Also, no evidence was found for the effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity through the inhibition of memory reconsolidation.

In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol at present is insufficient to support the routine use of propranolol in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: Evolving conceptualization and evidence, and future research directions [^112FUYk7]. World Psychiatry (2025). Low credibility.

The understanding of responses to traumatic events has been greatly influenced by the introduction of the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, we review the initial versions of the diagnostic criteria for this condition and the associated epidemiological findings, including sociocultural differences. We consider evidence for post-traumatic reactions occurring in multiple contexts not previously defined as traumatic, and the implications that these observations have for the diagnosis.

More recent developments, such as the DSM-5 dissociative subtype and the ICD-11 diagnosis of complex PTSD, are reviewed, adding to evidence that there are several distinct PTSD phenotypes. We describe the psychological foundations of PTSD, involving disturbances to memory as well as to identity. A broader focus on identity may be able to accommodate group and communal influences on the experience of trauma and PTSD, as well as the impact of resource loss.

We then summarize evidence concerning the biological foundations of PTSD, with a particular focus on genetic and neuroimaging studies. Whereas progress in prevention has been disappointing, there is now extensive evidence supporting the efficacy of a variety of psychological treatments for established PTSD. These include trauma-focused interventions, such as trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and non-trauma-focused therapies, which also include some emerging identity-based approaches such as present-centered and compassion-focused therapy.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^115egHFg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016).

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is consequently best positioned as a clinical intervention for identified and ascertained acute PTSD cases. It is optimally provided at some distance from the traumatic event, during which time survivors with transient symptoms recover. Survivors who recover with early CBT seldom relapse spontaneously but could remain sensitive to subsequent exposure. Importantly, early CBT leaves numerous survivors unimproved, as seen with approximately 20% of those treated in the J-TOPS study. Thus, it should be supplemented by 'second-step' interventions, which unfortunately are very poorly mapped, if at all. CBT is therefore a 'must try' in symptomatic trauma survivors, for many of whom it may shorten symptom duration by months and years.

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Various pharmacological agents have been examined in the prevention of post-traumatic symptoms. A Cochrane review in 2014 concluded that, in general, there is moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone and no evidence for propranolol, escitalopram, temazepam, and gabapentin. This field is rapidly developing as the neurobiological processes underlying PTSD begin to be clarified by more studies.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^113MD7wq]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Most preventive studies at the time of writing are theory-informed. Figure 1 presents the main theoretical models of PTSD pathogenesis, linking each model with specific interventions. The figure posits a progression from genetics and epigenetic vulnerability factors, childhood experience to peri-traumatic distress, and to specific pathogenic mechanisms operating during trauma exposure and its aftermath. The latter include psychological (appraisal of trauma, recovery environment) and putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PTSD.

The review focuses on secondary and tertiary prevention, targeting the progression of psychopathology after the traumatic event. Interventions targeting elements in that progression (e.g. fear conditioning, emotion processing, initial neuroendocrine response) are associated with each element. Considering such a progression shows that the timing and window of opportunity for interventions may be crucial for affecting relevant pathogenic mechanisms. For example, trauma memories may consolidate within hours of trauma, or during the first night's sleep, suggesting that interventions designed to disrupt initial memory consolidation (pharmacological or psychological) must be provided within this timeframe. Other mechanisms in post-traumatic psychopathology, such as changes in memory, context processing, and nociceptive circuits, may also occur within a currently unmapped timeframe, calling for time-dependent intervention delivery.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^113FRwMe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We further found that, in contrast to benzodiazepine exposure during ACS, exposure to morphine and β‐blockers and use of antidepressants was not significantly associated with the development of PTSS. This is consistent with the available evidence from randomized controlled trials on early pharmacotherapy in survivors of noncardiac trauma. However, such studies are rare, precluding meta‐analysis on effects of morphine, which reduced PTSD incidence in civilian and military patients, but may delay the onset of action of oral antiplatelet agents in patients with ACS.

In addition, only propranolol was tested, a lipophilic and nonselective β‐blocker able to cross the blood-brain barrier and block traumatic memory consolidation, but not administered during ACS. Interestingly, metoprolol, which is also lipophilic but a selective β1‐adrenoreceptor antagonist, was previously suggested to have fear-reducing properties after trauma. In a previous study, patients exposed to β‐blockers during emergency department evaluation for ACS had less severe PTSS at 1 month, although not in the subgroup with confirmed ACS, and, unfortunately, the types of used β‐blockers were unknown.

Previous trials with escitalopram were not prevention but early treatment trials, and our patients were taking antidepressants yet before MI, pointing to the vulnerable health of this small subgroup. Specifically, the use of antidepressants was associated with a history of lifetime depression, poorer self-rated health, and negative mood. The rate of almost 30% of p…

### Propranolol's impact on cognitive performance in post-traumatic stress disorder [^1174mU4d]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Propranolol has effectively diminished fear-based emotional memories in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been attributed to traumatic memory reconsolidation blockade. However, propranolol may also exert cognitive effects by modulating stress and arousal.

- **Method**: Within a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, propranolol's impact on cognitive functioning was examined in individuals diagnosed with chronic PTSD. Participants received a single dose of 1 mg/kg of propranolol (n = 20) or placebo (n = 21) and completed subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III). PTSD symptoms were assessed one week before and after treatment using the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R).

- **Results**: The propranolol group performed significantly better on the Processing Speed composite measure compared to the placebo group. Additionally, greater heart rate decreases were associated with higher Perceptual Organization performance within the propranolol group.

- **Limitations**: The generalizability of results may have been reduced as participants were treatment-seeking; the sample size was small and included a greater proportion of females. This study could not assess whether pre-existing psychological function influenced cognitive performance post-trauma. Future studies might consider including a non-PTSD control group to determine if findings are specific to propranolol's effect on PTSD-associated cognitive impairment.

- **Conclusions**: Our preliminary results demonstrated that cognitive functioning improved following propranolol administration.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: A review of recent findings [^114h1PmM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

This article provides an update on recent findings in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with reference to pertinent epidemiologic, etiologic, diagnostic, and treatment advances in the past year. New studies serve to confirm high prevalence rates in the general population (7% to 12%) and high rates of secondary mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Recent substantive evidence has highlighted the unique pattern of biological alteration in PTSD that distinguishes it from the normative stress response and the role of constitutional risk factors and trauma-related factors in determining disease expression after trauma exposure.

The emergence of consistent data suggests that medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavior therapy, are effective in reducing core symptoms and improving quality of life. This has reinforced optimism and encouraged more widespread use of these interventions in patients with PTSD.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: Current evidence and future directions [^112h88F7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Hydrocortisone has been shown to be effective, especially in patients who have never been treated for psychiatric disorders. A study recruited 64 trauma survivors in a level I trauma center and randomly assigned them to hydrocortisone and placebo groups. At three months post-trauma, no hydrocortisone recipients (0%) and three placebo recipients (14%) met full PTSD diagnostic criteria. PTSD symptom severity decreased over time in both groups, with hydrocortisone recipients reporting lower Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores than the placebo group (19.4 ± 4 vs. 31.3 ± 3).

The underlying mechanism has not yet been established. One hypothesis is that hydrocortisone can facilitate extinction learning through both non-genomic and genomic effects. Some also believe that high-dose exogenous hydrocortisone administered shortly after trauma may promote recovery through enhancing synaptic plasticity and connectivity. An animal model showed significantly increased dendritic growth and spine density, with increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and decreased postsynaptic density protein 95 expression in steroid-treated stressed rats.

- **Propranolol**: Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier and is therefore capable of reducing the central nervous system adrenergic drive associated with defensive threat responses. Experimental studies of propranolol in healthy subjects have shown that its administration before exposure to potentially traumatic narratives reduced the recollection of stressful elements of the narratives.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116MQuxa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At doses greater than those required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The effects of propranolol are due to selective blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors while leaving alpha-adrenergic responses intact. There are two well-characterized subtypes of beta receptors (beta1 and beta2); propranolol interacts with both subtypes equally. Beta1-adrenergic receptors are found primarily in the heart. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors leads to a decrease in the activity of both normal and ectopic pacemaker cells and a decrease in A-V nodal conduction velocity. All of these actions can contribute to antiarrhythmic activity and control of ventricular rate during arrhythmias. Blockade of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors also decreases the myocardial force of contraction and may provoke cardiac decompensation in patients with minimal cardiac reserve.

Beta2-adrenergic receptors are found predominantly in smooth muscle — vascular, bronchial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary.

### Early pharmacological interventions for prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals experiencing acute traumatic stress symptoms [^116ccmry]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Acute traumatic stress symptoms may develop in people who have been exposed to a traumatic event. Although they are usually self-limiting in time, some individuals develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe and debilitating condition. Pharmacological interventions have been proposed for acute symptoms to act as an indicated prevention measure for PTSD development. As many individuals will spontaneously remit, these interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of early pharmacological interventions for prevention of PTSD in adults experiencing acute traumatic stress symptoms.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 23 January 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event and presenting acute traumatic stress symptoms, without restriction on their severity. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Using a random-effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH).

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^111kDVbo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent possessing no other autonomic nervous system activity. It specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor agonist agents for available receptor sites. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. At dosages greater than required for beta blockade, propranolol also exerts a quinidine-like or anesthetic-like membrane action, which affects the cardiac action potential. The significance of the membrane action in the treatment of arrhythmias is uncertain.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of propranolol has not been established. Factors that may contribute to the antihypertensive action include: (1) decreased cardiac output, (2) inhibition of renin release by the kidneys, and (3) diminution of tonic sympathetic nerve outflow from vasomotor centers in the brain. Although total peripheral resistance may increase initially, it readjusts to or below the pretreatment level with chronic use of propranolol. Effects of propranolol on plasma volume appear to be minor and somewhat variable.

In angina pectoris, propranolol generally reduces the oxygen requirement of the heart at any given level of effort by blocking the catecholamine-induced increases in the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the velocity and extent of myocardial contraction. Propranolol may increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^113Yhy3Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

In the event of overdosage or an exaggerated response, propranolol is not significantly dialyzable. The following measures should be employed:

- **General**: If ingestion is recent or may have occurred, evacuate gastric contents while taking care to prevent pulmonary aspiration.

- **Supportive therapy**: Hypotension and bradycardia have been reported following propranolol overdose and should be treated appropriately. Glucagon can exert potent inotropic and chronotropic effects and may be particularly useful for treating hypotension or depressed myocardial function following a propranolol overdose. Glucagon should be administered as 50 to 150 mcg/kg intravenously, followed by a continuous drip of 1 to 5 mg/hour for a positive chronotropic effect. Isoproterenol, dopamine, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors may also be useful. However, epinephrine may provoke uncontrolled hypertension. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or isoproterenol; serious bradycardia may require temporary cardiac pacing.

Monitoring of the electrocardiogram, pulse, blood pressure, neurobehavioral status, and intake and output balance is essential. For bronchospasm, isoproterenol and aminophylline may be used.

### Pharmacotherapy in the aftermath of trauma; opportunities in the 'golden hours' [^117D3DGC]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Several lines of research have demonstrated that memories for fearful events become transiently labile upon re-exposure. Activation of molecular mechanisms is required in order to maintain retrieved information. This process is called reconsolidation. Targeting reconsolidation, as in exposure-based psychotherapy, offers a potentially interesting tool to manipulate fear memories and subsequently to treat disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In this paper, we discuss the evidence for reconsolidation in rodents and humans and highlight recent studies in which clinical research on normal and abnormal fear extinction achieved reduction of the expression of fear by targeting the process of reconsolidation. We conclude that reconsolidation presents an interesting opportunity to modify or alter fear and fear-related memories. More clinical research on normal and abnormal fear extinction is required.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: a retrospective cohort study [^112HXKDy]. BMC Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Previous research has shown that the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers is linked to a lower prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but longitudinal studies are scarce. We aimed to estimate the association between the use of RAS blockers and the risk of PTSD among individuals taking antihypertensive medications.

- **Methods**: This longitudinal study included participants aged 40–69 from the UK Biobank. Exposure data were obtained from the initial assessment (2006–2010), while outcome data were obtained from the online mental health questionnaire administered 6–11 years later (2016–2017). We included participants who were under antihypertensive treatment and did not have a prior diagnosis of PTSD before the initial assessment. Use of RAS blockers was defined as self-reported regular use, at the initial assessment, of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Among participants who experienced adverse life experiences, cases of probable PTSD were defined with the six-item PTSD Checklist-Civilian version score ≥ 14. Logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between RAS blocker use and the risk of probable PTSD.

- **Results**: Of the 15,954 participants (mean age = 59.9 years; 42.6% women) under antihypertensive treatment with no prior history of PTSD at the initial assessment, 64.5% were taking RAS blockers. After a mean follow-up of 7.5 years, 1,249 (7.8%) were newly identified with probable PTSD.

### Use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and posttraumatic stress disorder risk in the UK Biobank: A retrospective cohort study [^116FRXJP]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic mental disorder that affects a substantial number of individuals, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 4–9% in the US, U.K., and Canadian general populations. PTSD develops among individuals with a history of trauma and is characterized by symptoms such as re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal. Although various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for PTSD have been developed, there remains a need to further prevent and manage PTSD to mitigate its burden on affected individuals' lives.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the link between trauma and PTSD. Renin is released in response to stress, with plasma levels elevated among individuals exposed to trauma. Severe stress sensitizes angiotensin II signaling in the central nervous system of rodents. Moreover, individuals with PTSD have been shown to have altered RAS activities. Given these consistent strands of inquiry, modification of RAS could play a key role in the development of PTSD following trauma or, conversely, in the improvement of its symptoms.

RAS blockers, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are types of medications used to lower blood pressure by inducing vasodilation and inhibiting sodium retention. In addition to their protective effects on diabetic kidney diseases and heart diseases, RAS blockers have also been associated with decreased risks of.

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries [^112GHeJG]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Symptoms of depression and anxiety may occur in up to half of all patients following significant trauma, resulting in poorer outcomes in functional recovery and quality of life. Established depression is difficult to treat, and a preventative measure is therefore in the interest of both patients and trauma physicians. The mechanisms resulting in clinical depression are not fully established, but intense emotion around the time of trauma is important for subsequent memory recollection and thus depression maintenance. During memory retrieval of traumatic events, adrenergic activity is increased in humans, manifesting as elevated heart rate and skin conduction. These physiological findings are more significant in patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Animal studies show that noradrenaline levels in the brainstem increase with trauma, and amnesia is induced in rodents administered systemic propranolol shortly after memory recollection. In clinical studies, subjects who received metoprolol exhibited diminished physiological stress responses when watching a traumatic event and had impaired memory recall. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that β-adrenergic receptor activation plays a crucial role in the early stages of trauma-induced depression, indicating a potential therapeutic role for β-blockade (BB) in trauma patients. BB treatment administered peri- and post-trauma has been investigated in the context of PTSD and appears to reduce such symptoms, but studies are limited in cohort size and produce conflicting results.

### Effect of post-retrieval propranolol on psychophysiologic responding during subsequent script-driven traumatic imagery in post-traumatic stress disorder [^113B3LGy]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2008). High credibility.

The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, when given within hours of a psychologically traumatic event, reduces physiologic responses during subsequent mental imagery of the event. In this study, we tested the effect of propranolol administered after the retrieval of memories of past traumatic events. Subjects with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder described their traumatic event during a script preparation session and then received a one-day dose of propranolol (n = 9) or placebo (n = 10), in a randomized and double-blind design.

A week later, subjects participated in script-driven mental imagery of their traumatic event while heart rate, skin conductance, and left corrugator electromyogram were measured. Physiologic responses were significantly smaller in the subjects who had received post-reactivation propranolol a week earlier. The administration of propranolol after reactivation of the memory of a past traumatic event reduces physiologic responding during subsequent mental imagery of the event, similar to propranolol given shortly after the occurrence of a traumatic event.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^111Ps1qM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines and morphine are administered during acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) to alleviate anxiety and pain, while β‐blockers may also reduce pain. ACSs may induce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS). It is known that when benzodiazepines are taken during trauma other than ACSs, they increase the risk of PTSS; however, it is unknown if benzodiazepines increase the risk of PTSS in ACSs. This study examined the effects of drug exposure during ACSs on the development of PTSS.

- **Methods and results**: Study participants were 154 patients with a verified ACS. Baseline demographics, clinical variables, and psychological measures were obtained through a medical history, a psychometric assessment, and patient records, which were then used as covariates in linear regression analysis. Three months after an ACS event, the severity of PTSS was assessed using the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale. During ACS, 37.7% of patients were exposed to benzodiazepines, 72.1% to morphine, 88.3% to β‐blockers, and only 7.1% to antidepressants. Eighteen (11.7%) patients developed clinical PTSD. Adjusting for all covariates, benzodiazepine use was significantly associated with the Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale total severity score (unstandardized coefficient B [SE], 0.589 [0.274]; partial r = 0.18; P = 0.032) and the reexperiencing subscore (B [SE], 0.433 [0.217]; partial r = 0.17; P = 0.047). Patients exposed to benzodiazepines had an almost 4‐fold increased relative risk of developing clinical PTSD, adjusting for acute stress disorder symptoms (odds ratio, 3.75; 95% CI, 1.31–1).

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries [^115fTkjU]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Interestingly, despite the reduction in patient depression associated with pre-admission β-blockade (BB), the unadjusted reduction in the incidence of depression between groups (BB (+) vs. BB (−)) did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.20). However, the unadjusted analysis does not account for confounding factors such as the fact that patients who had been prescribed β-blockers had significantly longer ICU stays and were older, both factors associated with depressive syndromes. For example, trauma patients admitted to the ICU have been estimated to have a four times greater risk of developing moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms six months post-injury. Additionally, the observed protective effect of BB in this study increased when adjustment was made for significant group differences in the logistic regression model, strengthening the observed impact of BB on the risk of depression.

While our findings support a possible BB effect on post-trauma depression, the retrospective design does not establish a direct causal link. Further investigation is required into the mechanisms behind this effect, and a prospective design examining whether early β-blockade during the admission itself results in the same outcome would be of value. Additionally, the national drugs registry neither keeps a record of alternative therapies for depression, such as electroconvulsive or talking/behavioral therapies, nor does it register the medical indication for prescriptions. Except for the exclusion of patients prescribed pre-admission antidepressants, the study design is una

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ELPqv]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Propranolol's generic status and the fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become the first-line pharmacological treatment across the range of anxiety disorders have probably contributed to gradually declining attention to the agent as a potential treatment for anxiety-related conditions. More recently, however, with advanced insights into the way the brain processes emotional experiences and their pivotal role in the development and persistence of several mental disorders, the psychopharmacological properties of propranolol have regained research attention.

Whereas propranolol was first studied as a general anxiolytic in the treatment of anxiety disorders, today it is mainly its amnesic effect on retrieved fear memory that is the subject of interest. There is evidence to suggest that following a fear memory is recollected and followed specifically by a prediction error (a discrepancy between actual and expected negative events), propranolol selectively blocks protein synthesis. This action prohibits the 'reconsolidation' of the fear memory while sparing declarative memory. A recent meta-analysis of eight experiments with healthy human volunteers (total n = 308) supported this line of reasoning, finding that compared with placebo, propranolol administered before memory reactivation is capable of reducing the expression of cue-elicited fear responses. These findings have tempted several authors to suggest that propranolol has potential for treating anxiety disorders rooted in the presence of disturbing memories.

### Risk and preventive factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Alcohol consumption and intoxication prior to a traumatic event diminishes the relative risk to develop PTSD in response to that trauma [^111iZLir]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

Previous reports examined the effects of selected pre- (e.g. female gender, previous trauma), peri- (e.g. the horror of the trauma, threatened death), or post-exposure (e.g. the physical injury caused by the trauma) risk factors on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder associated with a traumatic event outside the range of usual human experience. We hypothesized that alcohol consumption prior to traumatic events may reduce the incidence rate of PTSD. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the above risk factors and preventive factors, such as alcohol consumption, on the development of PTSD.

- **Methods**: An epidemiological cohort study was carried out on 127 victims trapped in a ballroom fire. Data were collected 7–9 months after the traumatic event by means of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and structured interviews. These were aimed at assessing the above pre-, peri-, and post-exposure factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association of PTSD with the etiologic factors and to delineate those risk factors which contribute most to the development of PTSD.

- **Results**: Female gender, the number of previous traumas, a past history of simple phobia, threatened death, trauma exposure, hospitalization for trauma-induced injuries, and the presence of burns increased the odds of PTSD. In contrast, a sense of control during the trauma and alcohol consumption and intoxication decreased the odds of PTSD. Six factors made independent contributions to the prediction of PTSD, i.e. the number of previo.

### Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in severely burned patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jguHz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). High credibility.

We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with a severe burn, defined as a burn with an affected area greater than 20% of the total body surface area (TBSA). Trials were eligible if they evaluated propranolol as the intervention of interest in adults or children and compared it to usual care or placebo. We excluded trials where propranolol was compared to other pharmacologic interventions and trials evaluating the combination of propranolol with other interventions. Two investigators independently assessed articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria and selected studies for the final analysis, with divergences resolved by consensus.

### Does memory of a traumatic event increase the risk for posttraumatic stress disorder in patients with traumatic brain injury? A prospective study [^111hRqSx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The present study examined prospectively the relationship between memory of the traumatic event and the subsequent development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More specifically, the aims of this study were to investigate the possibility that a lack of memory of the traumatic event might be a protective factor; assess whether memory of the traumatic event equally affects the three symptom clusters of PTSD: reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal; and explore the predictive value of memory of the traumatic event for the development of subsequent PTSD in the immediate aftermath of the event.

One hundred twenty subjects with mild traumatic brain injury who were hospitalized for observation were assessed immediately after the trauma and followed up 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months later. All participants underwent psychiatric evaluation and self-assessment of their memory of the traumatic event.

Overall, 17 (14%) of the participants met full criteria for PTSD at 6 months. Subjects with memory of the traumatic event were significantly more likely to develop PTSD than those without memory of the traumatic event; the difference between the groups resulted primarily from the reexperiencing cluster. Logistic regression analysis revealed that memory of the traumatic event within the first 24 hours is a strong predictor of PTSD 6 months after the event.

Our study indicated that memory of a traumatic event is a strong predictor and a potential risk factor for the subsequent development of PTSD. Future studies are needed to show whether additional factors influence this relationship.

### Emotional face processing in post-traumatic stress disorder after reconsolidation impairment using propranolol: A pilot fMRI study [^116vcyra]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit exaggerated emotional reactions to threatening stimuli, which may represent deregulated fear-conditioning associated with long-term adaptations in the sympathetic nervous system. Within a repeated measures design, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed to investigate neural responses to threat in PTSD participants (N = 7) during the presentation of emotional facial expressions. Scans were separated by six weekly reconsolidation impairment treatment sessions, consisting of traumatic memory reactivation under the influence of propranolol.

Greater activation before versus after treatment emerged in the thalamus and amygdala during fearful versus neutral face processing. Furthermore, participants showed greater activation after versus before treatment in the right anterior cingulate during fearful relative to happy face processing. PTSD symptoms significantly improved (d = 1.75) post-treatment. These preliminary results suggest that aberrant emotional responding is modulated by noradrenergic plasticity within the amygdala-prefrontal cortex circuit, a neural substrate for the pharmacological treatment of PTSD.

### Treatment with β-blockers and incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder after cardiac surgery: a prospective observational study [^115yBiSf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to investigate perioperative factors associated with the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. The study was designed as a prospective observational study conducted at a single academic center. The participants were 128 consecutive patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Patients were interviewed within the surgical unit 1 to 3 days before cardiac surgery. Six months after surgery, participants were mailed the modified version of the Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Inventory 10. Of the 71 patients who completed the questionnaire and mailed it back at follow-up, 14 (19.7%) received a diagnosis of PTSD. Among the female patients, seven of 13 who were not treated with β-blockers received a diagnosis of PTSD compared with none of the 12 who were treated with β-blockers (p = 0.005, Fisher exact test).

In a general linear model, including sex and β-blocker treatment as predictors, the Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Inventory 10 score was significantly predicted by β-blockade (F = 4.74, p = 0.033). There was a significant interaction between sex and β-blockade (F = 9.72, p = 0.003).

These findings suggest that the use of β-blockers might be protective against the development of PTSD in women after cardiac surgery.

### The role of early pharmacotherapy in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after traumatic injury: An observational cohort study in consecutive patients [^113EaBKZ]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacological intervention during traumatic memory consolidation has been suggested to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this study was to examine the association between the prescription of early pharmacotherapy and the risk of developing PTSD symptoms following traumatic injury.

- **Method**: The use of opiate analgesics, beta-adrenergic blockers, corticosteroids, and benzodiazepines within 48 hours post-injury was documented based on hospital charts for 629 Level 1 trauma center patients. PTSD symptoms were assessed using structured clinical interviews. The primary outcome was PTSD symptoms at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included PTSD diagnoses at 6 weeks and during 1 year post-trauma.

- **Results**: Linear regression analyses showed that opiate administration within 48 hours was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms at 6 weeks (β = -0.14, P = 0.009) after controlling for demographic and injury-related characteristics. Fewer patients with opiates had a PTSD diagnosis at 6 weeks (P = 0.047) and during 1 year post-trauma (P = 0.013) than patients with none of the specified pharmacotherapies. Low prescription frequency of beta-blockers (3.8%), corticosteroids (2.2%), and benzodiazepines (7.8%) precluded further examination of their role in the development of PTSD symptoms due to limited statistical power.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests a possible beneficial influence of opiate administration within 48 hours post-trauma on the development of PTSD symptoms. Future studies may evaluate the effectiveness of in-hospital opiate analgesics compared to placebo.

### Does beta-blockade reduce the risk of depression in patients with isolated severe extracranial injuries [^116NTVVW]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Exposure to pre-admission β-blockers significantly reduces the risk of developing depression by a factor of three up to one year following severe traumatic extracranial injury. Further investigation is needed to explore whether β-blockade in these instances may have a prophylactic or possibly therapeutic role.
