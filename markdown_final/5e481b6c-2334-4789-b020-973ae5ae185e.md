## Question

is intravenous theophylline still being used in bronchospasm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous theophylline (aminophylline) is still being used for bronchospasm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "still being used" in terms of guideline positions and real-world practice patterns. Then, I should review the most authoritative guidelines (GINA, GOLD, CHEST, VA/DoD) for their current recommendations. Next, I will examine the efficacy and safety evidence from randomized trials and systematic reviews, especially Cochrane and network meta-analyses. After that, I need to consider pediatric versus adult data, regional practice variations, and special scenarios where IV theophylline might still be used. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and practical implications for clinicians, making sure to verify each claim against high-credibility sources as I go [^112jnau7] [^115MsZm3] [^117KGC3t] [^114Cxgat] [^112Ubs2n].

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't drift. By "still being used", I need to distinguish routine, guideline-supported use versus exceptional or historical use in refractory cases or resource-limited settings; I should also separate asthma from COPD and adult from pediatric populations. I should verify whether the most recent guideline iterations still advise against IV methylxanthines in acute exacerbations, and I should double-check if any major guideline makes an exception for ICU use or pediatric status asthmaticus before drawing conclusions [^112jnau7] [^117KGC3t] [^114Cxgat] [^112Ubs2n].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor the hierarchy of evidence. GINA 2024/2025 explicitly recommends not using IV aminophylline/theophylline for asthma exacerbations due to poor efficacy and significant adverse effects, favoring SABA, systemic corticosteroids, and selected adjuncts; I should confirm there is no exception carved out for the ICU, and indeed there is none mentioned in these high-credibility documents [^112jnau7] [^115MsZm3]. GOLD 2025 likewise does not recommend IV methylxanthines for COPD exacerbations because of lack of efficacy and important side effects, reinforcing the same theme across obstructive airway diseases [^117KGC3t] [^114AgbrN]. CHEST 2025 concurs, recommending against IV methylxanthines in adult asthma and COPD exacerbations for the same reasons, and VA/DoD places theophylline as a non-preferred, specialty-only option with narrow therapeutic index and significant toxicity, underscoring that it is not routine primary care therapy [^114Cxgat] [^112Ubs2n].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA label position so I don't overstate guideline consensus as regulatory fact. The FDA labeling for IV aminophylline indicates it as an adjunct to inhaled beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations, reflecting older approval language; however, multiple high-quality evidence summaries and contemporary guidelines conclude that adding IV theophylline to standard care generally does not improve outcomes and increases adverse effects, which is why guidelines recommend against routine use despite the legacy indication [^113EihQt] [^113kzrRy] [^116PSioH].

> I will now examine the adult asthma evidence base. The Cochrane review of IV aminophylline added to inhaled beta-agonists shows no consistent benefit in lung function or admission reduction and higher rates of vomiting and arrhythmias/palpitations, supporting a negative risk–benefit balance in ED settings; I should double-check that subgroup analyses didn't identify a responsive population, and indeed none were found [^116PSioH]. A Cochrane comparison of IV beta-agonists versus IV aminophylline found no consistent superiority of either, again emphasizing that IV bronchodilators are inferior to inhaled therapy and carry more adverse effects; importantly, many included trials were small and heterogeneous, so conclusions should be cautious but align with guideline direction away from IV methylxanthines [^1172zp1W] [^116SLaxK]. A separate Cochrane review of adding IV beta-agonists to inhaled therapy also fails to show clear benefit and highlights side effects, reinforcing that the IV route for bronchodilators should be reserved for special circumstances rather than routine care [^113oU8bQ].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric data separately because practice sometimes diverges. In children with severe asthma, Cochrane reviews suggest that IV aminophylline can produce modest improvements in lung function (FEV1) within 6–24 hours but does not shorten hospital stay or reduce nebulizer use and increases vomiting; the clinical relevance of small spirometric gains without improved patient-centered outcomes is limited, so routine use is not supported [^116UbHRB] [^11759QP2]. A 2025 meta-analysis of pediatric RCTs likewise found no significant benefits in key outcomes but more emesis and nausea with aminophylline, aligning with prior conclusions; a contemporaneous pediatric network meta-analysis suggests IV magnesium sulfate performs better than methylxanthines for several outcomes, which helps rank adjunct options when IV therapy is considered [^113jG8SX] [^114jZgmS]. But wait, what if critical asthma is different? The AARC/PALISI guideline issues a conditional, very low certainty recommendation for or against IV methylxanthines in pediatric critical asthma, reflecting persistent uncertainty and heterogeneity; some pediatric ICU studies show signals for lower intubation or cost advantages, but these are not sufficient to overturn the broader negative risk–benefit view for routine use [^1173rkpL] [^1139uysX].

> Next, I should review COPD exacerbation data so I don't overgeneralize from asthma. Multiple systematic reviews and guidelines converge on the same conclusion: IV methylxanthines offer little to no improvement in FEV1 or clinical endpoints and increase gastrointestinal adverse effects; thus, they are not recommended for COPD exacerbations, where SABA/SAMA and systemic corticosteroids remain first-line [^1154bCu9] [^114AgbrN] [^117KGC3t]. Mechanistically, theophylline's benefits in stable COPD are modest and offset by toxicity, and there is no convincing acute-efficacy signal to justify IV use in exacerbations, reinforcing the guideline stance [^116gn1AU] [^111QniHt].

> I need to check regional practice patterns to reconcile "still being used" with "not recommended". Epidemiologic data from China show declining but still substantial use of theophylline, including IV formulations, particularly in lower-tier cities and central/western regions; this likely reflects historical prescribing inertia, access issues, and training gaps rather than superior efficacy, and it highlights a quality-improvement opportunity to align with modern standards [^116sNeQ9] [^1131tBwB]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that "50% still use IV theophylline", but I should be precise: one analysis reported IV theophylline comprising over 50% of theophylline use in certain regions, which is not the same as 50% of all clinicians using it; nonetheless, it documents persistent, non-guideline-concordant practice that warrants attention [^116sNeQ9].

> Let me consider special scenarios where IV theophylline might still be reasonable so I don't dismiss all contexts. Refractory perioperative bronchospasm unresponsive to inhaled therapy is a setting where some anesthesia and airway protocols list IV theophylline as a rescue adjunct alongside beta-agonists, though this is based on limited evidence and should be individualized with careful monitoring; similarly, rare adenosine-induced bronchospasm has been treated with IV aminophylline in case reports, again reflecting exceptional rather than routine use [^116VJsVL]. I should also acknowledge that a small number of clinicians may still use IV methylxanthines in the PICU for refractory pediatric status asthmaticus when other options fail, recognizing the weak evidence base and the need for expertise in dosing and monitoring; this remains controversial and is not a standard-of-care endorsement [^1139uysX] [^1173rkpL].

> I should confirm the safety and monitoring requirements because they materially affect the risk–benefit calculus. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index with notable toxicity including nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, and seizures; drug interactions and physiologic states (fever, smoking, liver disease, pregnancy) alter clearance, necessitating serum level monitoring and dose adjustments, which complicates acute care workflows and increases risk when benefits are marginal [^114fYf2f] [^114Kt8DN]. The Cochrane review quantifies higher odds of vomiting and arrhythmias/palpitations with IV aminophylline, reinforcing the need to avoid routine use when safer, more effective alternatives exist [^116PSioH].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a contradictory signal. Contemporary, high-credibility guidelines consistently recommend against IV theophylline/aminophylline for acute asthma and COPD exacerbations due to lack of added benefit and increased adverse effects; the strongest, most consistent evidence shows no improvement in admission or clinically meaningful lung function endpoints in adults, while pediatric data show small spirometric gains offset by more emesis and no reduction in length of stay or resource use; real-world use persists in some regions but is declining and reflects non-guideline-concordant practice rather than superior outcomes [^112jnau7] [^115MsZm3] [^117KGC3t] [^114Cxgat] [^116PSioH] [^113jG8SX] [^116sNeQ9]. Therefore, IV theophylline is not routinely used for bronchospasm in modern, guideline-concordant care; it may be considered only in exceptional, refractory circumstances by experienced clinicians with appropriate monitoring, and even then the evidence base is weak and the risk profile is nontrivial [^1173rkpL] [^1139uysX].

Intravenous theophylline is **not routinely used** for acute bronchospasm due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects [^116PSioH]. Current guidelines recommend inhaled beta-agonists and corticosteroids as first-line therapy [^113kzrRy]; IV theophylline is reserved for **refractory cases** when standard treatments fail or are unavailable [^113kzrRy]. It may improve lung function in severe asthma [^116UbHRB] but increases risks of arrhythmias, seizures, and gastrointestinal effects, requiring close monitoring of serum levels [^112Ubs2n]. Use is declining globally, with regional variation, and is generally limited to specialized settings [^116o8H8B] [^112Ubs2n].

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **GINA 2025**: Recommends against routine use of IV aminophylline/theophylline in asthma exacerbations due to poor efficacy and significant adverse effects; reserve for refractory cases when standard therapies fail [^112jnau7].

- **GOLD 2025**: Recommends against IV methylxanthines in COPD exacerbations due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects [^117KGC3t].

- **CHEST 2025**: Recommends against IV methylxanthines in asthma and COPD exacerbations due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects [^114Cxgat].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting or discouraging use

### Evidence supporting use

Evidence supporting use is **limited**; IV theophylline may improve lung function in severe asthma, particularly in children, but does not consistently reduce hospital stay or mechanical ventilation [^116UbHRB] [^113jG8SX]. It may be considered in refractory bronchospasm when first-line therapies fail or are unavailable [^113kzrRy].

---

### Evidence discouraging use

Evidence discouraging use shows that IV theophylline provides **no significant additional bronchodilation** over inhaled beta-agonists and corticosteroids and increases adverse effects such as arrhythmias, seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^116PSioH] [^112Ubs2n]. It is also less effective than inhaled beta-agonists and corticosteroids for acute bronchospasm [^112F3cZV].

---

## Clinical scenarios where intravenous theophylline may still be considered

IV theophylline may be considered in **refractory asthma** when patients do not respond to inhaled beta-agonists, corticosteroids, and magnesium sulfate, particularly in ICU settings [^117JCJ6t]. It is also an option when inhaled therapies are unavailable or contraindicated, such as in resource-limited settings or when patients cannot tolerate inhaled medications [^notfound].

---

## Adverse effects and safety considerations

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Arrhythmias, tachycardia, hypotension [^notfound].

- **Neurological effects**: Seizures, tremors, anxiety, insomnia [^112Ubs2n].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain [^notfound].

- **Narrow therapeutic index**: Requires close monitoring of serum theophylline levels to avoid toxicity [^112F3cZV].

## Comparison with alternative bronchodilators

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Current recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Inhaled beta-agonists | High | Excellent | First-line therapy [^1158sEkS] |
| Corticosteroids | High | Excellent | First-line therapy [^1158sEkS] |
| Magnesium sulfate | Moderate | Excellent | Adjunctive therapy [^111AiAMp] |
| IV theophylline | Limited | Poor | Reserved for refractory cases [^117JCJ6t] |

---

## Regional and institutional variations in practice

Use of IV theophylline **varies by region**, with higher use in some Asian countries and lower use in Western countries [^1131tBwB]. Institutional policies also differ; some hospitals have protocols for refractory cases, while others have removed it from formularies.

---

## Recent developments and emerging evidence

Recent studies and reviews continue to show **limited benefit and significant adverse effects**, reinforcing the recommendation to avoid routine use [^113jG8SX]. Interest has shifted toward safer, more effective alternatives such as biologics and targeted therapies [^notfound].

---

Intravenous theophylline is **not routinely used** for acute bronchospasm due to limited efficacy and significant adverse effects. It is reserved for refractory cases when standard therapies fail or are unavailable, and requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic index [^112jnau7].

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, other treatments, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use IV aminophylline or theophylline for the management of asthma exacerbations due to their poor efficacy and safety profile, and the greater effectiveness and relative safety of short-acting β-agonist.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115MsZm3]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Aminophylline and theophylline — intravenous aminophylline and theophylline should not be used in asthma exacerbations, given poor efficacy and safety compared with SABA; nausea and/or vomiting are more common with aminophylline, severe and potentially fatal side-effects are associated with intravenous aminophylline (especially with prior sustained-release theophylline), and in adults with severe exacerbations add-on aminophylline does not improve outcomes compared with SABA alone.

### Salbutamol or aminophylline for acute severe asthma: how to choose which one, when and why? [^112SoUuc]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Acute, severe exacerbations of asthma present a challenge due to the significant morbidity associated with this presentation. For exacerbations that are refractory to initial treatments with inhaled and oral therapies, there is still doubt about which intravenous therapies are most likely to be helpful. β-2 agonists and aminophylline have differing mechanisms of action that also affect their adverse effects profiles and these are considered. A review of the available randomised control trials suggests that a bolus of intravenous salbutamol may reduce symptoms and hasten recovery. Aminophylline infusions may improve lung function, and in some studies have been shown to improve symptoms, but the evidence is not clear cut. Decisions about which treatment to use should include risk management considerations such as ease of prescription, preparation and administration factors and availability of high-dependency beds.

### Theophylline anhydrous (Theo-24) [^115p1nWp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General Considerations:

Theo-24, like other extended-release theophylline products, is intended for patients with relatively continuous or recurring symptoms who have a need to maintain therapeutic serum levels of theophylline. It is not intended for patients experiencing an acute episode of bronchospasm (associated with asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema). Such patients require rapid relief of symptoms and should be treated with an immediate-release or intravenous theophylline preparation (or other bronchodilators) and not with extended-release products.

Patients who metabolize theophylline at a normal or slow rate are reasonable candidates for once-daily dosing with Theo-24. Patients who metabolize theophylline rapidly (e.g., the young, smokers, and some nonsmoking adults) and who have symptoms repeatedly at the end of a dosing interval, will require either increased doses given once a day or preferably, are likely to be better controlled by a schedule of twice-daily dosing. Those patients who require increased daily doses are more likely to experience relatively wide peak-trough differences and may be candidates for twice-a-day dosing with Theo-24.

Patients should be instructed to take this medication each morning at approximately the same time and not to exceed the prescribed dose.

Recent studies suggest that dosing of extended-release theophylline products at night (after the evening meal) results in serum concentrations of theophylline which are not identical to those recorded during waking hours and may be characterized by early trough and delayed peak levels. This appears to occur whether the drug is given as an immediate-release, extended-release, or intravenous product. To avoid this phenomenon when two doses per day are prescribed, it is recommended that the second dose be given 10 to 12 hours after the morning dose and before the evening meal.

### Aminophylline [^113kzrRy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Studies:

Inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids are the treatments of first choice for management of acute exacerbations of asthma. The results of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of adding intravenous theophylline to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma have been conflicting. Most studies in patients treated for acute asthma exacerbations in an emergency department have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline does not produce greater bronchodilation and increases the risk of adverse effects. In contrast, other studies have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients requiring hospitalization, particularly in patients who are not responding adequately to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases dyspnea, air trapping, the work of breathing, and improves contractility of diaphragmatic muscles with little or no improvement in pulmonary function measurements.

### Theophylline anhydrous (theophylline) [^112F3cZV]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

In adolescents ≥ 16 years and adults, including the elderly, the final theophylline dose should not exceed 400 mg/day in the presence of risk factors for reduced theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.

D. Loading Dose for Acute Bronchodilatation:

An inhaled beta-2 selective agonist, alone or in combination with a systemically administered corticosteroid, is the most effective treatment for acute exacerbations of reversible airways obstruction. Theophylline is a relatively weak bronchodilator, is less effective than an inhaled beta-2 selective agonist and provides no added benefit in the treatment of acute bronchospasm. If an inhaled or parenteral beta agonist is not available, a loading dose of an oral immediate release theophylline can be used as a temporary measure. A single 5 mg/kg dose of theophylline, in a patient who has not received any theophylline in the previous 24 hours, will produce an average peak serum theophylline concentration of 10 mcg/mL (range 5–15 mcg/mL). If dosing with theophylline is to be continued beyond the loading dose, the guidelines in Sections A.1.b. B.3, or C., above, should be utilized and serum theophylline concentration monitored at 24 hour intervals to adjust final dosage.

* Patients with more rapid metabolism, clinically identified by higher than average dose requirements, should receive a smaller dose more frequently to prevent breakthrough symptoms resulting from low trough concentrations before the next dose. A reliably absorbed slow-release formulation will decrease fluctuations and permit longer dosing intervals.

¶ Dose reduction and/or serum theophylline concentration measurement is indicated whenever adverse effects are present, physiologic abnormalities that can reduce theophylline clearance occur (e.g., sustained fever), or a drug that interacts with theophylline is added or discontinued (see WARNINGS).

### Asthma in adults [^114WFcbt]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic, and for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 121 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: for acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus Ipratropium bromide, nebulisers, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting intravenous), corticosteroids (inhaled), corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, short courses), education about acute asthma, generalist care, helium-oxygen mixture, magnesium sulphate (intravenous, adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists), mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen, controlled 100% oxygen), specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled as needed for symptom relief), inhaled corticosteroids (low dose, increasing dose), leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids), theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Intravenous bronchodilators in pediatric critical asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116yTbfz]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

To prepare this report, we used the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metanalyses (PRISMA) checklist for network metanalyses (Supporting Information S1: Table 1). This review was conducted as part of a project to develop clinical practice guidelines for pediatric critical asthma. The protocol for the systematic review was submitted to the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) at the University of York, United Kingdom and the application was accepted on March 29, 2023 (registration number CRD42023409281). Details of the protocol for the systematic review can be accessed at.

2.1 Review Question

What is the relative effectiveness and ranking of adjunct IV bronchodilators (MgSO 4, methylxanthines, and SABA) in children presenting with critical asthma who are unresponsive to initial treatment (systemic corticosteroids and inhaled SABA)?

Population: Acutely ill children receiving treatment for severe asthma exacerbation in a hospital setting (emergency department, hospital ward, or PICU).

Intervention: IV MgSO 4, IV methylxanthines (aminophylline or theophylline), IV SABA (salbutamol, terbutaline).

Comparator: Placebo or Control

Outcomes: Outcomes were selected before the literature search and rated for their patient‐ centeredness and importance using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Using this process, the panel of experts categorized the outcomes as the following:
a. Critical outcomes: Intubation rate, mortality.
b. Important outcomes: Hospital length of stay (LOS), noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) use rate, PICU admission, PICU LOS, side effects (hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmia, nausea/vomiting, flushing, seizure), change in respiratory score
c. Outcome of limited importance: composite outcome of other adjunct therapies, measures of oxygenation, measures of ventilation, cost.

### Asthma and other recurrent wheezing disorders in children (acute) [^1139FBje]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute childhood asthma is a common clinical emergency presenting across a range of ages and with a range of severities.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta2 agonists (high-dose nebulised, metered-dose inhaler plus spacer device versus nebuliser, intravenous), corticosteroids (systemic, high-dose inhaled), ipratropium bromide (single- or multiple-dose inhaled), magnesium sulphate, oxygen, and theophylline or aminophylline.

### Reassessment of theophylline use for severe asthma exacerbation: is it justified in critically ill hospitalized patients? [^117JCJ6t]. The Journal of Asthma (2002). Low credibility.

In the 1990s, numerous double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials revealed that theophylline therapy offered no benefit to inhaled beta2 agonists and systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbations. Routine use of theophylline in patients hospitalized for asthma is no longer advocated due to the potential for serious adverse effects and lack of benefit. However, the question remains whether this drug adds any benefits in critically ill patients who are being admitted to an intensive care unit. Two recent pediatric studies suggest that theophylline therapy may have a role in the management of patients with impending respiratory failure who have failed aggressive treatment with inhaled beta2 agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and inhaled ipratropium. If a patient has failed to respond adequately to high-dose routine therapies, theophylline should be initiated by a clinician who is competent in dosing, monitoring serum concentrations, and assessing factors that modify clearance of this high-risk drug. Further clinical research is needed to verify the value of theophylline in adults and children with severe asthma exacerbations and impending respiratory failure.

### Addition of intravenous aminophylline to inhaled beta (2)-agonists in adults with acute asthma [^116PSioH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic condition in which sufferers may have occasional or frequent exacerbations resulting in visits to the emergency department (ED). Aminophylline has been used extensively to treat exacerbations in acute asthma settings; however, it's role is unclear especially with respect to any additional benefit when added to inhaled beta(2)-agonists.

Objectives

To determine the magnitude of effect of the addition of intravenous aminophylline to inhaled beta(2)-agonists in adult patients with acute asthma treated in the ED setting.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group register (derived from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL standardised searches) and handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Two independent review authors screened and obtained potentially relevant articles and handsearched their bibliographic lists for additional articles. In the original version of this review published in 2000 we included searches of the database up to 1999. The 2012 review was updated with a revised search from inception to September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous aminophylline versus placebo in adults with acute asthma and treated with inhaled beta(2)-agonists. We included patients who were treated with or without corticosteroids or other bronchodilators provided this was not part of the randomised treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and one review author entered data into RevMan, which was checked by a second review author. Results are reported as mean differences (MD) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidential intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies were included in the previous version of the review, and we included two new studies in this update, although we were unable to pool new data. Overall, the quality of the studies was moderate; concealment of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only seven (45%) of the trials. There was significant clinical heterogeneity between studies as the doses of aminophylline and other medications and the severity of the acute asthma varied between studies. There was no statistically significant advantage when adding intravenous aminophylline with respect to hospital admissions (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.12; 6 studies; n = 315). In 2000 it was found that there was no statistically significant effect of aminophylline on airflow outcomes at any time period; the addition of two trials in 2012 has not challenged this conclusion. People treated with aminophylline and beta(2)-agonists had similar peak expiratory flow (PEF) values compared to those treated with beta(2)-agonists alone at 12 h (MD 8.30 L/min; 95% CI -20.69 to 37.29 L/min) or (MD -1.21% predicted; 95% CI -14.21% to 11.78% predicted) and 24 h (MD 22.20 L/min; 95% CI -56.65 to 101.05 L/min). Two subgroup analyses were performed by grouping studies according to mean baseline airflow limitation (11 studies) and the use of any corticosteroids (nine studies). There was no relationship between baseline airflow limitation or the use of corticosteroids on the effect of aminophylline. Aminophylline-treated patients reported more palpitations/arrhythmias (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.15 to 7.90; 6 studies; n = 249) and vomiting (OR 4.21; 95% CI 2.20 to 8.07; 7 studies; n = 321); however, no significant difference was found in tremor (OR 2.60; 95% CI 0.62 to 11.02; 5 studies; n = 249).

Authors' Conclusions

The use of intravenous aminophylline did not result in significant additional bronchodilation compared to standard care with inhaled beta(2)-agonists in patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation in the ED setting, or in a significant reduction in the risk of hospital admission. For every 100 people treated with aminophylline an additional 20 people had vomiting and 15 people arrhythmias or palpitations. No subgroups in which aminophylline might be more effective were identified. Our update in 2012 is consistent with the original conclusions that the risk-benefit balance of intravenous aminophylline is unfavourable.

### Theophylline [^116o8H8B]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Theophylline (dimethylxanthine) has been used to treat airway diseases for more than 80 years. It was originally used as a bronchodilator, but the relatively high doses required are associated with frequent side effects, so its use declined as inhaled β2-agonists became more widely used. More recently it has been shown to have antiinflammatory effects in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at lower concentrations. The molecular mechanism of bronchodilatation is inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE)3, but the antiinflammatory effect may be due to inhibition of PDE4 and histone deacetylase-2 activation, resulting in switching off of activated inflammatory genes. Through this mechanism, theophylline also reverses corticosteroid resistance, and this may be of particular value in severe asthma and COPD, wherein histone deacetylase-2 activity is reduced. Theophylline is given systemically (orally as slow-release preparations for chronic treatment and intravenously for acute exacerbations of asthma). Efficacy is related to blood concentrations, which are determined mainly by hepatic metabolism, which may be increased or decreased in several diseases and by concomitant drug therapy. Theophylline is now usually used as an add-on therapy in patients with asthma not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting β2-agonists and in patients with COPD with severe disease not controlled by bronchodilator therapy. Side effects are related to plasma concentrations and include nausea, vomiting, and headaches due to PDE inhibition and at higher concentrations to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures due to adenosine A1-receptor antagonism. In the future, low-dose theophylline may be useful in reversing corticosteroid resistance in COPD and severe asthma.

### Intravenous beta (2)-agonists versus intravenous aminophylline for acute asthma [^1172zp1W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. For rapid bronchodilation in severe cases, penetration of inhaled drug to the affected small conducting airway may be impeded, and the intravenous (IV) rather than inhaled administration of bronchodilators may provide an earlier response. IV beta(2)-agonist agents and IV aminophylline may also be considered as additional interventions in this setting and this review compares IV beta-agonist agents and IV aminophylline in the treatment of people with acute asthma.

Objectives

To compare the benefit of IV beta(2)-agonists versus IV aminophylline for acute asthma treated in the emergency department and in patients admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Register, which is compiled from systematic searches of bibliographic databases as well as handsearching of respiratory journals and conference abstracts. The latest search was run in September 2012. We searched bibliographies from included studies and known reviews were also searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs of patients who presented to the emergency department with acute asthma, and patients admitted to hospital with acute severe asthma, and were treated with IV beta(2)-agonists versus IV aminophylline. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles and selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed using two scoring systems and two review authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from data present in the papers. Trials were combined using a random-effects model for odds ratios (OR) or mean differences (MD) and reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria and in total they included 350 patients. However, opportunities to combine these studies in meta-analyses were limited by the variations in the range of outcomes reported in the trials. Length of stayTwo studies reported length of stay. They were both paediatric trials (with one in paediatric intensive care unit), and there was no significant difference between the two groups (MD 23.19 hours; 95% CI -2.40 to 48.77 hours; 2 studies; N = 73). Individual separate MD analyses for the two studies also indicated no significant difference between the aminophylline and beta(2)-agonist on this outcome. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution owing to the small number of trials and participants the analysis. Pulmonary functionThere were no significant differences in the sequential or summative pulmonary function demonstrated across the studies. Heart rateData for serial heart rates were reported in three studies at various points from 15 to 60 minutes and in each case there were no significant differences between people in the IV aminophylline or beta(2)-agonist groups. The difference between the two groups with respect to final heart rate was statistically significant (MD 10.00; 95% CI 0.99 to 19.01), although these data are from a single, small study and should be interpreted with caution. Adverse effectsThe analyses for giddiness (OR 59.22; 95% CI 2.80 to 1253.05; 1 study; N = 30), nausea/vomiting (where reported as a combined outcome) (OR 14.18; 95% CI 1.62 to 124.52; 2 studies; N = 96) and nausea (OR 6.53; 95% CI 1.60 to 26.72; 2 studies; N = 49) all significantly favoured beta(2)-agonists. In view of the very small number of studies and number of patients contributing to these analyses these results should be interpreted with caution. A closely related review considering the possible benefits of adding IV aminophylline to beta-agonists in adults with acute asthma also indicates a higher incidence of adverse effects associated with IV aminophylline.

Authors' Conclusions

In the included RCTs there was no consistent evidence favouring either IV beta(2)-agonists or IV aminophylline for patients with acute asthma. The opportunity to draw clear conclusions is limited by the heterogeneity of outcomes evaluated and the small sample sizes in the included studies. It is recommended that these data should be viewed carefully alongside the conclusions from separate Cochrane reviews comparing IV beta(2)-agonists plus inhaled beta(2)-agonists versus inhaled beta(2)-agonists alone and IV aminophylline plus inhaled beta(2)-agonists versus inhaled beta(2)-agonists alone.

### Intravenous aminophylline for acute severe asthma in children over 2 years using inhaled bronchodilators [^116UbHRB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous aminophylline was the bronchodilator of choice for many years until supplanted by more effective bronchodilators in the treatment of acute paediatric asthma. Recently there has been renewed interest in this therapy for children with acute severe asthma.

Objectives

To determine whether addition of intravenous aminophylline produces a beneficial effect in children with acute severe asthma receiving oxygen, maximised inhaled bronchodilators and oral/intravenous glucocorticoids.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group register of trials (based on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and hand searched respiratory journals) and reference lists of relevant articles were used to identify relevant studies. The latest search was carried out in October 2000.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised-controlled trials comparing intravenous aminophylline with placebo in children treated with inhaled bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids for acute asthma were considered for this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Full text of 35 trials were anonymized for author, date and publication and two blinded independent reviewers selected eligible studies for inclusion. Disagreement was resolved through consensus. Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. Attempts were made to contact authors to verify accuracy. Results were reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidential intervals (CI).

Main Results

Patients in these trials were predominantly school-aged children hospitalised for acute severe asthma with a baseline FEV1 at 35–40% of predicted and/or a baseline Pulmonary Index of 6–7. Aminophylline significantly improved percentage predicted FEV1 by 6–8 hours (WMD 8.4%; 95% CI: 0.82, 15.92%). The effect was maintained for 24 hours. Improvements were also seen in symptom scores at 6–8 hours (WMD = -0.71; 95% CI: -0.82,-0.60). There was no reduction in hospital stay or in number of nebulisers required. Vomiting was more likely with aminophylline therapy (Relative Risk = 3.69; 95% CI: 2.15, 6.33).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Addition of intravenous aminophylline should be considered early in the treatment of children hospitalised with acute severe asthma with sub optimal response to the initial inhaled bronchodilator therapy. Although the improvement is sustained for 24 hours, there is no apparent reduction in length of hospital stay or number of inhaled beta2-agonists nebulisations. Treatment with aminophylline is associated with an increased risk of vomiting.

### Theophylline versus terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial [^1139uysX]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of theophylline, terbutaline, or theophylline combined with terbutaline treatment in critically ill children with status asthmaticus who are already receiving continuous nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids.

Design

Randomized, prospective, controlled, double-blind trial.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary-care children's medical center.

Patients

Forty critically ill children between the ages of 3 and 15 yrs with impending respiratory failure secondary to status asthmaticus.

Interventions

All patients received intravenous methylprednisolone and continuous nebulized albuterol. The three study groups received theophylline plus placebo (group 1), terbutaline plus placebo (group 2), or theophylline and terbutaline together (group 3).

Measurements and Main Results

Differences in baseline characteristics, change in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, and incidence of adverse events were determined. The three study groups were similar in age, gender, race, asthma severity, and treatment. There were no differences in clinical asthma score over time, length of pediatric intensive care unit stay, or incidence of adverse events between the three groups, with the exception of a higher incidence of nausea in children in group 3. The median hospital cost of medication and theophylline blood levels was significantly lower in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 (280 US dollars vs. 3,908 US dollars vs. 4,045 US dollars, respectively, p < .0001).

Conclusions

Theophylline, when added to continuous nebulized albuterol therapy and intravenous corticosteroids, is as effective as terbutaline in treating critically ill children with status asthmaticus. The addition of theophylline to baseline therapy is more cost-effective when compared with terbutaline alone or terbutaline and theophylline together. Theophylline should be considered for use early in the management of critically ill asthmatic children.

### Perioperative considerations for the patient with asthma and bronchospasm [^114gwbW8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

The incidence of asthma is increasing worldwide, but morbidity and mortality are decreasing because of improvements in medical care. Although the incidence of severe perioperative bronchospasm is relatively low in asthmatics undergoing anaesthesia, when it does occur it may be life-threatening. The keys to an uncomplicated perioperative course are assiduous attention to detail in preoperative assessment, and maintenance of the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory regimens through the perioperative period. Potential trigger agents should be identified and avoided. Many routinely used anaesthetic agents have an ameliorative effect on airway constriction. Nonetheless, acute bronchospasm can still occur, especially at induction and emergence, and should be promptly and methodically managed.

### Use of intravenous aminophylline in addition to the standard first-line treatment in children and adolescents with an acute asthma exacerbation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113jG8SX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

The role of intravenous aminophylline in acute asthma in childhood is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous aminophylline for asthma in children.

Methods

From 1966 to May 2024, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included only randomised controlled trials testing standard treatment in combination with aminophylline and followed the international guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. The outcomes measured were morbidity, escalation of care, length of hospital stay, adverse events, mortality and lung functions. We used the random-effects model for data analysis and the fixed-effects model to evaluate heterogeneity.

Results

Nine studies (466 participants) fulfilled our a priori eligibility criteria. No significant difference was found in post-treatment asthma severity score (mean difference (MD) = 0.13, 95% CI -0.79 to 1.06, I² = 0%), hospitalisation rate (risk ratio (RR) = 0.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.59, I² = 0%), paediatric intensive care unit admission (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.05, I² = 0%), intubation rate (RR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.64, p = 0.1) or length of hospital stay (MD = -3.62, 95% CI -13.05 to 5.82, I² = 31%). Emesis (RR = 3.52, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.06, I² = 0%) and nausea (RR = 4.92, 95% CI 2.41 to 10.06, I² = 0%) occurred more in the aminophylline group. One study showed improved lung function in the aminophylline group, while others showed no difference.

Conclusion

This review showed limited evidence of the benefit of intravenous aminophylline in managing asthma in most preventilation severity parameters. However, lowering the intubation rate and improving lung function deserve more attention.

### Resolution of bronchoconstriction with positive airway pressure after intravenous adenosine [^113NFV7y]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that plays a major role in the pathophysiology of airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also an effective drug at terminating supraventricular tachycardia and used for pharmacological stress testing with a relatively safe side effect profile. There is a contraindication for the use of adenosine in patients with asthma and a caution to use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We present a case of a 63-year old female patient who was treated with adenosine and subsequently went into respiratory distress. She was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure and had rapid resolution of symptoms.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114Cxgat]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Medications

IV magnesium sulfate has been shown to reduce hospitalizations among patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations in the ED, and it should be considered in patients not responding to initial therapies (Table 2).– The use of ketamine, a dissociative analgesic with bronchodilator effects, has been suggested in patients who are not intubated at low, subdissociative doses; however, quality data showing a clinical benefit are lacking. Some interest exists in using biologic agents in asthma exacerbations, given their relatively quick onset over days, although data have been limited to case reports and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating that benralizumab administered in the ED reduced the rate of recurrent exacerbations in the subsequent 12 weeks. Methylxanthines (eg, theophylline and aminophylline) and terbutaline, an IV β 2 -agonist, are not recommended for asthma or COPD exacerbations among adults because of their lack of efficacy compared with inhaled β 2 -agonists, and methylxanthines are associated with increased side effects and adverse events such as tachyarrhythmias.

Inhaled Gases

The use of volatile anesthetics for life-threatening asthma exacerbations has been described in case reports, although prospective data are insufficient to support their use outside of refractory cases of bronchospasm until further research is carried out. – No role currently exists for volatile anesthetics in severe COPD exacerbations because studies show mixed effects on respiratory mechanics compared with IV sedation. Helium-oxygen (heliox) mixtures, used to promote laminar flow and to reduce airway resistance, may improve respiratory mechanics during severe asthma exacerbations, although data are limited on meaningful clinical outcomes in this population. – Among COPD exacerbations requiring NIV or IMV, heliox improves the work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi). Two RCTs of COPD exacerbations requiring NIV found that heliox did not prevent NIV failure; however, trends toward lower intubation rates and greater time to NIV failure were noted in the heliox group. – Heliox could be considered on a case-by-case basis as an adjunct therapy for patients with severe asthma and COPD exacerbations refractory to other treatments.

### Management of acute, severe asthma in children [^111xg7yE]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly present the current options available for the treatment of acute, severe asthma in children, with a special focus on emergency department and inpatient treatment, and to describe newer therapies that may aid treatment in the future.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2001) of the English-language literature pertaining to drug therapy of acute asthma was performed. Key word searches included acute asthma, albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids, magnesium, and theophylline. Additional articles from these sources and published national guidelines were identified. Relevant studies pertaining to current therapy of acute asthma in pediatric patients were selected; if there were minimal pediatric data, adult data were included.

Data Synthesis

Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the airways. Acute exacerbations can occur and are challenging to manage. Albuterol, ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in acute asthma exacerbations. Because some patients do not respond to maximal therapy, older therapies such as magnesium and theophylline are being reevaluated. Theophylline may have some therapeutic effect, but given its toxicity profile, it is unclear whether it offers any advantage over maximal beta(2)-agonist therapy. There are only minimal published data evaluating the use of magnesium in pediatrics, and most are small trials or case reports. Newer therapies such as ventilation strategies with heliox and intravenous leukotriene modifiers currently being evaluated may or may not prove to be beneficial in the future.

Conclusions

beta(2)-agonists, ipratropium, and corticosteroids remain the most useful therapeutic agents for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. However, these agents are not ideal in all patients and, given the existing questions regarding safety and/or efficacy of available alternatives, more effective options are needed.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117KGC3t]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations — pharmacological treatment and bronchodilator delivery specify that the three classes of medications most commonly used are bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. For bronchodilators, it is recommended that short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of a COPD exacerbation. A systematic review of the route of delivery of short-acting bronchodilators found no significant differences in FEV1 between using metered dose inhalers (MDI) (with or without a spacer device) or nebulizers to deliver the agent, although the latter may be an easier delivery method for sicker patients. It is recommended that patients do not receive continuous nebulization but use the MDI inhaler one or two puffs every one hour for two or three doses and then every 2–4 hours based on the patient's response. Although there are no clinical studies that have evaluated the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators with or without ICS during an exacerbation, we recommend continuing these treatments during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended to use in these patients due to significant side effects. If a nebulizer is chosen to deliver the bronchodilator agent, air-driven bronchodilator nebulization is preferable to oxygen-driven in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Methylxanthines for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1154bCu9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Most international guidelines currently recommend methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline, aminophylline) for severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet clinical trials underlying this recommendation have been small and underpowered.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of methylxanthines compared to placebo for COPD exacerbations.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group COPD Register, a compilation of systematic searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL and hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies and reviews were searched.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were limited to RCTs of patients presenting with acute COPD exacerbations, treated with methylxanthines (oral or intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Two reviewers independently selected articles for inclusion and assessed methodological quality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager 4.1. Studies were pooled to yield weighted mean differences (WMD), standardised mean difference (SMD) or odds ratios (OR) and reported using 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).

Main Results

From 29 identified references, 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria (169 patients). Mean change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 2 hours was similar in methylxanthine and placebo groups. Data on clinical outcomes were sparse. Trends toward improvements in hospitalisation and length-of-stay were offset by a trend toward more relapses at one week. Changes in symptom scores were not significant. Methylxanthines caused more nausea and vomiting than placebo (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 1.7 to 12.6) and trended toward more frequent tremor, palpitations, and arrhythmias.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Given current evidence, methylxanthines should not be used for COPD exacerbations. Possible beneficial effects in lung function and clinical endpoints were modest and inconsistent, whereas adverse effects were significantly increased. More selective agents, tested in larger randomised trials, are necessary if methylxanthines are to have any role in the treatment of COPD exacerbations.

### Theophyllin, anhydrous (quibron-T) [^114b4UhV]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

In adolescents ≥ 16 years
and adults, including the elderly, the final theophylline dose should
not exceed 400 mg/day in the presence of risk factors for reduced
theophylline clearance (see WARNINGS) or if it is not feasible to monitor serum theophylline concentrations.

D. Loading Dose for Acute Bronchodilatation:

An inhaled beta-2 selective agonist, alone or in combination
with a systemically administered corticosteroid, is the most effective
treatment for acute exacerbations of reversible airways obstruction.
Theophylline is a relatively weak bronchodilator, is less effective
than an inhaled beta-2 selective agonist and provides no added benefit
in the treatment of acute bronchospasm. If an inhaled or parenteral
beta agonist is not available, a loading dose of an oral immediate
release theophylline can be used as a temporary measure. A single
5 mg/kg dose of theophylline, in a patient who has not received any
theophylline in the previous 24 hours, will produce an average peak
serum theophylline concentration of 10 mcg/mL (range 5–15 mcg/mL).
If dosing with theophylline is to be continued beyond the loading
dose, the guidelines in Sections A.1.b. B.3, or C., above, should
be utilized and serum theophylline concentration monitored at 24 hour
intervals to adjust final dosage.

* Patients
with more rapid metabolism, clinically identified by higher than average
dose requirements, should receive a smaller dose more frequently to
prevent breakthrough symptoms resulting from low trough concentrations
before the next dose. A reliably absorbed slow-release formulation
will decrease fluctuations and permit longer dosing intervals.

† For products containing theophylline salts, the
appropriate dose of the theophylline salt should be substituted for
the anhydrous theophylline dose. To calculate the equivalent dose
for theophylline salts, divide the anhydrous theophylline dose listed
below by 0.8 for aminophylline, by 0.65 for oxtriphylline, and by
0.5 for the calcium salicylate and sodium glycinate salts.

### Theophylline [^116tLmWV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dosage of theophylline PO for symptomatic relief of reversible airway obstruction in adults with asthma is:

- Loading: 5 mg/kg PO once in a patient who has not received any theophylline in the previous 24 hours
- Subsequently: 300 mg PO daily, in 3–4 divided doses, for 3 days
- Maintenance: 400–600 mg PO daily, in 3–4 divided doses

### The acute management of asthma [^1158sEkS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or clinic with acute exacerbation of asthma (AEA) can be very challenging varying in both severity and response to therapy. High-dose, frequent or continuous nebulized short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy that can be combined with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) is the backbone of treatment. When patients do not rapidly clinically respond to SABA/SAMA inhalation, the early use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids should be considered and has been shown to impact the immediate need for ICU admission or even the need for hospital admission. Adjunctive therapies such as the use of intravenous magnesium and helium/oxygen combination gas for inhalation and for driving a nebulizer to deliver a SABA and or SAMA should be considered and are best used early in the treatment plan if they are likely to impact the patients' clinical course. The use of other agents such as theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist currently does not play a major role in the immediate treatment of AEA in the clinic or the ED but is an important therapeutic option for physicians to be aware of and to consider initiating at the time of discharge from clinic, hospital, or ED to reduce later clinical worsening and readmission to the ED and hospital. A comprehensive summary is provided of the currently available respiratory pharmaceuticals approved for asthma and other airway syndromes. Clinicians must be prepared to use the entire spectrum of medications available for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations and the agents that should be initiated to prevent worsening or additional exacerbations. They need to be familiar with the major potential drug toxicities associated with their use.

### Intravenous beta2-agonists for acute asthma in the emergency department [^116SLaxK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled beta-agonist therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of intravenous beta-agonist agents may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of intravenous (IV) beta2-agonists for severe acute asthma treated in the emergency department.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL as well as hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. Bibliographies from included studies and known reviews were also searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented to the emergency department with acute asthma and were treated with IV selective or nonselective beta2-agonists versus placebo, inhaled beta2-agonists, or other standard of care. Pulmonary function, vital signs, arterial gasses, adverse effects, and/or clinical success could be reported as outcome measures. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles and selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed using two scoring systems and two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, and confirmed with corresponding authors. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from data present in the papers. Trials were combined using a random effects model for odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) and reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

From 746 identified references, 55 potentially relevant articles were identified and 15 were included. The trials included 584 patients. Overall, selective IV beta2-agonist use conferred no advantage over the comparator regimes. For example, it was associated with a lower PEFR after 60 mins compared to inhaled beta2-agonist, although the difference was not statistically significant (-24.7 l/min; 95%CI 2.9, -52.3). There was no difference in heart rate (4.5 bpm; 95% CI -4.9, 14.0). In the well performed blinded studies there was no difference in autonomic side effects between treatments (Odds Ratio 2.2 (95%CI 0.9, 5.7).

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the use of IV beta2-agonists in patients with severe acute asthma. These drugs should be given by inhalation. No subgroups were identified in which the IV route should be considered.

### Intravenous magnesium sulphate provides no additive benefit to standard management in acute asthma [^112BHEKB]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) is known to have a bronchodilator effect on smooth muscle but studies have shown conflicting results on its efficacy in acute asthma, although its use is recommended in national and international guidelines.

Aims

To determine if intravenous MgSO(4), when used as an adjunct to standard therapy, improves the outcome in acute asthma.

Methods

A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial comparing 1.2g MgSO(4) with standard therapy in adult patients with acute asthma. Patients had a PEF ≤ 75% predicted and all were treated with oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium, and IV hydrocortisone. They then received 1.2g IV MgSO(4) or placebo. Outcome measures were % predicted PEF at 60 min and hospital admission rates.

Results

One hundred and twenty nine patients were studied. Placebo and active treatment groups were well matched at baseline. MgSO(4) had no benefit with regards hospital admission rates or % predicted PEF at 60 min (p = 0.48) for the whole group, or for subgroups of life-threatening (p = 0.85), severe (p = 0.63) and moderate (p = 0.67) acute asthma.

Conclusion

This study did not show additional benefit from 1.2g IV MgSO(4) when given as an adjunct to standard therapy for acute asthma.

### Aminophylline shortage and current recommendations for reversal of vasodilator stress: an ASNC information statement endorsed by SCMR [^117XbTvn]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Intravenous theophylline — dose equivalence and evidence for vasodilator stress reversal are as follows: due to differences in concentration between aminophylline (25 mg/mL) and theophylline (0.8 mg/ mL), it becomes impractical to administer more than 50 mg of theophylline as a single dose, equivalent to roughly 60 mg of aminophylline; a total of 5 published series with 215 patients support the use of IV theophylline as a vasodilator stress reversal agent, and in the largest such series with 154 patients, only 11 patients (7%) required a second injection with all cases successfully treated.

### Characteristics of medicine use for children with asthma in China: a nationwide population-based study [^116sNeQ9]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Theophylline

The combination of theophylline and glucocorticoids is often employed for the long-term control of moderate to severe asthma, which can facilitate asthma control and reduce hormone doses. However, theophylline is not as effective as low-dose ICS. Its therapeutic window is relatively narrow, and the toxicity is relatively severe. It is generally not the first choice, and it is not recommended to be used intravenously.

Based on the two epidemiological investigations of childhood asthma in China, theophylline use rate has decreased significantly (from 64.0% to 22.4%), which indicates that Chinese clinicians have gradually realized the shortcomings of the weak therapeutic effects and side effects of this agent. In the present study, the overall theophylline use rate was not high (14.38%), but the rates remained high in the central region (63.23%) and in tier 4 and below cities (55.10%). In addition, the proportion of intravenous theophylline used in 4 th tier and below cities was up to 50.64%. These data indicate that the side effects of theophylline have not attracted the attention of pediatricians in those regions. It is necessary to further strengthen the training of pediatricians in those corresponding regions and to reduce the use of theophylline, in order to improve the safety of medication for children with asthma.

Advantages and limitations

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study based on healthcare insurance data in China for the analysis of asthma medication use among children. The major strengths included its wide spectrum of data coverage and a certain representativeness of the samples. However, the lack of details of clinical data related to the disease, such as manifestation, diagnosis and treatment progress, makes it impossible to perform a more detailed analysis of drug use based on the clinical diagnosis, stage of asthma and treatment of outcomes. In addition, according to China's data protection regulations, we could only use random samples from fixed ratios drawn by provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities for analyses. Furthermore, since this is a cross-sectional study, we can't clearly analyze the underlying reasons that have caused the differences of asthma medication use among children in different age groups, regions and levels of urban cities, such as the population density of the city, level of poverty or education, medical resources and physician training.

### Management of refractory anaphylaxis: an overview of current guidelines [^115c1qmC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

Although adrenaline is the cornerstone of anaphylaxis treatment (IM for most settings, although in the perioperative setting, guidelines recommend the IV route), the management of RA is less clear. RA can occur in the emergency setting, in perioperative settings, but also during food challenges.

Optimal treatment requires both prompt recognition and appropriate management. The need for adrenaline (via an IV infusion) and fluid resuscitation have been flagged by recent publications. The preferred choice of second-line RA treatments in patients with cardiovascular compromise is unclear owing to the lack of high-quality studies both observational and randomised clinical trials. In patients with a predominant respiratory compromise (severe bronchospasm and severe laryngeal oedema), the use of short-acting bronchodilator treatment (including adrenaline) or of inhaled adrenaline is recommended in most guidelines but not detailed. Despite promising advances in the knowledge of anaphylaxis pathophysiology, mechanisms leading to RA are not well known.

Allergists, emergency physicians, intensivists, paediatricians and anaesthetists need to be aware of RA management, even if this is a rare event.

Whereas a previous article focused on the need for a consensus on RA definition, in this narrative (nonsystematic) review on published guidelines regarding the management of difficult-to-treat anaphylaxis, we identify slightly different approaches according to community or perioperative settings and knowledge gaps in RA management, we discuss postulated pathogenic mechanisms underlining RA and highlight recent research which might yield potential new therapeutic interventions.

### The pulmonary effects of intravenous adenosine in asthmatic subjects [^111bbY18]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The respiratory effects of adenosine, and endogenous nucleoside, have been studied in animals and man. Adenosine is also used therapeutically to treat supraventricular tachycardia. Amongst the reported side effects of intravenous adenosine in asthmatics are bronchospasm and dyspnea; however, in normal subjects we have shown that while intravenous adenosine is dyspnogenic, and also stimulates ventilation and tachycardia, it does not cause bronchospasm. In rats we have shown that intravenous adenosine directly stimulates pulmonary vagal C fibers through activation of A 1 receptors, and it is likely that the dyspnea in man is a direct consequence of pulmonary C fiber activation. Asthmatic subjects are known to have airways inflammation hyperreactivity and it is probable that airway vagal fibers are sensitized in these subjects.

We therefore studied normal subjects and asthmatics, to document whether the intensity of adenosine-induced dyspnea is altered in asthma and whether it is associated with bronchospasm.

3.1 Effects of Interventions on Outcomes

Hospital LOS was studied in nine trials including a three‐arm trial. Table 2a describes the summary of the findings of the NMA for this outcome. With placebo as the reference group, the largest clinically meaningful reduction in hospital LOS was noted with IV MgSO 4 (MD: −3.1 days, 95% CrI: −6.9 days to 0.13 days). IV MgSO 4 also had the highest SUCRA value (0.884), meaning it had the highest probability of being the best intervention (least hospital LOS). IV SABA (0.573) had slightly higher SUCRA compared to IV methylxanthines (0.356) but both were clearly higher than placebo (0.185). The credible intervals around the effect estimates were wide and crossed the line of no effect for all comparisons. The cumulative ranking curves for hospital LOS are shown in Figure 1A. The summary of absolute effect sizes of all the comparisons along with the GRADE certainty of evidence estimates is provided in Supporting Information S1: Table 3.

### Intravenous bronchodilators in pediatric critical asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114jZgmS]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Pediatric critical asthma is one of the most common pediatric illnesses in children admitted to the pediatric ward and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Adjunct intravenous (IV) bronchodilators are often used when initial management with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled short‐acting beta agonists (SABA) fail to provide improvement in a patient's clinical condition. While the recent guidelines gave recommendations for the use of different IV bronchodilators compared to placebo, it did not include ranking on which one should be used as first‐line or second‐line agent. The aim of this network meta‐analysis is to determine the effect of IV bronchodilators on patient‐centered outcomes and rank medications based on their effectiveness in these outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using three databases MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL to identify randomized control trials examining the use of IV magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4), IV methylxanthines (aminophylline or theophylline), IV SABA (salbutamol, terbutaline) in pediatric critical asthma patients. Bayesian network metanalytic framework was used to compare the interventions. Results are reported as odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% Credible Interval (CrI).

Results

Twelve trials (n = 852) were included in the network meta‐analysis. Largest reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS), PICU admission, and PICU LOS were noted with IV MgSO 4; (MD: −3.1 days, 95% CrI: −6.9 days to 0.13 days), (OR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.02, 1.3), and (MD: −4.0 days, 95% CrI: −7.1 days to −1.2 days) respectively. IV MgSO 4 was ranked first in three outcomes of interest with Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA) of 0.884 for hospital LOS, 0.919 for PICU admission, and 0.957 for PICU LOS. For preventing intubation, IV SABA was ranked the highest (SUCRA 0.995), but the only study with IV SABA had zero intubation events. In a sensitivity analysis that excluded studies with zero events, the intubation rate was lowest with IV MgSO 4 (OR 0.10; 95% CrI 0.003, 0.88) and it was ranked the best treatment (SUCRA 0.921).

Conclusions

In this network meta‐analysis comparing different IV adjunct bronchodilators, IV MgSO 4 was ranked first followed by IV SABA, and then IV methylxanthines. Given these findings and the favorable safety profile, ease of use, and low cost, IV MgSO 4 appears most promising the first adjunct IV bronchodilator, however, further large high‐quality trials are still needed before it can be endorsed as routine first‐line agent.

### Intravenous aminophylline for acute severe asthma in children over two years receiving inhaled bronchodilators [^11759QP2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Since the advent of inhaled beta2-agonists, anticholinergic agents and glucocorticoids, the role of aminophylline in paediatric acute asthma has become less clear. There remains some consensus that it is beneficial in children with acute severe asthma, receiving maximised therapy (oxygen, inhaled bronchodilators, and glucocorticoids).

Objectives

To determine if the addition of intravenous aminophylline produces a beneficial effect in children with acute severe asthma receiving conventional therapy.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group register of trials was used to identify relevant studies. The latest search was carried out in December 2004

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials comparing intravenous aminophylline with placebo in addition to usual care in children met the inclusion criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed studies and extracted data. Disagreement in the selection of trials was resolved by consensus. Attempts were made to contact authors to verify accuracy of data.

Main Results

Seven trials met the inclusion criteria (380 participants). Methodological quality was high. All studies recruited children with acute severe asthma and requiring hospital admission. Six studies sought participants who were unresponsive to nebulised short-acting beta-agonist and administered systemic steroids to study participants. In two studies where some children were able to perform spirometry, baseline FEV1 was between 35 and 45% predicted. The addition of aminophylline to steroids and beta2-agonist significantly improved FEV1% predicted over placebo at 6–8 hours, 12–18 hours and 24 hours. Aminophylline led to a greater improvement in PEF% predicted over placebo at 12–18 hours. There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay, symptoms, frequency of nebulsations and mechanical ventilation rates. There were insufficient data to permit aggregation for oxygenation and duration of supplemental oxygen therapy. Aminophylline led to a three-fold increase in the risk of vomiting. There was no significant difference between treatment groups with regard to hypokalaemia, headaches, tremour, seizures, arrhythmias and deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

In children with a severe asthma exacerbation, the addition of intravenous aminophylline to beta2-agonists and glucocorticoids (with or without anticholinergics) improves lung function within 6 hours of treatment. However there is no apparent reduction in symptoms, number of nebulised treatment and length of hospital stay. There is insufficient evidence to assess the impact on oxygenation, PICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Aminophylline is associated with a significant increased risk of vomiting.

### Asthma in adults [^112Noe7U]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild-to-moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for chronic asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 54 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding anti-IgE treatment; beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Myocardial injury during standard treatment of an adult with status asthmaticus [^112seL4u]. The Journal of Asthma (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma affects 5%-10% of adults in the United States. Older adults (> 65 years) with asthma have higher rates of fatal asthma than younger adults. The occurrence of a respiratory emergency, such as status asthmaticus, would seem likely to create a situation of cardiopulmonary dysfunction conducive to myocardial ischemia. However, multiple studies of fatal or near-fatal asthma have failed to incriminate myocardial infarction as a contributing factor. We report a patient without underlying coronary artery disease who sustained myocardial injury consistent with myocardial ischemia and infarction during status asthmaticus while receiving recommended treatment without intravenous sympathomimetics or theophylline.

### Theophylline anhydrous (theophylline) [^113WdYnq]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Studies:

In patients with chronic asthma, including patients with severe asthma requiring inhaled corticosteroids or alternate-day oral corticosteroids, many clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases the frequency and severity of symptoms, including nocturnal exacerbations, and decreases the "as needed" use of inhaled beta-2 agonists. Theophylline has also been shown to reduce the need for short courses of daily oral prednisone to relieve exacerbations of airway obstruction that are unresponsive to bronchodilators in asthmatics.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases dyspnea, air trapping, the work of breathing, and improves contractility of diaphragmatic muscles with little or no improvement in pulmonary function measurements.

B

Short-acting inhaled β 2 -agonists (SABA), with or without short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA), are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of ECOPD, administered using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), with a spacer device if necessary, or nebulization. If a nebulizer is chosen, air-driven is preferable to oxygen-driven nebulization to avoid the potential risk of increasing Pa CO 2. The GOLD 2023 report recommends continuing treatments with long-acting bronchodilators during the exacerbation or to start these medications as soon as possible before hospital discharge. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects.

G

Systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations improve lung function, oxygenation, and risk of early relapse, and reduce treatment failures and length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended. Longer courses increase the risk of pneumonia and mortality. Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration. Nebulized budesonide may be a suitable alternative to systemic corticosteroids in some patients. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat COPD exacerbations in patients with lower blood eosinophil levels.

A

Antibiotics should be given to patients with ECOPD who have increased sputum volume and sputum purulence and most of those requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive). The recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days. The choice of antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern. Usually, initial empirical treatment is an aminopenicillin with clavulanic acid, macrolide, tetracycline, or, in selected patients, quinolone. In patients with frequent exacerbations, severe airflow obstruction and/or exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, cultures from sputum or other materials from the lung should be performed, as gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas species) or resistant pathogens that are not sensitive to the above-mentioned antibiotics may be present. The route of administration (oral or intravenous) depends on the patient's ability to ingest medications and the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotic.

A

Additional therapies may be indicated to maintain appropriate fluid balance, treat the comorbidities, and monitor nutritional aspects. Hospitalized patients with COPD are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and prophylactic measures for thromboembolism should be instituted. At all times, healthcare providers should strongly enforce the need for smoking cessation.

2.5 Statistical Analysis

IV MgSO 4, IV methylxanthine, and IV SABA were the experimental nodes (interventions in a network plot), and placebo/control was considered the reference node in the NMA. We performed the NMA using a Bayesian analytic framework. A Bayesian approach, compared to a frequentist approach, has been preferred for NMA since it is better able to handle studies with very few events and produce probability and ranking outputs that are intuitive to end users. A Bayesian random effects model for network meta‐analysis was adopted because it assumes and accounts for unexplained heterogeneity across studies (details provided in Supporting Information S1). The effect of the intervention for dichotomous outcomes was summarized as odds ratio (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI); continuous measures data were summarized as mean difference (MD) and 95% CrI.

Ranking of interventions was done using the rank probabilities generated by the Bayesian model. We also used Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA) to describe the relative ranking of interventions. SUCRA is expressed as a fraction and provides the relative probability of an intervention being the best among all the options in the model. Thus, SUCRA of 1 for an intervention indicates that the intervention is certain to be the best among all the interventions tested, while a SUCRA of 0 indicates that the intervention is certain to be the worst among the treatments tested. SUCRA should be interpreted in the context of the certainty of evidence and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) which are provided in the summary of evidence tables for each outcome.

The network meta‐analysis was conducted using the GeMTC package of R version 3.5.3 (RStudio, Boston, MA) and the network plots were created using the CINeMA software. We assessed the certainty of evidence using published guidance by the GRADE working group (details provided online in eMethods).

Pair‐wise analysis for outcomes that were not amenable to NMA are reported in a separate clinical practice guideline document.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^1133FjRr]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Theophylline in COPD — pharmacology, safety, and exacerbation outcomes: Theophylline's bronchodilator effects are mediated through inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3 at fairly high serum levels that are associated with frequent side effects, and at lower doses it likely has antiinflammatory effects through phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition and activation of histone deacetylase 2; it is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome p450 system with important drug interactions. In a randomized study of 254 patients with COPD (FEV1, < 70% predicted), participants received formoterol 12 or 24 μg bid, slow-release theophylline titrated to 8 to 20 mg/L 3 to 4 h after dosing, or placebo for 1 year; exacerbations were reduced in both formoterol dosage arms compared with placebo, there was no difference in the theophylline vs placebo arms, and GI side effects were threefold higher with theophylline leading to a 27% withdrawal rate in the first 3 months. Another 1-year trial of slow-release theophylline 100 mg bid in 110 patients with COPD (FEV1, > 30% predicted) reported the odds of exacerbation reduced (0.73) vs placebo.

### Aminophilline suppress the release of chemical mediators in treatment of acute asthma [^117MDqSr]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The control of airway inflammation is crucial for management of asthma. Theophylline has been demonstrated to have an anti-inflammatory effect as a long-term-medication for asthma in various studies. In the present study we attempted to clarify if aminophylline, a theophylline derivative, could act as an anti-inflammatory agent as well as a bronchodilator in the treatment for acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Patients are initially treated either with an intravenous infusion of aminophylline or with inhalation of salbutamol. Pro-inflammatory mediators such as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), histamine, serotonin, thromboxane B2, leukotriene C4 were measured before and one hour after the initial treatment. Clinical parameters such as peak expiratory flow (PEF) and SpO2 were also checked during the studies.

Results

Significant improvements of PEF and SpO2 with both aminophylline and salbutamol treatment were seen. Furthermore, significant decreases of ECP, histamine, and serotonin were observed with aminophylline but not with salbutamol.

Conclusions

Suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators may play a role, at least in part, in the beneficial effects of aminophylline in the treatment of acute exacerbations in asthma. Additionally, this study indicated that treatment with aminophylline is at least as beneficial as nebulized salbutamol in the restoration of lung function.

### Salbutamol: beware of the paradox! [^114qAhQj]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old known asthmatic presented with an acute severe asthma attack to the Accident and Emergency department. Following a poor response to salbutamol and ipratropium nebulisers, he was given intravenous salbutamol and aminophylline. Over the course of the following 3 h, there was improvement in his bronchospasm with decreasing oxygen requirement, however, his respiratory rate showed an upward trend. Serial blood gas estimations showed a worsening metabolic acidosis unresponsive to two fluid boluses of 20 ml/kg of normal saline. Lactate levels were subsequently measured and found to be high, accounting for the metabolic acidosis. High lactate levels were attributed to intravenous salbutamol. His blood gases and lactate level returned to normal within 3 h after stopping intravenous salbutamol. He was recommended on salbutamol nebulisers while still continuing on intravenous aminophylline. He continued to improve and was discharged home after 4 days.

### Pharmacological management of pediatric critical asthma [^115vJNwj]. Respiratory Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric critical asthma, formerly known as status asthmaticus, is a common pediatric condition encountered in emergency departments, hospital wards, and PICUs. Systemic corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators are evidence-based, initial treatments for patients with pediatric critical asthma. If clinical symptoms do not improve, then pediatric practitioners often prescribe adjunctive medications, including inhaled anticholinergics, intravenous ketamine, intravenous magnesium, intravenous short-acting β 2 agonists, and intravenous methylxanthines (eg, aminophylline). In this narrative review, we summarize the current evidence and present the research gaps related to these therapies in the pediatric population.

Methods

For a more detailed discussion of the methods used in this study, please see the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at.

Animals

Male guinea pigs (Dunkin-Hartley, Harlan, United Kingdom) weighing 350 to 450 g (400–750 g for single-fiber in vivo studies) were housed in temperature-controlled (21°C) facilities with food and water ad libitum for at least 1 week before the experiment. All experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Home Office guidelines for animal welfare based on the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.

Effect of theophylline on citric acid–and capsaicin-evoked cough in conscious guinea pigs

Conscious unrestrained guinea pigs were placed in individual plastic, transparent, whole-body plethysmograph chambers, and cough was detected, as previously described.

Effect of theophylline on capsaicin-induced firing of single-fiber afferents and bronchospasm in vivo

Guinea pigs were anaesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg) intraperitoneally. The trachea was cannulated, and pressure was measured with an air pressure transducer connected to a side arm of the tracheal cannula. Animals were paralyzed with vecuronium bromide, initially administered at a dose of 0.10 mg/kg intravenously, followed every 20 minutes with 0.05 mg/kg administered intravenously to maintain paralysis. Firing of single-fiber afferents and bronchospasm was measured, as previously described.

Effect of theophylline on depolarization of the vagus nerve preparation to various tussive agents

Guinea pigs were culled with an overdose of pentobarbitone (200 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally). The 2 vagus trunks were carefully dissected free and placed in Krebs–Henseleit solution. Segments of the vagus nerve were mounted in a "grease-gap" dual recording chamber system, as previously described.

### Intravenous bronchodilators in pediatric critical asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114T8hEG]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

A total of 7149 records were retrieved after the three literature searches (one each for IV MgSO 4, IV methylxanthine and IV SABA). From these, we identified 27 RCTs with at least one IV bronchodilator arm. Twelve RCTs reported important or critical patient centered outcomes and met the eligibility criteria for our final analysis. Supporting Information S1: Figure 1a–c shows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metanalyses (PRISMA) flow diagram with reasons for exclusion of records during the full text review.

The studies included a total sample size of 852 subjects (Table 1). The comparisons studied across the different trials were (a) IV MgSO 4 versus placebo/control, (b) IV MgSO 4 versus IV SABA, (c) IV MgSO 4 versus IV methylxanthine, (d) IV SABA versus placebo, (e) IV methylxanthine versus placebo/control and, (f) IV methylxanthine versus IV SABA. Across the 12 trials, four outcomes were included in the NMA, and these outcomes were reported for three or more different comparisons. These outcomes were hospital LOS, intubation rate, PICU admission and PICU LOS. The risk of bias profiles for each outcome is provided in Supporting Information S1: Figures 2–5. Most trials were double‐blinded; but concealment of the allocation sequence was poorly reported across the trials. Only one study had high‐risk of bias due to lack of blinding for intubation. The overall risk of bias estimate for all four outcomes was 'of some concerns'.

### Addition of intravenous beta (2)-agonists to inhaled beta (2)-agonists for acute asthma [^113oU8bQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled beta-agonist therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. This review evaluates the benefit of an additional use of intravenous beta(2)-agonist agents.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of adding intravenous (IV) beta(2)-agonists to inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy for acute asthma treated in the emergency department.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL as well as handsearching of 20 respiratory journals. Bibliographies from included studies and known reviews were also searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. The search was performed in September 2012.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented to the emergency department with acute asthma and were treated with IV beta(2)-agonists with inhaled beta(2)-agonist therapy and existing standard treatments versus inhaled beta(2)-agonists and existing standard treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and confirmed their findings with corresponding authors of trials. We obtained missing data from authors or calculated from data present in the papers. We used fixed-effect model for odds ratios (OR) and for mean differences (MD) we used both fixed-effect and random-effects models and reported 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

From 109 potentially relevant studies only three (104 patients) met our inclusion criteria: Bogie 2007 (46 children), Browne 1997 (29 children) and Nowak 2010 (29 adults). Bogie 2007 investigated the addition of intravenous terbutaline to high dose nebulised albuterol in children with acute severe asthma, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Browne 1997 investigated the benefit of adding intravenous salbutamol to inhaled salbutamol in children with acute severe asthma in the emergency department. Nowak 2010 investigated addition of IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids) among adults, and was reported as a conference abstract only. There was no significant advantage (OR 0.29; 95%CI 0.06 to 1.38, one trial, 29 adults) for adding IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids) with regard to hospitalisation rates. Various outcome indicators for the length of stay were reported among the trials. Browne 1997 reported a significantly shorter recovery time (in terms of cessation of 30 minute salbutamol) for children in the IV salbutamol with inhaled salbutamol group (four hours) versus the 11.1 hours for the inhaled salbutamol group (P = 0.03). Time to cessation of hourly nebuliser was also significantly shorter (P = 0.02) for the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group (11.5 hours versus 21.2 hours), and they were ready for emergency patient discharge on average 9.7 hours earlier than the inhaled salbutamol group (P < 0.05). In a paediatric ICU study Bogie 2007 reported no significant advantage in length of paediatric ICU admission (hours) for adding IV terbutaline to nebulised albuterol (MD -12.95, 95% CI: -38.74, 12.84). Browne 1997 reported there were only six out of 14 children with a pulmonary index score above six in the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group at two hours compared with 14 of the 15 in the inhaled salbutamol group (P = 0.02)In Browne 1997 there was a higher proportion of tremor in the IV plus inhaled salbutamol group than in the inhaled salbutamol group (P < 0.02). Nowak 2010 did not report any statistically significant adverse effects associated with adding IV bedoradrine to standard care (nebulised albuterol, ipratropium and oral corticosteroids). Troponin levels were elevated in three children in the IV terbutaline + nebulised albuterol group at 12 and 24 hours in Bogie 2007

Authors' Conclusions

There is very limited evidence from one study (Browne 1997) to support the use of IV beta(2)-agonists in children with severe acute asthma with respect to shorter recovery time, and similarly there is limited evidence (again from one study Browne 1997) suggesting benefit with regard to pulmonary index scores; however this advantage needs to be considered carefully in relation to the increased side effects associated with IV beta(2)-agonists. We identified no significant benefits for adults with severe acute asthma. Until more, adequately powered, high quality clinical trials in this area are conducted it is not possible to form a robust evaluation of the addition of IV beta(2)-agonists in children or adults with severe acute asthma.

### Gold 2023: highlights for primary care [^117D2iAB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatment

Bronchodilators. Short-acting inhaled β2-agonists (SABA), with or without short-acting anticholinergics (SAMA), are the initial bronchodilators for acute treatment of ECOPD, administered using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI, with a spacer device if necessary, or nebulization. If a nebulizer is chosen, air-driven is preferable to oxygen-driven nebulization to avoid the potential risk of increasing PaCO 2. Intravenous methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) are not recommended due to lack of efficacy and significant side effects.
Glucocorticoids. Systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations improve lung function, oxygenation, risk of early relapse, and reduce treatment failures and length of hospitalization –. A dose of 40 mg prednisone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended. Longer courses increase risk of pneumonia and mortality. Therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective as intravenous administration.
Antibiotics. Antibiotics should be given to patients with ECOPD who have increased sputum volume and sputum purulence and most of those require mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive). CRP-guided prescribing of antibiotics for ECOPD in primary care clinics resulted in a reduced proportion antibiotic use with no evidence of harm. The recommended length of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days. The choice of the antibiotic should be based on the local bacterial resistance pattern.

Non-pharmacologic treatment

Oxygen therapy. Supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia should be titrated to a target saturation of 88–92%. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of inspired oxygen than do nasal prongs.
Non-invasive ventilatory support (NIV). NIV is indicated in patients with respiratory acidosis since it improves gas exchange and decreases respiratory rate, work of breathing, the severity of breathlessness, intubation rates, and mortality.

It is important that patients are reviewed clinically, and treatment adjusted if needed, after the exacerbation episode.

### Oral theophylline for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111QniHt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Oral theophylline has, for many years, been used as a bronchodilator in patients with COPD. Despite the introduction of new drugs, and its narrow therapeutic index, theophylline is still recommended for COPD treatment.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of oral theophylline when compared to placebo in patients with stable COPD.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Review Group and Cochrane Controlled Clinical Registers were searched.

Selection Criteria

All studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently abstracted and the methodological quality assessed by two reviewers.

Main Results

Twenty RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Concomitant therapy varied from none to any other bronchodilator plus corticosteroid (oral and inhaled). The following outcomes were significantly different when compared to placebo. FEV1 improved with treatment: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 100 ml; 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) 40, 160 ml. Similarly for FVC: WMD 210 mL 95%CI 100, 320. Two studies reported an improvement in VO2max; WMD 195 ml/min, 95%CI 113,27). At rest, PaO2 and PaCO2 both improved with treatment (WMD 3.2 mmHg; 95%CI = 1.2, 5., and WMD -2.4 mmHg; 95%CI = -3.5, -1.2, respectively). Walking distance tests did not improve (4 studies, Standardised Mean Difference 0.30, 95%CI -0.01, 0.62), neither did Visual Analogue Score for breathlessness isn two small studies (WMD 3.6, 95%CI -4.6, 11.8). The Relative Risk (RR) of nausea was greater with theophylline (RR 7.7; 95%CI 1.5, 39.9). However, patients' preference for theophylline was greater than that for placebo (RR 2.27; 95%CI = 1.26, 4.11). Very few patient withdrew from these studies for any reason.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Theophylline has a modest effect on FEV1 and FVC and slightly improves arterial blood gas tensions in moderate to severe COPD. These benefits were seen in patients receiving a variety of different concomitant therapies. Improvement in exercise performance depended on the method of testing. There was a very low dropout rate in the studies that could be included in this review, which suggests that recruited patients may have been known by the investigators to be theophylline tolerant. This may limit the generalisability of these studies.

### Interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy [^116XGnxo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common respiratory disorder complicating pregnancy, and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub-optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. We included multi-armed trials along with two-armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non-pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based algorithm versus a clinical guideline-based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist-led multi-disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons. Pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) -2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.21 to -2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta-analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventionsPrimary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO-based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist-led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions.

Secondary Outcomes

the use of a FENO-based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists, and less frequent use of short-acting β-agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO-based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist-led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO-based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist-led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well-designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway.

### Intravenous bronchodilators in pediatric critical asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113Lg5L1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Literature Search

Comprehensive search strategies were composed and conducted by one of two medical librarians (HJC, ECW). Multi‐database searching was performed in Ovid for MEDLINE and Embase simultaneously. CINAHL Complete (EBSCO) was also searched. Searching occurred July 2023 (for IV MgSO 4 and IV SABA), September 2023 (IV methylxanthines), and both were rerun again in July 2024. There were no language or date limitations. The complete search strategy is provided in Supporting Information S1: Table 2. Inclusion criteria included all human Randomized Controlled Trials that include children ≥ 2 years of age and < 18 years. The returned references were dually screened for inclusion in Covidence (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Previously published systematic reviews related to pediatric critical asthma found during screening were reviewed to ensure all relevant articles were included in the abstract screening stage. Abstracts and subsequent full‐text articles were dually screened by panelists using Covidence and conflicts were resolved by a third member.

2.3 Data Collection

Data abstraction was done by a pair of independent reviewers using a standardized data collection form in Redcap and discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer.

2.4 Risk of Bias Within Individual Studies

Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane tool for the assessment of risk of bias in RCTs (RoB 2.0).

### Adenosine-induced severe bronchospasm in a patient without pulmonary disease [^116VJsVL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Adenosine is widely used for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias for its efficacy and excellent safety, but it has been reported to precipitate severe bronchospasm in patients with pulmonary disease. The drug is therefore contraindicated in asthmatic subjects and should be used with caution in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nevertheless, true bronchospasm is rare and should be distinguished from the much more common occurrence of dyspnea, only as a symptom and without respiratory compromise, which is benign and transient. We describe the occurrence of severe bronchospasm following adenosine administration for a supraventricular tachycardia in a young male without any history of pulmonary disease. To our knowledge, this is the first time such complication is reported in a subject without lung disease. The patient arrived at the emergency department for palpitations with a regular wide QRS tachycardia with a left bundle-branch block morphology. Sinus carotid massage was unsuccessful, and 2 intravenous adenosine boluses were given without effect. A further 12-mg bolus cardioverted the patient, who became increasingly dyspneic and hypoxic, with diffuse bronchospasm. An urgent chest radiograph had normal results. He was treated with oxygen and inhaled and intravenous steroids, but dyspnea and bronchospasm resolved only after intravenous aminophylline. The arrhythmia recurred and was finally terminated by intravenous flecainide. Although dyspnea after adenosine administration is usually a transient, benign phenomenon, physicians should be alert to the presence of objective signs of respiratory distress, which should prompt immediate treatment, even in subjects without previous history of pulmonary disease.

### Use of theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: examining the evidence [^114Lpvre]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of theophylline in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains controversial. This review was undertaken to determine the efficacy of theophylline in patients with stable disease.

Recent Findings

Twenty-two good quality randomized controlled trials were included in this systematic review. The review showed that theophylline significantly improved forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity (weighted mean difference 0.10 L; 95% confidence interval 0.04–0.16 and weighted mean difference 0.21 L; 95% confidence interval 0.10–0.31, respectively). V also improved with theophylline (weighted mean difference 195.27 mL/min; 95% confidence interval 112.71–277.83), as did Pa and Pa (weighted mean difference 1.45 mmHg; 95% confidence interval 0.26–2.65 and weighted mean difference -1.09 mmHg; 95% confidence interval -1.83 to -0.35, respectively). Patients preferred theophylline over placebo (relative risk 2.27; 95% confidence interval 1.26–4.11). Theophylline increased the risk of nausea, however, compared with placebo (relative risk 7.67; 95% confidence interval 1.47–39.94).

Summary

This review has shown that oral theophylline plays an important role in the management of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by improving lung function, arterial blood gas tensions and ventilatory capacity. Patients also preferred treatment with theophylline when compared with placebo. The benefits of theophylline in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, however, have to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects, particularly nausea.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^11765Qen]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Theophylline anhydrous and dextrose (theophylline in dextrose) [^114Kt8DN]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Smokers

Tobacco and marijuana smoking appears to increase the clearance of theophylline by induction of metabolic pathways. Theophylline clearance has been shown to increase by approximately 50% in young adult tobacco smokers and by approximately 80% in elderly tobacco smokers compared to non-smoking subjects. Passive smoke exposure has also been shown to increase theophylline clearance by up to 50%. Abstinence from tobacco smoking for one week causes a reduction of approximately 40% in theophylline clearance. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in patients who stop smoking (see WARNINGS). Use of nicotine gum has been shown to have no effect on theophylline clearance.

Fever

Fever, regardless of its underlying cause, can decrease the clearance of theophylline. The magnitude and duration of the fever appear to be directly correlated to the degree of decrease of theophylline clearance. Precise data are lacking, but a temperature of 39°C (102°F) for at least 24 hours is probably required to produce a clinically significant increase in serum theophylline concentrations. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in patients with sustained fever (see WARNINGS).

Miscellaneous

Other factors associated with decreased theophylline clearance include the third trimester of pregnancy, sepsis with multiple organ failure, and hypothyroidism. Careful attention to dose reduction and frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations are required in patients with any of these conditions (see WARNINGS). Other factors associated with increased theophylline clearance include hyperthyroidism and cystic fibrosis.

Clinical Studies

Inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids are the treatments of first choice for management of acute exacerbations of asthma. The results of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of adding intravenous theophylline to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma have been conflicting. Most studies in patients treated for acute asthma exacerbations in an emergency department have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline does not produce greater bronchodilation and increases the risk of adverse effects. In contrast, other studies have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients requiring hospitalization, particularly in patients who are not responding adequately to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases dyspnea, air trapping, the work of breathing, and improves contractility of diaphragmatic muscles with little or no improvement in pulmonary function measurements.

### Management and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a state of the art review [^114jjgXu]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The mainstay of therapy at exacerbation remains an increase in the dose and frequency of short-acting β 2 agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators, and systemic corticosteroids for exacerbations not responding to this intervention alone. Antibiotics are generally added for exacerbations associated with a change in the characteristics of expectorated sputum. Oxygen with or without ventilatory support is necessary in the presence of respiratory failure, and often indicates the need for hospitalisation. Theophyllines are sometimes added in patients responding poorly to other therapies. Many national and international guidelines exist.

Reviewing data from the original trials of these commonly prescribed therapies challenges our rationale for their use. Many exacerbations in the seminal study of antibiotics versus placebo improved in the placebo arm anyway, and the value of antibiotics has recently been further questioned in a systematic review in this journal. There certainly appears to be no additional benefit from antibiotic courses lasting longer than 5 days compared to shorter regimes. The major benefit of systemic corticosteroids is in increasing the rate of recovery of lung function, rather than more important endpoints such as mortality. Indeed, there is evidence of relative corticosteroid resistance in COPD. Whilst acknowledging the methodological limitations of such approaches, meta-analyses are available reporting summarised benefits at exacerbation for short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, theophyllines and non-invasive ventilation (NIV). NIV has now all but replaced respiratory stimulants such as doxapram in the management of exacerbations with acute hypercapnoeic respiratory failure, and meta-analyses of NIV have documented a mortality benefit from such therapy over standard care. However, NIV is not a replacement for endotracheal intubation and ventilation where this is necessary through severity or contraindication to NIV. Whilst the decision to intubate and ventilate a patient with COPD can be complex, outcomes in COPD are no worse than in patients with respiratory failure due to other causes and any remaining therapeutic nihilism in this area should be challenged.

### The pulmonary effects of intravenous adenosine in asthmatic subjects [^114iLHLs]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We have shown that intravenous adenosine in normal subjects does not cause bronchospasm, but causes dyspnea, most likely by an effect on vagal C fibers in the lungs [Burki et al. J Appl Physiol 2005; 98:180–5]. Since airways inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are features of asthma, it is possible that intravenous adenosine may be associated with an increased intensity of dyspnea, and may cause bronchospasm, as noted anecdotally in previous reports.

Methods

We compared the effects of placebo and 10 mg intravenous adenosine, in 6 normal and 6 asthmatic subjects.

Results

Placebo injection had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on the forced expiratory spirogram, heart rate, minute ventilation (Ve), or respiratory sensation. Similarly, adenosine injection caused no significant changes (p > 0.05) in the forced expiratory spirogram; however, there was a rapid development of dyspnea as signified visually on a modified Borg scale, and a significant (p < 0.05) tachycardia in each subject (Asthmatics +18%, Normals + 34%), and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in Ve (Asthmatics +93%, Normals +130%). The intensity of dyspnea was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the asthmatic subjects.

Conclusion

These data indicate that intravenous adenosine does not cause bronchospasm in asthmatic subjects, and supports the concept that adenosine-induced dyspnea is most likely secondary to stimulation of vagal C fibers in the lungs. The increased intensity of adenosine-induced dyspnea in the asthmatic subjects suggests that airways inflammation may have sensitized the vagal C fibers.

### Methyl-xanthines for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114AgbrN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines currently recommend the use of methyl-xanthines for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for patients who have incomplete responses to bronchodilators. However, available clinical trials are small and underpowered to evaluate the benefits and risks of methyl-xanthines in this acute setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of methyl-xanthines compared to standard care for COPD exacerbations.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group COPD Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL and hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. In addition, primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute COPD exacerbations and were treated with either methyl-xanthines (oral or intravenous) or placebo (with or without standard care) early in the acute treatment. Studies also needed to report either pulmonary function or admission results. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles and selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of information. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. The data were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager 4.0.4 Studies were pooled to yield weighted mean differences (WMD) or odds ratios (OR) and reported using 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).

Main Results

From 28 identified references, 4 RCTs met inclusion criteria (172 patients). Mean change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at 2 hours was similar in methyl-xanthine and placebo groups (FEV1 WMD: -8 ml; 95% CI: -85 to 69 ml). The only study to report hospitalization rates showed a non-significant reduction with methyl-xanthines (OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1 to 1.8) among 39 patients. Patients receiving methyl-xanthines had similar improvements in symptom scores, but reported more gastrointestinal side effects (OR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.3 to 21.0) than patients receiving placebo.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no evidence to support the routine use of methyl-xanthines for COPD exacerbations. Methyl-xanthines do not appreciably improve FEV1 during COPD exacerbations and cause adverse effects; evidence of their effect on admissions is limited.

### A systematic review with attempted network meta-analysis of asthma therapy recommended for five to eighteen year olds in GINA steps three and four [^113f3AEK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

We tried to synthesize the evidence for GINA step 3&4 recommendations for 5 to 18 year-olds with moderate persistent asthma. Our aim was to rank the 21 different GINA treatment options as to their effectiveness using standard systematic review methods extended by network meta-analytic techniques.

In principle, the situation looked favourable for network meta-analysis, with RCTs on six out of seven interventions either against placebo or head-to-head (Figure 2). Lack of direct comparisons, for example GINA 3C versus 4A, could have been compensated by indirect comparisons, for example through GINA 3B and placebo. Only theophylline was disconnected to the network of trials as we found no trials in this age group.

Due to extremely different choices trialists made on outcome reporting methods, we had to abandon attempts at meta-analysis. Apart from embarking on a set of concerted new trials in this area, which may take years to complete, a potentially quicker way to salvage the situation with existing data may be joint action among sponsors and trialists of existing trials to aggregate their raw data to inform an IPD meta-analysis. The authors of this review would be more than happy to support such an endeavour, thereby achieving this review's original aim. Such an exercise would depend also on the results of additional trialist-provided information on trial quality, since pooling of very low quality data is unattractive. This brings us to the next point. We assessed the risk of bias in the included trials on a 9-item methodological quality checklist. We scored "?" if the risk of bias seemed hard to determine. We scored 138/207 "?", and this is largely due to partial, unclear or non-reporting (see Table 2). Adoption and enforcement of the CONSORT statement should become a priority for trialists and journals alike.

### Theophylline anhydrous (Elixophyllin) [^112j6kA6]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Dosage Increases:

Increases in the dose of theophylline should not be made in response to an acute exacerbation of symptoms of chronic lung disease since theophylline provides little added benefit to inhaled beta2-selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in this circumstance and increases the risk of adverse effects. A peak steady state serum theophylline concentration should be measured before increasing the dose in response to persistent chronic symptoms to ascertain whether an increase in dose is safe. Before increasing the theophylline dose on the basis of a low serum concentration, the clinician should consider whether the blood sample was obtained at an appropriate time in relationship to the dose and whether the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

As the rate of theophylline clearance may be dose-dependent (i.e., steady-state serum concentrations may increase disproportionately to the increase in dose), an increase in dose based upon a sub-therapeutic serum concentration measurement should be conservative. In general, limiting dose increases to about 25% of the previous total daily dose will reduce the risk of unintended excessive increases in serum theophylline concentration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table VI).

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose

Overdoses of RAPIBLYK injection can cause adverse cardiac and central nervous system effects. These adverse effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications such as severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma, and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required.

Cardiac adverse effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1-, 2-, 3-degree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity.
Central nervous system adverse effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma.
In addition, bronchospasm, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur.

10.2 Treatment Recommendations

Because of its approximately 4-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue RAPIBLYK infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures:

Bradycardia

Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing.

Cardiac Failure

Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, milrinone or inamrinone.

Symptomatic Hypotension

Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

Bronchospasm

Consider intravenous administration of a beta agonist or a theophylline derivative.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^112Ubs2n]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Theophylline — primary care considerations and monitoring — states that patients for which theophylline is being considered should be referred from primary to specialty care, and this medication is not intended to be used in primary care. Theophylline is considered a mild-to-moderate bronchodilator and may have mild anti-inflammatory effects, while LABA or LTRA are preferred as add-on therapy to ICS. Theophylline is associated with significant food and medication interactions and adverse reactions including insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, tremor, arrhythmias, delirium, seizures, and death, and ongoing and continued cigarette smoking also poses increased clearance of theophylline. Patients on theophylline should be maintained at a serum level of 5–15 mcg/ml with routine trough level monitoring appropriate for the formulation, and it might be considered as a non-preferred alternative when other options cannot be used or have been unsuccessful.

### Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction update-2016 [^115dVpYz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Methylxanthines, antihistamines, and other agents in EIB: There are studies that clearly show no benefit from methylxanthines administered orally, and methylxanthines exhibit a relatively narrow therapeutic index with potentially serious adverse events, such as seizures, although the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor roflumilast has been reported to attenuate mild EIB. When caffeine is ingested, it can attenuate EIB in a dose-response manner, with evidence of high doses of caffeine (6–10 mg/kg) inhibiting EIB, and these studies have led to the recommendation of abstaining from caffeine before performing bronchial provocation testing to identify EIB. Some antihistamines have been reported to attenuate EIB but results are inconsistent and other agents appear ineffective, and there is an absence of definitive studies determining the effectiveness of nasal or systemic antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis for an effect on EIB. Other compounds examined include calcium channel blockers, inhaled furosemide, α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists (oral and inhaled), inhaled heparin, and hyaluronic acid; although some of these drugs are not recommended for clinical use against EIB, they might be useful as probes to study mechanisms.

### An integrative review of systematic reviews related to the management of breathlessness in respiratory illnesses [^111tzUB5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma (pharmacological treatments)

In all, 69 systematic reviews were identified. Eighteen were excluded because they referred only to children, did not specify symptoms as outcomes, or were reviews of studies of vaccines or comparisons between devices. Of the 51 reviews included, 50 were accessed via the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Seven included data on breathlessness while all others assessed breathlessness as part of a single score of 'asthma symptoms'. Again, there was heterogeneity between systematic reviews in the specific outcomes measured within these symptom scores.

Treatments included: anti-leukotrienes; beta-agonists (inhaled/non-inhaled); allergen immunotherapy; anti-IgE; antibiotics; anti-cholinergics; azathioprine; beclomethasone; budesonide; caffeine; beta-blockers; chloroquine; corticosteroids (inhaled/non-inhaled); cyclosporine; fluticasone; anti-gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment; gold; inhaled/non-inhaled magnesium sulphate; macrolides; methotrexate; oxatomide; and tailored interventions based on sputum eosinophils.

Many reviews report some level of benefit from or equivalence between treatments under review. Clearly steroids (both oral and intramuscular) improve lung function, while long-acting beta agonists (LABA) with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) demonstrate improved outcomes in lung function and symptoms compared to LABA and antileukotrienes, short-acting beta agonists (SABA) or theophylline. Treatments from large scale reviews that report positive effects most strongly include: allergen immunotherapy (57 trials), beclomethasone (60 trials), budesonide (43 trials), fluticasone (75 trials), ICS compared with sodium cromoglycate (25 trials), LABA (67 trials), and LABA vs. SABA (31 trials).

Small reviews of caffeine (6 trials), inhaled magnesium sulphate (6 trials), intravenous magnesium sulphate (7 trials), and tailored interventions based on sputum eosinophils, particularly those with severe asthma and frequent exacerbations (3 trials) also suggested therapeutic benefits. Caffeine (taken orally) has demonstrated a modest, though short-term (up to 4 hours), effect as a bronchodilator.

### Theophylline [^114fYf2f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

(see PRECAUTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, Table II).

When Signs or Symptoms of Theophylline Toxicity Are Present:

Whenever a patient receiving theophylline develops nausea or vomiting, particularly repetitive vomiting, or other signs or symptoms consistent with theophylline toxicity (even if another cause may be suspected), additional doses of theophylline should be withheld and a serum theophylline concentration measured immediately. Patients should be instructed not to continue any dosage that causes adverse effects and to withhold subsequent doses until the symptoms have resolved, at which time the healthcare professional may instruct the patient to resume the drug at a lower dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Dosing Guidelines, Table VI).

Dosage Increases: Increases in the dose of theophylline should not be made in response to an acute exacerbation of symptoms of chronic lung disease since theophylline provides little added benefit to inhaled beta2-selective agonists and systemically administered cortico-steroids in this circumstance and increases the risk of adverse effects. A peak steady-state serum theophylline concentration should be measured before increasing the dose in response to persistent chronic symptoms to ascertain whether an increase in dose is safe. Before increasing the theophylline dose on the basis of a low serum concentration, the healthcare professional should consider whether the blood sample was obtained at an appropriate time in relationship to the dose and whether the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen (see PRECAUTIONS, LABORATORY TESTS).

As the rate of theophylline clearance may be dose-dependent (i.e., steady-state serum concentrations may increase disproportionately to the increase in dose), an increase in dose based upon a sub-therapeutic serum concentration measurement should be conservative. In general, limiting dose increases to about 25% of the previous total daily dose will reduce the risk of unintended excessive increases in serum theophylline concentration (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table VI).

### Characteristics of medicine use for children with asthma in China: a nationwide population-based study [^1131tBwB]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the asthma medication use in Chinese children of different age groups, regions, and levels of cities in China, based on the 2015 Healthcare Insurance Data in China.

Methods

The China Healthcare Insurance Research Association (CHIRA) database was searched for children from 0 to 14 years old diagnosed as asthma based on the "J45" and "J46" coded in ICD-10. A cross-sectional study design was employed.

Results

A total of 308,550 children were identified, all of whom were treated under the coverage of healthcare insurance. Among them, 2,468 children were eligible for inclusion in the present study. Compared with the current status of asthma care in European and American countries, under the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in China, the use percentages of ICS and short-acting β 2 receptor agonist in children with asthma in China were lower, but the use percentages of oral corticosteroids, long-acting β 2 receptor agonist, and theophylline (especially intravenous theophylline) were higher, especially in the Central and West China.

Conclusion

The asthma medication use was attributed to many factors, thus efforts are still needed to further popularize the GINA programs and China's guidelines for asthma diagnosis and treatment, especially in the Central and West China.

### Glucagon for refractory asthma exacerbation [^116oFBdB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Glucagon, a hormone secreted by pancreatic alpha cells, causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation by activating the synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. It was studied in the 1980s and 1990s as a treatment option for the management of asthma but has since not been evaluated. Data to support its use are limited, but it may serve as a last-line agent for refractory asthma exacerbation. Here we describe 4 cases in which intravenous glucagon was used to manage severe, refractory asthma exacerbation in the emergency department.

### Pathophysiology, research challenges, and clinical management of smoke inhalation injury [^111DZnvP]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

As noted above, a variety of therapeutic agents are used in clinical practice. These can be classified as 1) mucolytic agents, 2) anticoagulants, or 3) bronchodilators. These agents are included in the treatment protocol at Shriners Hospitals for Children ® — Galveston, which is an example of best evidence-based care and is summarized Table 1.

Mucolytic Agents

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a powerful mucolytic agent commonly used in the treatment of smoke inhalation injury, and it is indicated for patients with abnormal inspissated mucus secretions.NAC is also an airway irritant and may directly induce bronchoconstriction. Thus, patients should be evaluated for signs of bronchospasm and a bronchodilator added if wheezing is present.

Anticoagulants

Effects of aerosolized anticoagulants for treatment of smoke inhalation injury have been described in both preclinical and clinical studies. Aerosolized heparin (5,000 units in 3 ml) decreases airway cast formation, and combination treatment with NAC reduces ventilator days and mortality in pediatric patients. – Heparin exerts a potent anticoagulant effect solely through binding to AT. Thus, its effect is limited when AT is deficient. In experimental animals with burn and smoke inhalation injury, the combination of aerosolized heparin and recombinant AT (aerosolized or intravenous) improves pulmonary function. These treatment approaches improve lung compliance, reduce pulmonary edema, and diminish airway obstruction better than control treatments. Systematic reviews confirm that inhaled anticoagulants improve survival and lessen morbidity in preclinical and clinical studies of smoke inhalation injury.

Bronchodilators

Smoke inhalation injury to the lower airways results in a chemical tracheobronchitis, producing wheezing, mucosal sloughing, cast formation, and bronchospasms. Aerosolized bronchodilators are useful for several reasons. They induce bronchial muscle relaxation and stimulate mucociliary clearance. Additionally, bronchodilators decrease airflow resistance and improve dynamic compliance. Currently useful bronchodilators include albuterol, levalbuterol, and racemic epinephrine. These should be given when wheezing or bronchospasm occurs.

The present treatment protocol used at Shriners Hospitals for Children (SHC) at Galveston, a best evidence-based protocol, is summarized in Table 1. Ventilator support management, which is often institution- or physician-specific and is discussed above, is not included in Table 1.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose

Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac and central nervous system effects. These effects may precipitate severe signs, symptoms, sequelae, and complications (for example, severe cardiac and respiratory failure, including shock and coma), and may be fatal. Continuous monitoring of the patient is required.

Cardiac effects include bradycardia, atrioventricular block (1st-, 2nd-, 3rddegree), junctional rhythms, intraventricular conduction delays, decreased cardiac contractility, hypotension, cardiac failure (including cardiogenic shock), cardiac arrest/asystole, and pulseless electrical activity.
Central nervous system effects include respiratory depression, seizures, sleep and mood disturbances, fatigue, lethargy, and coma.
In addition, bronchospasm, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral cyanosis, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia (especially in children) may occur.

10.2 Treatment Recommendations

Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, consider the following general measures.

Bradycardia

Consider intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug or cardiac pacing.

Cardiac Failure

Consider intravenous administration of a diuretic or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or inamrinone. Glucagon has been reported to be useful.

Symptomatic hypotension

Consider intravenous administration of fluids or vasopressor agents such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

### Esmolol [^1153ZiXo]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Overdosage

Acute Toxicity

Overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride can cause cardiac arrest. In addition, overdoses can produce bradycardia, hypotension, electromechanical dissociation and loss of consciousness. Cases of massive accidental overdoses of esmolol hydrochloride have occurred due to dilution errors. Some of these overdoses have been fatal while others resulted in permanent disability. Bolus doses in the range of 625 mg to 2.5 g (12.5–50 mg/kg) have been fatal. Patients have recovered completely from overdoses as high as 1.75 g given over one minute or doses of 7.5 g given over one hour for cardiovascular surgery. The patients who survived appear to be those whose circulation could be supported until the effects of esmolol hydrochloride resolved. Because of its approximately 9-minute elimination half-life, the first step in the management of toxicity should be to discontinue the esmolol hydrochloride infusion. Then, based on the observed clinical effects, the following general measures should also be considered.

Bradycardia: Intravenous administration of atropine or another anticholinergic drug.

Bronchospasm: Intravenous administration of a beta2 stimulating agent and/or a theophylline derivative.

Cardiac Failure: Intravenous administration of a diuretic and/or digitalis glycoside. In shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, intravenous administration of dopamine, dobutamine, isoproterenol, or amrinone may be considered.

Symptomatic Hypotension: Intravenous administration of fluids and/or pressor agents.

### The pulmonary effects of intravenous adenosine in asthmatic subjects [^114T3XA7]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study confirms our previous results in normal subjects that intravenous adenosine is dyspnogenic and results in an increase in ventilation and tachycardia, and extends these observations to asthmatics.

Intravenous infusion of adenosine is known to increase heart rate by increasing cardiac sympathetic tone; this effect overrides the bradycardia caused by its direct effects on the sinus node and atrio-ventricular conduction. In normal subjects we have shown that adenosine causes tachycardia; the results of the present study are in conformity with these previous reports: intravenous adenosine was associated with a significant tachycardia.

The ventilatory effects of adenosine have previously been ascribed to activation of carotid chemoreceptors; however, our previous data indicate that the ventilatory effects of adenosine are probably not secondary to carotid chemoreceptor stimulation per se.

There are anecdotal reports of bronchospasm in asthmatics receiving intravenous adenosine for the treatment of arrhythmia. However bronchoconstriction has never been documented by any measurements of airway function. In a study of 122 consecutive patients, undergoing adenosine stress testing for myocardial perfusion imaging, of whom 36 had chronic bronchitis, dyspnea was noted in over 50% of subjects but no changes in spirometric indices were noted. Previous studies have found no change in airway function in normal subjects after intravenous adenosine, and our results are in conformity with these findings, and further extend these observations to asthmatic subjects, since there was no significant change in the spirogram after adenosine. Thus it is probable that dyspnea in asthmatics receiving intravenous adenosine has been misinterpreted as bronchoconstriction in these instances.

Inhaled adenosine and adenosine 5-monophosphate and triphosphate are known to cause bronchospasm in asthmatics probably via mast cell mediator release and, since this effect has not been demonstrated with intravenous adenosine, this suggests that the bronchospastic effect of adenosine is related to the route of administration. The bronchospasm occurring with inhaled adenosine monophosphate and triphosphate is also associated with the development of dyspnea; this has been interpreted as being secondary to the bronchospasm, although differences in the intensity of dyspnea for equivalent degrees of bronchospasm have been ascribed to an additional effect on airway sensory nerves.

### Treatment of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^1174ravd]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes the transient narrowing of the airways during, and particularly after exercise and occurs commonly in asthmatic individuals. Limitation of exercise capacity is a frequent complaint in all age groups, and severity of EIB ranges from mild impairment of performance to severe bronchospasm and a large reduction in FEV1. Treatment of EIB varies from daily to less frequent therapy, depending on the level of activity. In this article, the authors evaluate the treatment possibilities before, during, and after exercise. They also review medications currently used to treat EIB.

### Carteolol hydrochloride (ocupress) [^114kSiQf]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

No specific information on emergency treatment of overdosage in humans is available. Should accidental ocular overdosage occur, flush eye(s) with water or normal saline. The most common effects expected with overdosage of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent are bradycardia, bronchospasm, congestive heart failure and hypotension.

In case of ingestion, treatment with Ocupress should be discontinued and gastric lavage considered. The patient should be closely observed and vital signs carefully monitored. The prolonged effects of carteolol must be considered when determining the duration of corrective therapy. On the basis of the pharmacologic profile, the following additional measures should be considered as appropriate:

Symptomatic Sinus Bradycardia or Heart Block: Administer atropine. If there is no response to vagal blockade, administer isoproterenol cautiously.

Bronchospasm: Administer a beta2-stimulating agent such as isoproterenol and/or a theophylline derivative.

Congestive Heart Failure: Administer diuretics and digitalis glycosides as necessary.

Hypotension: Administer vasopressors such as intravenous dopamine, epinephrine or norepinephrine bitartrate.

### The effectiveness of IV β-agonists in treating patients with acute asthma in the emergency department: a meta-analysis [^113XFMmn]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of IV beta(2)-agonists for severe acute asthma treated in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were identified using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CINAHL; the Cochrane Airways Review Group database; hand searching; bibliographies; pharmaceutical companies; and author contact. Studies where IV beta(2)-agonists were compared to placebo and/or existing standards of care were considered. Where appropriate, trials were combined using odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

From 746 identified references, 55 potentially relevant articles were identified and 15 articles were included. All trials were performed outside North America and were published prior to 1997. Three main treatment strategies were reviewed: strategy 1 (three articles), IV beta(2)-agonists with inhaled beta(2)-agonists vs inhaled beta(2)-agonists; strategy 2 (six articles), IV beta(2)-agonists alone vs inhaled beta(2)-agonists; and strategy 3 (six articles), IV beta(2)-agonists vs IV methylxanthines. Compared to all treatments, IV beta(2)-agonist use did not lead to clinical or statistical significant differences in vital signs, pulmonary functions, laboratory measures, adverse effects, or clinical success. Although statistically nonsignificant, seven methodologically strong studies demonstrated that peak expiratory flows and heart rates were unchanged following beta(2)-agonist use compared to all other treatments at 60 min (8.3 L/min [95% CI, 17.6 to 34.2] and 3.65 beats/min [95% CI, 2.9 to 10.2], respectively), with an increased risk of adverse effects (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.5 to 8.2).

Conclusions

Evidence is lacking to support the use of IV beta(2)-agonists in ED patients with severe acute asthma. Moreover, the clinical benefit appears questionable, while the potential clinical risks are obvious. The only recommendations for IV beta-(2)agonist use should be in those patients in whom inhaled therapy is not feasible, or in the context of a controlled clinical trial comparing IV beta(2)-agonists with standard care vs standard care alone.

### The use of theophylline in' irreversible' chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^114K3FtD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The use of theophylline in patients with "irreversible" chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is controversial. Possible favorable actions of theophylline, including improved mucociliary clearance, stimulation of respiratory drive, enhanced cardiovascular function, and increased diaphragmatic contractility and endurance, have either been shown to be minor in degree, or have not been demonstrated in patients with irreversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No well-designed trial has yet shown improved exercise capacity following theophylline treatment in these patients. Nevertheless, considering that some patients benefit symptomatically in the absence of objective improvement, a cautious trial of theophylline appears indicated in patients with severe irreversible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with discontinuation if there is no objective or subjective improvement.

Theophylline therapy should be initiated via the intravenous route during acute exacerbations, but otherwise should start with sustained-release oral preparations of anhydrous theophylline. Oral therapy should begin at low doses in stable patients to avoid side effects, and dosing should take into account the many factors, such as age, cardiovascular and liver function, smoking status, and possible drug interactions, that can affect theophylline metabolism.

### Aminophylline injection… [^113oVN7g]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli. While the mechanisms of action of theophylline are not. on the efficacy of adding intravenous theophylline to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma have been conflicting. Most studies in patients treated for acute asthma exacerbations in an emergency department have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline does not produce greater bronchodilation and increases the. risk of adverse effects.

In contrast, other studies have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients requiring hospitalization, particularly in patients who are not responding adequately to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, clinical studies have shown that. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Intravenous theophylline is indicated as an adjunct to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids for the treatment of acute exacerbations of the symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction associated with asthma and other chronic lung diseases, e.g., emphysema and. to the increased risk of exacerbation of the concurrent condition: Active peptic ulcer disease Seizure disorders Cardiac arrhythmias Conditions That Reduce Theophylline Clearance: There are several readily identifiable causes of reduced theophylline clearance.

1) was obtained and was required to be 70 percent or less than the predicted normal value. An increase of at least 15 percent in the FEV 1 also was required within 30 minutes of two isoproterenol inhalations. On the second pretest day, patients received two puffs of ipratropium, followed by spirometry at 30 and 60 minutes. Pre-study baseline spirometry values did not differ significantly, and the FEV 1 increased significantly from baseline in response to isoproterenol, ipratropium and theophylline during the three pretest screening procedures. Patients were then seen on four separate days for administration of the four test regimens. On each day, an electrocardiogram was obtained, baseline and post-test spirometry was performed and a serum theophylline level was measured. A total of 32 patients entered the study, but complete data were available in 19.

The FEV 1 increased significantly after all three drug tests, with the increase occurring more rapidly with ipratropium alone than with theophylline alone. However, the combination of theophylline and ipratropium produced the greatest increase in FEV 1. The effect persisted over a longer period of time with administration of ipratropium and theophylline together as opposed to either agent alone. No significant side effects occurred in response to the drug and placebo combinations. A significant increase in the heart rate was noted three to five hours following all three drug tests, but the rate did not differ significantly among the drug tests. The author concludes that since the proposed mechanisms of action of theophylline and ipratropium are different, the bronchodilator effect of this combination is likely to be additive, which would explain the greater increase in FEV.

1 when the drugs were administered together. In addition, the combination of theophylline and ipratropium did not result in increased side effects or tachycardia. The author notes that this combination may be a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot tolerate the side effects of beta agonists or when tachyphylaxis to the beta agonists is suspected.
