## Question

Testicular torsion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about testicular torsion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will review clinical presentation and the differential diagnosis. After that, I need to examine diagnostic strategies, including the role of ultrasound and the TWIST score. Then, I should confirm management principles, including timing, manual detorsion, and surgical fixation. I will also consider special populations and system-level delays. Finally, I will synthesize outcomes, quality metrics, and practical takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord that compromises testicular blood flow, most often due to a bell-clapper deformity allowing intravaginal rotation; extravaginal torsion occurs in neonates with a poorly fixed tunica vaginalis, and the resulting ischemia is time-critical to reverse [^3d9f8e5f] [^c294a2a5].

> I need to check the epidemiology and risk factors. Incidence peaks bimodally in infancy and adolescence, with a median age around 12–14 years; risk is higher with a bell-clapper deformity and may have a familial component in up to 10% of cases, which should raise suspicion in relatives of affected patients [^3d9f8e5f] [^25c57cde].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about presentation. I should verify the classic features: sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain, nausea/vomiting, a high-riding testis, and absent cremasteric reflex are typical, but I must remember that the cremasteric reflex can be unreliable and that atypical presentations with abdominal, flank, or leg pain occur in a substantial minority, which can delay care and worsen outcomes [^3d9f8e5f] [^6c2a191f] [^9e333300].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis. Torsion of the appendix testis, epididymitis/orchitis, trauma, incarcerated hernia, and testicular tumor can mimic torsion; importantly, epididymitis is less common in prepubertal boys, so I need to be cautious not to anchor on infection when the story fits torsion, especially with sudden onset and no urinary symptoms [^7ce709e8] [^006200bb].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy. Wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound: color Doppler ultrasound is the first-line imaging when imaging is pursued, but a normal study does not exclude torsion, particularly in intermittent or early cases with preserved flow; thus, clinical suspicion should drive action, and imaging must not delay surgical exploration when suspicion is high [^1a862700] [^de1be06a] [^65e19eac].

> Let me consider the TWIST score. The TWIST score uses five clinical findings (swelling, hard testis, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea/vomiting, high-riding testis) to stratify risk; a score ≥ 5 has high PPV for torsion and can obviate ultrasound, whereas low-risk patients may avoid imaging, though I should double-check that local validation supports this approach before relying on it exclusively [^e9600f9f] [^f1bbd714].

> Now, I should confirm management principles. Immediate urology consultation and surgical exploration are indicated when torsion is suspected or confirmed; delays for imaging worsen salvage, and the contralateral testis should undergo orchiopexy at the same time to prevent asynchronous torsion, which is a guideline-supported standard of care [^f4600cf1] [^cfee3288] [^634c6d74].

> I need to ensure I address timing. Salvage drops sharply with symptom duration: roughly 90–100% if treated within 6 hours, 20–50% at 6–12 hours, and 0–10% beyond 12–24 hours; door-to-detorsion time in the ED also independently predicts nonviability, with each 10-minute delay increasing the odds of nonviability by about 4.8%, so system delays matter as much as prehospital delay [^c294a2a5] [^5e1a4828].

> But wait, what if surgical access is delayed? Manual detorsion can be attempted as a temporizing measure, ideally with ultrasound guidance to confirm restoration of flow; it is not definitive therapy, and surgical exploration with orchiopexy is still required, but it can buy critical time and relieve pain while arranging the OR [^859a731b] [^240b93db].

> Let me think about special populations. In neonates, extravaginal torsion is common, salvage is rare, and bilateral asynchronous torsion is a key concern; many experts recommend early exploration with contralateral orchiopexy given the risk of anorchia, even though some cases are already nonviable at presentation [^cfee3288] [^2f1cac42]. In adolescents and adults, torsion still occurs and is frequently misattributed to epididymitis, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and avoid anchoring bias [^be7381f0] [^4a500706].

> I should double-check system-level delays that worsen outcomes. Hospital transfer, prolonged ED throughput, and reliance on formal radiology ultrasound can add hours; meta-analysis suggests transfer increases orchiectomy risk when symptom onset is within 24 hours, and quality improvement pathways that parallel-process urology, anesthesia, and ultrasound can reduce door-to-incision times and variability, though salvage still hinges on total ischemic time [^1636f15a] [^c085a5ee] [^9e875f64].

> Next, I should review outcomes and quality metrics. Reported orchiectomy rates vary widely, but contemporary series and meta-analyses suggest roughly 15–40% testicular loss, with late presentation and prolonged ischemic time as dominant predictors; long-term atrophy and subfertility remain concerns even after salvage, underscoring the need for early intervention and counseling [^e67fd854] [^957dd716] [^71aad82a].

> Hold on, I should verify practical takeaways. Maintain a high index of suspicion for any acute scrotal pain, especially in adolescents; do not delay surgical exploration for imaging when suspicion is high; use TWIST to triage imaging in stable patients; and if torsion is confirmed, fix the contralateral testis and document torsion direction and degree for prognostic and medicolegal purposes [^f4600cf1] [^e9600f9f] [^71aad82a].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address education and prevention. Missed torsion is a leading cause of pediatric urology litigation, often due to atypical presentations and failure to examine the scrotum; public and clinician education, standardized pathways, and simulation training can mitigate delays and improve salvage rates across systems [^fea4ed5c] [^c085a5ee] [^9e875f64].

Testicular torsion is a **surgical emergency** [^cfee3288] caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, cutting off testicular blood flow and risking irreversible ischemia within 6–8 hours [^d09fde52]. It presents with **sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain**, nausea/vomiting, and an absent cremasteric reflex [^d09fde52]; a high-riding, horizontally lying testis may be seen [^notfound]. Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** [^e21175d1]; Doppler ultrasound can confirm absent or reduced flow but should not delay urgent urology consultation or surgical exploration [^de1be06a] [^f4600cf1]. Immediate manual detorsion may be attempted if surgery is delayed, but definitive treatment is **surgical detorsion and bilateral orchiopexy** [^859a731b] [^f4600cf1]. Delays beyond 6–8 hours sharply reduce salvage rates, so time-critical management is essential [^c294a2a5].

---

## Pathophysiology

Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord twists, **obstructing arterial inflow and venous outflow**, causing ischemia and infarction if not promptly corrected [^3d9f8e5f]. The most common predisposing factor is the **bell-clapper deformity**, in which the tunica vaginalis envelops the entire testis and epididymis, allowing free rotation of the testis within the scrotum [^c294a2a5]. Torsion can occur at any age, but it is most common in adolescents and young adults, with a bimodal peak in infancy and puberty [^3d9f8e5f].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Sudden severe unilateral scrotal pain**: Often accompanied by nausea and vomiting [^d09fde52].
- **Absent cremasteric reflex**: Highly specific for torsion [^006200bb].
- **High-riding testis**: The affected testis may lie higher and horizontally due to shortening of the spermatic cord [^d09fde52].
- **Scrotal swelling and erythema**: Develop as ischemia progresses [^notfound].

Atypical presentations can occur, including abdominal or groin pain, and symptoms may be intermittent in cases of **intermittent torsion** [^6c2a191f].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** [^e21175d1], but imaging may be used when the diagnosis is uncertain:

- **Doppler ultrasound**: The gold standard imaging modality, demonstrating absent or reduced testicular blood flow [^e6041e07]. However, false negatives can occur, particularly in early or intermittent torsion [^699d7e83].
- **TWIST score**: A clinical scoring system incorporating testicular swelling, hardness, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea/vomiting, and high-riding testis. A score ≥ 5 indicates high risk and warrants immediate surgical exploration [^e9600f9f].

---

## Management

Immediate management includes:

- **Urgent urology consultation**: Do not delay for imaging if torsion is strongly suspected [^f4600cf1].
- **Manual detorsion**: Attempted if surgery is delayed, typically by rotating the testis laterally ("open the book") [^859a731b].
- **Surgical exploration**: Definitive treatment involves detorsion and bilateral orchiopexy (fixation) to prevent recurrence [^f4600cf1].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **duration of ischemia**. Testicular salvage rates are approximately 90% if treated within 6 hours, dropping to 50% at 12 hours, and less than 10% after 24 hours [^c294a2a5]. Delayed treatment can result in testicular atrophy, infertility, and psychological distress [^e67fd854].

---

## Prevention

There are **no specific preventive measures** for testicular torsion. However, early recognition and prompt treatment are critical to preserving testicular viability. Public education and awareness campaigns may help reduce delays in seeking medical attention [^05429ea7].

---

Testicular torsion is a **time-sensitive surgical emergency** characterized by sudden severe scrotal pain and an absent cremasteric reflex. Immediate surgical exploration is the cornerstone of management, with salvage rates declining rapidly as ischemia persists [^f4600cf1].

### Testicular torsion: diagnosis, evaluation, and management [^d09fde52]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents and is a surgical emergency affecting 3.8 per 100,000 males younger than 18 years annually. It accounts for 10% to 15% of acute scrotal disease in children, and results in an orchiectomy rate of 42% in boys undergoing surgery for testicular torsion. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary for testicular salvage, and torsion must be excluded in all patients who present with acute scrotum. Testicular torsion is a clinical diagnosis, and patients typically present with severe acute unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination may reveal a high-riding testicle with an absent cremasteric reflex. If history and physical examination suggest torsion, immediate surgical exploration is indicated and should not be postponed to perform imaging studies. There is typically a four- to eight-hour window before permanent ischemic damage occurs. Delay in treatment may be associated with decreased fertility, or may necessitate orchiectomy.

### Pediatric testicular torsion [^7fd43e2a]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The pediatric patient presenting with acute scrotal pain requires prompt evaluation and management given the likelihood of testicular torsion as the underlying cause. Although other diagnoses can present with acute testicular pain, it is important to recognize the possibility of testicular torsion because the best chance of testicular preservation occurs with expeditious management. When testicular torsion is suspected, prompt surgical exploration is warranted. A delay in surgical management should not occur in an effort to obtain confirmatory imaging. When torsion is discovered, the contralateral testicle should undergo fixation to reduce the risk of asynchronous torsion.

Regardless of age, any presentation of an acute scrotum requires prompt triage and immediate evaluation. The potential for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality exists if timely diagnosis and treatment are provided. Often overlooked, an early scrotal examination in the emergency department may produce the most accurate information into the underlying pathologic process, be it systemic or localized to the scrotum. Although the immediately lethal conditions presenting as acute scrotal pain should be considered, the combined incidence and morbidity associated with testicular torsion make its exclusion paramount in acute scrotal presentations. Similarly, a painless scrotal mass must be assumed to be a testicular neoplasm until proven otherwise, with appropriate work-up and rapid urologic follow-up assured.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of testicular torsion, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Testicular torsion is a urological emergency that occurs with rotation of the testicle along its supporting ligaments leading to obstruction of vascular flow. A key risk factor is the presence of a bell-clapper deformity. The most common population affected includes children in a bimodal distribution with the most cases occurring in the first year of life and between 12 and 18 years, although cases do occur in adults. Acute, severe, unilateral scrotal pain is the most common presenting symptom. Nausea and vomiting are common, but the presence or absence of a cremasteric reflex is not a reliable indicator of disease. The TWIST score may assist with clinical decision making in patients presenting with acute testicular pain but should not be used in isolation. If torsion is suspected or confirmed, consultation with the urology specialist should not be delayed, as outcomes are time sensitive. Ultrasound can be used for diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent urology consultation for surgical exploration and detorsion, as well as symptomatic therapy in the ED. Manual detorsion can be attempted in the ED while awaiting transfer or consultation.

Conclusions

An understanding of testicular torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease.

Background

Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, requiring time-critical surgery to avoid potential organ loss. This study collates national data on paediatric testicular torsion, offering a comprehensive insight into the current standard of care in England for paediatric patients with suspected testicular torsion.

Methods

National data collection using Freedom of Information requests. Of 134 acute secondary care NHS trusts in England that treat paediatric patients, responses were received from 121 trusts - representing 140 hospitals - providing a picture of the current standard of care in England.

Findings

Less than two thirds of hospitals have a paediatric A&E department. One third of hospitals use inter-hospital transfer for paediatric patients with suspected torsion, with variable age restrictions. Mean transfer distance was 19.4 miles (range 2.2 to 61.6 miles). No statistically significant relationship between transfer arrangements and the number of non-viable testicle incidents was found (P = 0.15, ns). There was no correlation demonstrated nationally between size of population served and number of scrotal explorations completed (Pearson's r = 0.20 (CI -0.0.8–0.46), p = 0.16, ns). Qualitative thematic content analysis of serious incident reports identified common themes leading to missed diagnosis and delayed time to theatre: Education and Training, Communication, Transfer Complications, On-site Resources and Cross-site Working.

Interpretation

We found variability in resource provision across England, as well as the number of explorations, and the number of unviable testicles found at exploration nationally. We received variable and incomplete data on emergency scrotal explorations and subsequent orchidectomies, very low levels of local audit and limited disclosure of incident reports. A mandatory national audit would allow more comprehensive data collection to accurately identify trends and make informed recommendations. To improve outcomes, we recommend continued education of ED and surgical teams, with mandatory testicular examination for young males presenting with abdominal pain. Whilst streamlining inpatient services is important, the time lost between symptom onset and seeking medical attention is crucial, and raising awareness in the community for young boys and parents may be imperative to improve rates of testicular salvage.

### Contemporary review of testicular torsion: new concepts, emerging technologies and potential therapeutics [^a03947e9]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is one of the few emergencies in pediatric urology which requires an accurate and timely diagnosis in order to avoid testis loss. It is not an uncommon event affecting a young male population. In fact, testicular torsion is more common than testicular tumors for this same age group, yet testicular torsion has not been given the public attention it deserves as a male health risk. In this review we highlight the new information published over the past four years regarding testicular torsion. We will discuss a variety of topics associated with torsion including: medical legal issues, etiology and genetics, imaging diagnostics, innovative surgical techniques, management controversies, fertility, and new drug therapies.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^c294a2a5]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion (TT) is a urologic emergency where prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent testicular loss. TT can occur in male patients at any age, but there is a bimodal distribution which has been described with peaks within the first year of life and between ages 13–16 years old. The etiology of TT can be further classified into two broad categories: intravaginal and extravaginal. Intravaginal TT occurs when the testis twists completely within the tunica vaginalis. This mechanism is the most common etiology and is usually seen in individuals with a bilateral anatomic defect known as the bell clapper deformity. In extravaginal TT, there is a loose attachment between the tunica vaginalis and the scrotal wall early in prenatal development that increases the likelihood of the tunica vaginalis and its contents to twist around the spermatic cord, most commonly in the neonatal period.

Management is centered around prompt surgical exploration for every patient with a definitive diagnosis as well as those with inconclusive imaging due to the morbidity associated with delay in management. Delayed intervention can result in permanent ischemic injury of the testis that can lead to long term consequences including testicular loss and infertility. Irreversible ischemia from torsion begins in 6 h from symptom onset and the likelihood of testicular salvage is the highest within the first 6 hours. Based on prior literature, treatment with 6 h of symptom onset correlates with 90–100% chance of testicular salvage. However, treatment within 6–12 h decreases salvage rates to 20–50%, and treatment in the 12–24 h range affords only a 0–10% chance of testicular salvage. If surgery is delayed more than 24 h following symptom onset, testicular non-viability is almost inevitable even if the testicular tissue appears viable during surgical exploration. Due to factors such as patient preference, hospital capacity, and access to health care providers capable of managing TT, over 1/3rd of patients with suspected TT are transferred to a tertiary care facility for management, which increases total time of ischemic damage and morbidity.

### Management of testicular torsion and a contralateral testicular mass presenting synchronously [^238b42cc]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Testicular masses found in prepubertal males are often benign in nature. This has led to an increase in the use of testis-sparing surgery. Testicular torsion is considered a urologic emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. Based off literature review, it is rare for these unique entities to present synchronously in a single patient. This report demonstrates that in the pediatric population it is possible to safely treat a suspected benign testicular mass with testis sparing mass enucleation if it presents synchronously with testicular torsion in the contralateral testis.

### Scrotal masses [^7ce709e8]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### Identifying systems delays in assessment, diagnosis, and operative management for testicular torsion in a single-payer health-care system [^f85c66eb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion (TT) is a common pediatric urologic emergency. Management of TT is time sensitive and often confirmed on scrotal Doppler ultrasound (DUS). Acquiring DUS, however, can result in delays in the management of TT, affecting testicular salvage rates.

Objective

The objective of this study is to identify delays in the assessment and diagnosis for patients presenting with TT to a Canadian academic hospital using patient flow analysis.

Study Design

A retrospective review was performed for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) who received a scrotal DUS to rule out possible TT between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome measured cycle-time measurements (median time) between points along the clinical flow pathway for a patient with suspected TT. The secondary outcome assessed diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of standard scrotal DUS components (Doppler flow, arterial waveform, heterogeneous echotexture).

Results

A total of 609 patients presented with an acute scrotum warranting a scrotal DUS to rule out TT; of which, 46 underwent scrotal exploration. Testicular salvage rate was 82.6% in the series (38 testes salvaged, 8 required orchiectomy). Median time from symptom onset to ED presentation for patients with possible TT was 4 h. After triage, a median of 79.8 min was required for ED physician assessment and an additional 48 min for scrotal DUS to be performed. Absence of Doppler flow on scrotal DUS had a 97.4% PPV for diagnosing TT confirmed during scrotal exploration.

Discussion

Almost 4 h of in-ED time is required from triage to surgical intervention for potential TT at the institution. One area of delay is the time needed to conduct a scrotal DUS (48–128 min; Fig. 1). This represents an area of opportunity for patient flow optimization through the use of standardized clinical pathways and diagnostic adjuncts, such as point-of-care ultrasound. This study is limited in its retrospective nature and does not include patients with overt signs of TT who underwent surgical detorsion without need for scrotal DUS.

Conclusion

Patient flow delays to surgical intervention for patients with TT represent a preventable cause of orchiectomy in young men. This study identifies intervention points in patient-care flow pathways where delays to surgical intervention can be potentially reduced by up to 2 h. The findings support the need for further studies into the optimization of patient flow and management protocols to reduce delays in the diagnosis and management of TT.

### Development and initial validation of a scoring system to diagnose testicular torsion in children [^e9600f9f]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Testicular Workup for Ischaemia and Suspected Torsion score (TWIST score)" for testicular torsion.

The Testicular Workup for Ischaemia and Suspected Torsion score (TWIST score) is a clinical tool designed for the evaluation of acute scrotal pain, specifically to differentiate testicular torsion from other causes. The target patient population includes individuals presenting with acute scrotal pain, where timely diagnosis is crucial to prevent testicular loss.

The primary components of the TWIST score include five clinical findings: testicular swelling, hard testes, absent cremasteric reflex, nausea or vomiting, and high-riding testis. Each of these components contributes to the overall score, which guides the subsequent management strategy.

The Testicular Workup for Ischaemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score calculator evaluates the likelihood of testicular torsion based on user responses to five specific clinical signs or symptoms. Each of these inputs is associated with a predefined point value.

The calculator takes the following inputs:

- **Testicular swelling**: 2 points if true
- **Hard testes**: 2 points if true
- **Absent cremasteric reflex**: 1 point if true
- **Nausea or vomiting**: 1 point if true
- **High-riding testis**: 1 point if true

Each response might be a boolean value (true or false). For every true input, the respective points are added to calculate the total TWIST score, which ranges from 0 to a maximum of 7 points.

The interpretation of the TWIST score is provided based on the cumulative sum as follows:

1. **High risk (score ≥ 5)**: A score of 5 or more indicates a high risk with a 100% positive predictive value for testicular torsion. It suggests that prompt urological consultation and likely surgery are required.
2. **Intermediate risk (score 3–4)**: A score between 3 and 4 signifies an intermediate risk, necessitating an ultrasound for further evaluation.
3. **Low risk (score ≤ 2)**: A score of 2 or less reflects a low risk with a 100% negative predictive value for testicular torsion, typically meaning that an ultrasound is not generally required.

### Testicular torsion: a review [^28eb5afa]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Torsion of the testis, also referred to as torsion of the spermatic cord, is a subject of debate among physicians and surgeons. Testicular torsion is an acute vascular event causing the rotation of the vascular pedicle of the testis, thereby impeding the blood flow to the testis and the scrotal contents. It could be either within or outside the tunica vaginalis. Testicular torsion causes immediate circulatory changes and long-term sequelae such as testicular function and fertility. It is considered a surgical emergency, as a delay causes irreversible testicular damage. The diagnosis and treatment of testicular torsion are discussed in this review, which also illustrates an algorithm and a scoring system for the diagnosis and management of this condition based on current literature.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to refer patients with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset and test results not supporting a diagnosis of urethritis or UTI, or if the diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediately to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion.

### Testicular torsion [^006200bb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Each year, testicular torsion affects one in 4,000 males younger than 25 years. Early diagnosis and definitive management are the keys to avoid testicular loss. All prepubertal and young adult males with acute scrotal pain should be considered to have testicular torsion until proven otherwise. The finding of an ipsilateral absent cremasteric reflex is the most accurate sign of testicular torsion. Torsion of the appendix testis is more common in children than testicular torsion and may be diagnosed by the "blue dot sign" (i.e., tender nodule with blue discoloration on the upper pole of the testis). Epididymitis/orchitis is much less common in the prepubertal male, and the diagnosis should be made with caution in this age group. Doppler ultrasonography may be needed for definitive diagnosis; radionuclide scintigraphy is an alternative that may be more accurate but should be ordered only if it can be performed without delay. Diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on the finding of decreased or absent blood flow on the ipsilateral side. Treatment involves rapid restoration of blood flow to the affected testis. The optimal time frame is less than six hours after the onset of symptoms. Manual detorsion by external rotation of the testis can be successful, but restoration of blood flow must be confirmed following the maneuver. Surgical exploration provides definitive treatment for the affected testis by orchiopexy and allows for prophylactic orchiopexy of the contralateral testis. Surgical treatment of torsion of the appendix testis is not mandatory but hastens recovery.

### Testicular pain pathway in children: investigating where missed torsion occurs most often [^84b2873c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute scrotal pain in children is a common presenting complaint in hospital, and it is imperative that cases of testicular torsion are identified and managed promptly. We aim to identify the most influential points in the pathway in determining whether patients are managed in the appropriate time frame, so these areas can be targeted to improve salvage rates.

Methods

Using quality improvement principles, the pediatric scrotal pain pathway was mapped out, commencing with initial symptom onset and ending with definitive surgical management. We retrospectively reviewed data on all patients between 0 and 18 years of age attending the emergency department at Whipps Cross University Hospital with acute scrotal pain between October 2010 and October 2013.

Results

Over the 3-year period, 238 patients 18 years or younger presented to casualty with scrotal pain. Of the patients assessed initially by an emergency department physician, 52.8% (n = 67) were discharged without referral. To our knowledge, none of these patients presented later with a missed torsion. Torsion was diagnosed in 23.2% of the patients operated on (n = 22), of which 5 required orchidectomy, comprising 2.1% of all patients presenting with scrotal pain. In this group, 4 were due to late presentation by the patient.

Conclusions

We demonstrate the value of different stages of the pathway, as more than half of patients seen in A&E were correctly discharged without referral. In the context of our study, late presentation to hospital appears to be the most significant factor leading to orchidectomy. To target this issue, awareness among both children and parents must be improved.

### Ovarian torsion: diagnosis of inclusion mandates earlier intervention [^149c26ac]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The treatment of ovarian torsion (OT) is often delayed because of diagnostic uncertainty and dependence on radiologic confirmation. In contrast, when testicular torsion (TT) is suspected, diagnosis and management are expedited despite lack of certainty, and operative exploration is not delayed by radiologic investigations. We compared the management of torsion in both sexes to define a better clinical pathway for suspected OT.

Methods

A 2.5-year review of the Pediatric Health Information System database was performed to determine the incidence of TT and OT at large children's hospitals. A 10-year retrospective review of children (0–19 years) diagnosed with TT or OT at a single academic center was performed to identify differences in diagnosis and management and determine the impact on gonadal salvage rates.

Results

The incidence of TT was comparable with OT in the Pediatric Health Information System database (0.03% vs 0.02%). A total of 158 patients with TT and 90 patients with OT were managed at our center with a median age of 12 years in both groups. Boys presented earlier after the onset of pain (36 vs 72 hours, P < .0001) and were imaged more quickly (0.77 vs 1.86 hours, P < .0001). Time to operating room (OR) was also shorter for TT (2.3 vs 6.3 hours, P < .0001). The salvage rate for TT was 30.3% vs 14.4% for OT (P < .01).

Conclusions

Girls with suspected OT waited 2.5 times as long for diagnostic imaging and 2.7 times as long to be taken to the operating room. In addition, the gonadal salvage rate was significantly worse for girls compared with boys with TT. More urgent intervention for OT, with liberal use of diagnostic laparoscopy and without reliance on a definitive diagnosis by imaging, should be considered in girls with lower abdominal pain.

### Impact of hospital transfer on testicular torsion outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1636f15a]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion is an emergent condition requiring prompt treatment. Previous studies have suggested transfer of pediatric testicular torsion cases may be detrimental to patient outcomes. Findings have not reached statistical significance. No study has quantitatively analyzed all literature reporting outcomes for transferred torsion patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate the impact of hospital transfer on pediatric testicular torsion outcomes through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A predefined study protocol registered with PROSPERO was developed according to PRISMA. A comprehensive literature review of articles investigating outcomes for pediatric testicular torsion for transferred and non-transferred (treated "directly" at presentation institution) patients with orchiectomy as the primary outcome was conducted by systematically searching PubMed and Embase. Potential studies were screened against a predefined study protocol. Meta-analysis using a random effects model with transferred status as the "intervention" was performed using Review Manager 5.3.

Results

Of 18 eligible studies, 9 retrospective studies comprised of 2564 patients (532 transferred and 2032 direct) were suitable for quantitative analysis. Main analysis showed transfer status does not have a significant effect on torsion outcomes (RR 0.96 [95% CI 0.78–1.17]; I² = 44%). Subgroup analysis for torsion patients presenting within 24 h of symptom onset shows patients who are transferred to another facility for management are more likely to undergo orchiectomy than those treated at their presenting institution (RR 0.35 [95% CI 0.24–0.51]; I² = 4%).

Conclusions

In this meta-analysis, hospital transfer does not affect orchiectomy rate in pediatric patients with testicular torsion when pooling data from all presentation timeframes. Subgroup analysis of patients presenting with testicular torsion in an acute setting (< 24 h of symptom onset) suggests the delay associated with hospital transfer has a deleterious effect on testicular viability.

### Scrotal pain in the absence of torsion; need for vigilance [^2b63641c]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common presentation of acute testicular pain seen in the emergency department, the differential diagnosis being testicular torsion. The vast majority of young men with epididymitis have an infective aetiology and this settle with antibiotic treatment. The clinical course of a patient who presented with testicular pain is described. At ultrasonography, the patient was found to have the uncommon condition of testicular microlithiasis, a condition that has been linked to malignant disease. Emergency doctors should be aware of the potential consequences of returning scrotal pain consistent with epididymitis to the community on antibiotic treatment alone. All patients with probable epididymitis should have either a scrotal ultrasound or specialist follow up.

### Implementation of the accelerated care of torsion pathway: a quality improvement initiative for testicular torsion [^c085a5ee]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely diagnosis and management of testicular torsion is of paramount importance. Furthermore, time to surgical intervention is a benchmark for the quality of care provided by pediatric urologists included in US News and World Report (USNWR) methodology.

Objective

We sought to optimize management of acute testicular torsion at a single institution by decreasing time from presentation to definitive management through the creation and implementation of a clinical care pathway (accelerated care of torsion or ACT) for acute testicular torsion in a 2-year period.

Study Design

Multidisciplinary process mapping involving the emergency department (ED), radiology, anesthesiology, peri-operative services, and operating room (OR) teams resulted in development of the ACT pathway with the goal of achieving surgical intervention within 4 h of arrival at our institution. The accelerated care of torsion pathway was implemented in April 2016. Thirty-eight consecutive acute torsion cases were then prospectively evaluated from April 2016 to April 2018. For process measures, we recorded triage to OR times and mode of presentation. For outcome measures, we examined orchiectomy rates. We retrospectively reviewed 97 cases of acute torsion from 2004 to 2016 as a control.

Results

Time from ED triage to OR start decreased from a median 196 min (interquartile range [IQR] 137–249 min) to 127 min (IQR 100–148 min; P < 0.0001) for all cases of acute torsion. In the control group, 72% of cases met the USNWR criteria for acute treatment of torsion. After ACT implementation, 100% of cases reached the OR within the 240 min time frame. Orchiectomy rates were performed in 24% of control cases vs 30% after ACT implementation (P = NS). Survival curve analysis demonstrated no significant difference in probability of testis salvage before or after implementation of the ACT pathway.

Discussion

In agreement with similar studies, despite a significant reduction in triage to OR times, the orchiectomy rate approached 30%. This outcome did not significantly improve after implementation of the ACT pathway. Overall ischemia time was a more important determinant of testis salvage. Study limitations include limited patient follow-up to assess testis atrophy.

Conclusions

The multidisciplinary creation and implementation of a clinical pathway for the care of acute testis torsion has significantly decreased the time from ED to OR in our institution. However, overall orchiectomy rate was not significantly affected.

### Optimal predictor of gonadal viability in testicular torsion: time to treat versus duration of symptoms [^a3d1cf6e]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We hypothesize that in testicular torsion, the duration of symptoms (DoS) better correlates with predicting testicular viability than minimizing the "time-to-treat" (TtT) after presentation to a medical facility.

Materials and Methods

Medical records of male pediatric patients treated for suspected diagnosis of testicular torsion in the emergency department (ED) from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, were retrospectively evaluated. Forty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis compared testicular viability based on TtT, DoS, and site of initial presentation.

Results

Testicular salvage rates for patients presenting directly to our ED was 56.3% with an average TtT of 2.5 h versus 77.8% and 1.96 h, respectively, for transferred patients. Overall testicular survival was not statistically impacted by the difference in TtT. Comparing DoS, an 84% testicular salvage rate (DoS < 24 h) versus a 15.4% salvage rate (DoS > 24 h) was shown in patients presenting directly to our ED (P ≤ 0.0001). Within the total population (n = 41), a significant difference was also shown (P ≤ 0.0001) when comparing overall testicular salvage rates in patients presenting with < 24 h versus > 24 h total DoS (84% versus 25%).

Conclusions

These data reveal that an alternative predictor of testicular salvage rates is a DoS < 24 h. This is a meaningful metric when providing accurate preoperating counseling to parents and may be a better focus of quality improvement efforts surrounding this topic.

### Factors associated with delayed presentation and misdiagnosis of testicular torsion: a case-control study [^70ec91ff]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

We identified factors associated with delay in presentation and misdiagnosis of testicular torsion. Compared with acute cases, delayed presentations were more likely to report isolated abdominal pain, developmental disorders, and history of recent genital trauma. Failure to perform a genitourinary examination or scrotal imaging was associated with misdiagnosis.

### Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors associated with delayed diagnosis and management of pediatric testicular torsion in west China: a retrospective study of 301 cases in a single tertiary children's hospital [^7dbbec6b]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Only approximately 26.9% of TT children received timely surgical management (within 12 h from symptoms onset to surgery) in West China. Delayed surgical management for TT was more likely for boys with age less than 6 years, the absence of other diagnosis, with a history of former treatment or symptoms progress, and those living far away from the main city zone. The misdiagnosis rate of TT in primary and secondary healthcare units was very high. It is vital to strengthen the public awareness of TT and conduct continuously re-education and update physicians working at primary and secondary healthcare units to maximize the possibility of timely surgical management for TT.

### The utility of scrotal ultrasonography in the emergent setting: beyond epididymitis versus torsion [^65904884]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Scrotal pain is a common acute presentation for medical care. Testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis are two diagnoses for which early detection is critical and their sonographic imaging features have been thoroughly described in the radiologic literature. Other important conditions for which radiologists must be aware have received less attention. This article will highlight key traumatic and non-traumatic causes of acute scrotal pain other than testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis that may present in the emergency department setting.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of pediatric testicular torsion: a retrospective case series analysis [^d9e751fb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that warrants prompt treatment. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by ultrasonography interpreted by a radiologist (RADUS); however, in this study, we describe the clinical course of 23 patients for whom point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians during the initial assessment for testicular torsion in the pediatric emergency department (PED).

Methods

A retrospective case series analysis of patients aged 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with acute testicular torsion after undergoing scrotal POCUS through our PED.

Results

Between June 2015 and December 2020, 155 boys received an International Classification of Diseases-9 code of Torsion of Testis after presenting to our PED. Seventy-three patients were imaged preoperatively, of which 50 (68.5%) were diagnosed via RADUS alone. Twenty-three patients (31.5%) underwent POCUS (median age 14.1 years [interquartile range {IQR}: 11.4–15.9 years]), of which 14 (60.9%) were imaged by POCUS alone, whereas the remaining 9 patients (39.1%) underwent POCUS before RADUS. Thirteen of the 23 patients (56.5%) who underwent POCUS had intraoperative findings consistent with acute testicular torsion, whereas another 3 patients (13.0%) required manual detorsion in the PED before orchiopexy. Six patients required orchiectomy. All patients for which POCUS findings were suggestive of acute testicular torsion were correctly classified. The median length of stay from time to admission to orchiopexy for those who received RADUS only versus POCUS only was 184 minutes (IQR: 136–255), and 121 minutes (IQR: 80–202), respectively (P = 0.036). Among the patients who experienced POCUS, the median length of stay for those who underwent RADUS in addition to POCUS compared with those who underwent POCUS alone was 202 minutes (IQR: 136–338.4) (P = 0.031).

Conclusions

Point-of-care ultrasound performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians can be used to expedite surgical management and streamline the management of pediatric patients suspected of acute testicular torsion.

### Testicular torsion in the inguinal canal in children [^43cfc345]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the management and outcomes of pediatric patients presenting with torsion of an undescended testis in the inguinal canal.

Patients and Methods

The case records of 84 children operated on for testicular torsion were retrospectively reviewed. The medical records included initial medical history, physical examination, operative findings, and the results of follow-up. The diagnosis of torsion of undescended testis was made clinically and confirmed by a Doppler ultrasound and inguinal canal exploration.

Results

Eight children were operated following torsion of undescended testis. In four cases the testicle was preserved and orchidopexy was performed, while in four cases orchidectomy was performed due to testicular gangrene. Mean duration of symptoms, at time of surgery, in the orchidopexy group was 6 h and in the orchidectomy group was 50 h. At follow-up atrophy of the testis was found in only one patient.

Conclusion

Torsion of an undescended testis is a relatively rare phenomenon that should be suspected, diagnosed and treated without delay. This study highlights the importance of examination of external genital organs. With improved recognition of this entity and earlier referrals of patients with undescended testes by primary care physicians, its occurrence might eventually be prevented.

### Did COVID-19 affect time to presentation in the setting of pediatric testicular torsion? [^a9326774]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine if boys with acute testicular torsion, a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to optimize salvage of the testicle, delayed presentation to a medical facility and experienced an extended duration of symptoms (DoS), and secondarily, a higher rate of orchiectomy, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Methods

Single-center, descriptive retrospective chart review of boys presenting with acute testicular torsion from March 15, to May 4, 2020 ("during COVID-19" or group 2), as well as for the same time window in the 5-year period from 2015 to 2019 ("pre-COVID-19" or group 1).

Results

A total of 78 boys met inclusion criteria, group 1 (n = 57) and group 2 (n = 21). The mean age was 12.86 ± 2.63 (group 1) and 12.86 ± 2.13 (group 2). Mean DoS before presentation at a medical facility was 23.2 ± 35.0 hours in group 1 compared with 21.3 ± 29.7 hours in group 2 (P < 0.37). When DoS was broken down into acute (< 24 hours) versus delayed (≥ 24 hours), 41 (71.9%) of 57 boys in group 1 and 16 (76.2%) of 21 boys in group 2 presented within less than 24 hours of symptom onset (P < 0.78). There was no difference in rate of orchiectomy between group 1 and group 2 (44.7% vs 25%, P < 0.17), respectively.

Conclusions

Boys with acute testicular torsion in our catchment area did not delay presentation to a medical facility from March 15, to May 4, 2020, and did not subsequently undergo a higher rate of orchiectomy.

### Management of perinatal torsion: today, tomorrow or never? [^2f1cac42]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Management of perinatal testicular torsion is a highly controversial issue. Despite uncommon salvage of the affected gonad, exploration for ipsilateral orchiectomy and empiric contralateral orchiopexy have been recommended due to the unlikely but unfortunate possibility of asynchronous torsion. Observation with serial examination is the alternative. Risk of general anesthesia must be weighed against the risk of anorchia. We describe our collective experience with bilateral perinatal torsion, solidifying our recommendation for early exploration in all cases of perinatal torsion.

Materials and Methods

All cases of perinatal torsion from 3 practices during a 3-year period were reviewed. All practices were at an academic center or in a major metropolitan area. Early exploration for contralateral orchiopexy was performed in all cases.

Results

In 18 patients examination was consistent with unilateral perinatal torsion. Contralateral torsion was discovered at the time of exploration in 4 cases (22%). Despite orchiopexy of the better perfused gonad, atrophy was universal in these 4 cases. Findings potentially related to contralateral torsion were identified in 2 additional cases. No anesthetic or operative complications occurred.

Conclusions

Bilateral asynchronous perinatal torsion is an uncommon but serious event. In our experience torsion of the contralateral gonad was not associated with signs or symptoms of acute torsion. Observation and serial examinations are then a challenging proposition. Due to the consistently poor outcome from bilateral asynchronous torsion, we continue to recommend early exploration and empiric contralateral orchiopexy for all cases of perinatal torsion. Parents must be counseled regarding the relative risks of exploration and anesthesia versus observation.

### Atypical presentation delays treatment of pediatric testicular torsion [^6c2a191f]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to identify patient- and care-related factors associated with time to treatment for acute testicular torsion and the likelihood of testicular loss.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected for patients 18 years and younger who had surgery for acute testicular torsion between April 1, 2005, and September 1, 2021. Atypical symptoms and history were defined as having abdominal, leg, or flank pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, local trauma, or not having testicular pain. The primary outcome was testicular loss. The primary process measure was time from emergency department (ED) triage to surgery.

Results

One hundred eleven patients were included in descriptive analysis. The rate of testicular loss was 35%. Forty-one percent of all patients reported atypical symptoms or history. Eighty-four patients had adequate data to calculate time from symptom onset to surgery and time from triage to surgery and were included in analyses of factors affecting risk of testicular loss. Sixty-eight patients had adequate data to evaluate all care-related time points and were included in analyses to determine factors affecting time from ED triage to surgery. On multivariable regression analyses, increased risk of testicular loss was associated with younger age and longer time from symptom onset to ED triage, while longer time from triage to surgery was associated with reporting atypical symptoms or history. The most frequently reported atypical symptom was abdominal pain, in 26% of patients. These patients were more likely to have nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal tenderness but equally likely to report testicular pain and swelling and have testicular findings on examination.

Conclusions

Patients presenting to the ED with acute testicular torsion reporting atypical symptoms or history experience slower transit from arrival in the ED to operative management and may be at greater risk of testicular loss. Increased awareness of atypical presentations of pediatric acute testicular torsion may improve time to treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^4a500706]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### Implementation of a health system intervention to reduce time from presentation to surgical intervention for pediatric testicular torsion [^9e875f64]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Testicular salvage rates for torsion are time-dependent 1. Door to detorsion time has been identified as an independent testicular survival factor 2. We describe an initiative to reduce door to incision (DTI) time for pediatric testicular torsion.

Materials and Methods

An institutional multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative with a primary outcome of reducing DTI time for pediatric testicular torsion was developed with multidisciplinary stakeholders. Several process and balancing measures were used as secondary outcomes to help interpret and verify the observed change in DTI time. Interventions were implemented in cycles. Initial interventions standardized assessment of suspected torsion by Emergency Medicine utilizing a validated scoring system. A threshold Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score led to parallel notification of essential services for rapid assessment and case prioritization3. Subsequently, bedside ultrasound in the Emergency Department was implemented. Progress was tracked in a live dashboard and analyzed with X-mR process control charts and Nelson rules. These tools are used in quality improvement and process control to demonstrate the significance of changes as they are being implemented, prior to when traditional hypothesis testing would be able to do so. We aimed to increase the proportion of cases with DTI times under 4 h from 64% to > 90% within one year.

Results

We observed 22 torsion cases prior to and 62 following initial implementation. The percentage of cases with DTI times under 4 h improved from 64% to 95%. At week 29, a shift identified a significant change on the X chart, with reduction in mean DTI time from 221 to 147 min. At the same time, a shift on the mR chart identified reduction in patient-to-patient variation. Mean time from arrival to Urology evaluation decreased from 140 to 56 min, mean time from arrival to scrotal ultrasound decreased from 70 to 36 min, and mean time from scrotal ultrasound to surgical incision decreased from 128 to 80 min. These improvements highlight the two key successes of our project: application of the TWIST score and bedside ultrasound for rapid assessment of suspected testicular torsions, and parallel processing of the evaluation and management.

Conclusions

Implementation of a protocol for pediatric testicular torsion increased the proportion of cases with DTI time < 4 h to 95%, decreased mean DTI time, and decreased variation. Our protocol provides a model to improve timeliness of care in treating pediatric testicular torsion.

### Testicular workup for ischemia and suspected torsion in pediatric patients and resource utilization [^f1bbd714]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion (TT) is a pediatric emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) scores patients on clinical symptoms and can predict TT. This study aimed to determine if the application of TWIST to children with acute scrotal pain could decrease the use of Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) and emergency department (ED) length of stay and ischemic time.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort study applying TWIST to patients who presented to a pediatric ED with acute testicular pain from December 2017 to June 2019 was performed. Demographics, TWIST score, diagnosis, DUS, consults, and time to the operation were recorded. Patients were stratified into low (LR), intermediate (IR), and high (HR) risk groups for TT based on TWIST score. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed.

Results

Seventy-seven patients were included in the study and had a mean age of 9.24 y ± 5.24. All 9 HR patients (TWIST = 5–7) had TT, and none of the 57 LR patients (TWIST = 0–2) had TT. Use of TWIST could have reduced the number of DUS needed to diagnose TT from 69 to 11 (75.3% reduction in DUS).

Conclusions

TWIST accurately predicts torsion in HR groups and excludes torsion in LR groups. Application of TWIST to HR patients may eliminate the need for DUS and decrease ischemic time and cost of care. Application of TWIST in LR patients may likewise eliminate the need for DUS and decrease ED length of stay and cost of care.

### Practice patterns affecting delays in care of testicular torsion [^f9da8236]. Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare impact of day or on-call team, pediatric or adult attending, and patient age on testicular torsion management and outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients with testicular torsion between 2012 and 2022 at a single institution was conducted. Variables impacting management time were assessed using univariate analyses.

Results

One hundred and thirty-four patients were included: 49 underwent orchiectomies and 84 underwent orchiopexies. There was no significant difference between efficiency of on-call vs day team regarding time to ultrasound or time to operating room (OR). There were no significant differences between pediatric vs adult attending surgeons for time to surgery, intraoperative length of surgery, or testicular salvage rates. However, when patients were stratified by age greater or younger than 18years, older patients had significantly longer symptom duration (91.9 vs 20.0 minutes, P = 0.005), time to receive an ultrasound from emergency room registration (152 vs 87 minutes, P < .001), time to OR from emergency room registration (268 vs 185 minutes, P < .001), and time to OR from ultrasound read (187 vs 123 minutes, P = 0.03). Older patients also had lower rates of testicular salvage approaching significance (orchiectomy rate 48.8% vs 31.5%, P = 0.057).

Conclusion

While no significant delays in testicular torsion management were detected between management by on-call vs day team nor pediatric vs adult attending, increased age of patient was associated with delays in definitive surgical management. Greater index of suspicion for testicular torsion diagnosis in adult patients may improve the rate of testicular salvage.

### Surge in testicular torsion in pediatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [^d78742be]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion is a pediatric surgical emergency, and prompt diagnosis and treatment is imperative. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric patients with symptoms of testicular torsion may be reluctant to seek medical care which increases the likelihood of delayed presentation and the need for an orchiectomy. This observational study sought to determine whether there was a higher number of testicular torsion cases during COVID-19.

Methods

As the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our facility on March 6, 2020, we identified male children ages 1–18 years with testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 (during COVID-19) compared to the same time period between 2015 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). All patients were evaluated at our Institution's Emergency Department by a pediatric urologist.

Results

There were 38 cases of testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 compared to 15.8 cases on average during the same 10-month period between 2015 and 2019 (a total of 79 cases). There was a statistically significant increase in testicular torsion cases during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to equivalent time periods in 2015–2019 (38 vs. 15.8, p = 0.05). Patients with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic were younger, had a longer duration of symptoms, and had a higher number of orchiectomies (although not statistically significant).

Conclusion

During the COVID-19 pandemic, an escalation in testicular torsion cases was observed. Timely assessment, diagnosis, and surgery are crucial to prevent testicular loss and potential infertility in the future. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the surge in testicular torsion and possible mechanisms.

### Indicators and outcomes of transfer to tertiary pediatric hospitals for patients with testicular torsion [^fa85e6c1]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Testicular torsion threatens testicular viability with increased risk of loss with delayed management. Still, healthy adolescents continue to be transferred from community hospitals to tertiary hospitals for surgical management for torsion even though adult urologists may be available. We sought to determine reasons behind patient transfer and to evaluate whether transfer to tertiary centers for testicular torsion leads to increased rates of testicular loss.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed for patients presenting to our free-standing pediatric tertiary care facility with surgically confirmed testicular torsion during the 5-year period between January 2011 and January 2016. Data was collected regarding transfer status, patient demographics, time of presentation to our facility, duration of symptoms, patient workup, and surgical outcomes. Patients with perinatal or intermittent torsion were excluded.

Results

One-hundred and twenty-five patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six of those were transferred from outside facilities while 89 presented directly to our hospital. A greater proportion of the transferred patients presented during nights or weekends than those presenting directly to our facility (77.8% versus 51.7%, p = 0.009). Eighty-nine patients presented with symptom duration of less than 24 h and had potentially viable testicles. Of those, 23 were transferred and 66 presented directly to our hospital. Differences are shown in the Table. Transferred patients had twice the rate of testicular loss as those not transferred, although the results were not significant (30.4% versus 15.2%, p = 0.129). Patients undergoing ultrasound prior to transfer had prolonged symptom duration and faced higher rates of testicular loss when compared with patients not transferred, although the latter was not significant (mean duration 8.0 versus 4.9 h, p = 0.025, and testicular loss 40.0% versus 15.2%, p = 0.065, respectively). Patients transferred over 30 miles had over 2.5 times the rate of testicular loss than those not transferred (42.8% versus 15.2%, p = 0.029).

Discussion

This study is unique in its examination of motivations for transfer of patients presenting with testicular torsion and in its evaluation of the impact of transfer on testicular salvage rates for potentially viable testicles (those with less than 24 h since symptom onset).

Conclusion

Patients are more likely to be transferred to our tertiary pediatric facility for management of testicular torsion during the night or weekend. Transferring patients for management of testicular torsion delays definitive management and threatens testicular viability, especially in those transferred greater distances. Urologists at the facility of initial patient presentation should correct testicular torsion when able.

Epididymitis — definition, causes, and referral: Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting < 6 weeks, and a high index of suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency; acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e. Escherichia coli), and acute epididymitis caused by an STI is usually accompanied by urethritis; among older men, nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis is associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression; chronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥ 6-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most common granulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be suspected with a known history of or recent exposure to TB, and men with this diagnosis should be referred to a urologist for clinical management.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^059d92a9]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study focuses on the relationships between patient transfer from rural areas throughout West Virginia to RMH and the clinical and surgical outcomes in patients with testicular torsion. The hypothesis that those transferred to our hospital would have a longer delay in surgical intervention and a higher numerical rate of orchiectomy was supported. There was a statistically significant delay from onset of testicular torsion symptoms to surgical intervention in the patients who were transferred to RMH compared to those who presented to RMH directly. These results suggest that patients who live in rural areas and present to rurally located hospitals first require transfer and travel time that is more likely to result in delays in definitive management. The rate of orchiectomy was 11% higher in patients who transferred to RMH than in the patients who presented to RMH directly. Although this number did not reach statistical significance, most likely due to small sample size of patients, these results suggest that delays in surgical intervention for testicular torsion patients are more likely to be associated with the need for orchiectomy.

Testicular torsion patients who were transferred to RMH had a significant decrease in time from presentation at RMH to surgical incision than patients who presented directly to RMH. There are multiple possible explanations for why these results were seen. One such explanation could be appropriate communication between facilities prior to arrival at RMH to ensure expeditious management. Another explanation may be that diagnostic criteria were completed at the outside hospital, expediting the process at RMH. Other studies have recognized the importance of shorter times from arrival to the operating rooms in patients who have already experienced delays in management due to the need for hospital transfer. One study implemented a standardized track called "Straight to the Operating Room" with a goal of reducing time to surgery, decreased hospitalization costs, and less overall testicular loss. While they did not see a statistically significant reduction in testicular loss, the STOR track did significantly decrease time to surgery and hospitalization cost for affected patients. Additionally, the distance that patients had to travel was not statistically correlated with amount of delay. These results, along with the finding that 73% of patients were transferred via ambulance, suggest that transportation distance itself was not associated with delays in care. Other studies have also shown that travel distance was not statistically correlated with total delay time. One study found that in patients traveling from distances all over 40 miles away, there was no difference in surgical outcomes between patients who travelled by car, ambulance, or helicopter.

### Testicular torsion and ultrasound-assisted manual detorsion [^240b93db]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion is a medical emergency that requires an immediate and multidisciplinary approach from emergency, surgical, and radiological services. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge and growing value of ultrasound (US) for intravaginal testicular torsion diagnosis and our experience with manual testicular detorsion with US assistance. Testicular torsion requires prompt and accurate diagnosis and quick therapeutic action. Technological advances in US equipment and knowledge of this pathology place the radiologist in an excellent position for its diagnosis and management. During the same medical procedure, the radiologist can both confirm the intravaginal testicular torsion and attempt manual testicular detorsion. US-assisted manual testicular detorsion is a non-invasive, simple, quick, safe, and effective manoeuvre that can rapidly restore testicular blood flow, maximising testicular salvage, relieving the patient's symptoms, and facilitating surgery.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^ae7b76da]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion (TT) is a urologic emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention. In rural Appalachia, patients are often transferred from surrounding communities due to lack of urologic care. We hypothesized that those transferred would have delayed intervention and higher rates of orchiectomy when compared to those who presented directly to our hospital.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patient charts with an ICD-9 diagnosis of TT from 2008 to 2016. Patients met inclusion criteria if diagnosis was confirmed by operative exploration. We compared rate of testicular loss and time until surgical intervention between groups.

Results

Twenty-three patients met inclusion criteria (12 transferred, 11 direct). Patient demographics did not significantly differ between groups. Transferred patients had a higher orchiectomy rate (33% v 22%, p = 0.41) although this was not statistically significant. Time to surgery from symptom onset was significantly longer in those transferred (12.9 h) compared to those not transferred (6.9 h, p = 0.02). Distance of transfer was not correlated with time of delay (r² = 0.063).

Conclusions

Transferred patients with TT have numerically higher rates of orchiectomy which may reach significance in an appropriately powered study, and relative delays in surgical intervention. This study highlights the need for improved access to urologic care in rural areas.

### Familial testicular torsion: a meta analysis suggests inheritance [^25c57cde]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Familial occurrence of testicular torsion has been infrequently reported. To date, no systematic analysis has been published. We systematically analyzed the literature to elucidate the epidemiology, presentation, management, and whether the observed prevalence of testicular torsion in families is consistent with absence of inheritance and is randomly distributed.

Patients and Methods

We searched electronic databases using keywords "testicular torsion", "spermatic cord torsion", "familial torsion" and "sibling torsion". Reports with genetically related first degree relatives were included in the analysis. Levene's nonparametric test was used to compare the variance of the age of presentation within families to that between different families to differentiate between familial predisposition and chance events.

Results

Up to 10% of patients with testicular torsion have an affected first degree relative. We were able to reject the null hypothesis that the observed prevalence of testicular torsion is due to chance (p < 0.001). Family history is missed in at least 27% of affected families. There is a high incidence of bilateral testicular torsion in families (37%) and probands (17%) and a high concordance rate for bilaterality among monozygous twins.

Conclusions

Current evidence from clinical and animal studies suggests the presence of a genetically determined component in familiar testicular torsion. Increased awareness may lead to earlier clinical presentation and higher testicular salvage rates.

### How do they get here: does the method of transportation impact salvage for patients with testicular torsion? [^2b9c524f]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A growing number of patients are arriving at our tertiary care center for evaluation of possible testicular torsion using ambulance or helicopter transport. In many cases the parents arrive by car before the patient arrives. Are these advanced methods of medical transport worth the expense and risk in the case of suspected testicular torsion?

Objective

We evaluated the total number of patients presenting to our emergency room for suspected testicular torsion to see if the means of transport affected testicular survival.

Study Design

Retrospective.

Results

As shown below in the table, the means of transport did not impact on testicular salvage.

Discussion

It is understandable that many patients with scrotal pain seek treatment closer to home because of their pediatrician's recommendation and/or family preference. However once evaluated many patients are transferred because of a lack of urologists willing to evaluate and treat the pediatric patients in community settings or because of a lack of anesthesia support. These patients are often transported by ambulance or helicopter. Our data would suggest that there is no improvement in the testicular salvage rate seen with these more advanced means of medical transportation compared with transfer by private car even when we restrict the analysis to patients traveling from over 40 miles away. We suspect that important time is lost while waiting to make such transfer arrangements. Furthermore transfer by ambulance or helicopter is more expensive and these costs are often passed on to families. Transfer by helicopter is also riskier. While an argument can be made in favor of medical transport over long distances or long driving times, this data suggests that many of these transfers could be accomplished by car with no effect on testicular salvage rates.

Conclusion

The rate of testicular salvage was not affected by the means of transport to our tertiary facility. Only 4 patients would have required advanced of medical transport if this were limited to those facilities over 100 miles or 1.5 hours driving time away. This would achieve a substantial cost savings with no measurable change in outcome.

### Factors determining testicular torsion and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients presenting with scrotal pain [^957dd716]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Immediate surgical correction can prevent testicular damage, whereas delayed management of TT increases the rate of orchiectomy. If TT is strongly suspected, DUS is a rapid, safe, noninvasive, and repeatable modality for assessing the testicular architecture and blood flow in all patients presenting to a PED with SP. Decreased or absent TUBF was detected in children with TT,– and the use of DUS in the PED helped physicians to diagnose TT accurately.–

Twelve patients with SP underwent scrotal exploration without finding TT. Their clinical condition strongly suggested TT, including a painful testis and inguinal swelling and peritestis turbid fluid on DUS. Surgery to confirm TT is still essential and should be recommended when TT is strongly suspectedto prevent irreversible ischemic changes in TT. –

The rate of orchiectomy was 38.9% in the patients with TT, which is similar to other studies (32%–64%). The rates of orchiectomy and orchiopexy were high in older patients (aged 10–18 years) and involved the left testicle, for which TT was more common. Longer intervals between SP onset and PED arrival and between SP onset and surgery were associated with orchiectomy. Testicular salvageability in torsion cases depends on the interval between the onset of SP and surgical intervention. Testicular salvage with orchiopexy was more common in TT patients with a short interval between SP onset and surgery, especially less than 6 hours. Orchiectomy for TT was associated with a longer interval between SP onset and surgery if the interval is more than 6 hours, especially more than 24 hours. Orchiectomy was significantly correlated with a greater degree of TT (P < 0.001). The rates of orchiectomy and TS with orchiopexy in pediatric patients with TT did not differ seasonally in our study. We found that a longer interval between SP onset and PED arrival and an interval between SP onset and surgery of more than 6 hours were related to orchiectomy in children with TT, rather than the interval between triage and surgery, which did not differ between the orchiectomy and TS with orchiopexy groups. This is different from previous reports. – Additional large studies of children with TT are required to confirm these results.

### Pediatric high-risk conditions [^fea4ed5c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Meningitis, appendicitis, and testicular torsion are among the most common conditions resulting in malpractice litigation in Pediatric Emergency Medicine. With meningitis, most litigation claims involved patients < 2 years old. Notably, 25% of patients had no fever and many lacked classic signs of meningitis. For appendicitis, nearly 3/4 of litigated cases claimed delayed/missed diagnosis. A non-diagnostic ultrasound (eg, no appendix visualized) has a negative predictive value of only 86%. Finally, testicular torsion carries a 34–42% testicular loss rate and 10% of patients with torsion only present with isolated abdominal pain. Atypical presentations must be considered and clear return precautions are imperative.

### Testicular loss in children due to incorrect early diagnosis of torsion [^371bb6cf]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background. Testicular torsion is a common surgical emergency in children that requires a high index of suspicion, early diagnosis, and exploration. Most children present early to their primary pediatricians or physicians. The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the surgical outcome of testicular torsion with early as well as delayed presentation or referral at our pediatric surgical unit. Methods. Records of 50 patients who presented with testicular torsion at our pediatric surgical unit over the span of 10 years (2007–2017) were reviewed retrospectively. The duration and characteristics of symptoms, initial consultation with primary care health professional, time duration between the initial consultation and referral to a tertiary care center, clinical findings prior to surgery, and operative findings were noted. Results. Fifty patients were in the age group ranging from 38 days to 18 years. All the patients consulted the primary care health professionals within 3 to 6 hours after the onset of testicular pain. The patients presented to our hospital within the range of 3.5 hours to 10 days of onset of initial symptoms. Out of 50 patients who presented to our hospital with torsion testis, 45 (90%) patients underwent orchidectomy as the testicle was gangrenous and 5 patients underwent orchiopexy as the testicle was viable. Conclusion. The risk of testicular loss is very high if there is delay in the initial diagnosis of testicular torsion. Greater effort in educating the primary health care professionals may reduce this delay. Primary objective of treating the acute scrotum should be prevention of testicular loss than treating symptoms.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^9e8bd94b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — scrotal examination and ultrasound guidance: "Clinicians should perform a thorough scrotal examination in patients with chronic pelvic pain; a scrotal ultrasound may be performed. (Clinical Principle)". A comprehensive genital examination is essential and should include assessment of the scrotum and penis in both standing and supine positions with careful palpation of scrotal structures including testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, and spermatic cord; other causes of scrotal pain should be excluded. Scrotal ultrasound may not be necessary when a comprehensive examination is performed and the diagnosis is unambiguous. In a retrospective analysis of 7,668 scrotal ultrasounds, the majority (80.4%) revealed benign or normal findings, with only 2.2% indicating a necessity for surgery. Nevertheless, when clinical evaluation raises suspicion of an acute surgical pathology and the diagnosis is uncertain, expedient scrotal ultrasound imaging can serve as a useful tool for confirming diagnoses such as testicular mass or torsion.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis revealing realistic outcomes following paediatric torsion of testes [^e67fd854]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Reported testicular loss rates following paediatric testicular torsion often reflect the surgical decision-making process, rather than long-term survival of the testes.

Objectives

We aim to perform systematic analysis and meta-analysis to investigate testicular salvage rates and to assess predictors of long-term viability.

Study Design

Systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines was performed to investigate immediate and long-term (> 12 months) testicular loss rates following torsion in the paediatric population. Literature search and study inclusion were performed by two investigators. A study quality score was derived and attributed to each study. Predictors of testicular loss were described. Proportions meta-analysis was performed with random effects modelling, and testing for heterogeneity.

Results

Twelve studies were includedm, 6 reporting early orchidectomy rates, and 6 reporting long-term outcomes. Study quality was generally low.

Discussion

The mean early testicular loss rate was 39%, whereas meta-analysis revealed late loss to approach 50%. Predictors of outcomes include prehospital symptom duration, location of presentation, transfer to a tertiary centre, social affluence and use of ultrasound prior to diagnosis or transfer.

Conclusions

This study has shown a considerable late testicular loss rate, which must be relayed to families even after testicular salvage. Delay in time to presentation is consistently found to predict poor outcomes.

### ESPR uroradiology taskforce – imaging recommendations in paediatric uroradiology, part VIII: retrograde urethrography, imaging disorder of sexual development and imaging childhood testicular torsion [^1a621877]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Nuclear medicine studies and MRI with perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging are methods that may theoretically be useful in testicular torsion; however, these methods are normally not readily available and will most often cause diagnostic delay, hence are not applicable in the acute setting.

Taking all aspects into account, the imaging algorithm for childhood testicular torsion (Fig. 3) is quite simple. In suspected testicular torsion (after the perinatal period), immediate surgical exploration is advocated when the clinical findings are highly suspicious. In equivocal cases, immediate US should be performed without diagnostic delay by an experienced ultrasonographer. MRI may be an option for complementing the assessment of differential diagnoses such as testicular tumour or undescended testes.

Fig. 3
Recommended imaging of suspected testicular torsion beyond the neonatal age

The algorithm in neonatal torsion (Fig. 4) is slightly different and more controversial. Because of the low prevalence of neonatal torsion there is practically no scientific evidence available regarding imaging and its role in the management of this condition. In neonatal torsion, the testicle is rarely salvageable, except in a few circumstances (e.g. partial torsion or if the torsion occurred during or just after birth and treatment was undertaken immediately). US examination followed by early surgical exploration has therefore become the most generally accepted approach for all cases with non-translucent scrotal swelling. In neonatal torsion, the testicle is often firm on palpation, with some bluish discolouration and lack of a cremasteric reflex. There may be some tenderness or a retracted testicle, but the patient is often asymptomatic. The US examination should be performed with a high-frequency linear transducer (12–18 MHz). The grey-scale findings are the most important because the colour Doppler assessment of a neonatal testicle can be very difficult even when the perfusion is normal. If US demonstrates a unilateral necrotic testis, it may be removed with elective surgery and a contralateral orchidopexy performed simultaneously. If there is bilateral involvement (with reportedly one-third being asynchronous), an immediate exploration is considered justified giving the risk of complete anorchia. In the rare occasion of unilateral disease with US signs of possible viable tissue, based on echogenicity and perfusion of the affected testicle, emergency surgery is also performed. Thus, immediate US should be performed when a neonate presents with non-translucent scrotal swelling, with stratification of further management depending on the US findings.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^65e19eac]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Testicular gray-scale ultrasound is the modality of choice for the imaging evaluation of acute scrotal pain. The presence of intratesticular flow does not exclude testicular torsion. Testicular vascularity can look symmetrical with the contralateral asymptomatic side with preserved arterial and venous flow and still represent testicular torsion. An integral part of the exam is to look for an abrupt change in configuration of cord at the external inguinal ring or in the scrotal sac. The presence of redundant spermatic cord within the scrotum is highly suspicious for testicular torsion. An enlarged epididymal-cord complex representing the torsion knot/pseudomass is more frequently identified at the sonographic examination compared to the more classic whirlpool sign of twisted spermatic cord. Residual flow might be preserved in parts of the cord when the twist is not tight enough to completely obliterate the flow. An astute analysis of the cord and lie of the testis can prevent the overdiagnosis of epididymitis. We encourage the use of simultaneous cine clips of testes side-by-side at the start of the exam to document lie and assess inherent flow. A group discussion among the radiologist, emergency room physician and urologist is recommended for proper management; manual detorsion of the testis might be considered to improve chances of salvage while the patient awaits surgery.

### Do not forget to include testicular torsion in differential diagnosis of lower acute abdominal pain in young males [^9e333300]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Management and outcomes of pediatric patients with testicular torsion initially presenting as acute abdominal pain were evaluated.

Patients and Methods

The case records of 84 children operated on for testicular torsion from January 1999 through May 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Of the total number of operated patients, 9 presented with abdominal pain but without initial scrotal pain, and only they were included in the study. The diagnosis of testicular torsion was made clinically and confirmed by Doppler ultrasound and scrotal exploration.

Results

The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient's scrotum and testicles were not examined during the first evaluation in 6 cases, while in 3 cases the testicles were examined during the first physical examination. At surgery, 4 testes were salvaged, while 5 have been lost because of testicular necrosis. The mean duration of symptoms was 4 h in the group of salvaged testes and 39 h in the orchidectomy group. There were no major complications.

Conclusion

Testicular torsion should always be included in differential diagnosis when evaluating lower abdominal pain in young males. The external genital organs should be examined in every child or adolescent with acute abdominal pain.

We present a 19-year-old man with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and a delayed presentation of testicular torsion. EDS is a rare and heterogeneous condition affecting collagen synthesis and presents multiple difficulties in a surgical setting. Management of this case of testicular torsion was complicated by impaired cognition of the patient, difficulty with intubation, a contralateral undescended testis and postoperative bleeding. We discuss the specific challenges faced in this case of testicular torsion with longstanding ischaemia and perioperative considerations of EDS.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^eaccf800]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

After Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective analysis of patient charts at Ruby Memorial Hospital (RMH) was performed using ICD-9 diagnosis of testicular torsion from 2008 to 2016. For each TT patient, the primary metrics were the surgical outcomes, including rate of orchiectomy between transferred and non-transferred patients, time from symptom onset to presentation, time from symptom onset to surgical intervention, and time from presentation to surgical intervention. We also aimed to characterize laterality of the affected testicle, if imaging was obtained prior to surgical management, and the mean total symptom duration. In TT patients who were transferred from outside facilities, we also aimed to characterize the mode of transfer, the distance of transfer, and relative delay in surgical intervention caused by transfer.

Criteria for inclusion were met if the patient had a diagnosis of testicular torsion that was confirmed by operative exploration. Patients were excluded from the study if suffering from neonatal torsion or if the symptoms were present for over 24 h. Multiple patients were also excluded due to poor documentation of symptom duration.

Patients were separated into those transferred and those who presented directly to our hospital. One hundred and eight patients with testicular torsion were revealed from the ICD-9 search and of those, 23 met inclusion criteria. Twelve patients were transferred from another hospital and sent to RMH due to lack of urologic care at outside facilities and 11 of these patients presented directly to RMH.

Graphpad and Microsoft Excel were utilized for statistical analysis. Normal distribution of data was confirmed using the Shapiro Wilk test. Statistical analyses performed include chi-squared tests for categorical variable data and two-tailed simple t-tests for continuous variable data. Statistical significance was determined by a threshold p value < 0.05.

Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate the scrotum because of its high resolution, Doppler capabilities, availability, and lack of ionizing radiation. Acute urologic emergencies diagnosed with ultrasound include testicular torsion, testicular rupture, and Fournier gangrene. The radiologist's knowledge of sonographic features of vascular, infectious, traumatic, and benign and malignant processes that occur in the scrotum coupled with the patient's presenting symptoms, age, and physical examination allows for the correct diagnosis of a wide spectrum of scrotal pathology.

### Retrospective review of diagnosis and treatment in children presenting to the pediatric department with acute scrotum [^994a41e9]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Testicular torsion is a common acute condition in boys requiring prompt accurate management. The objective of this article was to evaluate ultrasound accuracy, findings, and clinical predictors in testicular torsion in boys presenting to the Stollery pediatric emergency department with acute scrotal pain.

Methods

Retrospective review of surgical and emergency department ultrasound records for boys from 1 month to 17 years old presenting with acute scrotal pain from 2008 to 2011 was performed. Clinical symptoms, ultrasound and surgical findings, and diagnoses were recorded. Surgical results and follow-up were used as the reference standard.

Results

Of 342 patients who presented to the emergency department with acute scrotum, 35 had testicular torsion. Of 266 ultrasound examinations performed, 29 boys had torsion confirmed by surgery. The false-positive rate for ultrasound was 2.6%, and there were no false-negative findings. Mean times from presentation at the emergency department to ultrasound and surgery were 209.4 and 309.4 minutes, respectively. Of the torsed testicles, 69% were salvageable. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for testicular torsion were 100%, 97.9%, and 98.1%, respectively. Sonographic heterogeneity was seen in 80% of nonviable testes at surgery and 58% of patients with viable testes (p = 0.41). Sudden-onset scrotal pain (88%), abnormal position (86%), and absent cremasteric reflex (91%) were most prevalent in torsion patients.

Conclusion

Color Doppler ultrasound is accurate and sensitive for diagnosis of torsion in the setting of acute scrotum. Despite heterogeneity on preoperative ultrasound, many testes were considered to be salvageable at surgery. The salvage rate of torsed testes was high.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^dcd34fa5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute epididymitis — diagnostic considerations and testing: For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available, and ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord; although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis and a negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following point-of-care (POC) tests: Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating ≥ 2 WBCs per oil immersion field, positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine, or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF. All suspected cases should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT, and urine is the preferred specimen for NAAT for men; urine cultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are insensitive and are not recommended, whereas urine bacterial cultures should also be performed for all men to evaluate for the presence of genitourinary organisms and to determine antibiotic susceptibility.

### Testicular torsion revisited [^699d7e83]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is routinely used for the assessment and diagnosis of testicular torsion. It has proven to be a reliable and necessary diagnostic tool for the urologist. Problems, however, can arise in the form of misdiagnosis when the basic pathophysiology and clinical presentation of testicular torsion are not clearly understood. In this pictorial review, we present the spectrum of the appearance of testes with testicular torsion. This includes both complete and incomplete torsion. The critical use of Doppler and the interpretation of the Doppler findings will be presented. Other abnormalities that can be potentially confused with testicular torsion, including epididymitis and orchitis, will be shown. An approach to assessing the testis that stresses the critical role of both Doppler examination and an understanding of the clinical presentation will be presented. In particular, in incomplete torsion, a Doppler examination will still demonstrate flow to the testis, potentially leading to a missed diagnosis if the clinical presentation is not considered. Examples of normal and abnormal anatomy will be presented.

### Concurrent testicular torsion and acute incarcerated inguinal hernia in an adolescent boy [^0a39739d]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion and acute incarcerated inguinal hernia are both common surgical emergencies in the paediatric population. We present the unusual case of a 16-year-old adolescent boy who presented with both of these conditions concurrently. He had a history of a right inguinal hernia, but ultrasound confirmed a testicular torsion and we employed manual detorsion in the emergency department prior to taking him to the operating room. We successfully salvaged the testicle in addition to performing inguinal hernia reduction and repair. The goal of this report is to emphasise the importance of maintaining a broad differential and early utilisation of ultrasound in the patient with acute groin pain.

### Contralateral orchiopexy during pediatric testicular torsion management: what are the national practice patterns? [^4dcf4d8c]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Evidence-based guidelines for contralateral orchiopexy during testicular torsion surgery are lacking. We aim to evaluate the rates of contralateral orchiopexy at time of testicular torsion surgery.

Material and Methods

Utilizing Kids Inpatient Database, we performed a retrospective cohort study of children < 18 years old who had surgery for testicular torsion from 2016 to 2019. Patients were identified using the ICD10 testicular torsion diagnosis code. Primary outcome was the rate of contralateral orchiopexy. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated patient and hospital factors associated with contralateral orchiopexy.

Results

We identified 1544 children who had surgery for testicular torsion. Of the 531 patients who underwent ipsilateral orchiopexy, 170 (32%) did not have concurrent contralateral orchiopexy. Of the 528 patients who underwent orchiectomy, 186 patients (35%) did not have concurrent contralateral orchiopexy. Overall, 1188/1544 (76.9%) children underwent bilateral orchiopexy, and 356/1544 (23.1%) did not undergo contralateral fixation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that increased patient age was associated with decreased likelihood of having a contralateral orchiopexy (OR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.94–0.98], p < 0.01). Patients having surgery at Western region (OR = 0.50, 95% CI [0.34–0.73], p < 0.01), private non-profit (OR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.39–0.92], p < 0.02) and private investor owned (OR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.35–0.95], p < 0.03) hospitals were less likely to have a contralateral orchiopexy.

Conclusions

We observed that roughly a quarter of children having surgery for testicular torsion do not undergo a contralateral orchiopexy. Increasing patient age, surgery in Western region hospital, and private hospital, were associated with decreased likelihood of contralateral orchiopexy.

### Imaging of the scrotum in children [^dd4cfab4]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical examination of the scrotum is difficult due to the small size of the testes and the epididymis in infants and young children, and eliciting patients' history is challenging. Therefore imaging of the scrotum in childhood bears great importance. Ultrasound is the standard imaging technique of choice providing the clinicians with a definitive diagnosis in most cases. However, in conditions of testicular torsion and epididymoorchitis — the most common differential diagnosis of scrotal pain — ultrasound findings can be inconclusive and further evaluation is required. Since there is a large overlap between paediatric and adult pathology, differences from adults in anatomy and pathology must be considered when evaluating the paediatric scrotum.

### Testicular torsion in a 68-year-old man [^be7381f0]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is a rare, yet often underrecognized, cause of scrotal pain in adult men. Few reports have commented on testicular torsion in the geriatric population. We report a case of a 68-year-old man initially diagnosed with epididymo-orchitis, who, on surgical exploration, was found to have intravaginal testicular torsion. The diagnosis in this patient population is often delayed, leading to poor salvage rates. The use of color Doppler ultrasonography should be strongly considered if the history and physical examination is suggestive of testicular torsion, regardless of patient age.

### Simultaneous testicular and appendix testis torsion: a novel clinically relevant association [^e6d9e619]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Torsion of the appendix testis (TAT) and testicular torsion (TT) are the most common causes of acute scrotum in the pediatric population. They usually present as separate conditions and have distinct managements. We report a unique case of a 16-year-old boy with concomitant TAT and TT. The role of TAT as a trigger factor to TT is addressed, and its clinical repercussion on the management of acute scrotum is discussed.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^425ebfd9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) — definition, burden, presentation, and evaluation are described as follows: "CSCP or chronic testicular pain or chronic orchialgia is defined as unilateral scrotal pain interfering with activities of daily living that has persisted for greater than three months of time", and it "is usually diagnosed after excluding other potential causes (e.g., testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, abscess, testicular mass, varicocele)". The condition's impact is noted as "CSCP constitutes approximately 2.5% to 4.8% of all urology visits and is believed to affect over 100,000 men annually". Patients often have tenderness and neuropathic features: "The pain is commonly described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord appreciated on physical examination", and "Neuropathic changes such as hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia in the region of the groin may accompany these findings", with a fluctuating course — "The pain typically waxes and wanes". Care "requires a multi-disciplinary approach to management", and "Managing patient expectations through supportive counseling during this path is important to overall success". For workup, "potential underlying causes should be ruled out with a thorough physical exam and detailed history", and examples include "post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS), post-inguinal hernia repair, pain caused by trauma, after abdominal surgery, radiation, and radicular pain from spinal or sacral issues".

### Door to detorsion time determines testicular survival [^5e1a4828]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the importance of the duration of in-hospital management of patients with testicular torsion for testes survival. The time from onset of symptoms until surgery is a well-known factor determining testicular survival but there is no data regarding the contribution of in-hospital management duration to testicular survival. Unlike the time from onset of symptoms until seeking medical attention, the time from registration to the emergency department (ED) to the time of detorsion-"Door To Detorsion time" (DTD) is dependent on medical providers and should be minimized.

Materials and Methods

Data was retrieved on all patients who underwent surgery for testicular torsion in 1994–2014 (N = 219). We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine independent association between DTD time or duration of symptoms to testicular survival.

Results

Median DTD time was 135 minutes (range 23–546). Among patients with a viable testis, median DTD time was 107 minutes (range 35–381) compared to 160 minutes (range 23–546) among patients with a nonviable testis (P < .001). Logistic regression models showed that both DTD time (P = 0.04) and duration of symptoms (P < .001) are independent factors associated with testicular survival. Adjusted odds ratio was 1.0048 for a nonviable testis for every minute of delayed management in the ED (P = 0.04). Results suggest that every 10 minutes of delay in the ED increases the chance of having a nonviable testis in exploration by 4.8%.

Conclusion

DTD is an independent factor predicting testicular survival. Institutional efforts should be made to decrease duration of DTD. DTD should be considered as a measure for quality of care.

### Neonatalinfection in twins: clinical spectrum and management dilemma [^7687cccb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Scrotal abscess is effectively managed with incision and drainage, and a course of antibiotics specific to the infectious agent. Gram-positive bacteria is usually implicated, but abscesses due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli and Candida albicans have been reported. Abscess due to E. coli, as was the case here, appears extremely rare, with only four reported cases in the literature. Even if the testicle appears severely inflamed, necrosis is rare and the testicle can usually be salvaged. The postoperative course in our case was uncomplicated and the patient completed treatment without sequelae.

Healthcare practitioners should be vigilant in identifying neonates at risk of EOS, as early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality. In a case of sibling of a patient with EOS in multigestation pregnancy, careful consideration of risk factors is warranted when deciding empiric investigation and treatment of an asymptomatic neonate. Finally, in the uncommon case of acute scrotal swelling in the neonatal period, although it is a surgical emergency due to risk of testicular torsion, infection is also an important differential diagnosis.

Learning points

Early-onset neonatal sepsis is a condition with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Healthcare providers should be aware of the maternal and other risk factors and act early to treat empirically when it is suspected.
Vertical transmission is the usual source of bacteria, causing early-onset sepsis. Close monitoring of asymptomatic siblings of patients with sepsis in multigestational pregnancy is necessary and should have a low threshold for investigation and intervention.
Awareness of diversity of Escherichia coli clinical presentations is essential for the healthcare practitioners as it will guide the antibacterial treatment.
Scrotal abscess is a rare finding in neonates but should be considered on the differential for acute scrotal swelling in the neonatal period; however, urgent surgery is still required as testicular torsion usually cannot be ruled out clinically.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^ca9fe144]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
Sonographic protocol for suspected testicular torsion

Swollen epididymis and testis with testicular flow that is only minimally decreased, normal, or increased in boys with incomplete or intermittent testicular torsion can mimic epididymo-orchitis. The most common cause of acute scrotal pain in children is torsion of appendix testis, which can also mimic epididymo-orchitis. Therefore it is important to evaluate for the presence of avascular nodule that might represent the torsed appendage (Fig. 8; videos 9, 10 and 11, online supplementary material). Any time a child presents with acute scrotal pain, and findings resembling epididymitis without findings of torsed appendage, testicular torsion should be excluded. Suspicion of intermittent or incomplete testicular torsion should be raised in a child with a history of recurrent epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, or abrupt pain that resolved or decreased at the time of diagnosis.

### Real-world management of testicular torsion: level of adherence to the EAU pediatric urology guidelines [^8aa766cb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion is the most frequent cause of irreversible ischemia to the testis. Despite guidelines being available, challenges remain in both diagnosis and management of the disease.

Objective

This study aims to determine the adherence of urologists and residents in urology to the European Association of Urology (EAU) Pediatric Guideline on Testicular torsion.

Study Design

Both Dutch and European urologists, and residents in urology filled in a survey on testicular torsion. Information on demographics, diagnostics, and treatment modalities was retrieved from the questionnaire based on the EAU Guideline on Paediatric Urology.

Results

A total of 303 responders participated, of which 214 (71%) were from The Netherlands. Most (61%) responders treated three or more cases of testicular torsion in 2020. Ultrasound was used by 64%, followed by an attempt of manual detorsion by 38% (Summary Fig.). Importantly, 23% preferred not to perform emergency surgery after successful manual detorsion. A Winkelmann procedure was performed by 23%, without fixation of the test is using suture material. A large group of responders (30%) only fixed the contralateral testis by a proven testicular torsion.

Discussion

A feasible adherence to the EAU Guideline on Paediatric Urology in treating testicular torsion was reported using this survey, although not all recommendations are implemented as proposed. The fact that outcomes of the different diagnostic and treatment modalities are lacking might be a limitation in interpreting the results of this survey.

Conclusion

Majority of the responders followed the EAU Guideline on Paediatric Urology in the diagnosis and treatment of testicular torsion. Ultrasound might contribute to diagnosing testicular torsion as long as this does not cause any delay for surgical exploration. Surprisingly, many urologists do not perform a surgical fixation of the testis after detorsion. Since a wide range of techniques and materials is used in case of surgical fixation, the guideline may provide in preferences for a unified policy among urologists.

### Testicular ultrasound [^f0ab76f5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Acute scrotal pain makes up approximately 0.5% of all complaints presenting to an emergency department. Some of the most com-mon diagnoses for this complaint are testicular torsion and epididymitis. Misdiagnosing testicular torsion can lead to organ loss, cosmetic deformity, and compromised fertility. Modem ultrasound examination of the scrotum is the test of choice for acute scrotal pathology and yields high accuracy compared with surgical exploration. A key component of the testicular examination is use of power and spectral Doppler ultrasonography. Examination of the acute scrotum should not be undertaken unless Doppler capability is available because the evaluation of blood flow is such an important part of diagnosis of testicular torsion, orchitis, epididymitis, trauma, and hemorrhage into a mass.

### Pediatric testicular torsion: does patient transfer affect time to intervention or surgical outcomes at a rural tertiary care center? [^f23c037b]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

These results imply that patients who live in rural areas may have an increased likelihood to face negative outcomes than patients who live in close enough proximity to a facility with adequate care. This is in conjunction with other studies about delays in care for patients in rural settings. In a study assessing the health status of cancer survivors in rural areas versus urban areas throughout the United States, patients who lived in rural areas were more likely to have poor outcomes including additional comorbidities, worse overall physical and mental health, difficulties with maintaining jobs due to their health. Similar data has been shown for trauma patients where individuals who experience traumas in rural areas have a 50% higher mortality than individuals in urban areas. In a retrospective study looking at prehospital causes of rural fatality rates following motor vehicle crashes in Alabama, it was found that longer emergency medical service response time, longer time on the scene, and longer distances to travel to the scene were all associated with increased mortality in rural trauma patients. Individuals from rural areas face challenges of difficult travel, lack of access to health care facilities, and lack of access to specialty care.

This study demonstrated that patients with testicular torsion who transferred from an outside facility prior to presentation at RMH had higher rates of orchiectomy, relative delays in surgical care, less follow up care, and longer times to receive follow up care. This study also highlights the prevalence of delays in diagnosis and presentation, which could be due to gaps in primary care recognition of this urologic emergency.

Delays in management of testicular torsion can result in life long complications and adverse outcomes for individuals affected. In addition to its retrospective design, limitations of the study also include small sample size. However, inclusion and exclusion criteria were formed to be as specific as possible to minimize bias from confounding factors. Future studies may be aimed at looking at testicular torsion patients in rural Appalachia as a whole. This study highlights the need for streamlined access to prompt urologic care in rural areas to minimize the morbidity associated with delay.

### Testicular torsion: direction, degree, duration and disinformation [^71aad82a]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed and contrast with the literature the cumulative clinical experience at our pediatric urological division in the last 20 years with managing testicular torsion, focusing specifically on the direction and degree of testicular torsion and the duration of symptoms before presentation. We also addressed the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, role of manual detorsion, residual torsion and incidence of atrophy.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 200 consecutive males 18 months to 20 years old who underwent surgical exploration by a pediatric urologist for a diagnosis of testicular torsion between 1980 and 2000.

Results

Of 186 nonelective explorations symptoms were localized to the left side in 52% and to the right side in 48%. Information on the direction and degree of testicular rotation was available in 162 of 186 cases (87%) and anticipated medial rotation occurred in only 108 (67%). Lateral rotation in 54 of 162 cases (33%) occurred in 28 of 84 (33%) with left torsion and in 26 of 78 (33%) with right torsion. A median of 540 degrees of torsion (range 180 to 1,080) was noted in the 70 orchiectomy cases (38%) and a median of 360 degrees (range 180 to 1,080) was noted in the 116 salvaged testes (62%). Manual detorsion was attempted in 53 orchiopexy cases with residual torsion in 17 (32%). Testicular atrophy developed in 27% of the patients.

Conclusions

The traditional teaching that testicular torsion occurs primarily in the medial direction is misleading since in a third of cases it occurs in the lateral direction. While manual detorsion should be guided by response and return of normal anatomy, surgical exploration remains necessary since residual torsion still poses a risk to testicular viability. Long-term followup is warranted to assess the true incidence of subsequent atrophy after the management of acute testicular torsion.

Relationship between delays of care and transfer distances in patients transferred from outside facilities to RMH

Approximately 83% of patients who transferred from another facility received follow up care and 91% of patients who presented directly to RMH received follow up care. The mean number of days to receive follow up care in patients who were transferred was 171 days. The mean number of days to receive follow up care in patients who presented directly to RMH was 71 days. There was not a statistically significantly difference in number of follow up days between the two patient groups (p = 0.49).

### Testicular infarction becoming apparent after hernia reduction [^dd930992]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Testicular infarction from an incarcerated inguinal hernia is a rare event in children, often not considered in the initial evaluation.

Objective

To report a case that describes the presentation, diagnosis, and management of testicular infarction in the setting of an incarcerated inguinal hernia.

Case Report

A 2-month old boy was brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by his parents for vomiting, crying, and a left-sided scrotal swelling. An inguinal hernia was manually reduced successfully in the ED. Subsequently, scrotal ultrasound with color Doppler was obtained, demonstrating no blood flow to the left testis. The patient underwent a left orchiectomy and right orchiopexy with hernia repair.

Discussion

Testicular injury can occur from torsion due to the effect of an incarcerated hernia or due to ischemia from cord compression. Delay in diagnosis and surgery risks testicular viability, therefore, surgery should not be delayed for imaging in the presence of strong suspicion of torsion.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of testicular torsion is not always straightforward because many conditions may have a similar clinical presentation or may compromise testicular blood supply. This case is an unusual presentation of testicular infarction in the setting of an incarcerated inguinal hernia.

### Ultrasound-guided manual testicular detorsion in the emergency department [^859a731b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Scrotal ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of complete testicular torsion and assessment of alternative causes of acute scrotal pain. Early detection of torsion of the testis and reperfusion, either manually or surgically, is paramount to preserving testicular viability. Manual detorsion also offers immediate symptom relief by alleviating ischemia. Bedside ultrasound performed by a trained emergency physician (EP) can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis and reperfusion by means of performing an ultrasound-guided manual detorsion in the emergency department (ED).

Case Report

We report two cases of ultrasound-guided manual detorsion of testis that were performed successfully by EPs in the ED. After manual detorsion, both patients underwent nonemergent orchidopexy and recovered well after surgery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Manual testicular detorsion is a simple, safe, and effective maneuver that can be performed in the ED by EPs. Bedside ultrasound is helpful in confirming the diagnosis of complete torsion of the testicle (no blood flow) and successful reperfusion after manual detorsion. We recommend EPs be trained to perform scrotal ultrasound and manual detorsion of a torted testicle. We strongly emphasize that manual detorsion of the testes is not a substitute for definitive surgical management and should only be used as a temporary measure for reperfusion to allow more time to organize the logistics of surgery, which can be critical in remote settings.

### Factors determining testicular torsion and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients presenting with scrotal pain [^84da2855]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion (TT) is a severe cause of scrotal pain (SP) in children, accounting for 1/4 to 1/3 of pediatric patients presenting with an SP. Testicular torsion must be distinguished from SP of other etiologies – because TT/detorsion is an ischemia–reperfusion process of the testis, which is a time-critical urological emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and surgical intervention. – The annual incidence of TT is approximately from 3.5 to 25 per 100,000 person-years for boys aged younger than 18 years. Two peaks of the age-specific incidence are in young children and adolescents,–; the incidence decreases after age 18 years.

Testicular torsion may lead to testicular ischemic necrosis and permanent testicular damage or consequent orchiectomy in 32% to 64% of patients if testicular blood reperfusion is impaired. The probability of testis salvage (TS) decreases to less than 10% if TT persists for more than 24 hours. To prevent irreversible ischemic changes in TT, prompt evaluation and intervention are crucial in patients presenting with SP. –

Increasing age is a risk factor for orchiectomy due to TT. However, little is known about other factors associated with TT and consequent orchiectomy in children with SP at pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Therefore, we evaluated factors associated with TT and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients who presented with SP at a PED.

### Leveraging NSQIPP testicular torsion process measures: initial survey of the NSQIPP testicular torsion collaborative [^5261b4d4]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular torsion is a pediatric emergency that poses a time-sensitive risk to the testicle. Best practices for testicular torsion protocols remain unclear. We convened the Testicular Torsion Collaborative, leveraging National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIPP) Testicular Torsion Process Measure collection to assess factors associated with favorable metrics.

Methods

Data were accrued across 29 participating NSQIPP sites, excluding neonatal and non-urgent cases. Post-processed data available through NSQIPP included site of initial presentation and time stamps for presentation, ultrasound, and operating room entry; number of cases greater than the NSQIPP median for each time stamp; and orchiectomy rate. Hospital level data and torsion-related care processes were collected from each participating site via an electronic survey.

Results

From 10/1/2021 to 9/30/22, 1007 testicular torsion patients were included, with 494 (49.1%) transferred from another institutions. A standardized evaluation protocol was associated with fewer patients exceeding the NSQIPP median from presentation to ultrasound (38.8% vs 60%, p = 0.03). Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score use was associated with a shorter time frame from presentation to ultrasound (0.7 vs 1.1 h, p = 0.03). Free-standing children's hospitals (p > 0.01) and institutions with an American College of Surgeons Children's Surgery Verification (p = 0.03) also demonstrated improved time to ultrasound. Overall orchiectomy rate was 15.8% and there were no statistical differences noted across the study variables.

Conclusions

Across a wide spectrum of hospitals within NSQIPP, we demonstrate that certain torsion-related processes and hospital-level factors are associated with faster times to ultrasound. The NSQIPP Testicular Torsion Collaborative will continue to explore interventions to improve testicular torsion care and outcomes.

### An uncommon cause of testicular infarct: a case report and review of the literature of testicular infarcts from laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair [^7af8ee21]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Testicular ischemia requires timely diagnosis and definitive management to avoid serious consequences such as orchiectomy. It is almost always caused by testicular torsion; however, there are other causes to be aware of.

Case Report

A 32-year-old man developed testicular ischemia following a laparoscopic robotic-assisted inguinal hernia repair with preperitoneal mesh. The ischemia progressed to a fully infarcted testicle with no evidence of torsion on subsequent surgical exploration. He ultimately did require an orchiectomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? While extremely rare, testicular ischemia or infarct must be considered in patients presenting with testicular pain shortly after inguinal hernia repair. Emergent surgical evaluation and loosening of the hernia mesh may be required to salvage the testicle.

### First pediatric case of spermatic cord fibrolipoma: case report and literature review [^8a0da0d5]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this first reported pediatric case of spermatic cord fibrolipoma, we underscore that a rare, benign paratesticular tumor can present with acute scrotal symptoms, closely mimicking emergent pathologies like testicular torsion. Prompt surgical intervention remains crucial when torsion or incarceration cannot be excluded, yet avoiding unnecessary orchiectomy is equally important. Histopathologic confirmation is vital to accurately distinguish fibrolipomas from other potentially malignant tumors and guide appropriate management. Looking ahead, improved imaging techniques (e.g. MRI with fat suppression) and a structured approach to immunohistochemical analysis may further reduce diagnostic uncertainties, refine treatment decisions, and safeguard testicular viability in pediatric and adult patients.

Patient perspective

The patient and their parents were notified. Their opinions on the diagnostic and treatment procedures were solicited. The subjects reported experiencing significant concern regarding the pain in the testicle during the application process and the decision to proceed with immediate surgical intervention. However, these concerns diminished upon learning that no intervention would be necessary for the testicle post-surgery. They hoped the mass would not be malignant, a sentiment confirmed upon receiving the pathology report. The subjects subsequently experienced complete relief and reported no issues during subsequent follow-ups.

### Variation in the evaluation of testicular conditions across United States pediatric emergency departments [^a77176b2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore the variation in diagnostic testing and management for males diagnosed with three testicular conditions (testicular torsion, appendix testis torsion, epididymitis/orchitis) using a large pediatric health care database. Diagnostic testing is frequently used in evaluation of the acute scrotum; however, there is likely variability in the use of these tests in the emergency department setting.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of males with the diagnoses of testicular torsion, appendix testis torsion, and epididymitis/orchitis. We identified emergency department patients in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database from 2010 to 2015 using diagnostic and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases Codes 9 and 10. Frequencies of diagnoses by demographic characteristics and of procedures and diagnostic testing (ultrasound, urinalysis, urine culture and sexually transmitted infection testing) by age group were calculated. We analyzed testing trends over time.

Results

We identified 17,000 males with the diagnoses of testicular torsion (21.7%), appendix testis torsion (17.9%), and epididymitis/orchitis (60.3%) from 2010 to 2015. There was substantial variation among hospitals in all categories of testing for each of the diagnoses. Overall, ultrasound utilization ranged from 33.1–100% and urinalysis testing ranged from 17.0–84.9% for all conditions. Only urine culture testing decreased over time for all three diagnoses (40.6% in 2010 to 31.5 in 2015).

Conclusions

There was wide variation in the use of diagnostic testing across pediatric hospitals for males with common testicular conditions. Development of evaluation guidelines for the acute scrotum could decrease variation in testing.
