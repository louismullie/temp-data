## Question

Should patients with recognized OSA admitted to acute care for MI continue receiving CPAP?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with recognized obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who are admitted to acute care for myocardial infarction (MI) should continue or initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy during hospitalization and how to structure post-discharge management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the strength of evidence in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) settings. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines recommend for inpatient PAP in patients with established OSA. Next, I will examine randomized trials and meta-analyses for signals of benefit or harm, especially around adherence thresholds. After that, I need to consider patient selection, risk stratification, and timing of initiation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with attention to feasibility, adherence, and follow-up planning.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the evidence base. OSA is highly prevalent in ACS cohorts, and multiple studies have explored whether treating OSA with CPAP alters cardiovascular outcomes, but the highest-quality randomized evidence in ACS has not shown a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with CPAP, largely due to low adherence and the nonsleepy phenotype of enrolled patients [^11683EmD] [^115wiV6s] [^1114KLKj].

> Wait, let me verify guideline direction before drawing conclusions. The 2025 American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) inpatient guideline issues a conditional recommendation to use positive airway pressure (PAP) for medically hospitalized adults with established moderate-to-severe OSA who are not currently on treatment, with the caveat that clinicians may reasonably decline if PAP would interfere with medical care or if the patient places a higher value on avoiding PAP-related burdens during the hospitalization [^1146pknk]. I should also confirm that for patients already on PAP, continuation during hospitalization is suggested, again as a conditional recommendation with low certainty of evidence, emphasizing individualized judgment and care coordination [^114TKLXi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cardiovascular endpoints. The ISAACC randomized trial in ACS patients with OSA found no significant reduction in a composite of cardiovascular events with CPAP versus usual care over a median 3.35 years, with mean adherence around 2.78 hours per night, which likely attenuated any potential benefit signal [^11683EmD]. Similarly, the SAVE trial in patients with established cardiovascular disease and moderate-to-severe OSA showed no reduction in major cardiovascular events with CPAP, again with modest adherence and predominantly nonsleepy participants [^115wiV6s]. But wait, what if adherence is the key modifier? Multiple meta-analyses and on-treatment analyses suggest that CPAP use of at least 4 hours per night is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced MACE and mortality, although these are observational or adherence-defined subgroups and must be interpreted cautiously due to healthy-adherer bias [^111mBb2y] [^115JkiaS] [^111EW161] [^113N3E1v].

> I need to check whether there are identifiable subgroups where benefit might be more plausible. Post hoc and pooled analyses indicate that patients with high-risk OSA phenotypes — characterized by greater hypoxic burden or heart rate response to apneas — may derive cardiovascular benefit from CPAP, whereas low-risk phenotypes may not benefit or could even have signals of harm, underscoring the need for risk stratification rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^11168phM]. Additionally, observational cohorts suggest that OSA-related nocturnal hypoxemia after MI independently predicts worse outcomes, supporting the biological plausibility that treating hypoxemia with PAP could be beneficial if adherence is sufficient [^111Qqmni] [^117YTfrC].

> Let me consider the acute inpatient phase pragmatically. Even without definitive mortality or MACE benefit in RCTs, inpatient PAP can improve oxygenation, reduce apneas, and potentially mitigate nocturnal sympathetic surges that can destabilize the post-MI course. Thus, continuation of home PAP is reasonable if feasible, and initiation can be considered for newly diagnosed moderate-to-severe OSA after clinical stabilization, balancing patient tolerance and competing clinical priorities [^114TKLXi] [^1146pknk]. I should double-check feasibility issues: very ill patients may have difficulty tolerating PAP, and early experiences influence long-term adherence, so mask/interface selection, humidification, and education are critical during the inpatient window [^115KH6e3] [^1167Nbjj].

> Next, I should review post-discharge planning because inpatient decisions set the trajectory. Guidelines recommend a structured discharge plan to ensure timely diagnostic confirmation, effective PAP therapy, and adherence support, including telemonitoring, education, and linkage to sleep medicine follow-up; this is particularly important in ACS populations where adherence tends to wane without proactive support [^114KiAfh] [^114cF1GG] [^116i9A5Q] [^112uhZM3]. I need to ensure we anticipate barriers: acute illness, sedatives, and new cardiovascular medications can reduce tolerance, and ACE inhibitors have been linked to CPAP intolerance in case reports, so medication reconciliation and symptom management can preserve adherence [^113Fx4aZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is entirely asymptomatic and unlikely to adhere? I should confirm that benefit appears concentrated among those using PAP for at least 4 hours per night; therefore, if the patient is nonsleepy and unwilling or unable to achieve meaningful nightly use, the expected cardiovascular risk reduction is low and shared decision-making should emphasize symptom relief, blood pressure effects, and quality-of-life gains rather than promised event reduction [^111mBb2y] [^115JkiaS] [^111EW161]. Conversely, in symptomatic patients or those with high-risk OSA physiology, a stronger recommendation to pursue and optimize PAP is reasonable, with explicit adherence targets and close follow-up to realize potential cardiovascular benefits [^11168phM] [^113zKF1W].

> I will now examine the timing of initiation. Initiating PAP within the first 24–72 hours after ACS is feasible and was done in ISAACC, but adherence was poor without structured support; therefore, I should confirm that early initiation is paired with education, mask fitting, and a post-discharge adherence plan to avoid early dropout and to translate inpatient starts into sustained use [^11683EmD] [^114KiAfh]. Let me reconsider whether delaying until after discharge improves adherence; evidence is limited, so the balance favors early start with robust support rather than deferral that risks losing momentum [^1146pknk].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows: For patients with established OSA admitted for MI, continue home PAP whenever hemodynamically and clinically feasible, using the patient's usual settings and optimizing comfort and safety. If not already on therapy, consider initiating PAP after clinical stabilization for moderate-to-severe OSA, framed as a conditional inpatient recommendation with shared decision-making about burdens and benefits [^114TKLXi] [^1146pknk]. Post-discharge, implement a structured plan with expedited sleep medicine follow-up, telemonitoring, and adherence interventions to achieve at least 4 hours per night use, recognizing that sustained, adequate adherence is the most consistent predictor of improved outcomes in observational analyses and adherence-defined subgroups [^114KiAfh] [^111mBb2y] [^115JkiaS]. I should confirm that we also screen for high-risk OSA phenotypes and comorbidities such as diabetes, where signals for benefit may be stronger, and tailor counseling accordingly [^11168phM] [^115XNzEQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure we document the rationale and uncertainties. I should explain that RCTs have not shown definitive cardiovascular event reduction with CPAP in ACS, largely due to low adherence and nonsleepy populations, but guidelines support inpatient continuation or initiation with a focus on adherence and post-discharge care, and emerging data suggest benefit in adherent users and in high-risk phenotypes, which justifies a trial of therapy when feasible and patient-centered [^11683EmD] [^115wiV6s] [^114TKLXi] [^1146pknk] [^11168phM].

In general, **continue CPAP during acute MI hospitalization** for patients with known OSA because it improves oxygenation, reduces nocturnal hypoxemia, and may lessen myocardial ischemia, with no clear signal of harm in this setting [^114TKLXi] [^116uVZiG]. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, intubated, or unable to tolerate CPAP, **hold therapy and reassess** as stability improves. There is no high-quality evidence that CPAP reduces recurrent MI or mortality in this acute phase, so decisions should be individualized based on tolerance and clinical status, with close monitoring for discomfort, hemodynamic changes, or respiratory complications [^11683EmD] [^114TKLXi].

---

## Physiological rationale for continuing CPAP during acute MI

Continuing CPAP during acute MI may confer several **physiological benefits**:

- **Improved oxygenation**: CPAP reduces nocturnal hypoxemia, which can exacerbate myocardial ischemia and infarction [^116uVZiG] [^117YTfrC].

- **Reduced sympathetic activity**: CPAP lowers sympathetic tone, potentially decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and arrhythmia risk [^notfound].

- **Enhanced cardiac output**: CPAP can improve cardiac output in heart failure, a common complication of acute MI [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding CPAP use in acute MI

Although direct evidence is limited, **available studies and guidelines** provide useful guidance:

- **American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines**: The AHA recommends screening for OSA in patients with cardiovascular disease and considering CPAP therapy for symptomatic patients, emphasizing symptom relief and potential cardiovascular benefits [^111eCU9d].

- **Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)**: Trials such as the ISAACC study have shown that CPAP does not significantly reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and OSA, but they also do not show increased harm from CPAP use [^11683EmD].

- **Meta-analyses**: Meta-analyses suggest that CPAP may reduce cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and OSA, particularly in those with better adherence to therapy [^115JkiaS] [^115oZkUh].

---

## Potential risks and contraindications

While CPAP is generally safe, **certain situations warrant caution**:

- **Hemodynamic instability**: CPAP may reduce preload and cardiac output, potentially worsening hypotension or shock.

- **Respiratory compromise**: Patients with severe respiratory distress or inability to tolerate CPAP may require alternative ventilatory support.

- **Patient discomfort**: Mask discomfort or anxiety may limit CPAP tolerance, requiring careful patient selection and education.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements provide the following **recommendations**:

- **Continue CPAP**: Patients with known OSA who experience acute MI should generally continue CPAP therapy during hospitalization, provided they are hemodynamically stable and can tolerate it [^114TKLXi].

- **Individualized decision-making**: Decisions to continue or temporarily withhold CPAP should be individualized based on patient stability, tolerance, and clinical judgment [^1146pknk].

- **Monitor closely**: Patients receiving CPAP during acute MI should be closely monitored for hemodynamic changes, respiratory compromise, and discomfort.

---

## Practical considerations for implementing CPAP during acute MI

Implementing CPAP during acute MI requires **careful planning and monitoring**:

- **Patient selection**: Assess hemodynamic stability, respiratory status, and patient tolerance before initiating or continuing CPAP.

- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory status during CPAP therapy.

- **Education**: Educate patients and healthcare staff about the importance of CPAP adherence and potential side effects.

- **Alternative therapies**: Be prepared to use alternative ventilatory support methods if CPAP is not tolerated or contraindicated.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamically stable patient with known OSA | Continue CPAP therapy during acute MI hospitalization |
| Hemodynamically unstable patient or unable to tolerate CPAP | Temporarily withhold CPAP and reassess as stability improves |
| Patient with severe respiratory distress or contraindications to CPAP | Use alternative ventilatory support methods |

---

Patients with known OSA who experience acute MI should generally **continue CPAP therapy** during hospitalization, provided they are hemodynamically stable and can tolerate it. CPAP may improve oxygenation, reduce sympathetic activity, and enhance cardiac output, but decisions should be individualized based on patient stability, tolerance, and clinical judgment. Close monitoring and patient education are essential to ensure safe and effective CPAP use during acute MI.

### Nocturnal hypoxemia due to obstructive sleep apnea is an Independent predictor of poor prognosis after myocardial infarction [^114cGJhm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A potential cardioprotective role of intermittent ischemia from recurrent episodes of apneas during MI via preconditioning has been described. 34 Although reduced myocardial injury verified by cardiac enzyme levels after MI in patients with OSA has been reported, untreated OSA may increase the risk of MI and recurrence of MI. 4 Although survival advantage from even moderately elevated AHI has been seen in several cohorts, especially in older patients, 35 this may be due to ascertainment bias. However, given the paucity of data on this subject, further investigation testing the hypothesis that severe desaturation and reoxygenation can be protective for post‐MI patients is needed.

Strengths of the current study include first, its prospective design. Second is the use of comprehensive, overnight PSG to detect the presence and severity of OSA and hypoxemia by technologists blinded to the follow‐up. Nevertheless, this study has limitations. First, because of the small sample size, we could only address a limited number of clinically relevant variables, which may decrease the generalizability of the prognostic value of nocturnal hypoxemia and OSA. Second, CPAP users were not included in survival analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model because of the limited number of cases. Therefore, prognostic indices such as AHI, nocturnal hypoxemia, or other clinical factors could not be determined in this subgroup. Our data suggest a marked reduction in MACE in those patients receiving CPAP. However, whether CPAP therapy can improve long‐term prognosis in post‐MI patients with OSA is still to be determined. Third, it is possible that the prevalence and severity of OSA may change in the months to years following an MI. 36 Hence, data acquired 7 days after a MI may not be representative of the severity of OSA for all patients over the subsequent 48 months. However, this does not contradict our finding that OSA‐induced hypoxemia, measured early after MI, is an important predictor of MACE over 4 years of follow‐up. Furthermore, it is possible that serial observation by oximetry may provide further information on cardiovascular risk.

### Rationale and methodology of the impact of continuous positive airway pressure on patients with ACS and nonsleepy OSA: the ISAACC trial [^115YHtWY]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and a possible cause of increased morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

The main objective is to determine in patients with ACS and OSA if CPAP treatment reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for unstable angina or transient ischemic attack). The secondary objectives are to determine the prevalence of nonsleepy OSA in patients with ACS; assess the effect of CPAP on the incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, symptoms, and quality of life; identify biomarkers of risk involved in cardiovascular complications in these patients; and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of diagnosis and treatment.

Population and Methodology

Multicenter, prospective, randomized and controlled study. Patients are admitted to the coronary care unit with diagnosis of ACS and without daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≤ 10) at 15 teaching hospitals in Spain. All patients undergo a sleep study by cardiorespiratory polygraphy. Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15/hour will be randomized to treatment with CPAP (group 1, 632 patients) or conservative treatment (group 2, 632 patients). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index < 15/hour (group 3, 600 patients) will be followed as a reference group. Patients will be monitored at baseline (T0), 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), 12 months (T4), and every 6 months thereafter (where applicable) during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

The ISAACC trial will contribute to evaluating the effect of CPAP treatment on cardiovascular events in patients with ACS and OSA.

### Association of obstructive sleep apnea with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^115BG7ri]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Specifically, our results indicate that increased risk in OSA patients was obvious only after 1 year. This may be explained by the fact that patients are under guideline‐based therapy after ACS presentation (especially within 1 year), including intensive antiplatelet therapy and control of blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and glucose, which are also the intermediate mechanisms implicated in OSA. 2 Furthermore, some reports suggested that OSA may play a cardioprotective role in the acute phase of MI. 27 In contrast, OSA may have a chronic deleterious effect in the long run, which was verified in our study showing increased events after 1 year, consistent with previous studies with long‐term follow‐up. 9, 28

According to recent randomized trials and meta‐analysis, treatment of OSA with CPAP may not confer significant cardiovascular benefit among patients with established cardiovascular disease. 29, 30, 31 In a trial that enrolled 224 patients with OSA and coronary artery disease who had undergone revascularization, no difference was found in a composite end point of repeat revascularization, MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death in patients with CPAP versus those without CPAP therapy. The Kaplan–Meier curve suggests that CPAP may be harmful in the first 12 months following randomization, and modest benefits may emerge in the long‐term follow‐up. 29 Specifically, despite recommendations for treatment, the vast majority of patients in our study did not proceed to consideration for CPAP therapy because of unawareness of significance of OSA, a finding also observed in another study of OSA patients after MI. 32 In this case, treatment effects of CPAP for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease still need to be evaluated, especially in a high‐risk group (ACS, MI, etc). Also, the appropriate duration of intervention warrants further investigation, given that any randomized trial of CPAP or other therapy for 1 year or less will be unlikely to demonstrate significant benefit of therapy, given the absence of significant risk associated with OSA within the first year of ACS.

### Effects of continuous positive airway pressure on cardiac events and metabolic components in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis [^115JkiaS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

This meta-analysis aimed to systematically assess the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery disease.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials that compared CPAP with usual care in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea with coronary artery disease. The primary outcomes were MACEs, all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome, rehospitalization for heart failure, repeat revascularization, and arrhythmia.

Results

A total of 11 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 6 observational studies) with 5,410 patients reported outcomes of MACEs. Treatment with CPAP was associated with a modest risk reduction in MACEs (risk ratio [RR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 0.98; p = 0.02). Similarly, CPAP significantly reduced the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death by 23% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99; p = 0.04; I² = 0%). Subgroup analysis revealed that CPAP adherence time ≥ 4hours/night had a greater benefit on MACEs by 42% (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; P < .001; I² = 0%) and repeat revascularization by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.92; p = 0.02; I² = 0%). Also, CPAP had a positive effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusions

CPAP therapy might prevent subsequent MACEs and all-cause death among patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and concomitant coronary artery disease. CPAP use exceeding 4hours/night may add more benefits on MACEs, repeat revascularization, and blood pressure.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m8krz]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Compared to the general population, OSA is more common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), with a reported prevalence of 38% to 65%. Observational studies have shown OSA was associated with increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events in various subsets of CAD patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is recommended for symptomatic patients with OSA, but multiple observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown inconsistent results of CPAP therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with established CAD. Moreover, there is no meta-analysis focusing on patients with concomitant CAD and OSA and evaluating the role of CPAP in preventing recurrent adverse events. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether adding CPAP therapy would improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD and OSA.

### Treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea with positive airway pressure: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112b8jLK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). High credibility.

AASM recommendation strength implications — strong versus conditional: For strong recommendations, clinicians are told that almost all patients should receive the recommended course of action and that adherence to this recommendation could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for patients, almost all should receive the recommended course of action, although a small proportion may not; and for insurance providers, the recommended course of action can be adopted as policy for most situations and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator. For conditional recommendations, most patients should receive the suggested course of action; however, different choices may be appropriate for different patients, with the clinician helping each patient determine appropriateness consistent with values and preferences; for patients, most should receive the suggested course of action, though some may not, and the patient should work with their clinician to determine appropriateness consistent with values and preferences; and for insurance providers, the ultimate judgment regarding the suitability of the suggested course of action must be made by the clinician and patient together based on what is best for the patient, and this decision-making flexibility should be accounted for when establishing policies.

5 CONCLUSION

The use of CPAP, compared to usual care, was associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular outcomes or death in patients with OSA and CAD, particularly in the subgroup with AHI less than 30 events/h. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of CPAP for prevention of cardiovascular outcomes.

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has become the treatment of choice for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Successful therapy with CPAP depends greatly on individual patient acceptance and compliance. Current indications for CPAP, including those for mild obstructive sleep apnea, will need to be revisited when results from the longitudinal follow-up of the Wisconsin Cohort and the Sleep Heart Health Study are made available.

Best Preoperative Practices for Surgical Patients With Known OSA, Adherent or Nonadherent to PAP Therapy, or a High Probability of OSA

In addition to the studies noted previously, 2 recent large retrospective studies suggest potential efficacy of CPAP in patients with diagnosed OSA. In the first study, those patients diagnosed with OSA and provided with a prescription for CPAP therapy before their surgery had a significantly reduced risk for cardiovascular adverse events compared to patients with undiagnosed OSA (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.15–0.77; p = 0.009). Patients with severe OSA or undiagnosed OSA were found to have a significantly increased risk for cardiorespiratory complications.

The second study found that untreated OSA patients had significantly greater cardiopulmonary complication rates compared to those with prescribed PAP therapy (risk-adjusted rates 6.7% vs 4%; adjusted OR = 1.8, P = 0.001). Both myocardial infarction (adjusted OR = 2.6, P = 0.031) and unplanned reintubations (adjusted OR = 2.5, P = 0.003) were significantly greater in untreated OSA patients. These 2 large database studies provide preliminary evidence supporting preoperative diagnosis of OSA and treatment with CPAP therapy.

There are 3 studies, 2 prospective and 1 retrospective, on empiric APAP therapy in the perioperative care of patients with newly diagnosed untreated OSA. Each study reported a different primary outcome: perioperative AHI versus length of stay versus APAP adherence. None of the studies was sufficiently powered to address the impact of APAP on postoperative complications; and in one study, patients with suspected OSA who were at > 10% risk for postoperative cardiac complications as estimated by American College of Physicians criteria were excluded if they had an abnormal overnight oximetry study. The adherence to APAP therapy in these studies was uniformly low. Approximately 45% of patients with newly diagnosed OSA were adherent to APAP therapy in the perioperative period.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk — evidence context: Evidence from observational studies shows independent associations between OSA and CVD events, yet randomized controlled trial data indicate that positive airway pressure (PAP) for OSA on composite CVD events has not demonstrated benefit; practices vary from treating asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients to treating only those with sleepiness, and an evidence-based approach should consider individual patient characteristics for decision making.

A patient with obstructive sleep apnea was admitted to the hospital with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was prescribed upon discharge. She later became intolerant to continuous positive airway pressure therapy, and her adherence to the related device decreased precipitously. The intolerance subsided gradually after a switch in medication to an angiotensin receptor blocker, and her adherence to continuous positive airway pressure device usage returned to baseline after 4 weeks.

Background

Despite the improvement in the prognosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), substantial morbidity and mortality remain. We aimed to evaluate the effect of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and its treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the clinical evolution of patients with ACS.

Methods

We designed a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of patients with ACS at 15 hospitals in Spain. Eligible non-sleepy patients were men and women aged 18 years and older, admitted to hospital for documented symptoms of ACS. All patients underwent respiratory polygraphy during the first 24–72 h after admission. OSA patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CPAP treatment plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (UC group) by a computerised system available 24 h a day. A group of patients with ACS but without OSA was also included as a reference group. Because of the nature of the intervention, the trial intervention could not be masked to either investigators or patients. Patients were monitored and followed for a minimum of 1 year. Patients were examined at the time of inclusion; after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, and 36 months; and every 12 months thereafter, if applicable, during the follow-up period. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of a composite of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or non-fatal events [Acute myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalisations for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack]) in patients followed up for a minimum of 1 year. The primary analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01335087 and is now closed.

Findings

Between April 25, 2011, and Feb 2, 2018, a total of 2834 patients with ACS had respiratory polygraphy, of whom 2551 (90.01%) were recruited. 1264 (49.55%) patients had OSA and were randomly assigned to the CPAP group (n = 633) or the UC group (n = 631). 1287 (50.45%) patients did not have OSA, of whom 603 (46.85%) were randomly assigned to the reference group. Patients were followed up for a median of 3.35 years (IQR 1.50–5.31). The prevalence of cardiovascular events was similar in the CPAP and UC groups (98 events [16%] vs 108 events [17%]; hazard ratio [HR] 0.89 [95% CI 0.68–1.17]; p = 0.40) during follow-up. Mean time of adherence to CPAP treatment was 2.78 h/night (SD 2.73). The prevalence of cardiovascular events was similar between patients in the reference group (90 [15%] events) and those in the UC group (102 (17%) events) during follow-up (1.01 [0.76–1.35]; p = 0.93). The prevalence of cardiovascular events seem not to be related to CPAP compliance or OSA severity. 464 (74%) of 629 patients in the CPAP group had 1538 serious adverse events and 406 (65%) of 626 patients in the UC group had 1764 serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Among non-sleepy patients with ACS, the presence of OSA was not associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular events and treatment with CPAP did not significantly reduce this prevalence.

### Recognized obstructive sleep apnea is associated with improved in-hospital outcomes after ST elevation myocardial infarction [^1146Z83s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Although our results are thought provoking, there are several limitations to our analysis. First, we used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification codes to identify OSA rather than PSG. This almost certainly led to underestimation of the actual prevalence of OSA in our population. The prevalence of 1.3% observed in our cohort is markedly less than the 45% to 65% noted in studies where PSG was used. 23, 24 However, our estimates are similar to other studies using administrative data. 1, 11 Inclusion of potentially undiagnosed patients in our cohort may have pushed the effect toward null. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility of selection bias, wherein only patients with severe symptomatic OSA were captured in our database. We also lack data regarding the treatment status or severity of OSA in our population, both of which might impact our reported outcomes. Last, though we have carried out extensive multivariable adjustment for demographics and comorbid conditions, there is a possibility of unmeasured confounding variables. However, the large size of the data may compensate partly for some of the above‐mentioned limitations.

Methods

Study Populations

We conducted a prospective study of patients admitted for newly diagnosed MI at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The results of baseline assessments have already been published. 7, 20, 21 The diagnosis of MI, made by the attending physician, was defined by the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Committee (2000) criteria for "acute, evolving or recent MI". 22 A total of 121 eligible patients were enrolled consecutively (Figure 1). Twenty‐three patients were excluded from the final analysis: 1 due to a prior diagnosis of OSA that was managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), 1 because of a late final diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and not MI before polysomnography (PSG), 7 patients did not complete PSG testing due to technical, logistical, or clinical reasons, 6 had central sleep apnea, and 8 OSA patients used CPAP after PSG. The final study population consisted of 98 patients who completed overnight PSG within a median of 7 days after MI onset. No patients had acute heart failure at baseline, and only 1 was diagnosed with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all patients signed informed consent.

Management of MI

All patients received standard post‐MI care at the discretion of the attending clinician at Mayo Clinic. Eight patients did not undergo revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) or thrombolysis.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116fLsFx]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, the present meta-analysis is the first attempt to focus on a relatively homogenous group of patients with established CAD. Our findings suggested adding CPAP as a secondary prevention for patients with CAD and concomitant OSA might be beneficial in the long-term follow-up, but this was only shown in observational studies, and not verified in RCTs. The enrolled studies in the prospective and retrospective cohorts were usually conducted more than 10 years ago and had a wide range of follow-up, therefore they do not represent contemporary medical and interventional therapy. Also, the results could be underpowered due to a relatively small sample size and variations in study populations and definitions of events. The negative results of RCTs were mainly derived from the RICCADSA (Randomized Intervention With CPAP in Coronary Artery Disease and Sleep Apnea) trial, which enrolled 224 patients with OSA and revascularized CAD. There is no significant difference in the composite endpoint of repeat revascularization, MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death between CPAP and untreated OSA patients. It should be noted that CPAP therapy tended to be associated with a reduced risk of MACE in the 2 RCTs (RR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.32–1.02), although there was no significant difference. Due to the small number of included RCTs, this result should be interpreted with caution. In the RICCADSA trial, adjusted on-treatment analysis exhibited better outcomes among patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy (≥ 4 h per night). In addition, patients in the RICCADSA trial were heterogeneous with variable risk profiles, including both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and CABG, and both acute or elective PCI, thus attenuating the anticipated treatment effect. In case of second prevention of CAD patients, the treatment effects of CPAP are still needed to be evaluated in a high-risk group with homogenous CAD populations (ACS, MI, or PCI, etc.).

In the contemporary era, with the extensive use of lipid-lowering and blood pressure lowering agents, antiplatelet therapy, and drug-eluting stents, treatment of OSA with CPAP might not add more benefits for CAD patients based on current evidence. As OSA is highly prevalent and is associated with subsequent cardiovascular risk, we should still pay more attention to this condition when assessing patients with CAD in clinical practice. Whether increased compliance to CPAP or novel treatment options can lead to better cardiovascular outcomes needs further investigation.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Our cohort included 1 850 625 (weighted) patients with STEMI, of which 1.3% (24 623) had documented OSA. Patients with OSA were generally young, male, white, smokers and were more likely to have chronic pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes mellitus (with and without complications), hypertension, known history of CAD, dyslipidemia, obesity, and renal failure (P < 0.001 for all). Whereas patients with OSA had a greater prevalence of alcohol abuse (P = 0.001), prevalence of drug abuse was similar between both groups. Patients with OSA were more likely to have higher socioeconomic status and be admitted to large, urban, and teaching hospitals (P < 0.001 for all).

### Long-term use of continuous positive airway pressure therapy in coronary artery disease patients with nonsleepy obstructive sleep apnea [^1167Nbjj]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Excessive daytime sleepiness is a frequent symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and has been proposed as a motivator for adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. However, excessive daytime sleepiness is absent in many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and concomitant OSA. We evaluated long-term use of CPAP and predictors of CPAP use in nonsleepy and sleepy OSA patients from a CAD cohort.

Hypothesis

Long-term CPAP use is lower in CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA vs sleepy OSA.

Methods

Nonsleepy (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score < 10) OSA patients randomized to CPAP (n = 122) and sleepy (ESS ≥ 10) OSA patients offered CPAP (n = 155) in the RICCADSA trial in Sweden were included in this substudy. The median follow-up was 4.8 years for the main trial, with a predefined minimum follow-up of 2 years.

Results

The probability of remaining on CPAP at 2 years was 60% in nonsleepy patients and 77% in sleepy patients. Multivariate analyses indicated that age and hours of CPAP use per night at 1 month were independently associated with long-term CPAP use in nonsleepy patients. In the sleepy phenotype, body mass index, acute myocardial infarction at baseline, and hours of CPAP use per night at 1 month were predictors of long-term CPAP use.

Conclusions

Long-term use of CPAP is likely to be challenging for CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA. Early CPAP use is an important predictor of continued long-term use of CPAP, so optimizing patients' initial experience with CPAP could promote adherence.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111frWNf]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present meta-analysis, the associations of CPAP use with risk reduction of composite cardiovascular events, all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with concomitant CAD and OSA were only demonstrated in observational studies, but not RCTs. There were also no significant associations between CPAP treatment with individual cardiovascular outcomes. Based on these results, there is still no clear evidence to prescribe CPAP with the purpose of preventing future cardiovascular events in patients with OSA and established CAD.

OSA was linked to a series of cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes. CPAP is effective in reversing upper airway obstruction and hypoxemia. Randomized trials have demonstrated that CPAP treatment improves cardiovascular surrogate endpoints, such as blood pressure and insulin resistance. However, in the trials evaluating MACE, no significant beneficial effects of CPAP were shown in patients with OSA. In the most recently SAVE (Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints) trial that randomized 2717 participants with coronary or cerebrovascular disease and moderate-to-severe OSA, CPAP did not result in a lower rate of the composite cardiovascular events at a median follow-up of 3.7 years. Furthermore, several meta-analyses of randomized trials also showed no effect of CPAP therapy on MACE for OSA with or without cardiovascular morbidities. However, the study populations of included studies are diverse, from general population to patients with severe CAD (such as MI), thus precluding definitive conclusions.

### Nocturnal hypoxemia due to obstructive sleep apnea is an Independent predictor of poor prognosis after myocardial infarction [^113iXhoB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Although nocturnal hypoxemia from OSA predicts poor outcome, it is unknown whether patients with MI benefit from oxygen therapy. Breathing events and sleep fragmentation still occur in spite of the elevated oxygen saturation. 27 Concerns regarding lengthened apnea duration and risk of hypercapnia have been raised. 28, 29 Gottlieb and colleagues report that CPAP, rather than oxygen therapy, may reduce blood pressure in OSA patients, although patients with AHI > 50 events/h or long duration of severe nocturnal hypoxemia (SaO₂ < 85% for > 10% of sleep) were excluded from the study. 30 On the other hand, it has been shown that sleep‐disordered breathing is common in patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension, 31 and nocturnal oxygen therapy seems to have a positive effect on prognostic markers and may improve outcomes in this patient population. 32 Therefore, considering that CPAP may be intolerable for some patients with OSA, oxygen therapy may be an alternative therapeutic strategy to reduce severe hypoxemia and consequent target organ damage, although it may be prudent to consider oxygenating patients with persistently low oxygen saturation (< 88%) after CPAP, 33 or hypoxemia without apneic events. Despite our limited sample of CPAP users, our findings are consistent with a previous study showing that CPAP therapy may reduce the risk of recurrent MI and revascularization in OSA patients after MI. 4

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort study, OSA was not independently associated with a higher incidence of MACCE in patients with ACS. However, an increased risk associated with OSA was observed during the period after 1 year. Efficacy of CPAP therapy for secondary prevention and timing of intervention after ACS need further evaluation.

Study Design and Participants

The OSA‐ACS project (NCT03362385) is a large‐scale, single‐center, prospective cohort study designed to assess the relationship between OSA and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ACS. As described in the flowchart (Figure 1), 1505 patients aged 18 to 85 years and admitted for ACS who underwent coronary angiography and were successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention in the Emergency & Critical Care Center of Beijing An Zhen Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) between June 2017 and May 2019 were eligible for inclusion, and the median period of follow‐up was 3.1 years.

ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; AHI, apnea–hypopnea index; CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

The ACS definition and exclusion criteria are provided in Data S1.

This study complied with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology guidelines and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of Beijing An Zhen Hospital, Capital Medical University approved the study (2013025), and all patients provided written informed consent.

Patients were followed up at 6‐month intervals for at least 1 year. Trained nurses or physicians who were blinded to the clinical data completed the interviews. Our primary end points (CVEs) were cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Our secondary outcome was all‐cause mortality. Survival time was measured from the time of enrollment to censoring (event, loss to follow‐up, or latest date of follow‐up).

### Obstructive sleep apnea therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction-time for a rethink? [^113k24Wi]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The CPAP in patients with acute coronary syndrome and OSA (ISAACC) trialwas a multicenter randomized trial of patients with the acute coronary syndrome. All patients underwent respiratory polygraphy during the acute phase, and patients with OSA were randomized to CPAP (n = 633) or usual care (n = 631). The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or nonfatal events [acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalizations for unstable angina or transient ischemic attack]). Over a median follow‐up of 3.4 years, the incidence of the primary end point was 16% (CPAP group) versus 17% (usual care group, p = .40).

Superficially, all three trials showed no clear benefit of OSA therapy using CPAP in improving cardiovascular outcomes. However, further data analysis revealed limitations in the design and execution of the studies. The adherence of CPAP in these trials was low. Indeed, none of these trials reported an average CPAP adherence of ≥ 4 h/night, which is the minimum adherence needed to derive benefits from CPAP. Notably, these trials recruited patients who had developed cardiovascular events. Such patients are different from younger patients whom CPAP may confer a benefit in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, as they may be more likely to be adherent to CPAP.

When considering in-hospital OSA treatment, patients who place a lower value on potential reduction of clinically meaningful outcomes and a higher value on possible downsides of PAP, or clinicians who perceive that OSA diagnosis or management may interfere with medical care, would reasonably decline OSA screening or PAP during the hospitalization.

### The great controversy of obstructive sleep apnea treatment for cardiovascular risk benefit: advancing the science through expert consensus. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^111Z2Js2]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Introduction — obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular risk: OSA is characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep with cardiovascular effects mediated by intermittent hypoxia, mechanical load, autonomic dysregulation, and inflammation. Recent modeling data estimate the global burden at more than 400 million persons globally using a defining criterion of apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15 events/h. Continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the mainstay of OSA treatment, and current guidelines recommend therapy for all patients with OSA with sleep-related symptoms or elevated blood pressure. Several recent randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate a benefit of PAP therapy on composite cardiovascular disease outcomes, including stroke and myocardial infarction, in nonsleepy or mildly sleepy patients with moderate to severe OSA.

### Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with acute… [^1127f21r]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to its association with hypertension, stroke, heart attack and sudden death. The standard therapy for symptomatic OSA is continuous positive airway pressure. CPAP has been shown to effectively reduce snoring, obstructive episodes and daytime sleepiness and to modestly reduce blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The overall aim of ISAACC is to determine if CPAP can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or heart failure for people with OSA admitted in a hospital for an acute coronary syndrome. Overall objective: To assess the impact of obstructive sleep apnea and its treatment on the clinical evolution of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Primary objectives:

1.

To determine if continuous positive airway pressure treatment will reduce the rate of cardiovascular events death, non-fatal events, non-fatal stroke, hospital admission for heart failure, and new hospitalizations) for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack) in patients with ACS and co-occurring sleep apnea. Secondary objectives:

- Determine the prevalence of OSA in patients who have suffered an episode of ACS. Other secondary objectives will include the effects of CPAP on:

- To evaluate a composite of CV death, myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke.
- Components of primary composite endpoints
- Re-vascularization procedures
- To evaluate all-cause death
- To evaluate new onset, ECG-confirmed atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias
- To evaluate newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, according to standard definitions.

Evaluations will include; i)new episodes of ACS, stroke, TIA, heart failure, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes and cardiovascular mortality, ii) biological risk markers involved in cardiovascular complications, iii) an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and CPAP treatment in patients with ACS who have obstructive sleep apnea. Other: Standard care Device: continuous positive airway pressure

- Previous CPAP treatment for OSA diagnosis
- Psycho-physical inability to complete questionnaires.
- **Presence of any previously diagnosed sleep disorders**: narcolepsy, insomnia, chronic sleep deprivation, regular use of hypnotic or sedative medications and restless leg syndrome
- Patients with > 50% of central apneas or the presence of Cheyne-Stokes Respiration.

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114cF1GG]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Inpatient OSA treatment in those with established diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) not currently on treatment — In adult patients with a known pre-admission diagnosis of OSA who are not already on treatment, we recommend initiation of PAP therapy, interventions to address any non-adherence prior to hospitalization, and a discussion of strategies to optimize post-discharge adherence as well as alternatives to PAP. That said, more immediate OSA treatment may be beneficial to optimize clinical outcomes directly related to the medical reason for admission and reduce short-term recurrent risk of clinical progression or decompensation, particularly in those with cardiopulmonary and neurologic disease.

### Sleep study-guided multidisciplinary therapy (SGMT) for patients with acute coronary syndrome: trial rationale and design [^115hAL8Z]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an emerging risk marker for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This randomized trial aims to determine the effects of sleep study-guided multidisciplinary therapy (SGMT) comprising overnight sleep study, continuous positive airway pressure, and behavioral therapy for OSA during the subacute phase of ACS. We hypothesize that SGMT will reduce (1) the plasma levels of N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide and suppression of tumorigenicity 2; (2) the estimated 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality as measured by the European Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) algorithm; and (3) the cardiovascular event rate during a 3-year follow-up, compared with standard therapy. In the SGMT trial, 180 patients presenting with ACS will be randomly assigned to SGMT (n = 90) and standard therapy (n = 90) groups. Both groups will receive guideline-mandated treatment for ACS. Those assigned to SGMT will additionally undergo a sleep study and, if OSA is diagnosed, attend a multidisciplinary OSA clinic where they will receive personalized treatment including continuous positive airway pressure and behavioral/lifestyle counseling. The primary endpoint is the plasma N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide concentration at 7-month follow-up. This report presents the baseline characteristics of 117 patients (SGMT group: n = 54; standard therapy group: n = 63) who had been enrolled into the study as of August 31, 2017. The results of this trial will help us to understand whether active OSA diagnosis and treatment will improve the physiologic and clinical cardiovascular outcomes of this group of patients.

3.2.2 Secondary endpoints

Analyses of all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and repeat revascularization were shown in Figure 3. With respect to all‐cause death, data were available from six studies, with 2340 participants (Figure 3(A)). When pooled, CPAP treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of all‐cause death (RR, 0.66, 95% CI, [0.46, 0.94], I² = 0, p = .009). Cardiovascular death was evaluated in six trials, with a total of 1928 participants. When combined, CPAP was significantly associated with a reduced risk for cardiovascular death (RR, 0.495, 95% CI, [0.292, 0.838], I² = 0, p = .838). (Figure 3(B)). Six studies,(2036 patients) reported on MI. However, there was no significant difference in the risk of MI with CPAP (RR, 0.845, 95% CI, [0.451, 1.582], I² = 45.4%, p = .103) (Figure 3(C)). For stroke, when four studies, were pooled (1867 participants), the risk of stroke was no reduced with CPAP treatment (RR, 0.941, 95% CI [0.539, 1.643], I² = 11.40%, p = .336) (Figure 3(D)). For repeat revascularization, when seven studies,(2146 patients) were pooled, CPAP was not associated with the risk of repeat revascularization (RR, 0.73, 95% CI, [0.442, 1.231]), and the pooled estimate showed substantial heterogeneity (I² = 55.9%, p = .034) (Figure 3(E)).

Study Population

Consecutive patients in stable hemodynamic condition who had experienced a first acute MI (ST‐segment–elevation in the ECG or acute occlusion of coronary artery) were assessed for eligibility and included in the TEAM‐ASV I trial if aged between 18 and 80 years and if a primarily successful PCI had been achieved within 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Ad hoc PCI was performed in the culprit lesion and additionally in nonculprit subtotal stenoses. Chronic totally occluded coronary arteries were not intervened in the first examination. Exclusion criteria included previous MI or myocardial revascularization (PCI or surgical), indication for surgical revascularization, cardiogenic shock, mean supine blood pressure < 60 mm Hg or New York Heart Association class IV, an implanted cardiac device or other contraindication (known allergies or contraindication to contrast dye) for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and previous stroke. Patients with contraindications for positive airway pressure support, severe obstructive or restrictive airway disease, heart failure due to primary valve disease; patients on or with indication for oxygen therapy, mechanical or noninvasive ventilation, nocturnal positive airway pressure support, or diurnal symptoms of OSA requiring immediate treatment; patients awaiting heart transplantation; and pregnant patients were also excluded. For troponin I as well as for creatine kinase and creatine kinase muscle‐brain type, the respective peak value within 72 hours after MI was recorded. Because of a change in laboratory testing from sensitive troponin I to high‐sensitive troponin I during the study period, the troponin I value is given as "times upper limit of normal". Three‐vessel disease was diagnosed if there was a stenosis of at least 50% in all 3 main epicardial coronary vessels. "Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading of angina pectoris" refers to the period of 14 days before the infarct‐related event. All clinical data were collected from the medical files of the enrolled study patients.

Methods

Search strategies

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The searches included the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library from their inceptions to October 7, 2017, without language restrictions. We used Medical Subject Heading terms "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure", "Sleep Apnea Syndromes", "Myocardial Ischemia", and related text words including CPAP, sleep apnea, and coronary disease. We also checked the reference lists of all included studies, relevant review articles, and conference abstracts manually for potential citations. An example search strategy is presented in Additional file 1: Table S1.

Study selection and eligibility criteria

Two authors (X.W. and Y.Z. both cardiologists) assessed the eligibility of articles by initially screening the titles and abstracts. Articles that reported the impact of CPAP versus standard therapy (control group) among patients with OSA and CAD were considered for inclusion. Each full-text article was then reviewed in duplicate by these authors. Studies that were not performed in patients with CAD, studies that did not report on outcomes of interest (cardiovascular events), and studies with less than 1-year follow-up were excluded. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus through referral to a third reviewer (S.N.).

### Does continuous positive airway pressure therapy benefit patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Q4yKt]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The prevalent co-morbidity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has attracted great interest. However, effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with OSA and CAD for cardiovascular outcomes and deaths are still controversial. Usage of CPAP among patients with CAD and OSA could decrease the risk of cardiovascular events and death in adults. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched. Studies that described association of CPAP treatment with cardiovascular events in CAD and OSA patients were included. The main outcome was the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and repeat revascularization. Summary relative risks (risk ratios [RRs]) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of outcomes were pooled and heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 statistic. Nine studies enrolling 2590 participants with OSA and CAD were included and extracted data. There was significant association of CPAP with reduced risk of MACE (RR, 0.73, 95% CI [0.55, 0.96]), particularly among those with AHI less than 30 events/h (RR, 0.43, 95% CI [0.22, 0.84]). Similarly, the same result was found in all-cause death (RR, 0.66, 95% CI, [0.46, 0.94]) and cardiovascular death (RR, 0.495, 95% CI [0.292, 0.838]). Our data suggested that CPAP usage, compared to usual care, was associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular outcomes or death in patients with OSA and CAD, particularly in the subgroup with AHI less than 30 events/h, which still needs further studies to confirm.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123xhMt]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Study limitations

First, we observed significant statistical heterogeneity in the outcome measure of MACE in the observational studies, which could be partly explained by different study design, small sample size, and study quality according to whether adjustment for confounders was performed. We did subgroup analysis based on prospective or retrospective cohorts, and the heterogeneity was attenuated in both subgroups. Second, the study population varies across studies, from general CAD patients to MI with or without revascularization (PCI or CABG). The treatment effects of CPAP need to be further investigated in more homogenous patients. Third, there are significant differences in the definitions of the use and adherence of CPAP, which could impact the treatment effects compared to the control group. Fourth, there are not enough studies (less than 10) to test for publication bias for the primary endpoint. Fifth, the risk estimates of individual cardiovascular events could be underpowered due to a small number of included studies and variations in events definition.

### Effect of positive airway pressure on cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease patients with nonsleepy obstructive sleep apnea. the RICCADSA randomized controlled trial [^11139WNZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), many of whom do not report daytime sleepiness. First-line treatment for symptomatic OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), but its value in patients without daytime sleepiness is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the effects of CPAP on long-term adverse cardiovascular outcome risk in patients with CAD with nonsleepy OSA.

Methods

This single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded evaluation trial was conducted between December 2005 and November 2010. Consecutive patients with newly revascularized CAD and OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15/h) without daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score < 10) were randomized to auto-titrating CPAP (n = 122) or no positive airway pressure (n = 122).

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoint was the first event of repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular mortality. Median follow-up was 57 months. The incidence of the primary endpoint did not differ significantly in patients who did versus did not receive CPAP (18.1% vs. 22.1%; hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.46–1.41; P = 0.449). Adjusted on-treatment analysis showed a significant cardiovascular risk reduction in those who used CPAP for ≥ 4 versus < 4 hours per night or did not receive treatment (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.86; P = 0.026).

Conclusions

Routine prescription of CPAP to patients with CAD with nonsleepy OSA did not significantly reduce long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the intention-to-treat population. There was a significant reduction after adjustment for baseline comorbidities and compliance with the treatment. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00519597).

Disappointingly though, no randomized trials investigating the impact of PAP therapy on cardiovascular outcomes have shown a clear benefit with respect to hard cardiovascular outcomes. In patients with a history of stroke, Hsu et al found no reduction in recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with OSA treated with PAP therapy. 135 Peker et al randomized 244 nonsleepy patients with CAD following revascularization and moderate‐to‐severe OSA to APAP versus no PAP therapy and found no difference in the composite cardiovascular event outcome after a median of 57 months follow‐up. 136

The SAVE (Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints) trial was the largest RCT designed to investigate the question of whether treating OSA with CPAP may improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with established CVD. 5 SAVE randomized 2717 patients with moderate‐to‐severe OSA and either CAD or cerebrovascular disease to CPAP plus usual care or usual care alone and followed them for a mean period of 3.7 years. The trial failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the primary end point (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, HF, or transient ischemic attack) among patients treated with CPAP in addition to usual care (hazard ratio 1.10; 95% CI, 0.91–1.32; P = 0.34). Among secondary end points, CPAP was associated with significant reductions in snoring and daytime sleepiness, improvement in health‐related quality of life and mood, and fewer days off work because of poor health.

### Effect of obstructive sleep apnea in acute coronary syndrome [^116Kto2Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on clinical outcomes after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is incompletely defined. We sought to determine the prevalence of OSA in patients with ACS and evaluate prognostic impact of OSA and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in these patients. This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 73 patients admitted on cardiac intensive care unit for ACS. Cardiorespiratory sleep study and/or polysomnography were performed in all patients. CPAP was recommended if Apnea-Hypopnea Index ≥ 5. The main study outcome was a composite of death for any cause, myocardial infarction, and myocardial revascularization. OSA was diagnosed in 46 patients (63%). Age and cardiovascular risk factors were not significantly different between groups. OSA was classified as mild (m-OSA) in 14 patients (30%) and as moderate-to-severe (s-OSA) in 32 patients (70%). After a median follow-up of 75 months (interquartile range 71 to 79), patients with s-OSA had lower event-free survival rate. After adjustment for gender, patients with s-OSA showed a significantly higher incidence of the composite end point (hazard ratio 3.58, 95% CI 1.09 to 17.73, p = 0.035). Adherence to CPAP occurred in 19 patients (41%), but compliance to CPAP therapy did not reduce the risk of composite end point (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.46, p = 0.798). In conclusion, OSA is an underdiagnosed disease with high prevalence in patients with ACS. It is urgent to establish screening protocols because those have high diagnostic yield and allow identifying a group of patients with manifestly unfavorable prognosis.

### Positive airway pressure, mortality, and cardiovascular risk in older adults with sleep apnea [^116SpX6Y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first-line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but evidence on its beneficial effect on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality prevention is limited.

Objective

To determine whether PAP initiation and utilization are associated with lower mortality and incidence of MACE among older adults with OSA living in the central US.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective clinical cohort study included Medicare beneficiaries with 2 or more distinct OSA claims identified from multistate, statewide, multiyear (2011–2020) Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Individuals were followed up until death or censoring on December 31, 2020. Analyses were performed between December 2021 and December 2023.

Exposures

Evidence of PAP initiation and utilization based on PAP claims after OSA diagnosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality and MACE, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or coronary revascularization. Doubly robust Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weights were used to estimate treatment effect sizes controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors.

Results

Among 888 835 beneficiaries with OSA included in the analyses (median [IQR] age, 73 [69–78] years; 390 598 women [43.9%]; 8115 Asian [0.9%], 47 122 Black [5.3%], and 760 324 White [85.5%] participants; median [IQR] follow-up, 3.1 [1.5–5.1] years), those with evidence of PAP initiation (290 015 [32.6%]) had significantly lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.52–0.54) and MACE incidence risk (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89–0.91). Higher quartiles (Q) of annual PAP claims were progressively associated with lower mortality (Q2 HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81–0.87; Q3 HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.74–0.79; Q4 HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72–0.77) and MACE incidence risk (Q2 HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95; Q3 HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86–0.91; Q4 HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85–0.90).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with OSA, PAP utilization was associated with lower all-cause mortality and MACE incidence. Results might inform trials assessing the importance of OSA therapy toward minimizing cardiovascular risk and mortality in older adults.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fL77r]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and validity assessment

Data extraction was performed independently and in duplicate by two reviewers (X.W. and Y.Z.) using a standardized electronic form, and verified by a senior author (S.N.). Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We recorded the following information: study design, location, and time span, number of participants, inclusion criteria for OSA, demographic characteristics, methods of OSA assessment, duration and completeness of follow-up, cardiovascular events, and potential confounders included in adjusted analysis.

The potential risk of bias of RCTs was appraised according to the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The quality items included random sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias, which were each classified as low, unclear, or high.

The quality of observational studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. A quality score was calculated according to a maximum of one star for each item upon selection (4 items: representativeness of the exposed cohort, selection of the non-exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure, demonstration that outcome was not present at study start), comparability (2 items: controls for the most important factor and any additional factor), and outcomes (3 items: assessment, duration, and adequacy of follow-up) categories.

The primary outcome of interest was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause or cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, repeat revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary endpoints included all-cause death, cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and repeat revascularization. Definitions of events were in accordance to guidelines during each study period. Endpoints were assessed at the longest follow-up.

Data synthesis and analysis

In general, we collected multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) from original studies. In case of unreported HR or RR of the outcomes of interest, we calculated unadjusted RR using crude values. Summary RR with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for primary and secondary outcomes by DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. We used the Cochran Q test and I² statistic to assess heterogeneity across studies with a significance level of p < 0.10. All analyses were performed with Cochrane Review Manager software (version 5.3). A 2-sided p value < 0.05 was deemed significant.

### Association of obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia with the circadian rhythm of myocardial infarction [^111YtwqE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

A total of 2130 patients were assessed for eligibility. Patients with unstable angina (n = 1132), cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest (n = 14), malignancy (n = 20), or failed sleep study (n = 68) were excluded, of whom 896 patients received a successful sleep study. After excluding patients with central sleep apnea (n = 59), regular continuous positive airway pressure therapy (n = 42), and those without clearly defined time of onset of MI (n = 82), 713 patients were finally included with a mean age of 55.4 ± 11.1 years. Of these, 630 (88.4%) were men and 398 (55.8%) had moderate/severe OSA (Figure 1). In the subgroup analyses, patients were further categorized into 4 groups based on the severity of OSA and the presence of nocturnal hypoxemia.

Figure 1
Study flow chart.

ACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure; MI, myocardial infarction; and OSA, obstructive sleep apnea.

The proportion of men was higher in the moderate/severe OSA group compared with the non/mild OSA group (91.2% versus 84.8%, P < 0.01). Patients with moderate/severe OSA had a larger neck circumference and were more likely to have hypertension, prior MI, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and worse left ventricular function. There was no other significant difference between the 2 groups. Characteristics of the study population are described in Table 1.

Results of Sleep Study

The median AHI was 29.6 events/h in the moderate/severe OSA group, with 7.0 events/h in the non/mild OSA group. Patients with moderate/severe OSA showed significant lower minimum SaO 2 and higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score than those with non/mild OSA. The detailed findings are listed in Table 2.

### Positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea [^112wLVLh]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Positive airway pressure (PAP) is considered first-line therapy for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and may also be considered for mild obstructive sleep apnea, particularly if it is symptomatic or there are concomitant cardiovascular disorders. Continuous PAP is most commonly used. Other modes, such as bilevel airway pressure, autotitrating positive airway pressure, average volume assured pressure support, and adaptive support ventilation, play important roles in the management of sleep-related breathing disorders. This article outlines the indications, description, and comfort features of each mode. Despite the proven efficacy of PAP in treating obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and its sequelae, adherence to therapy is low. Close follow-up of patients for evaluation of adherence to and effectiveness of treatment is important.

### CPAP for prevention of cardiovascular events in obstructive sleep apnea [^115wiV6s]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents major cardiovascular events is uncertain.

Methods

After a 1-week run-in period during which the participants used sham CPAP, we randomly assigned 2717 eligible adults between 45 and 75 years of age who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary or cerebrovascular disease to receive CPAP treatment plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health-related quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood.

Results

Most of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea-hypopnea index (the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%) and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34). No significant effect on any individual or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.

Conclusions

Therapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with sleep apnoea with or without continuous positive airway pressure therapy: follow-up of 4.5 million Danish adults [^115rKwaf]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic significance of age and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on cardiovascular disease in patients with sleep apnoea has not been assessed previously.

Methods

Using nationwide databases, the entire Danish population was followed from 2000 until 2011. First-time sleep apnoea diagnoses and use of CPAP therapy were determined. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) were analysed using Poisson regression models.

Results

Amongst 4.5 million individuals included in the study, 33 274 developed sleep apnoea (mean age 53, 79% men) of whom 44% received persistent CPAP therapy. Median time to initiation of CPAP therapy was 88 days (interquartile range 34–346). Patients with sleep apnoea had more comorbidities compared to the general population. Crude rates of MI and ischaemic stroke were increased for sleep apnoea patients (5.4 and 3.6 events per 1000 person-years compared to 4.0 and 3.0 in the general population, respectively). Relative to the general population, risk of MI [IRR 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57–1.86] and ischaemic stroke (IRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.35–1.66) was significantly increased in patients with sleep apnoea, in particular in patients younger than 50 years (IRR 2.12, 95% CI 1.64–2.74 and IRR 2.34, 95% CI 1.77–3.10, respectively). Subsequent CPAP therapy was not associated with altered prognosis.

Conclusions

Sleep apnoea is associated with increased risk of ischaemic stroke and MI, particularly in patients younger than 50 years of age. CPAP therapy was not associated with a reduced rate of stroke or MI.

### Association of obstructive sleep apnoea with long-term cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome with or without hypertension: insight from the OSA-ACS project [^117XVKsp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study design and patients

The OSA-ACS project (Impact of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Therapy on Outcomes in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome) is a prospective cohort study and the study design has been previously illustrated in the published literature. This is a post hoc analysis of the OSA-ACS project with the purpose to evaluate the impact of OSA on clinical outcomes following ACS in patients with or without hypertension. From June 2015 to January 2020, we consecutively recruited ACS patients aged 18 years to 85 years who were admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Patients were excluded if they had cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, malignancy, diagnosed secondary hypertension or if they had failed sleep studies (due to inadequate or unsatisfactory signal recordings during sleep). We also excluded patients with predominantly central sleep apnoea (at least 50% central events and a central apnoea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 10/hours) as well as those who received regular CPAP therapy (> 4 hours/day and > 21 days/month) after discharge. Patients who were lost to follow-up were also excluded from the analysis. This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

### ACP releases guideline on the management of OSA… [^116uVZiG]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice Physicians should encourage all persons with OSA who are overweight or obese to lose weight. CPAP is the recommended initial treatment for OSA. Use of a mandibular advancement device is an alternative treatment for those who prefer it or if CPAP leads to adverse effects From the AFP Editors. Recommendations Continuous positive airway pressure is the recommended initial treatment for OSA in addition to weight loss. It improves Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, reduces apnea-hypopnea index and arousal index scores, and increases oxygen saturation. Studies show that CPAP is more effective than control treatments or sham CPAP, although there were no data on long-term outcomes, such as death or cardiovascular illness, and inconsistent data regarding the effects on quality of life. Evidence shows that fixed CPAP, auto-CPAP, and C-Flex are similar in adherence and effectiveness, although data were insufficient to compare other CPAP modifications.

Use of a mandibular advancement device is an alternative treatment for those who prefer it or if CPAP leads to adverse effects. Using this device has been shown to lower apnea-hypopnea index scores and reduce sleepiness, although CPAP more effectively decreases apnea-hypopnea index scores and increases minimum oxygen saturation. Evidence was limited about which patients would benefit from either CPAP or a mandibular advancement device. Patients with more severe OSA may more readily adhere to CPAP treatment. Other factors that may increase the likelihood of adherence to CPAP are younger age, snoring, lower CPAP setting, higher body mass index, greater mean oxygen saturation, and the sleepiness domain on the Grenoble Sleep Apnea Quality of Life test.

Evidence was insufficient to compare the effectiveness of other treatments, such as positional therapy, oropharyngeal exercise, palatal implants, surgery, pharmacologic therapy, and atrial overdrive pacing. Physicians should encourage all persons with OSA who are overweight or obese to lose weight. Intensive weight loss in these patients has been shown to reduce apnea-hypopnea index scores and improve OSA symptoms.

### Nocturnal hypoxemia due to obstructive sleep apnea is an Independent predictor of poor prognosis after myocardial infarction [^117YTfrC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OSA on prognosis after MI, and to determine which specific measures of OSA severity best predicted outcomes.

Methods and Results

We performed a prospective study, in which 112 patients without a prior diagnosis of sleep apnea underwent comprehensive polysomnography within a median of 7 days after MI. Patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals (± 2 weeks) for a total of 48 months. Patients classified with central apnea (n = 6) or those using continuous positive airway pressure (n = 8) after polysomnography were excluded from analyses. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events, including death from any cause, recurrent MI, unstable angina, heart failure, stroke, and significant arrhythmic events. Forty of 98 patients (41%) had OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 15 events/h). OSA patients had higher major adverse cardiac event rates when compared to those without OSA (47.5% versus 24.1%; χ² = 5.41, P = 0.020). In a multivariate model that adjusted for clinically relevant variables including age, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, oxygen desaturation index, and arousal index, significant hypoxemia, as defined by nocturnal nadir oxygen saturation ≤ 85%, was an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio = 6.05, P = 0.004) in follow-up 15 months after baseline.

Conclusions

Nocturnal hypoxemia in OSA is an important predictor of poor prognosis for patients after MI. These findings suggest that routine use of low-cost nocturnal oximetry may be an economical and practical approach to stratify risk in post-MI patients.

### Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure for patients with acute transient ischemic attack: a randomized feasibility trial [^114iUB9N]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients are at risk of recurrent vascular events. The primary objectives were to evaluate among TIA patients the prevalence of sleep apnea and among patients with sleep apnea auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (auto-CPAP) adherence. The secondary objective was to describe among TIA patients with sleep apnea the recurrent vascular event rate by auto-CPAP use category.

Methods

All intervention patients received auto-CPAP for 2 nights, but only intervention patients with evidence of sleep apnea received auto-CPAP for the remainder of the 90-day period. Intervention patients received polysomnography at 90 days after TIA. Control patients received polysomnography at baseline and at 90 days. Acceptable auto-CPAP adherence was defined as ≥ 4 hours per night for ≥ 75% of nights. Vascular events included recurrent TIA, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or death.

Results

We enrolled 70 acute TIA patients: 45 intervention and 25 control. The majority of patients had sleep apnea: 57% at baseline and 59% at 90 days. Among the 30 intervention patients with airflow obstruction, 12 (40%) had acceptable auto-CPAP adherence, 18 (60%) had some use, and none had no use. Three intervention patients (12%) had recurrent events compared with 1 (2%; P = 0.13) control patient. The vascular event rate was highest among sleep apnea patients with no CPAP use: none, 16%; some, 5%; acceptable adherence 0% (P = 0.08).

Conclusions

Sleep apnea is common among acute TIA patients. It appears feasible to provide auto-CPAP in the acute TIA period. Larger studies should evaluate whether a strategy of diagnosing and treating sleep apnea can reduce recurrent vascular events after TIA.

### Clinical significance of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with acute coronary syndrome in relation to diabetes status [^115XNzEQ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

Currently, data from randomized controlled trials do not support a role of CPAP for reducing cardiovascular events among patients with established cardiovascular disease. In the RICCADSA (Randomized Intervention with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in CAD and OSA) Study, 224 non-sleepy patients with OSA and coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomized to CPAP or usual care. At a median follow-up of 57 months, no difference was found in a composite end point of repeat revascularization, MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death. The negative results may be partly explained by the fact that patients are under guideline-based optimal medical therapy, including intensive antiplatelet therapy, and control of blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and glucose, which are also the intermediate mechanisms implicated in OSA. More importantly, the RICCADSA trial included the entire spectrum of patients with CAD, with only 25% of patients having DM, thereby limiting the sample to a potentially lower-risk group. In the present study, only patients with combined DM and OSA had a significantly increased risk of future events after ACS, therefore representing a high-risk subset most likely to respond to the intervention. Conversely, patients with DM without OSA had a similar prognosis as patients without DM (with or without OSA). The presence of OSA seems to be a key modifier contributing to the negative effect of DM in patients with ACS. Thus, for patients with ACS and DM, it is important to screen for OSA and intervention may be needed, although more trials evaluating the effects of OSA treatment in this high-risk subgroup are warranted.

Study limitations

First, the size of the DM cohort with 248 patients was modest. However, the primary outcome showed a significant difference between the OSA and non-OSA groups in patients with DM. Also, the results based on glucose and HbA1c levels were consistent with the main findings. Second, the diagnosis of OSA was based on portable polygraphy, a method that may underestimate AHI due to overestimating actual sleeping time. Third, although OSA severity may be overestimated during the acute setting of ACS but not stable CAD, this is true for OSA assessment in the setting of any high-risk acute disease including heart failure. Additionally, the patients in our study received a sleep study after clinical stabilization during hospitalization, minimizing the potential bias. Fourth, the overall sample was predominantly male and non-obese. Whether our findings may be extrapolated to the female or obese population is unknown. Finally, this study primarily recruited East-Asian patients. Studies pertaining to other ethnicities are needed.

Support for efficacy of OSA treatment on improving cardiovascular outcomes came from early observational studies. A prospective analysis of 54 patients with known CAD and OSA found a significant reduction in the composite end point of cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, hospitalization for HF, or need for coronary revascularization (hazard ratio 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09–0.62; P < 0.01) among patients treated for OSA with either CPAP or upper airway surgery; however, these results may have been subject to significant bias because the untreated arm consisted of patients who had refused treatment despite a recommendation from their provider. 132 An observational study that followed 223 patients for 5 years after a stroke found an increased risk of mortality in patients unable to tolerate CPAP versus those who tolerated CPAP (hazard ratio 1.58; 95% CI, 1.01–2.49; P = 0.04). 133 Similarly, a 444 patient cohort that included patients treated with CPAP, weight loss, or surgery found a significant reduction in mortality associated with each individual treatment modality as compared with untreated patients. When compared with the general population using census‐derived survival data, untreated patients had a significantly higher mortality rate, whereas mortality did not differ significantly between the treated patients and general population. 134

### Strategies to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term clinically important outcomes among patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115mcDEg]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop — continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) identifies strategies to understand the causal effects of CPAP on long-term clinically important outcomes and to ensure the generalizability and practicality of future randomized trials. CPAP is the first-line treatment for OSA and improves symptoms, yet there is a lack of high-quality evidence that CPAP prevents many long-term outcomes (including cognitive impairment, myocardial infarction, and stroke), creating uncertainty about the full benefits of CPAP. Observational studies suggest that symptomatic patients may be particularly likely to experience preventive benefits, but ethical and practical concerns have limited their participation in prior long-term randomized trials. The report states that quasi-experimental designs can provide valuable information, are less time and resource intensive than trials, and under specific conditions and assumptions may provide causal estimates of CPAP's effectiveness from generalizable observational cohorts. However, randomized trials represent the most reliable approach to understanding causal effects in patients with symptoms and can ethically include symptomatic patients when there is outcome-specific equipoise, adequate informed consent, and a plan to maximize safety while minimizing harm (e.g., monitoring for pathologic sleepiness). To strengthen forthcoming trials, strategies include reducing the burden of trial procedures, improving patient-centeredness, and engaging historically excluded and underserved populations.

### Association between treated and untreated obstructive sleep apnea and risk of hypertension… [^116sjqvc]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Compared with controls, the adjusted HRs for incident hypertension were greater among patients with OSA ineligible for CPAP therapy, among those who declined CPAP therapy ineligible for CPAP therapy according to the national guidelines, eligible for CPAP therapy but declined, started CPAP therapy but were nonadherent, and treated with CPAP therapy. Among 1579 patients with OSA, 462 were ineligible for CPAP therapy according to the national treatment guidelines, 195 were eligible but declined CPAP therapy, 98 were eligible and started CPAP therapy but were nonadherent, and 824 adhered to CPAP therapy. The reasons for declining CPAP therapy were discomfort, psychological or social problems, and unspecified problems.

The incidence of new-onset hypertension was lower among patients with severe OSA who were treated with CPAP therapy compared with patients with untreated severe OSA, whereas patients with mild OSA who were treated and untreated had similar incidence of hypertension. Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival function for new-onset hypertension in controls and in patients with OSA who were untreated. The incidence of hypertension increased with severity of OSA. who declined CPAP therapy, and among patients with OSA who were nonadherent to CPAP therapy compared with controls without OSA. In patients with OSA who were treated with CPAP therapy, the risk of new-onset hypertension was lower than in controls in the fully adjusted model. An important potential limitation of our study stems from its observational nature.

Patients with OSA who are willing to adhere to CPAP therapy may be more health conscious and thus more adherent to other treatment modalities and more likely to do well.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111eCU9d]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent complete and partial upper airway obstructive events, resulting in intermittent hypoxemia, autonomic fluctuation, and sleep fragmentation. Approximately 34% and 17% of middle-aged men and women, respectively, meet the diagnostic criteria for OSA. Sleep disturbances are common and underdiagnosed among middle-aged and older adults, and the prevalence varies by race/ethnicity, sex, and obesity status. OSA prevalence is as high as 40% to 80% in patients with hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Despite its high prevalence in patients with heart disease and the vulnerability of cardiac patients to OSA-related stressors and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, OSA is often underrecognized and undertreated in cardiovascular practice. We recommend screening for OSA in patients with resistant/poorly controlled hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and recurrent atrial fibrillation after either cardioversion or ablation. In patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure and suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing or excessive daytime sleepiness, a formal sleep assessment is reasonable. In patients with tachy-brady syndrome or ventricular tachycardia or survivors of sudden cardiac death in whom sleep apnea is suspected after a comprehensive sleep assessment, evaluation for sleep apnea should be considered. After stroke, clinical equipoise exists with respect to screening and treatment. Patients with nocturnally occurring angina, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or appropriate shocks from implanted cardioverter-defibrillators may be especially likely to have comorbid sleep apnea. All patients with OSA should be considered for treatment, including behavioral modifications and weight loss as indicated. Continuous positive airway pressure should be offered to patients with severe OSA, whereas oral appliances can be considered for those with mild to moderate OSA or for continuous positive airway pressure-intolerant patients. Follow-up sleep testing should be performed to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment

The review of potentially eligible scientific reports identified by the searches was completed by two authors (Yasha Chen and Yihong Chen) to identify reports for review in full text. Each full‐text article was then reviewed for eligibility and, for each included study, data recorded were (1) study characteristics: first author, year of publication, country, study phase and study design; (2) participants: sample size, age, sex, key inclusion criteria, apnea‐hypopnea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (ESSs); (4) interventions and comparison: CPAP equipment, type of interface, type of control, duration of treatment; and (5) outcomes: follow‐up duration, rate of lost‐to follow‐up and precision of measurements (risk ratios [RRs] or HRs with 95% CI) of each trial. Any disagreements would be resolved by discussion with a third party. Authors were contacted to clarify ambiguities and to request data on outcomes missing in primary reports.

To evaluate risk of bias, we used the individual criteria of the Newcastle‐Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS)(eMethod in Supplement). There were three parts assessed: selection bias (0–4 points), comparability bias (0–2 points), and outcome assessment bias (0–3 points), which were each classified as low, unclear, or high. NOS scores of 6 were assigned as high‐quality studies.

2.4 Outcomes

The primary end point was the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke or repeat revascularization at the longest available follow‐up. The secondary end points were individual components of the primary end point. Definitions of events were in accordance to guidelines during each study period.

Follow‐Up and End Point Definitions

Follow‐up contact was made via mail or telephone every 6 months (± 2 weeks) to ascertain vital status and incidence of the outcome variables. In addition, the subjects' Social Security and (for those over 65 years) Medicare numbers were obtained to assist with determining vital status of subjects who were lost to follow‐up using the state health department, National Death Index, and Social Security Administration records.

The primary composite end points were major adverse cardiac events (MACE), 24 including all‐cause mortality, re‐admission for recurrent nonfatal MI, hospitalized unstable angina leading to revascularization or not, hospitalized heart failure, stroke, and significant arrhythmic events (sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or asystole). The diagnosis of unstable angina was based on new onset, worsening, or resting angina associated with evidence of ST‐segment elevation or depression without evidence of myocardial necrosis. Significant arrhythmias were detected and documented by emergency medical services, in the hospital, or by internal cardioverter defibrillators.

Patients with an AHI ≥ 5 events/h were advised to seek formal clinical assessment. When CPAP therapy was subsequently initiated by the treating physicians, these patients were followed up including obtaining basic usage data from devices.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ischemic preconditioning and myocardial injury — among patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), OSA has been linked to augmented coronary collateral circulation, increased proliferation and angiogenic capacity of endothelial progenitor cells, and elevated plasma VEGF concentrations that are suppressed by positive airway pressure (PAP); additionally, a higher apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) is associated with lower peak troponin during acute nonfatal MI, and these studies suggest potentially positive effects of ischemic preconditioning in OSA that PAP would prevent or reverse.

Study Design and Population

The OSA‐ACS project (NCT03362385) is a large‐scale, single‐center, prospective, observational study to assess the association of OSA with cardiovascular outcomes of patients with ACS in the contemporary era. For the current study, we performed a landmark analysis at a median follow‐up of 1 year. Consecutive patients aged 18 to 85 years and admitted for ACS to the Emergency & Critical Care Center of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University between June 2015 and May 2017 were eligible for inclusion. ACS was defined as acute presentation of coronary disease, including ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction, non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. Exclusion criteria were as follows: cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, previous or current use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), malignancy, and failed sleep study (patients without adequate and satisfactory signal recording). Patients with predominantly central sleep apnea (≥ 50% central events or central apnea hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 10 h⁻¹) and those receiving regular CPAP therapy (> 3 months) after hospitalization were excluded from the analysis. This study conformed to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology) guidelines and was conducted in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University approved the study (2013025). All patients provided informed consent.

2.5 Statistical analysis

The numbers of dichotomous outcomes were summarized and mean values with standard deviations were collated for continuous outcomes. For every included trial, we retrieved or calculated the RRs and HRs with 95% CIs for the assessed outcomes. Fixed‐effects models assume that there is a common underlying effect and the variability observed is attributed to chance alone; random‐effects models acknowledge that true between‐study heterogeneity exists and take into account the presence of heterogeneity into their calculations. In the absence of heterogeneity, fixed‐ and random‐effects models yield the same results. We summarized RR or HR with a random‐effects model first and changed to a fixed‐effects model if no between study heterogeneity was found for the random‐effects model. And I² statistic and was distinguished as low (I² less than or equal to 25%), moderate (I² less than 25% and more than 75%), or high (I² equal to or more than 75%), as was a p value of less than or equal to .05 for heterogeneity. Where there was a substantial heterogeneity (I² more than 50%), subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses was conducted for heterogeneity assessment. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to mean age, mean body mass index (BMI), mean AHI, OSA assessment, which might be potential mediators. In sensitivity analyses, we also excluded the following characteristics: (1) observational studies, (2) number of patients less than 200, (3) NOS score less than 9, (4) follow‐up duration no more than 36 months, and (5) lost to follow‐up rate more than 5%.

Funnel plots using the Egger test were visually assessed for publication bias. All tests were two‐tailed; p no more than.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata/SE version 15.1.

### Continuous positive airway pressure treatment of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea reduces cardiovascular risk [^111qTu4J]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is linked to increased cardiovascular risk, but the impact of mild forms of OSA and their treatment on cardiovascular outcomes remains controversial.

Objectives

To prospectively investigate cardiovascular outcomes in treated versus untreated patients with OSA.

Methods

Consecutive sleep laboratory patients with all degrees of OSA were included. Endpoints were nonfatal (myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome requiring revascularization procedures) and fatal (death from myocardial infarction or stroke) cardiovascular events.

Measurements and Main Results

Comparison of event-free survival rates in treated versus untreated patients (Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank test). Of 449 patients enrolled (age, 56.0 ± 10.5 years; body mass index, 30.8 ± 5.4 kg/m(2)), 364 patients received OSA treatment, and 85 patients remained untreated. Median follow-up was 72.0 months (range, 1–156). Mean apnea-hypopnea index before treatment was 30.9 ± 21.8/hour in treated and 15.3 ± 13.0/hour in untreated patients, but there were no differences in cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors. In patients with mild-moderate OSA (n = 288), events were more frequent in untreated patients (estimated event-free survival at 10 yr, 51.8 vs. 80.3% [P < 0.001]; absolute risk reduction, 28.5%; number needed to treat to prevent one event/10 yr, 3.5). After adjustment for age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, and comorbidities at baseline, OSA treatment was an independent predictor for events (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.21–0.62; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

OSA treatment was associated with a cardiovascular risk reduction of 64% independent from age and preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities. OSA treatment should be considered for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention, even in milder OSA.

4 DISCUSSION

A large number of studies have investigated the effects of CPAP in cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, we reviewed the published studies and undertook an updated meta‐analysis to make a more precise estimation of the benefit of CPAP for cardiovascular outcomes in patients with OSA and CAD.

In this meta‐analysis of nine studies involving 2590 participants, we have demonstrated a decreased risk of MACE associated with CPAP, especially in AHI less than 30 events/h subgroup. Additionally, the results were nearly the same in individual outcomes including all‐cause death and cardiovascular death. Indeed, CPAP is associated with at least 37% decrease in the risk of MACE compared to control patients in usual care group. Yet our analysis demonstrated null result with respect to MI, stroke or repeat revascularization.

The negative results of included studies were mainly derived from RICCADSA studyand ISAACC study.RICCADSA trial, a single‐center RCT from Sweden, illustrated a viewpoint that routine CPAP did not significantly reduce the adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with non‐sleepy OSA (HR 0.80 (95% CI, [0.46, 1.41], p = .449). However, A significant beneficial effect of CPAP was seen in patients used the device for equal to or more than 4 h/night, with an adjusted HR that similar to a prior observational study. Another RCT of 1255 patients with ACS at 15 hospitals across Spain, ISAACC study, showed that CPAP treatment did not result in a significantly lower prevalence of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe OSA. But the patients in this study did not attend any sleep unit, but were instead recruited from coronary units, without being referred for a sleep‐related breathing problem or symptoms. In such population, getting a good adherence to CPAP treatment was very difficult. Hence, this population had a very low compliance to CPAP treatment (2.78 h/night), the benefit effect of sustained well‐conducted CPAP (more than or equal to 4 h/night) could not be excluded. A greater effect on patients with adequate adherence than on those without adequate adherence has been illuminated. The SAVE trial study, a large‐scale RCT of 2602 CAD patients reported better outcomes among patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy (equal to or more than 4 hours per night) than those who did not receive CPAP or who used CPAP less than 4 hours per night. A prior meta‐analysis of RCTs for CAD patients showed that utilization of CPAP in patients with OSA was not associated with reduced risk of major adverse cardiac events, but wearing CPAP more than 4 hours did in fact decrease MACE in the subgroup analysis. This might be derived from low average CPAP usage achieved in most trials. We speculated that poor CPAP treatment adherence might be the major reason for above null outcomes. Adherence of CPAP still remains a challenging in this field. However, the null result of two RCTs, the final combined primary endpoint still showed a positive effect for CPAP. The reason behind it might be the significant benefit observed in observational studies. Considering the poor compliance and limitation of observative study, further RCTs on patients with good CPAP compliance are required.

### Strategies to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term clinically important outcomes among patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^113jJkKA]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) prevalence and evidence context — Approximately 425 million individuals are estimated to have moderate-severe OSA, a condition for which continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), including autotitrating CPAP, is the first-line treatment. In randomized trials, CPAP consistently reduces the frequency of obstructive events (i.e., apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) and improves daytime sleepiness, sleep-related quality of life, and blood pressure, yet although observational studies suggest that CPAP can prevent certain long-term outcomes such as cardiovascular events, randomized trials powered to detect moderate to large effect sizes have not replicated these findings. Citing these negative trials, the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that the available evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of CPAP for "long-term clinically important outcomes". Prior trials tended to exclude patients with symptomatic OSA; among patients receiving care for OSA, roughly half have excessive daytime sleepiness and up to three-fourths have at least one attributable symptom, reinforcing the stated need for additional evidence.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disease characterized by repeated collapse and obstruction of the muscular upper airways during sleep, resulting in significant hypopnea, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. 1 OSA is an independent risk factor for many cardiovascular conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and stroke. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Also, increasing severity of OSA has been shown to have a positive correlation with the occurrence of CAD. 2 Although the association with cardiovascular diseases is well established, the impact of OSA on immediate acute coronary syndrome outcomes remains controversial. Although some studies have associated OSA with increased rates of cardiovascular events and decreased long‐term survival post‐MI, others have shown that OSA is not a risk factor for adverse outcomes. 7, 8 These studies are limited by small sample sizes, selection bias, and low event rates for immediate post‐MI outcomes in patients with and without OSA. Understanding the impact of OSA on these immediate outcomes is necessary to better risk stratify patients with known OSA and provide more‐aggressive treatment, such as positive airway pressure therapy, to these patients. 8 Additionally, several human and animal studies have shown that OSA or chronic intermittent hypoxia (which is associated with OSA) is associated with less‐severe cardiac injury after an MI. 9, 10 Several studies on OSA in the elderly and in other conditions, such as pneumonia, and those hospitalized for bariatric procedures have shown a survival benefit associated with OSA. 1, 11, 12 In fact, the presence of OSA has been used to explain the "obesity paradox" wherein obese patients with established cardiovascular disease have better outcomes than their leaner counterparts. 13, 14 We used the nation‐wide inpatient database to compare in‐hospital outcomes of patients with and without recognized OSA with a primary discharge diagnosis of ST‐elevation MI (STEMI). We also studied the comparative resource utilization, including in‐hospital procedures, hospital charges, and hospital length of stay, in these patients.

### The great controversy of obstructive sleep apnea treatment for cardiovascular risk benefit: advancing the science through expert consensus. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1114KLKj]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) positive airway pressure (PAP) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit — randomized trials' primary analyses showed no significant benefit, with post hoc signals only when PAP was used for > 4 hours per night and with adherence-linked stroke reduction, but such subgroup findings must be interpreted cautiously due to potential healthy adherer bias and residual confounding. Taken together, the current evidence does not support the use of PAP among asymptomatic patients with OSA to reduce CVD risk, and there is an absence of prospective RCT data regarding CVD outcomes after treatment of OSA among symptomatic patients. Trial context may limit detectable effects: limited PAP adherence averaged 3–5 hours per night; in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) settings a report noted resolution of OSA among 11%, and OSA in ACS may be transient with improvement after cardiovascular recovery; additionally, many secondary prevention trial participants were already receiving therapies that may also treat downstream effects of OSA. Epidemiologic observations also vary over time, as high OSA prevalence in ACS cohorts did not persist six months later.

3.1 Study selection and baseline characteristics

Among the retrieved 813 articles, 85 were excluded because of duplication, and 728 articles were excluded after review of the title or abstract, 21 articles were reviewed in full text, and nine studies (2590 participants) met the inclusion criteria. (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Study identification and selection. Flow chart for the systematic review and meta‐analysis as per the preferred reporting. System for systematic review and meta‐analysis (PRISMA)

The summary and baseline characteristics of patients included in these trials are shown in Table 1. The meta‐analysis included two retrospective cohort studies, four prospective cohort studies, and three RCTs, published from 2004 to 2020. All studies except onewere single‐center trials. The median of sample size was 129 (range from 46 to 1255). The median of average age of study participants was 60.3 years (range of average age from 55.1 to 68.3 years) and 83.3% of participants were men (range from 82.2% to 98.1%). The median of average BMI of patients was 28.3 (range from 27.3 to 34.1) and the median of AHI was 30.6 events/h (range from 21.7 to 42.8 events/h). All participants enrolled in these studies were diagnosed with OSA and CAD. Diagnosis of OSA was based on polysomnography in all but and two trials, that used portable diagnostic device (PDD), with AHI equal to or more than 15 as cutoff value in most studies. Participants received standard intervention of CPAP in most studies. Usual care served as a control in all trials. The median duration of follow‐up was 57.6 months from 36 months to 86.5 months, and a small proportion of patients were lost to follow‐up (the maximum utmost up to 10%). The primary end point (MACE) was reported in all studies except for one, which only reported MI and repeat revascularization.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

The OSA‐ACS project (NCT03362385) is a large‐scale, prospective, observational study designed to investigate the relationship between OSA and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with ACS. The study design has been described previously. From June 2015 to January 2020, patients with ACS aged 18 to 85 years admitted to Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University were enrolled and underwent overnight sleep studies. The exclusion criteria were as follows: cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock, malignancy, and unsuccessful sleep studies (ie, inadequate and unsatisfactory recordings). Furthermore, patients with predominantly central sleep apnea (≥ 50% central events and a central apnea hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 10/h), or those receiving regular continuous positive airway pressure therapy (> 4 h/d and > 21 days/mo) were excluded. In the present post‐hoc analysis of the OSA‐ACS project, we only included patients with clear time of MI onset. MI was defined as ischemic symptoms, persistent ST‐segment elevation (≥ 1 mm), and an elevation of creatine‐phosphokinase concentration > 2 times the upper limit of normal, along with cardiac troponin T levels ≥ 0.1 ng/mL. The time of MI onset was determined by an individual patient's report of the chest pain that prompted hospital admission, which has been previously validated. All the patients with an MI onset between midnight to 5:59were asleep at the onset of the chest pain that led to their hospital admission. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as treatment with lipid‐lowering agents such as statins, or a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 70 mg/dL in individuals with clinical coronary artery disease. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg. Diabetes was defined as treatment with hypoglycemic agents or insulin, or a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL.

The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University (2013025). All participants provided written informed consent. The current study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Management of the hospitalized patient with sleep disordered breathing [^115KH6e3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) frequently comes to medical attention for the first time when patients are hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment of an associated condition (eg, poorly controlled hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, or problems related to management of diabetes mellitus). Diagnosis of SDB is generally performed in a specialized facility, which is often inconvenient and expensive for the hospitalized patient. Expectant perioperative management of patients with sleep apnea is critical, particularly if they are previously undiagnosed. An ideal diagnostic strategy for these patients has not been defined. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the mainstay of treatment of patients with sleep apnea. Unfortunately, it is often difficult for very ill patients to tolerate CPAP, unless it is administered with a high level of expertise.

### Meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcomes with continuous positive airway pressure therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^111EW161]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the main treatment of OSA. The present study explores the impact of CPAP on cardiovascular outcomes. A systematic search of electronic databases for randomized controlled trials comparing CPAP with medical therapy alone in patients with OSA who reported cardiovascular outcomes of interest was performed. The main outcome was major adverse cardiac events. Other outcomes included cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Fixed effect model was used in all analyses except for subgroup analysis in which the random effect DerSimonian and Laird's model was used. Four randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,780 patients were included. Compared with medical therapy alone, CPAP use was not associated with reduced risk of major adverse cardiac events (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78 to 1.15, p = 0.93, I² = 0%) except in the subgroup that wore CPAP > 4 hours (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94, p = 0.02, I² = 0%). Furthermore, no reduction in the risk of cardiac mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.97, p < 0.36, I² = 2%), myocardial infarction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.44, p < 0.15, I² = 47%), angina pectoris (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.50, p < 0.51, I² = 0%), stroke (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38, p < 0.0.86, I² = 0%), and transient ischemic attack (RR 1.36, 95% CI 00.69 to 2.68, p < 0.24, I² = 30%) was observed. Subgroup analysis of CPAP adherence in regards to cardiac outcomes showed that CPAP use is not associated with decreased risk of heart failure (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.66, p < 0.55, I² = 0%). In conclusion, compared with medical therapy alone, utilization of CPAP in patients with OSA is not associated with improved cardiac outcomes except in patients who wore it for > 4 hours.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Cz6V9]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and is associated with recurrent cardiovascular risk. However, whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces this risk remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of CPAP on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with concomitant CAD and OSA.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library from their inceptions to October 7, 2017. We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that described the association of CPAP treatment with cardiovascular events in patients with CAD and OSA. The primary outcome of interest was major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), including all-cause or cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, repeat revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. Outcomes data were pooled using random effects models and heterogeneity assessed with the I² statistic.

Results

We identified 9 studies (2 RCTs and 7 observational studies) with 1430 participants. The median follow-up duration was from 36 to 86.5 months. Treatment with CPAP was associated with a significantly lower risk of MACE in 6 observational studies (RR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39–0.94, P = 0.02), but this was not reproduced in 2 RCTs (RR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.32–1.02, P = 0.06). Similarly, CPAP significantly reduced the risk of all-cause death (4 observational studies) and cardiovascular death (3 observational studies), which were also not confirmed in RCTs.

Conclusions

The use of CPAP in patients with CAD and OSA might prevent subsequent cardiovascular events, which was only demonstrated in observational studies, but not in RCTs. The value of CPAP therapy as second prevention for CAD needs further investigation.

### Prognostic implications of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with acute coronary syndrome stratified by homocysteine level: a prospective cohort study [^114jfSWV]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

The OSA-ACS project (NCT03362385), executed by Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, is a large-scale, prospective cohort study attempting to assess the effects exerted by OSA on cardiovascular prognosis of ACS patients. Designing schemes of the project and criteria for patient recruitment have been explicitly described in our published data. Briefly, 18–85 years patients admitted for ACS from June 2015 to January 2020 were recruited to undergo overnight sleep monitoring after clinical stabilization of ACS. ACS was determined when diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or unstable angina (UA). Patients with cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, previous or present utilization of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), malignancy (life expectancy < 2 years), and invalid recordings during sleep study were further excluded. In addition, we also precluded those with central sleep apnea (≥ 50% central events or central apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 10 events/h) prevailing, regular CPAP therapy (> 3 months) after discharge and loss of follow-up. In current study, patients with serum Hcy ≤ 15 μmol/L were defined as normohomocysteinemia (NHcy) and the other with Hcy > 15 μmol/L were classified into hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) group, in accordance with prior studies.

This study cohered with the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, and was complied with the principles of Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was ratified by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University (2013025). All patients were asked to sign informed consent before enrollment.

### Effect of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Q57do]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Association of CPAP with all-cause and cardiovascular death

There were 5 studies (1080 participants) that reported outcomes of all-cause death. CPAP significantly reduced the risk of all-cause death in 4 observational studies (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39–0.94, P = 0.03; I² = 0%). However, the only RCT did not show significant risk reduction (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.30–2.02, P = 0.61) (Fig. 3).

Forest plot of the risk estimates for all-cause death in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to control

Cardiovascular death was evaluated in 5 studies with 866 participants. Similarly, CPAP therapy significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death in 3 observational studies (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12–0.68, I² = 0%), which were also not reproduced in 2 RCTs (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.12–1.41, I² = 0%) (Fig. 4).

Association of CPAP with individual cardiovascular events

We also evaluated the effect of CPAP on outcomes of MI in 5 studies (3 observational and 2 RCTs; 781 participants), stroke in 3 studies (1 observational and 2 RCTs; 612 participants), and repeat revascularization in 6 studies (5 observational and 1 RCTs; 886 participants). There was no association of CPAP with all individual cardiovascular events in both observational studies and RCTs (Figs. 5, 6, and 7).

### Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114WAyVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults.

Methods

This guideline is based on published literature from 1966 to September 2010 that was identified by using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. A supplemental MEDLINE search identified additional articles through October 2012. Searches were limited to English-language publications. The clinical outcomes evaluated for this guideline included cardiovascular disease (such as heart failure, hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction), type 2 diabetes, death, sleep study measures (such as the Apnea-Hypopnea Index), measures of cardiovascular status (such as blood pressure), measures of diabetes status (such as hemoglobin A1c levels), and quality of life. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using ACP's clinical practice guidelines grading system.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that all overweight and obese patients diagnosed with OSA should be encouraged to lose weight. (Grade: strong recommendation; low-quality evidence)

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends continuous positive airway pressure treatment as initial therapy for patients diagnosed with OSA. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence)

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends mandibular advancement devices as an alternative therapy to continuous positive airway pressure treatment for patients diagnosed with OSA who prefer mandibular advancement devices or for those with adverse effects associated with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. (Grade: weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Continuous positive airway pressure improves sleepiness but not calculated vascular risk in patients with minimally symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea: the MOSAIC randomised controlled trial [^112HhpFb]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) improves sleepiness and reduces vascular risk, but such treatment for the more prevalent, minimally symptomatic disease is contentious.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised controlled, parallel, hospital-based trial across the UK and Canada, recruited 391 patients with confirmed OSA (oxygen desaturation index > 7.5/h) but insufficient symptoms to warrant CPAP therapy. Patients were randomised to 6 months of auto-adjusting CPAP therapy, or standard care. Coprimary endpoints were change in Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and predicted 5-year mortality using a cardiovascular risk score (components: age, sex, height, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, cholesterol, creatinine, left ventricular hypertrophy, previous myocardial infarction or stroke). Secondary endpoints included some of the individual components of the vascular risk score, objectively measured sleepiness and self-assessed health status.

Results

Of 391 patients randomised, 14 withdrew, 347 attended for their follow-up visit at 6 months within the predefined time window, of which 341 had complete ESS data (baseline mean 8.0, SD 4.3) and 310 had complete risk score data. 22% of patients in the CPAP group reported stopping treatment and overall median CPAP use was 2:39 h per night. CPAP significantly improved subjective daytime sleepiness (adjusted treatment effect on ESS -2.0 (95% CI -2.6 to -1.4), p < 0.0001), objectively measured sleepiness and self-assessed health status. CPAP did not improve the 5-year calculated vascular risk or any of its components.

Conclusions

In patients with minimally symptomatic OSA, CPAP can reduce subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, and improve self-assessed health status, but does not appear to improve calculated vascular risk.

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^1146pknk]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 2 — medically hospitalized adults with an established diagnosis of moderate-to-severe OSA not currently on treatment: "the AASM suggests the use of inpatient treatment with positive airway pressure rather than no positive airway pressure. (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence)". Remarks specify that "When considering in-hospital OSA treatment, 1) patients who place a lower value on the potential reduction of clinically meaningful outcomes… and place a higher value on the possible downsides associated with the use of PAP…, or 2) clinicians who perceive that the diagnosis or management of OSA may interfere with medical care, would reasonably decline OSA screening or PAP during the hospitalization". Supporting evidence notes "The TF identified 16 RCTs… ", with "Six of the 16 RCTs" excluded from the stroke-recovery meta-analysis; certainty "was low", hospital PAP cost "was judged to be moderate", and "The intervention was deemed feasible to implement".

### Cardiovascular benefit of continuous positive airway pressure according to high-risk obstructive sleep apnoea: a multi-trial analysis [^11168phM]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Randomized trials of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in patients with cardiovascular disease have not detected reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). This study tested whether the cardiovascular benefit of CPAP occurs preferentially in high-risk OSA, characterized by greater OSA-related heart rate acceleration or hypoxaemia.

Methods

In a post hoc analysis of pooled Randomized Intervention with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Coronary Artery Disease and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, Impact of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Nonsleepy Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, and Sleep Apnoea Cardiovascular Endpoints Study randomized trials; outcomes were stratified by high-risk OSA status, defined by heart rate response following OSA respiratory events > 9.4 b.p.m. (third tertile) or oxygen desaturation area under baseline (hypoxic burden) > 87.1% min/h (third tertile). Cox mixed models quantified the CPAP treatment effect on MACCE (including cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke) within high-risk OSA and the difference vs low-risk status (primary test). Secondary analyses examined participants without excessive sleepiness (Epworth < 11 points) or without increased blood pressure (systolic/diastolic < 140/90mmHg).

Results

In 3549 participants, 16.6% and 16.3% reached the MACCE endpoint with CPAP (n = 1778) and usual care (n = 1771), respectively. The CPAP treatment effect was greater in participants with vs without high-risk OSA [interaction hazard ratio (iHR) .69, 95% confidence interval (CI) .50-.95, Pinteraction = .024; Nhigh-risk = 1832]. The differential effect was stronger in those without excessive sleepiness (iHR .59, 95% CI .41-.84; Nhigh-risk = 1509), or without increased blood pressure (iHR .54, 95% CI .36-.81; Nhigh-risk = 1244). Continuous positive airway pressure benefits in high-risk OSA were observed alongside harm in low-risk OSA.

Conclusions

Continuous positive airway pressure preferentially improves cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk OSA, while harm in low-risk OSA may counteract this effect. These findings provide a pathway to identify patients likely to benefit.
