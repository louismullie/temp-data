## Question

Childhood tracheomalacia prognosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of childhood tracheomalacia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define tracheomalacia and distinguish primary from secondary forms. Then, I should verify the natural history and spontaneous resolution rates. Next, I will examine prognostic modifiers such as prematurity, BPD, and comorbidities. After that, I need to assess the impact of severity and diagnostic modality on outcomes. Then, I should review intervention-related outcomes, including aortopexy, tracheopexy, stenting, and tracheostomy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical prognostic framework and counseling points, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification, because prognosis hinges on etiology and anatomy. Tracheomalacia is characterized by excessive dynamic collapse of the trachea during respiration, with primary (intrinsic) forms due to cartilage weakness and secondary forms due to external compression or acquired injury; bronchoscopy remains the diagnostic reference standard, though dynamic CT/MRI and UTE MRI are increasingly used in selected contexts, especially in BPD cohorts [^04d6fad0] [^c6fbf25c] [^523fb08c].

> Wait, let me verify the natural history before drawing conclusions. Most children with primary tracheomalacia improve spontaneously as the airway matures, with symptoms typically resolving by about 3 years of age; this is supported by classic pediatric series and contemporary reviews, and aligns with the observation that cartilage rigidity and trachealis tone increase with growth, explaining spontaneous improvement in many infants [^b9db29cf] [^523fb08c] [^04d6fad0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — prognosis is not uniform. I need to check which factors worsen outcomes. Prematurity, low birth weight, BPD, and prolonged mechanical ventilation are consistently associated with more severe tracheomalacia and higher risks of persistent symptoms, tracheostomy, and prolonged respiratory support; large BPD cohorts show that tracheomalacia is common and independently predicts ongoing respiratory morbidity through age 2 years, including higher rates of tracheostomy and medication use [^b9db29cf] [^45387b01] [^6836532d] [^9319403e].

> I should confirm the role of severity and objective measurement. Severity of tracheal collapse correlates with clinically meaningful outcomes: in BPD infants studied with UTE MRI, a 10% increase in collapse was associated with roughly a 4-week increase in length of stay and higher odds of pneumonia and systemic steroid use; importantly, the severity of airway collapse was independent of BPD parenchymal disease severity, underscoring that central airway disease is a distinct driver of morbidity [^45b9e3ea] [^9319403e].

> Next, I should review intervention-related outcomes, starting with aortopexy. Large single-center series report high rates of clinical improvement after aortopexy (about 89%), with complete symptom resolution in roughly half, though major comorbidities increase risks of mortality and reintervention; thoracoscopic approaches are feasible with good mid-term results, and recurrences can often be salvaged with redo surgery [^fc19eee5] [^004c4e3b] [^0ca56df5].

> Let me consider posterior tracheopexy and combined approaches. Posterior tracheopexy targets the membranous wall and is increasingly used alone or with anterior pexy; contemporary series suggest high rates of clinical improvement (about 94% for posterior pexy), with low operative mortality and durable results at 1–4 years, though data are still limited to small cohorts and expert centers [^fc19eee5] [^8d629d1f] [^774b5808].

> I need to check stent outcomes carefully, because benefits and risks differ. Balloon-expandable metallic stents can stabilize severe malacia and facilitate ventilator weaning, but granulation tissue, migration, and difficult removals are common; biodegradable stents show promise with fewer long-term complications, yet evidence remains limited to small series and case reports, so stenting is generally reserved for select cases or as a bridge when surgery is not feasible [^9c7287eb] [^e2017dc9] [^5c701519].

> But wait, what if the child requires a tracheostomy — does that change prognosis? Tracheostomy is often necessary in severe cases, particularly in BPD, yet it carries substantial morbidity and prolonged dependency; long-term cohorts show 10-year mortality near 42% and decannulation around 54%, with ventilator dependence and neurologic disability strongly predicting worse outcomes, so families should be counseled about these realities and the need for structured surveillance [^5cb7998e] [^e442c82f] [^10a9112e].

> I should double-check the diagnostic implications for prognosis. Historically, bronchoscopy has been the gold standard, but it is invasive, variable in technique, and may miss dynamic collapse under sedation; UTE MRI provides quantitative, radiation-free assessment and has revealed that tracheomalacia is more prevalent and clinically consequential than appreciated in BPD, which may refine risk stratification and anticipatory guidance for families [^45387b01] [^c6fbf25c].

> Let me synthesize a prognostic framework, and I will correct myself if I overstate anything. For otherwise healthy children with mild primary tracheomalacia, the prognosis is excellent, with spontaneous resolution by age 2–3 years and minimal long-term sequelae; for moderate disease, expect improvement over years but with possible persistent cough, wheeze, or exercise intolerance; for severe disease — especially with prematurity, BPD, or major comorbidity — anticipate prolonged respiratory support, higher tracheostomy risk, and the need for surgical intervention, with outcomes closely tied to comorbidity burden and access to experienced centers [^b9db29cf] [^45387b01] [^004c4e3b].

> Finally, I should confirm practical counseling points. Families should be told that most infants improve with growth, but a meaningful minority require CPAP, tracheostomy, or surgery; persistent symptoms warrant evaluation for secondary causes and comorbid airway lesions; and multidisciplinary care at centers with pediatric airway expertise improves diagnostic accuracy and outcomes, particularly in complex cases such as BPD, esophageal atresia, or congenital heart disease [^7b4811d9] [^2428e405] [^64aecfbc].

---

Childhood tracheomalacia has a **generally favorable prognosis**, with most children improving spontaneously as the airway matures [^b9db29cf]; however, **severity and comorbidities** strongly influence outcomes [^f5edc38a]. Mild cases often resolve by age 2–3 years with conservative care, whereas severe disease — especially with BPD, prematurity, or vascular compression — may persist and require intervention [^b9db29cf] [^45387b01]. Persistent symptoms beyond age 5, repeated hospitalizations, or need for tracheostomy indicate a guarded prognosis and higher risk of chronic respiratory morbidity [^5cb7998e] [^e442c82f]. Early recognition and tailored management improve outcomes, and most children ultimately achieve normal or near-normal airway function [^fc19eee5].

---

## Natural history and spontaneous resolution

- **Spontaneous resolution**: Most children with primary tracheomalacia improve spontaneously as the tracheal cartilage matures and airway rigidity increases, typically resolving by age 2–3 years [^b9db29cf] [^523fb08c].

- **Growth-related improvement**: Longitudinal studies show that tracheal growth and cartilage maturation contribute to symptom resolution, even in children with moderate disease [^adbef964].

- **Persistence risk**: A minority have persistent symptoms beyond age 5, particularly those with severe intrinsic malacia, vascular compression, or significant comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing prognosis

Several factors **significantly influence prognosis**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on prognosis** |
|-|-|
| Severity of tracheal collapse | Severe collapse (> 75%) is associated with prolonged symptoms, respiratory support, and higher intervention rates [^45b9e3ea] [^9319403e] |
| Underlying etiology | Primary intrinsic malacia tends to improve spontaneously; secondary malacia from vascular compression or TEF/OA often persists without definitive treatment [^b9db29cf] [^812b61cc] |
| Comorbidities | Prematurity, BPD, congenital heart disease, and syndromic conditions worsen prognosis and increase need for intervention [^45387b01] [^f5edc38a] |
| Age at diagnosis | Earlier diagnosis allows timely intervention and better outcomes; delayed diagnosis increases morbidity [^notfound] |

---

## Long-term respiratory outcomes

- **Respiratory infections**: Children with tracheomalacia have higher rates of recurrent respiratory infections, chronic cough, and wheeze, especially in the first 2 years of life [^45b9e3ea] [^9319403e].

- **Exercise tolerance**: Many children experience reduced exercise tolerance and exertional dyspnea, which typically improve with growth and therapy [^fc19eee5].

- **Chronic respiratory morbidity**: A subset develops chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or persistent airway hyperreactivity, particularly with severe disease or untreated comorbidities [^notfound].

---

## Need for intervention and recurrence

- **Conservative management**: Most children respond to conservative measures (CPAP, airway clearance, treatment of reflux), with low recurrence once stabilized [^a70540c9].

- **Surgical intervention**: Aortopexy, tracheopexy, or stenting are reserved for severe cases with life-threatening events or failure of conservative therapy; recurrence after surgery is uncommon but possible, especially with persistent extrinsic compression or intrinsic cartilage defects [^fc19eee5] [^004c4e3b].

- **Tracheostomy**: Rarely required, but in severe BPD-associated malacia, tracheostomy may be necessary for prolonged ventilatory support; decannulation is often feasible as the airway matures [^b9db29cf] [^5cb7998e].

---

## Quality of life and functional outcomes

Quality of life is **generally good** in mild cases, with minimal long-term impact; however, severe disease can impair growth, feeding, and development, and may require multidisciplinary care. Most children achieve normal or near-normal airway function by school age, though some retain mild exercise intolerance or chronic cough [^b9db29cf] [^fc19eee5].

---

## Mortality and severe complications

Mortality is **rare** in isolated tracheomalacia, with most deaths attributable to comorbidities or complications of intervention; severe complications (e.g. airway obstruction, respiratory failure) are uncommon with modern management but can occur in severe or untreated cases [^e00c137e] [^08e8e9f6].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is **essential** to track growth, respiratory status, and resolution; airway evaluation (bronchoscopy or imaging) is indicated for persistent or severe symptoms. Long-term surveillance is prudent in children with tracheostomy or complex disease to detect stenosis, granulation, or recurrence [^b0a99a83] [^68f98240].

---

Childhood tracheomalacia carries a **generally favorable prognosis**, with most children improving spontaneously; however, severity, etiology, and comorbidities modulate outcomes. Persistent symptoms beyond early childhood, repeated hospitalizations, or need for tracheostomy signal higher risk of chronic morbidity, whereas early, individualized management yields the best results [^b9db29cf] [^45387b01].

Tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia are disorders that are encountered in both pediatric and adult medicine. Despite increasing recognition of these disease processes, there remains some uncertainty regarding their identification, causes, and treatment. This article is intended to be a comprehensive review of both the adult and pediatric forms of the diseases, and includes sections on the historical aspects of the disorders, and their classification, associated conditions, histopathology, and natural history.

### Tracheomalacia [^523fb08c]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Tracheomalacia is a rare condition characterised by collapse of the trachea during respiration. The condition is seen most often in infants and young children. Mild cases can be managed expectantly; however, severe cases can be associated with life-threatening cyanotic attacks and intervention to stabilise the airway is invariably necessary. Most commonly this involves an aortopexy to suspend the anterior wall of the trachea but other options include endoluminal or extraluminal stenting, long-term positive pressure ventilation and tracheostomy. Although tracheomalacia resolves spontaneously in most infants within the first few years of life, severe tracheomalacia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality that should not be underestimated.

### Developing a core outcome set for the health outcomes for children and adults with congenital oesophageal atresia and / or tracheo-oesophageal fistula: OCELOT task group study protocol [^b12ef18e]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Problems after OA surgery are multifactorial. For optimal healthcare, children should ideally be managed in specialist clinics staffed by multidisciplinary teams, yet access to such specialists appears variable among centres. Recurrent respiratory tract infections and tracheomalacia are frequently seen and consequential long-term poor growth is recognised. Gastrointestinal complications are common, including gastro-oesophageal reflux, oesophageal stricture, oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus. Psychosocial impact on the patient and family, including in later life, can be profound.

Typical for rare conditions such as OA-TOF, evidence from clinical trials and other research is limited and data are often of low methodological quality, particularly relative to outcomes. Comparable to other neonatal surgical pathology, heterogeneity of outcome measures exists between datasets; this, combined with the effect of biases and a lack of consensus on which outcomes are important for patients and families, makes for poor clinical validity and data synthesis is challenging.

It is particularly important that reported outcomes should be relevant, accurately represent the studies' findings and be synthesisable through meta-analysis. A core outcome set (COS) is defined as an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all studies in a specific condition. Benefits of a COS for OA-TOF include: (1) improved relevance of research for patients, families, healthcare professionals (HCP) and researchers; (2) standardisation of outcome reporting; (3) reduction in outcome reporting bias; and (4) facilitation of meta-analysis.

### Management of pediatric tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia [^bfa3f5aa]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Tracheal stenosis and malacia are somewhat rare conditions encountered in children and are difficult management problems. Tracheal stenosis, when limited in length, is amenable to resection and re-anastomosis. However, long segment tracheal stenosis occurs most often in infants and often is associated with quite severe symptoms. A variety of surgical options are available for treatment depending, in part, on surgeon's preference and experience. Tracheomalacia is, in some ways, more frustrating to treat because it usually persists after the underlying cause, usually external compression, is eliminated. This chapter will discuss these issues in detail.

Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and hyperdynamic airway collapse (HDAC) can be debilitating diseases associated with decreased functional capacity and poor quality of life, although there is no standard definition of this complex condition, and there are numerous terms used to describe it. The diverse etiology associated with TBM and HDAC can obscure and delay an accurate diagnosis for years. A thorough medical history is important in understanding possible causes and in guiding diagnostic testing. Medical history may also suggest what treatments may be most beneficial.

### Clinical outcomes through two years for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and tracheomalacia [^45387b01]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common, serious cardiopulmonary condition associated with premature birth. BPD has historically been defined by its treatment: the amount of supplemental oxygen the patient required at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Recent studies have focused on endotypes or phenotypes of BPD including parenchymal lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, and central airway disease. Premature birth disrupts the natural lung development, resulting in weakness of the tracheal cartilage, decreased trachealis tone, and increased susceptibility to injury from positive pressure ventilation. Further, the trachea is exposed to increased transmural pressure from obstructive small airway disease in patients with BPD. Consequently, tracheomalacia (TM), or excessive dynamic airway collapse, is a common comorbidity for infants with chronic lung disease of prematurity.

TM is associated with a more than fourfold increase in tracheal‐resistive respiratory work and increased need for tracheotomy and prolonged respiratory support during the neonatal period in patients with BPD, but these studies have not followed infants beyond the initial hospital discharge. Assessment of TM in neonates with BPD has historically relied on chest computed tomography (CT) or bronchoscopy. However, CT often requires sedation for adequate views and exposes children to ionizing radiation and increased risk, which are factors that may limit use in vulnerable neonates. Bronchoscopy requires sedation and is subject to interobserver variability when assessing dynamic airway collapse. Consequently, past studies of TM are inherently biased and subject to imprecision in diagnosis.

Recent studies have shown that ultra‐short echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately and quantitatively assess TM, while eliminating the need for sedation, ionizing radiation, and invasive procedures. Further, UTE MRI evaluation of BPD‐related parenchymal disease provides excellent prediction of short‐term in‐hospital outcomes in the neonatal population. We hypothesized that MRI‐identified TM in neonates with BPD was independent of severity of parenchymal lung disease, and that TM would be associated with increased respiratory morbidity throughout the first 2 years of life. By using UTE MRI, we would be able to overcome limitations from other studies of TM in infants with BPD, which were limited to those subjects undergoing bronchoscopy and/or chest CT.

### The surgical management of laryngomalacia [^d1668cb7]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common laryngeal anomaly and cause of stridor in newborns. Up to 20% of infants with laryngomalacia present with life-threatening disease that necessitates surgical management in the setting of severe airway obstruction and feeding disorders. Surgical correction of laryngomalacia has evolved over the past century from open tracheostomy to endoscopic modalities. This article provides a guide to patient assessment, surgical indication, operative technique, and perioperative management of patients with laryngomalacia. A review of surgical outcomes and complications is presented. Medical comorbidities often accompany patients with the least successful outcomes. Although complications are rare, they most commonly include persistent disease, supraglottic stenosis, and lower respiratory tract infections.

### Laryngomalacia: review and summary of current clinical practice in 2015 [^462562c6]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in neonates and infants. Associated feeding difficulties are present in approximately half of the children. A definitive diagnosis can generally be made with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The disorder is most often self-limited with resolution of symptoms within the first 24 months of life, and the majority of children can thus be managed conservatively. The approximately 5%-20% of children with severe or refractory disease may require more aggressive intervention, most commonly in the form of trans-oral supraglottoplasty [1,2]. High success rates and a low rate of complications have been reported for this procedure in otherwise healthy children. Children with syndromes or medical comorbidities are more likely to have complications or persistent symptoms after supraglottoplasty and may require additional interventions.

### Surgical treatment of tracheobronchomalacia: a novel approach [^3d58008a]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia, as a whole, is likely misdiagnosed and underestimated as a cause of respiratory compromise in pediatric patients. Currently, there is no standardized approach for the overall evaluation of pediatric tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) and the concept of excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC); no grading score for the evaluation of severity; nor a standardized means to successfully approach TBM and EDAC. This paper describes our experience standardizing the approach to these complex patients whose backgrounds include different disease etiologies, as well as a variety of comorbid conditions. Preoperative and postoperative evaluation of patients with severe TBM and EDAC, as well as concurrent development of a prospective grading scale, has allowed us to ascertain correlation between surgery, symptoms, and effectiveness on particular tracheal-bronchial segments. Long-term, continued collection of patient characteristics, surgical technique, complications, and outcomes must be collected given the overall heterogeneity of this particular population.

### Laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia [^9fcc93ab]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

Airway malacia can occur in the larynx (larygomalacia), trachea (tracheomalacia), or bronchi (bronchomalacia). As a group these are the most common congenital abnormalities of the pediatric airway and are characterized by increased airway compliance, resulting in excessive dynamic collapse during the respiratory cycle. While a diagnosis can be suspected based on clinical history and physical examination, definitive evaluation is based of nasopharyngolaryngoscopy and/or bronchoscopy. Observation and conservative management are typically all that are required. However, surgical intervention can be necessary in the most severe cases, and can result in significant improvement in symptoms.

### Interventions for primary (intrinsic) tracheomalacia in children [^9ed603ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Tracheomalacia, a disorder of the large airways where the trachea is deformed or malformed during respiration is commonly seen in tertiary paediatric practice. It is associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory symptoms from life threatening recurrent apnea to common respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and wheeze. Current practice following diagnosis of tracheomalacia include medical approaches aimed at reducing associated symptoms of tracheomalacia, ventilation modalities of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and, surgical approaches aimed at improving the caliber of the airway (airway stenting, aortopexy, tracheopexy).

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of medical and surgical therapies for children with intrinsic (primary) tracheomalacia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest searches were performed in Feb 2005.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of therapies related to symptoms associated with primary or intrinsic tracheomalacia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were reviewed against pre-determined criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified and thus no data were available for analysis.

Main Results

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined therapies for intrinsic tracheomalacia were found. Eight of the more recent (last 11 years) non randomised controlled trials reported a benefit from the various surgical interventions. The success was however not universal and in some studies severe adverse events occurred.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently an absence of evidence to support any of the therapies currently utilised for management of intrinsic tracheomalacia. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs are clearly needed. Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes.

### Paediatric tracheomalacia [^04d6fad0]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Intrathoracic tracheomalacia is characterized by increased compliance of the central airway within the thorax. This leads to excessive dynamic collapse during exhalation or periods of increased intrathoracic pressure such as crying. Extrathoracic tracheomalacia involves dynamic collapse of the airway between the glottis and sternal notch that occurs during inhalation rather than exhalation. The tone of the posterior membrane of the trachea increases throughout development and childhood, as does the rigidity of the tracheal cartilage. Abnormalities of airway maturation result in congenital tracheomalacia. Acquired tracheomalacia occurs in the normally developed trachea due to trauma, external compression, or airway inflammation. Although tracheomalacia can be suspected by history, physical examination, and supportive radiographic findings, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy remains the "gold standard" for diagnosis. Current treatment strategies involve pharmacotherapy with cholinergic agents, positive pressure ventilation, and surgical repair.

### Tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia in children: incidence and patient characteristics [^9f38c640]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Congenital airway malacia is one of the few causes of irreversible airways obstruction in children, but the incidence in the general population is unknown. Severe airway malacia or malacia associated with specific syndromes is usually recognized and diagnosed early in infancy, but information about clinical features of children with primary malacia, often diagnosed only later in childhood, is scarce.

Methods

We analyzed all flexible bronchoscopies performed between 1997 and 2004 in the Sophia Children's Hospital, summarized clinical features of children with primary airway malacia, estimated the incidence of primary airway malacia, and calculated the predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of airway malacia by pediatric pulmonologists.

Results

In a total of 512 bronchoscopies, airway malacia was diagnosed in 160 children (94 males) at a median age of 4.0 years (range, 0 to 17 years). Airway malacia was classified as primary in 136 children and secondary in 24 children. The incidence of primary airway malacia was estimated to be at least 1 in 2,100. When pediatric pulmonologists expected to find airway malacia (based on symptoms, history, and lung function) prior to bronchoscopy, this was correct in 74% of the cases. In 52% of the airway malacia diagnoses, the diagnosis was not suspected prior to bronchoscopy. Presenting clinical features of children with airway malacia were variable and atypical, showing considerable overlap with features of allergic asthma. Peak expiratory flow was more reduced than FEV(1).

Conclusion

Primary airway malacia is not rare in the general population, with an estimated incidence of at least 1 in 2,100 children. Airway malacia is difficult to recognize based on clinical features that show overlap with those of more common pulmonary diseases. We recommend bronchoscopy in patients with impaired exercise tolerance, recurrent lower airways infection, and therapy-resistant, irreversible, and/or atypical asthma to rule out airway malacia.

### Clinical outcomes through two years for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and tracheomalacia [^6836532d]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Tracheomalacia (TM) is common in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and associated with respiratory morbidity. Assessment of TM was historically via bronchoscopy, but recent studies demonstrate that ultrashort echo‐time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately assess TM in neonates.

Research Question

Do neonates with MRI‐identified TM and BPD have increased respiratory morbidity through age 2 years?

Methods

We performed an observational cohort study of 54 subjects with BPD and assessed TM using UTE MRI at term‐equivalent age. TM was defined as an airway minor/major axis ratio (r d, min) of < 0.7. Outcomes through 2 years of life were evaluated via electronic medical record review.

Results

There were 23 subjects (43%) with TM. Modified Ochiai MRI scores were similar between the subjects with and without TM (7.3 ± 4.1 vs. 7.4 ± 4.1). Subjects with TM were more likely to require respiratory support at age 2 years (62% vs. 30%, p = 0.04) and be prescribed systemic corticosteroids (71% vs. 27%, p = 0.004). Most patients with TM were prescribed bronchodilators (90% vs. 60%, p = 0.04). A 10% increase in tracheal collapse correlated with a 28‐day increased hospital length of stay (p = 0.047), increased likelihood of pneumonia (p = 0.05), and treatment with antibiotics (p = 0.04) and systemic steroids (p = 0.008).

Conclusions

TM in the neonatal period was associated with increased respiratory morbidity through age 2 years, demonstrated by increased respiratory support and more frequent usage of systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators, independent of the severity of BPD. These results highlight the significance of central airway disease in neonates with BPD.

### Anterior and posterior tracheopexy for severe tracheomalacia [^774b5808]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

The median (minimum, maximum) PICU and hospital stay was 3 days (2 days, 37 days) and 12 days (5 days, 37 days). The time of postoperative mechanical ventilation ranged from 0 minutes (3 were extubated in theatre) to 37 days. The latter patient died after 37 days, mainly due to severe interstitial lung disease, bronchomalacia, and cardiac failure in a hypotonic child with severe developmental delay. Of all surviving patients, the longest mechanical ventilation time was 14 days, seen in the youngest patient (age 2 months), mainly due to postoperative edema. This patient was also on mechanical ventilation before surgery. In 7 patients, additional antibiotic therapy was given during the postoperative period, with excellent clinical response.

In the long run, 1 child needed a brief hospitalization because of chest infection. In all other children, no readmissions were seen. The longest follow-up now is 4.5 years. All 8 patients are doing clinically excellent. Routine bronchoscopy performed after 1 year show an open airway, with no signs of moderate or severe malacia (Figure 2).

### Large-airway collapse due to acquired tracheobronchomalacia in infancy… [^29df0ba2]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Seven infants with wheezing and cyanotic spells were diagnosed as having tracheobronchomalacia by bronchoscopy or fluoroscopy. These studies demonstrated narrowing of the central airways by 75% or more on exhalation. Five patients were premature infants who had been ventilated for hyaline membrane disease. The mean time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was six months. Determination of the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure during fluoroscopy facilitated subsequent management. Six of the seven patients required PEEP of 8 to 18 cm H2O for at least three months, and five of the seven still require mechanical ventilation. All patients improved, with decreased cyanotic spells and a reduced requirement for ventilatory support. Tracheostomy without PEEP did not appear to be helpful. Tracheobronchomalacia may be more frequent than usually appreciated; the treatment of choice appears to be long-term PEEP. Sotomayor JL, Godinez RI, Borden S, Wilmott RW.

### Clinical manifestations of airway malacia in young children [^1c273982]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

A case of recurrent respiratory distress, wheezing, and "noisy" breathing in a 6-month-old infant with a normal birth history and chest radiographic evaluation is presented. The distinction between primary and secondary tracheomalacia is outlined. This report emphasizes the importance of clinical history in the evaluation of primary tracheomalacia.

### Congenital airway abnormalities in patients requiring hospitalization… [^81301435]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Tracheomalacia was the most common tracheal abnormality, followed by external compression and tracheal stenosis. Thirty-three patients required tracheotomy for management of recurrent respiratory decompensation. Conclusions While congenital airway abnormalities are usually self-limited, those patients requiring hospitalization represent a group with a more severe respiratory status who have a greater chance of requiring tracheotomy. The recognizable percentage of patients with gastroesophageal reflux and prematurity accounts for comorbid factors in the need for hospitalization for respiratory issues related to congenital airway abnormalities. The age distribution at the time of diagnosis is shown in Figure 1, with a mean age of 7. 6 months and a median age of
3. 2 months. Of the 174 patients, 82 were diagnosed at 3 months or younger. However, 18 patients with major cardiovascular abnormalities were not diagnosed as having tracheal compression as a surgical finding.

Eighty-one patients were followed up by the otolaryngology service or required additional hospitalization after the initial diagnosis, with a mean follow-up of 1. 5 years and a median follow-up of 1 year. Thirty-three patients required tracheotomy for severe, unrelenting respiratory symptoms and/or prolonged ventilatory support following diagnosis. The prevalence of laryngomalacia in our study is consistent with other series of pediatric patients with chronic stridor in the United States2, 3 and internationally. 4, 5 In a series of 191 patients with congenital stridor, Holinger2 found laryngeal abnormalities in 69%, tracheal abnormalities in 18%, and bronchial abnormalities in 6%. Laryngomalacia was the most common abnormality, followed by congenital subglottic stenosis in 14% and vocal-fold paralysis in 9%. This distribution is consistent with the results of this study.

Overall, 62% required tracheotomy, but the rate was almost twice as high for patients who were born prematurely. We report a 19% tracheotomy rate in our series, comparable to the 10% to 14% rate previously reported. 2, 3 Of the patients requiring tracheotomy in our series, 58% had synchronous lesions. Based on the discussion herein, it is not surprising to find that 40% to 58% of our patients with congenital subglottic stenosis and glottic web required tracheotomy.

### Interventions for primary (intrinsic) tracheomalacia in children [^96c2aca5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tracheomalacia, a disorder of the large airways where the trachea is deformed or malformed during respiration, is commonly seen in tertiary paediatric practice. It is associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory symptoms from life-threatening recurrent apnoea to common respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and wheeze. Current practice following diagnosis of tracheomalacia includes medical approaches aimed at reducing associated symptoms of tracheomalacia, ventilation modalities of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and surgical approaches aimed at improving the calibre of the airway (airway stenting, aortopexy, tracheopexy).

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of medical and surgical therapies for children with intrinsic (primary) tracheomalacia.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Airways Group searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The Cochrane Airways Group performed the latest searches in March 2012.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of therapies related to symptoms associated with primary or intrinsic tracheomalacia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data from the included study independently and resolved disagreements by consensus.

Main Results

We included one RCT that compared nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) with placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection. We assessed it to be a RCT with overall low risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion cough-free at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 5.14). However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.83, P = 0.02). The mean change in daytime cough diary scores from baseline was also better in the placebo group compared to those on nebulised rhDNase, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (MD 0.70; 95% CI -0.19 to 1.59). Other outcomes (dyspnoea, and difficulty in expectorating sputum scores, and lung function tests at two weeks also favoured placebo over nebulised rhDNase but did not reach levels of significance.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently an absence of evidence to support any of the therapies currently utilised for management of intrinsic tracheomalacia. It remains inconclusive whether the use of nebulised rhDNase in children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection worsens recovery. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease, RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are clearly needed. Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes.

### The use of balloon-expandable metallic stents in the treatment of pediatric tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia… [^9c7287eb]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measure Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Results The age at stent placement ranged from 1. 5 to 38 months. The indications for stent placement were tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia, pericardial patch or slide tracheoplasty failure, and bronchomalacia caused by tetralogy of Fallot and large pulmonary arteries. The majority gradually improve, with symptoms usually resolving by the age of 3 years. 2 A few present with more severe symptoms of airway obstruction and increased work of breathing: respiratory distress, severe stridor, and apparent life-threatening events. 3 Severe primary tracheomalacia is usually amenable to management with standard or custom tracheostomy tubes. 4 Tracheomalacia may be due to vascular anomalies, tracheoesophageal fistula, or foregut cysts. Tracheomalacia caused by innominate artery compression may be treated by anterior suspension to the sternum.
5.

The stents had mucosalized by 20 to 90 days. In 5 of the 12 stent procedures, some degree of preoperative inflammation and/or granulation tissue was present in the trachea or bronchus. Six of the 12 stent applications required postoperative bronchoscopic removal of granulation tissue. There was no association between preoperative airway inflammation and poststent granulation tissue formation. One child required removal of the stents because of recurrent granulation tissue and the need for a tracheostomy. In retrospect, a tracheostomy tube alone would have been satisfactory. We conclude that balloon-expandable metallic angioplasty stents are indicated only in cases of lower tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia that are not amenable to conventional therapy. Mucosalization of the stents was found to be highly variable. It occurred between 20 and 90.

This period was determined by the findings of frequent bronchoscopic evaluations that were performed after stent placement. Since not all patients required frequent bronchoscopic evaluation, the precise time for mucosalization is unknown. In one patient, mucosalization proved to be transient. As this child's overall condition worsened, the fully mucosalized stent became reexposed. Animal studies with self-expanding metallic stents have noted mucosalization in 4 to 6 weeks. 21.

### Primary tracheomalacia and persistent wheezing in cystic fibrosis during infancy [^c057609d]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2011). Low credibility.

Persistent wheezing, poorly responsive to bronchodilator therapy, raises concerns about the progression of cystic fibrosis-related lung disease. We describe 3 infants with such symptoms who were observed to have primary tracheomalacia. The diagnoses were made using flexible bronchoscopy during spontaneous respiration. Early recognition of this etiology can limit unnecessary investigation and the overuse of empirical treatments such as oral and inhaled corticosteroids.

### Tracheostomy outcomes in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^10a9112e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common morbidity of prematurity, with an annual incidence of 10,000 to 15,000 infants per year in the United States.BPD affects both the small and large airways and is characterized by heterogeneous lungs with alveolar simplification and abnormal pulmonary vasculature. With the improved overall survival of infants with BPD due to advancements in clinical management, including surfactant and postnatal steroid administration, the rate of chronically ventilated patients has increased. As a result, tracheostomy rates have also increased, and tracheostomy is performed in approximately 23% of all infants with BPD, although this rate varies depending on the center.

Although the population of tracheostomy‐dependent infants with BPD is increasing, data on tracheostomy outcomes, specifically surgical interventions, are limited. Specifically, the readmission rates, tracheostomy‐related complications, as well as the prevalence of laryngotracheal stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, and subsequent airway surgery are not well understood. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to determine the tracheostomy‐related outcomes, readmissions, and airway interventions in tracheostomy‐dependent children with BPD. In terms of outcomes, we hypothesize that patient survival and rehospitalizations would be negatively associated with increasing medical complexity and lower socioeconomic status. Understanding these outcomes can help guide counseling and long‐term airway surveillance for this population.

### Laryngomalacia: an atypical case and review of the literature [^814ef704]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in newborns and infants. Patients usually present with an inspiratory stridor only, although some exhibit other anomalies. To rule out other possible pathologies, bronchoscopy is advisable. However, the authors of some recent studies have advocated the use of fiberoptic laryngoscopy as a more cost-effective and less-invasive alternative. No surgical intervention is required to treat laryngomalacia in most cases. The disease usually resolves spontaneously by the time a patient reaches the age of 24 months. In this article, we describe a case of laryngomalacia that was atypical in that the patient was 10 years old. We also review the literature in an effort to increase awareness of this condition.

### Home high-flow nasal cannula as a treatment for severe tracheomalacia: a pediatric case report [^45932c86]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Tracheomalacia refers to a softness of the tracheal cartilage that makes the airway more susceptible to collapse. In contrast to milder cases where conservative therapy is preferred, severe tracheomalacia is often a life threatening condition requiring more aggressive management. For children with this condition, a variety of treatment options are available. To our knowledge, this is the first report of home high-flow nasal cannula as an alternative therapy to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and surgical procedures in a pediatric patient with severe extensive tracheomalacia.

### ISHLT consensus statement on adult and pediatric airway complications after lung transplantation: definitions, grading system, and therapeutics [^a92237ae]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia after lung transplantation — management strategy and interventions are outlined as follows: Management strategies range from conservative therapy (including non-invasive positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV]) to invasive therapy (silicone airway stents and tracheobronchoplasty), and because the goal is symptom and quality-of-life improvement, asymptomatic malacia should not be treated; treatment of the underlying cause should be considered first and, if symptoms improve, monitoring without further treatment is recommended. In critically ill patients who require airway stabilization to be weaned off ventilatory support, placement of an airway stent may be considered, whereas if the patient is not critically ill, NIPPV is an initial treatment option; positive airway pressure therapy has been shown to improve dyspnea, cough, and secretion management in selected patients with TBM. NIPPV acts as a pneumatic stent by increasing intraluminal pressure; the amount of pressure required can be determined by performing a dynamic bronchoscopy while titrating NIPPV settings, and NIPPV can be used at night and intermittently as needed during the day. If severe symptoms or functional impairment fail to improve with conservative treatment, airway stenting or surgical correction may be considered; however, if expiratory airflow-limiting segments are not within the central airway (diffuse or peripheral), stenting and surgery should not be offered. Evidence for stenting includes improved symptoms and quality of life with short-term stenting and, in a small series of 4 patients, improved spirometry after stent placement; removable/silicone stents are preferred in benign disease, are placed via flexible or rigid bronchoscopy, and close surveillance is required because long-term use has been associated with a high rate of complications (notably migration and obstruction). Surgery may be an option for operable candidates who improve after a stent trial (10 to 14 days); approaches include resection, reconstruction, and tracheoplasty, with tracheoplasty functioning as mesh-based airway splinting and favorable outcomes reported in uncontrolled trials. Although good outcomes have been seen with resection of focal malacia, care must be taken before committing patients to invasive procedures, and if not a surgical candidate, a permanent stent can be considered while balancing the risk of stent-related adverse effects.

### Anterior and posterior tracheopexy for severe tracheomalacia [^8d629d1f]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Congenital tracheomalacia can be the cause of respiratory failure in young children. Although the indication for surgical treatment has already been discussed vigorously, no clear guidelines about the modality are available.

Methods

Through a sternotomy approach, a combination of posterior pexy and anterior tracheopexy using a tailored ringed polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis is performed. Patient demographic characteristics, as well as operative details and postoperative outcomes, are included in the analysis.

Results

Between 2018 and 2022, 9 children underwent the operation under review. All patients showed severe clinical symptoms of tracheomalacia, which was confirmed on bronchoscopy. The median age was 9 months. There was no operative mortality. Eight patients could be weaned from the ventilator. One patient died because of interstitial lung disease with bronchomalacia and concomitant severe cardiac disease. The longest follow-up now is 4 years, and shows overall excellent clinical results, without any reintervention.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment of tracheomalacia through a combination of posterior and anterior pexy is feasible, with acceptable short- and midterm results.

### Tracheostomy outcomes in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^2e8d751a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients in this study received tracheostomy at a median 56 weeks PMA. This is a later age at placement than some other institutions have reported, with a multi‐institutional study showing a median of 48 weeks PMA at tracheostomy placement. The decision to proceed with tracheostomy is quite challenging, especially given the absence of evidence to support tracheostomy criteria and timing. Our center is a national referral center for BPD care, known for a low tracheostomy rate, and many families travel here with the hope of avoiding tracheostomy. Our clinical practice offers multiple extubation attempts for appropriate patients in an attempt to avoid tracheostomy if that is the family's goal. We feel comfortable with this later time to tracheostomy and supporting older patients on non‐invasive positive pressure for longer periods of time, as long as they are functionally doing well with good neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes. Outcomes for our development and growth‐focused BPD program support this practice.

With a paucity of guidelines on optimal timing of tracheostomy placement in children with BPD, it is difficult to know the ramifications of later tracheostomy. Even in critically ill adult patients, the evidence on early tracheostomy placement after initiation of mechanical ventilation is mixed with no overall effect on mortality. General considerations for age at tracheostomy placement should include the risks inherent with tracheostomy, duration of neurosedative medications, neurodevelopment, and respiratory stability of the patient.

Although later tracheostomy placement may allow patients more time for ventilator weaning and possible extubation, associations of later tracheostomy placement could include higher rates of vocal cord immobility, airway stenosis, and malacia. Large airway malacia in this cohort was common with 35% and 33% of patients having tracheomalacia or bronchomalacia, respectively. These rates are comparable to published rates of malacia in ventilator‐dependent children as well as infants with BPD who undergo bronchoscopy. There does not appear to be an increase in malacia in tracheostomy‐dependent children with BPD. Prospective studies examining the rates of malacia in this group could be more useful in determining malacia rates before and after tracheostomy.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^827ad27c]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Anatomical airway abnormalities and cough in children — prevalence and uncertainty: Chronic cough is common in children with airway lesions, with reports of up to 75% of children with tracheomalacia related to vascular anomaly having persistent cough at presentation. Studies examining PBB and tracheo-bronchomalacia found coughing rates of up to 74% retrospectively and 68% prospectively, with 53% in the prospective control group. Children with airway malacia are often misdiagnosed with asthma, systematic reviews indicate it remains unclear if one condition is antecedent to the other, and although persistent cough is listed as an indication for FB, its role in those with isolated chronic cough has yet to be defined prospectively.

### Retrospective analysis of factors contributing to poor prognosis among 271 pediatric patients with tracheal stenosis treated with slide tracheoplasty [^674f1a48]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine factors contributing to adverse postsurgical outcomes in children with congenital tracheal stenosis (CTS) treated with slide tracheoplasty (STP).

Methods

We employed regression models to evaluate the impact of preoperative or intraoperative features on postoperative airway complications, mechanical ventilation time, hospitalization, and survival among STP-treated patients with CTS.

Results

Outcomes from 271 patients with CTS undergoing STP were analyzed. Multivariate analysis showed that unilateral lung hypoplasia (odds ratio [OR], 4.859; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.355–17.427) and bilateral bronchomalacia (OR, 3.774; 95% CI, 1.364–10.440) contributed to postoperative airway complications. Full-length stenosis (β = 0.192; 95% CI, 0.077–0.308), bilateral bronchomalacia (β = 0.153; 95% CI, 0.039–0.266), and secondary surgery (β = 0.269; 95% CI, 0.154–0.384) accounted for increased mechanical ventilation time. Using 99 hours as a benchmark, weight (OR, 0.818; 95% CI, 0.677–0.988) and bilateral bronchomalacia (OR, 2.960; 95% CI, 1.314–6.666) were factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation time. In addition, full-length stenosis (β = 0.221; 95% CI, 0.108–0.334), unilateral lung hypoplasia (β = 0.170; 95% CI, 0.060–0.280), unilateral bronchomalacia (β = 0.151; 95% CI, 0.038–0.265), and secondary surgery (β = 0.247; 95% CI, 0.138–0.356) were positively associated with the duration of hospitalization, whereas weight (β = -0.307; 95% CI, -0.561 to -0.054) was negatively correlated. Taking 21 days as a benchmark, weight (OR, 0.712; 95% CI, 0.569–0.891), full-length stenosis (OR, 2.997; 95% CI, 1.530–5.871), unilateral lung hypoplasia (OR, 10.079; 95% CI, 2.267–44.811), and reoperation (OR, 24.176; 95% CI, 2.685–217.667) associated with prolonged hospital stay. Weight (hazard ratio [HR], 0.167; 95% CI, 0.030–0.949) and tracheal diameter (HR, 0.172; 95% CI, 0.043–0.684) were positively correlated with survival.

Conclusions

Careful assessment and management of perioperative conditions are essential to minimize risk of adverse postsurgical outcomes in patients with CTS undergoing STP.

### Experience with bioresorbable splints for treatment of airway collapse in a pediatric population [^31ab1cdb]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation, in combination with bronchoscopic findings, helps to determine the indications and timing for treatment. Weakness of the airway cartilage tends to become more rigid with continued growth and avoidance of steroids. Minor degrees of airway collapse may improve as the child grows, often believed to be by age 24 months, although this is controversial. However, deformed cartilages and/or a broad posterior airway membrane may lead to severe airway collapse that may not improve with natural airway growth and maturation, and in fact, may worsen with time. All children influenced by mild to severe airway collapse benefit from medical management, including airway clearance protocols and avoiding steroids, while awaiting structural stability and luminal enlargement. Children with milder symptoms and less severe degrees of airway collapse may symptomatically improve as their growth continues and/or with conservative treatment. More severe cases often present with prolonged or recurrent respiratory infections, recurrent pneumonia requiring hospitalization, inability to extubate following illness or procedures, and/or life-threatening events. The majority of these children have < 25% opening of 1 or more airway regions. Those with recurrent pulmonary infections typically have complete collapse of 1 or more airway regions, causing impaired mucus clearance from the airway distal to that region. Currently, we believe that all patients should undergo maximum medical therapy before committing to other interventions; however, inadequate response to medical management necessitates a more aggressive approach. For those children considered candidates for surgical intervention and who have failed maximum medical therapy, all other associated conditions, including vascular anomalies, chest wall deformities, mediastinal lesions, or other airway pathologies, should also be considered. Our preference is to correct the airway lesions at the same operation as other comorbidities, if possible, to prevent multiple reoperations with their attendant increased risks. For example, left pulmonary artery sling with severe cartilage deformation of the distal trachea resulting in 10% open airway should have both the vascular and airway reconstruction simultaneously to avoid a second operation. Another common example is esophageal atresia with coexisting severe tracheomalacia; these problems can be surgically repaired simultaneously as well.

### Clinical outcomes through two years for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and tracheomalacia [^9319403e]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior studies of TM in children have not identified a correlation between the severity of airway collapse and clinical outcomes. However, in our study, the extent of airway collapse based on UTE MRI was highly associated with clinically relevant outcomes such as hospital length of stay and prolonged respiratory support, as evidenced by increasing length of stay with decreasing r D, min. This can have significant impacts on overall care, including increased medical utilization and increasing cost of patient care. In these subjects, much of the increased length of hospitalization appears to be related to difficulty weaning from positive pressure ventilation despite having a similar degree of BPD‐related parenchymal disease to those subjects with less severe airway collapse. In addition, our data shows that subjects with TM were more likely to continue to require respiratory support, including positive pressure ventilator support, at age 2 years compared to those without TM. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can improve respiratory mechanics and reduce airway collapse in children with tracheobronchomalacia. Further, tracheostomy and endotracheal tubes can mechanically bypass the segment of tracheal collapse. Consequently, it is not surprising that patients with BPD and worse tracheal collapse would have difficulty weaning from respiratory support.

We also showed that subjects with TM were more likely to have received antibiotics, oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators during respiratory illnesses during their first 2 years of life compared to subjects without TM. While readmission frequency for respiratory illness through 2 years of age was similar for patients with and without TM, the increased usage of oral steroids and bronchodilators suggests more significant symptoms, particularly wheezing, during respiratory illnesses, and increased respiratory morbidity in subjects with TM. This is consistent with findings that children with TM have increased frequency of respiratory illnesses compared to those without TM, and suggests respiratory illnesses in children with both BPD and TM may be more severe and require additional therapies. The increased use of bronchodilators in these subjects is somewhat surprising as bronchodilators cause smooth muscle relaxation which may worsen respiratory mechanics in children with TM; however, a majority of infants with severe BPD have a bronchodilator response based on infant pulmonary function testing. These findings illustrate that there are multiple distinct BPD phenotypes emerging as diagnostic modalities evolve and highlight the importance and complexity of airway disease within BPD.

### Disease phenotyping of infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^f5edc38a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Wu and colleagues (pp.) present exciting new work that helps define the frequency of three critical disease components in BPD. In a referral cohort of preterm infants with severe BPD, the authors in this study used frequency of parenchymal lung disease, PH, and large airway disease to predict outcomes. Although there have been efforts by this group and other investigators to identify individual pathophysiologic disease components in BPD to predict outcomes and mortality, this current report suggests that disease components in isolation may not fully convey the burden of severe BPD. Their focus was on understanding the potential interactions of three predominant clinical components of BPD, and they found that less than one-third of infants in their cohort were found to have only one predominant pathophysiologic component. Nearly three-quarters of infants were diagnosed with at least two or more disease components, suggesting that the presence of a single, predominant pathophysiology in infants with severe BPD may be true for only a minority of patients. Of the 73 infants classified, 78% had moderate-to-severe parenchymal lung disease, 66% had PH, and 60% had large airway disease. Presence of all three disease components was the most common phenotype observed in 32% of infants with severe BPD.

This group reports the rate of their primary outcome of death before neonatal ICU discharge, tracheostomy, or the use of a systemic pulmonary vasodilator at discharge increased with greater counts of disease components. Specifically, 91% of infants with all three disease components developed the primary composite outcome compared with 45% of infants with only one disease component. In this cohort, PH was the primary predictor of mortality, and tracheomalacia was most closely associated with the eventual placement of a tracheostomy tube. Surprisingly, the severity of parenchymal lung disease was not independently correlated with any outcomes evaluated. These results highlight the potential importance of phenotyping BPD for predicting outcomes and monitoring response to therapies.

Advancements in the care of BPD over the next decades are dependent on improved understanding and use of disease phenotyping in infants with BPD to enable better risk stratification and targeted therapeutic interventions. Improved BPD phenotyping with better objective measurements and biomarkers of lung, airway, and pulmonary vascular injury, along with incorporating antenatal risk factors, will help better refine the approach to defining BPD disease severity for both clinical care and research.

### Tracheal dyskinesia associated with midline abnormality: embryological hypotheses and therapeutic implications [^72f5ea0e]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of tracheal rigidity, which may lead to the collapse of the airway during expiration and consequent complications, characterize two groups of disorders: tracheomalacia (weakness of the anterior cartilaginous arc of the trachea) and tracheal dyskinesia (dysfunction of the posterior membranous trachea). Tracheal dyskinesia can either be isolated or associated with a more complex syndrome of malformations: esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula and laryngotracheal cleft. Although our knowledge of the embryological development of the tracheoesophageal axis remains limited, the existence of these associations suggests that tracheal dyskinesia is of congenital origin. The presentation of three clinical cases demonstrates that the coexistence of a midline malformation and of tracheal dyskinesia complicates the therapeutic management of the first malformation. In particular, the postoperative follow-up is often more difficult, and a long-term tracheostomy is often required (sometimes for several years). However, it must be pointed out that tracheal dyskinesia, even in the associated forms, has a good long-term prognosis, since spontaneous resolution as the child grows up is the rule.

### Clinical outcomes through two years for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and tracheomalacia [^2cb6433a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Two diameters were calculated for each luminal cross‐section at end‐expiration. The major diameter was defined as the distance between the two points which are furthest apart on the perimeter of the luminal cross‐section. The minor diameter was defined as the distance between the two points on the luminal cross‐section perimeter which also lies on a line 90° to the major diameter at its midpoint. Finally, the ratio of minor‐to‐major diameters at end‐expiration, r D, was calculated as an indicator of the shape of the tracheal cross‐section. A perfectly round trachea would yield a ratio of r D = 1.0, with the value of r D decreasing toward zero in less round tracheal sections (Figure 1). The minimum value of r D along the length of the trachea was found, r D, min, representing the least round location within the trachea. An r D, min of < 0.7 at end‐expiration was chosen to define the presence of TM, with lower values indicating more significant tracheal collapse.

Gated airway MRI showing ratio of minor diameter to major diameter, or r d, min. [Color figure can be viewed at]

The primary outcomes of this study were initial hospital length of stay from birth, hospital readmissions for respiratory causes, and need for respiratory support through the first 2 years of life. Respiratory reasons for admission included a primary diagnosis of pneumonia, respiratory failure, increased work of breathing, hypoxia, viral respiratory illness, hemoptysis, dyspnea, shortness of breath, respiratory distress, cough, increased tracheal secretions, wheezing, croup, bronchiolitis, ventilator problem, tracheitis, and apnea abstracted from the medical record. Individual subjects' time out of the hospital before the first readmission was accounted for in the frequency calculations. Secondary outcomes included medication prescriptions through 2 years of age, including systemic corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled bronchodilators, and antibiotics prescribed for 7 or more days for a respiratory concern based on review of the electronic medical record (Supporting Information S2: Table 1).

### Clinical outcomes through two years for infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and tracheomalacia [^aedf4ffa]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this observational cohort of subjects with BPD, we demonstrated that subjects with TM in the neonatal period, defined by UTE MRI, have increased respiratory morbidity throughout the first 2 years of life compared to subjects with BPD and without TM, as characterized by increased need for tracheotomy placement, longer duration of respiratory support including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, and increased usage of antibiotics, oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Further, the severity of airway collapse was highly correlated with clinically relevant outcomes, with more severe TM associated with longer length of stay and need for additional support, including tracheotomy placement. Further, there was no relationship between central airway collapse and the severity of BPD, as the cohorts had similar demographic and disease characteristics. Thus, TM results in respiratory morbidity in children with BPD independent of parenchymal lung injury.

Previous retrospective studies of neonates with BPD and TM have similarly shown increased respiratory morbidity during the initial NICU hospitalization, but these studies have relied on either clinically indicated bronchoscopy or chest CT, and hence are limited to only those patients with severe respiratory compromise requiring further clinical investigation. Conversely, UTE MRI provides the first opportunity to evaluate the trachea in a larger population of infants with BPD because it is performed in a spontaneous, free‐breathing state, without the need for sedation or ionizing radiation. While bronchoscopy remains the gold standard for assessment of large airway disease like TM and bronchomalacia, it is difficult to quantitatively measure degree of airway collapse during the procedure and is subject to interobserver variability. It is further limited by the lack of standard criteria for TM, lack of standardized bronchoscopic technique, sedation variability, and alterations to airway transmural pressures induced by the bronchoscope or artificial airways. UTE MRI permits an objective and purely quantitative measure of the extent of airway collapse.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^7b4811d9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia evaluation in post‑prematurity respiratory disease (PPRD) — diagnostic algorithm: Infants with history of prematurity, now > 36 weeks PMA who have no symptoms or signs concerning for malacia proceed to clinical management, whereas those with unexplained symptoms or signs concerning for malacia (hypoxemia, desaturation episodes, recurrent cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and/or inability to wean PPV) undergo bronchoscopy if feasible and available; if bronchoscopy is not feasible and available, consider unsedated free breathing chest CT (or CT Angio or MRI). If tracheomalacia is diagnosed by imaging, consider tracheostomy/airway intervention or PEEP titration; after bronchoscopy, findings may be no malacia or + Mild‑moderate or severe malacia, and in the latter case consider tracheostomy/airway intervention or PEEP titration. If there is concern for anatomic abnormalities, ++: Consider CT/bronchoscopy combination, with abbreviations defined in the figure caption for computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positive end‑expiratory pressure (PEEP), postmenstrual age (PMA), positive‑pressure ventilation (PPV), and angiography (Angio).

Airway endoscopy in PPRD — evidence certainty, benefits, harms, and practice considerations are reported with cautious language. The panel's confidence "was very low". Benefits include that in patients with PPRD and unexplained prolonged ventilation or chronic respiratory symptoms, "airway endoscopy can be used to identify treatable anatomic abnormalities and can provide prognostic information", and "airway endoscopy may be best performed by a multidisciplinary aerodigestive team" to assess upper and lower airway pathology at once. Harms included mild hypoxemia "during bronchoscopy in 5 of 27 patients (18.5%)", defined as "an Spo2 less than 90% but greater than 80%", and a severe event with "Spo2 less than 50%", and coordination with other procedures "can increase the anesthesia time; thus, unnecessary procedures should be avoided". In a large series, "1,297 bronchoscopic procedures" had "27 (2.1%)" unplanned outcomes, "with 21 of 27 patients undergoing multiple procedures", although in those coordinated through a multidisciplinary aerodigestive clinic, unplanned outcomes "were not different from those of flexible bronchoscopy alone". When general anesthesia risk is high, "airway imaging (dynamic CT or MRI) can be considered", though the panel notes it "is not as sensitive as endoscopy" for tracheomalacia. Parental preference from expert opinion indicated "the majority of parents prefer to proceed with coordination of all necessary airway endoscopies… to identify treatable airway abnormalities and inform future management". Costs are noted: "Endoscopic airway evaluations, especially those done by multiple services, are expensive". The panel concluded that "airway endoscopy is the best available test for the identification of severe airway disease", that "When indicated, the benefits of airway endoscopy exceed its risks", and that "Airway endoscopy can be considered when less invasive diagnostic methods have been exhausted".

### ISHLT consensus statement on adult and pediatric airway complications after lung transplantation: definitions, grading system, and therapeutics [^4b288ed9]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

Classification — proposed grading system for airway complications: The basic unit of analysis is the nature of the pathophysiologic change (i.e., type): ischemia and necrosis; dehiscence; stenosis; or malacia. Each type of complication is then further graded based on what part of the tracheobronchial tree is involved (location), and the severity of the pathologic process (extent). This proposed grading system is based on the first bronchoscopy findings within 2 to 3 weeks after lung transplant, and the trajectory of changes may be assessed.

Figure 3
Hospital length of stay stratified by tracheomalacia status (A) and r d, min (B). [Color figure can be viewed at]

When examining respiratory support, we found that subjects with TM were significantly more likely to remain dependent on respiratory support, including supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, at age 2 years compared with subjects without TM (62% vs. 30%, p = 0.04, Supporting Information S1: Figure 1). Systemic corticosteroids were more likely prescribed in subjects with TM compared to those without TM (71% vs. 27%, p = 0.004, Table 2), and bronchodilators were prescribed in most patients with TM (90% vs. 60%, p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in diagnosis of pneumonia or prescriptions for inhaled corticosteroids or antibiotics for a respiratory infection between the two groups (Table 2).

Table 2
Comparison of secondary clinical outcomes at age 2 years by tracheomalacia status.

In multivariable analysis, a 10% increase in tracheal collapse was associated with 4 week increase in hospital length of stay (p = 0.047), and the odds of tracheotomy tended to increase with decreasing r D, min (p = 0.07, Table 3). While decreasing r D, min was not associated with frequency of respiratory readmissions or increased need for respiratory support at 2 years of age, increased airway collapse was associated with increased likelihood of pneumonia (p = 0.05, Table 3) and treatment with both antibiotics (p = 0.04, Table 3) and systemic steroids (p = 0.008, Table 3).

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a2cef01e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bronchoscopy before tracheostomy decannulation — evidence certainty and recommendations reflect low-quality data and explicit graded guidance: the certainty of evidence was low with several studies small (< 20 patients), including only young children (< 2 yr of age) or excluding congenital malformations, and unclear bronchoscopy practices. The low certainty of evidence resulted in a conditional recommendation for bronchoscopy to evaluate symptoms; however, a strong recommendation was made for bronchoscopy before tracheostomy decannulation based on the panel's unanimous opinion that decannulation without bronchoscopy could be life threatening if an airway lesion was not identified and addressed.

### Tracheobronchial stenting for airway malacia [^812b61cc]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia is a rare but clinically troublesome condition in paediatrics. The softening of the major airways - which can include some or all of the tracheobronchial tree can lead to symptoms ranging from the minor (harsh barking cough, recurrent chest infections) to severe respiratory difficulties including prolonged ventilator support and 'near death attacks'. The causes are broadly divided into intrinsic softening of the airway wall which is considered a primary defect (e.g. syndromes; post tracheo-oesophageal fistula repair; extreme prematurity) or secondary malacia due to external compression from vascular structures or cardiac components. These secondary changes can persist even when the external compression is relieved, for example, following the repair of a pulmonary artery sling or double aortic arch. For children with severe clinical symptoms attributed to malacia, consideration is given to possible surgical remedies such as an aortopexy for short limited areas of malacia, or long term positive pressure support with CPAP either by non invasive or tracheostomy interface. More recently the role of stenting in children is receiving attention, especially with the development of newer techniques such as bioabsorbable stents which buy time for a natural history of improvement in the malacia to occur. This paper reviews the stents available and discusses the pros and cons of stenting in paediatric airway malacia.

### Current management and outcome of tracheobronchial malacia and stenosis presenting to the paediatric intensive care unit [^e00c137e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify factors associated with mortality and prolonged ventilatory requirements in patients admitted to our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with tracheobronchial malacia and stenosis diagnosed by dynamic contrast bronchograms.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

Tertiary paediatric intensive care unit.

Patients

Forty-eight cases admitted to our PICU over a 5-year period in whom a diagnosis of tracheobronchial malacia or stenosis was made by dynamic contrast bronchography (1994–1999).

Interventions

Conservative management, tracheostomy and long-term ventilation, surgical correction, internal or external airway stenting.

Measurements and Results

Recording of clinical details, length of invasive ventilation and appearance at contrast bronchography. Five groups of patients were defined: isolated primary airway pathology (n = 7), ex-premature infants (n = 11), vascular rings (n = 9), complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (n = 17) and tracheo-oesophageal fistulae (n = 4). The overall mortality was 29%. Median length of invasive ventilation in survivors was 38 days and in patients who died 45. Mortality was highest in the patients with complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology (p = 0.039 Cox regression analysis) but was not related to any other factor. Patients with stenosis required a significantly longer period of ventilatory support (median length of ventilation 59 days) than patients with malacia (39 days).

Conclusions

Length of ventilation and bronchographic diagnosis did not predict survival. The only factor found to contribute significantly to mortality was the presence of complex cardiac and/or syndromic pathology. However, patients with stenosis required longer ventilatory support than patients with malacia.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a67d67cb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence base

In the absence of RCTs, we identified 11 observational studies assessing airway endoscopy (flexible bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy, and DLB) in children with PPRD. Six indirectly addressed diagnostic yield and prognostic data from flexible bronchoscopy. Four studies addressed flexible laryngoscopy to identify left vocal cord paralysis (LVCP) after PDA ligation in preterm infants with respiratory or feeding symptoms. One study reported findings on DLB versus flexible laryngoscopy in children with aspiration (online supplement).

Two retrospective studies addressed the prognostic value of flexible bronchoscopy in preterm infants with BPD and TBM. Three hundred fifty-three of 974 infants with BPD (36.2%) undergoing flexible bronchoscopies demonstrated malacia. Those with TBM more commonly underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy, had longer mechanical ventilation and hospital LOSs, and were more likely to be mechanically ventilated at discharge. In 20 of 27 infants with severe BPD undergoing flexible bronchoscopy, airway pathologies were identified, including tracheomalacia (48%), bronchomalacia (40.7%), and airway edema (48%), often leading to changes in management (63%).

3 Results

There were 54 subjects included in the study sample. All subjects were followed for at least their first 2 years of life after discharge from the NICU. Twenty‐three subjects (43%) met UTE MRI criteria for the diagnosis of TM (Table 1). There was no difference in birth gestational age or corrected gestational age at the time of UTE MRI. Both study groups had a range of BPD severity (Table 1), though most patients met criteria for severe BPD. There was no difference between severity of lung disease based on MRI between the groups. Similarly, r Dmin did not correlate with either BPD severity or modified Ochiai score (Figure 2). Thirty‐seven percent of subjects were treated with sedative medications as part of their clinical care, and 48% percent of subjects were intubated at the time of their MRI. No changes were made to sedative medications or ventilatory support for the purposes of the MRI.

Subjects with TM had a 70‐day increase in hospital length of stay (297 days vs. 229 days, p = 0.14) during the initial hospitalization, though this did not achieve statistical significance. Further, decreasing r D, min correlated with hospital length of stay (rho = −0.30, p = 0.02, Figure 3). Tracheotomy was performed more frequently in neonates with TM (61% vs. 35%, p = 0.04). After their initial hospital discharge, there was no significant difference in readmission rates for respiratory causes between subjects with and without TM.

Aortopexy is the therapeutic modality of choice for severe primary tracheomalacia. The thoracoscopic approach has been used with good results in infants and toddlers, but little information exists on the use of aortopexy in older children. We present the case of a boy with a lifelong history of refractory, a steroid-dependent reactive airway disease, and who was found to have severe primary tracheomalacia. He subsequently underwent thoracoscopic aortopexy with immediate resolution of the tracheomalacia as demonstrated by serial bronchoscopy and long-term resolution of his clinical respiratory symptoms at 1 year.

### Tracheobronchomalacia in children… [^b9db29cf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia is an important cause of airway distress during infancy, but it generally resolves as the airway enlarges. To assess the origin and natural history of TBM, a chart review and telephone survey were conducted for 50 patients with TBM at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. This study revealed that TBM is a relatively common airway abnormality and is found on 15% of all diagnostic bronchoscopies. Prematurity, low birth weight, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and prolonged ventilation predispose patients to the most severe symptoms. In our study, a tracheotomy with continuous positive airway pressure was required by 75% of the premature infants and 25% of the full-term infants with TBM. Seventy-one percent of all patients underwent decannulation without any other surgical intervention and remained nearly asymptomatic. Some patients could not undergo decannulation because of other airway lesions.

In most instances, TBM is a self-limited disease that resolves without surgery. Jacobs IN, Wetmore RF, Tom LWC, Handler SD, Potsic WP. Tracheobronchomalacia in Children. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1994; 120: 154–158.

### Pulmonary function of children with tracheomalacia and associated clinical factors [^304b3c1b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Children with tracheomalacia (TM) have common respiratory symptoms (e.g. wheeze and cough)and are not uncommonly seen in pediatric pulmonology practice.TM in children is predominantly diagnosed on direct inspection using flexible bronchoscopy (FB). Although, the universal definition of TM in children remains controversial, TM is commonly defined as deformity in the shape of the trachea at end‐expiration, or a reduction of > 50% in the tracheal cross‐sectional lumenduring spontaneous respiration.

There is limited data on the utility of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in TM diagnosis and assessment. Previous pediatric TM studies revealed that abnormal spirometry parameters and flow‐volume curve, that is, expiratory flow limitation and the "knee" pattern, may or may not be present. Another possible spirometry‐derived indicator of TM may include the Empey Index [EI = ratio of forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV 1) to peak expiratory flow (PEF)] which reflects upper airway obstruction. Other PFT abnormalities reported in children with TM included variations in tidal end‐expiratory flow, maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity, ratio of forced to tidal flows at mid‐tidal volume, thoracic gas volume, and pulmonary resistance. All the studies of complex PFTs were small and used a vague definition of TM; and some were undertaken in infants using chest squeeze. In addition, none of the studies evaluated whether PFTs indices related to bronchoscopic TM characteristics (e.g. severity). Due to this paucity of evidence, spirometry and other PFTs have not been considered an important diagnostic tool for TMdespite their wide availability and the simplicity of testing.

### Fatal complication from a balloon-expandable tracheal stent in a child: a case report [^08e8e9f6]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of airway stents in the pediatric population is uncommon, reflected in the few patient series reported in the literature. We describe a fatal complication of tracheal stent placement in an 18-month-old child with spondylothoracic dysplasia.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Intensive care unit of a tertiary academic pediatric center.

Patient

An 18-month-old child with spondylothoracic dysplasia who underwent tracheal stent placement for tracheomalacia.

Interventions

Management of an acute upper-airway hemorrhage.

Main Results

The patient died, despite aggressive interventions.

Conclusion

Use of tracheal stents in pediatric patients with tracheomalacia is not without risks; tracheal erosion with severe hemoptysis is an infrequent but devastating complication of this intervention.

### Longitudinal quantification of growth and changes in primary tracheobronchomalacia sites in children [^adbef964]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2007). Low credibility.

Rationale

Longitudinal follow-up of children with tracheobronchomalacia is essential to improving our understanding of these disorders, yet currently, there is no such data.

Objectives

To longitudinally define malacia sites and quantify the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the lumen using a bronchoscopic technique and to relate these measurements to illness profiles.

Methods

The validated color histogram mode technique was utilized to quantify primary malacia lesions and airway sites' CSA. Illness frequency, validated scales of illness and cough diary scores were prospectively used to assess clinical profiles.

Results

Thirty-five malacia sites were defined from the 2 studies of 21 children. CSA of 21 (60%) of the malacia lesions increased, 5 (14%) new lesions appeared, 5 (14%) decreased in size, 3 (8%) remained unchanged, and 1(3%) was indeterminate. Overall there was no statistically significant change in paired-data assessments of malacia sites' area while there was a significant increase in area of non-malacia sites. The median yearly growth rate for the malacia sites and non-malacia was 3.65 mm2/year sites and 5.38 mm2/year, respectively (P = 0.31). The type and severity of lesion was not associated with any difference in growth rates, illness frequency or clinical scores.

Conclusions

Malacia lesions increase in size at the same rate as non-malacia sites. However malacia may worsen and new primary lesions may develop. Neither malacia type nor severity influences their growth pattern or illness profile.

### Thoracoscopic aortopexy for tracheomalacia [^0ca56df5]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tracheomalacia is a condition that may result in acute life-threatening events. Aortopexy has become a generally accepted mode of treatment, although the impact of a thoracotomy is considerable. With the advent of minimal invasive surgery the impact of such a procedure may be greatly reduced. This study evaluates the outcome of thoracoscopic aortopexy for tracheomalacia.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of a database containing all patients with thoracoscopic aortopexy. Based on symptomatology, on indication 24 h pH study and/or rigid tracheo-bronchoscopy were carried out to confirm the diagnosis. A three-trocar technique was used on the left side together with intra-operative flexible tracheoscopy through the tube. Follow-up continued for the duration of the study.

Results

Between January 2002 and December 2012, 16 patients presented with severe tracheomalacia. Fourteen of them had a history of esophageal atresia. Age at time of aortopexy varied from 2 weeks to 12 months. All procedures were performed thoracoscopically without intra-operative complications. In five children, there was a recurrence of symptoms within 2–4 weeks for which a re-thoracoscopic aortopexy was carried out successfully. With a follow-up of 6 months to 10 years all patients are thriving and are without incidents.

Conclusion

This is the largest single-center series of thoracoscopic aortopexy for tracheomalacia so far. All procedures were completed successfully without complications. Although recurrences occur, as in open surgery, the ultimate results are satisfactory. In an era of minimal invasive surgery the thoracoscopic approach is feasible and safe, even in redo-procedures.

### Series of laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and bronchomalacia disorders and their associations with other conditions in children [^fd215488]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Laryngomalacia, bronchomalacia, and tracheomalacia are commonly seen in pediatric respiratory medicine, yet their patterns and associations with other conditions are not well-understood. We prospectively video-recorded bronchoscopic data and clinical information from referred patients over a 10-year period and defined aspects of interrelationships and associations. Two hundred and ninety-nine cases of malacia disorders (34%) were observed in 885 bronchoscopic procedures. Cough, wheeze, stridor, and radiological changes were the most common symptoms and signs. The lesions were most often found in males (2:1) and on the left side (1.6:1). Concomitant malacia lesions ranged from 24% for laryngotracheobronchomalacia to 47% for tracheobronchomalacia. The lesions were found in association with other disorders such as congenital heart disorders (13.7%), tracheo-esophageal fistula (9.6%), and various syndromes (8%). Even though the understanding of these disorders is in its infancy, pediatricians should maintain a level of awareness for malacia lesions and consider the possibility of multiple lesions being present, even when one symptom predominates or occurs alone.

### Anterior and posterior tracheopexy for severe tracheomalacia [^a1a2c81a]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although the indication for surgery in symptomatic children with severe tracheomalacia is well defined, no consensus has yet been delineated on the ideal surgical strategy. Large centers often describe a patient-tailored approachusing an armamentarium of posterior and anterior pexy, with or without anterior external splinting and aortopexy. The latter still is a good option for children with tracheomalaciaand can even be performed through a minimally invasive approach. However, depending on the degree of malacia, the success rate of aortopexy is variable. Prior aortopexy can complicate sternotomy in case additional airway procedures are necessary. Posterior tracheopexy addresses the frail membranous part of the trachea, often responsible for collapse because it is the most mobile part of the main airway. It can be performed at multiple levels and more reports are suggesting a minimally invasive approach. Although aortopexy and posterior tracheopexy can offer relief of symptoms, the cartilaginous part of the main airway is often weak (especially in esophageal atresia patients), and some authors suggest a combination of anterior and posterior tracheopexydirectly addressing both parts of the trachea. Although it can be achieved without external stent, a partially circumferential scaffold seems useful to generate optimal lumen diameter. The concept of external splinting has previously been described and has satisfactory results. The use of a ringed PTFE prosthesis offers good support, is rapidly available, and is cheaper than biological 3-dimensional printed scaffolds.

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a6b2d2bc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — evidence base for bronchoscopy to evaluate the airway in children with tracheostomy — reports that 15 studies described rigid or flexible bronchoscopy for airway evaluation and surveillance was addressed by 14 studies. Across surveillance cohorts, approximately 45–87% of children were diagnosed with an airway lesion, with common findings including suprastomal granulation (31–59%), subglottic stenosis (17–57%), glottic edema (37%), suprastomal collapse (2–15%), pretracheal granulation (10–13%), distal tracheal granulation (5%), and tracheal wall ulceration (1–3%). Approximately 23–48% were symptomatic before bronchoscopy with complaints including increased secretions (23–78%), difficulty with tracheostomy tube changes (23%), ventilation problems (7–31%), blood-tinged secretions (10%), stoma obstruction (5%), hemoptysis (3–8%), and several 1% symptoms. In three studies, lesions were more likely on bronchoscopy in symptomatic patients (70% vs. 42%, 92% vs. 73%, or with an odds ratio of 6.75), while lesion prevalence was also noted to be higher in patients with iHMV or with cardiopulmonary disease or traumatic injury in some, but not all, studies; data were mixed regarding timing of endoscopy after tracheostomy insertion.

### Advances in surgical treatment of congenital airway disease [^04be9138]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is frequently present in infants and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Infants with CHD and TBM appear to do worse than those without TBM. The principle of operative intervention for TBM is to improve function of the airway and clinical status. When indicated, conventional surgical options include tracheostomy, aortopexy, tracheoplasty, and anterior tracheal suspension. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of severe tracheobonchomalacia, which can be associated with a mortality rate as high as 80%. Congenital tracheal stenosis is also frequently associated with CHD (vascular rings, atrioventricular canal defects, and septal defects) and may require concomitant repair. Repair of tracheal stenosis is often associated with distal TBM. This article addresses new techniques that can be performed in corrective surgery for both TBM and congenital tracheal stenosis.

### Critical airway obstruction in apparently asymptomatic neonates [^328e2eee]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Central airway obstruction (trachea and major bronchi) in neonates can be caused by malacia, stenosis, or compression by masses or vascular structures. These abnormalities may be present in the neonatal period but are typically not detected until at least 6 months of age. We present four patients (1.6–4.1kg, 32–41 weeks gestation) with nonspecific symptoms (e.g., poor weight gain, difficulty weaning from CPAP) who underwent bronchoscopy in the neonatal period. Critical airway obstruction (> 90%) was identified in these relatively asymptomatic neonates. We suggest a low threshold for investigation with bronchoscopy in high-risk neonates.

### Airway findings in trisomy 13 and trisomy 18: a 10-year retrospective review [^c9089cde]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 are the most common autosomal trisomies following trisomy 21, with overall incidence rising. Both diagnoses are characterized by multisystem involvement and were previously thought to be incompatible with life. New data suggest that prolonged survival is possible, and thus many families are opting for more aggressive medical interventions. This study aims to describe airway findings in trisomy 18 and trisomy 13, as these have not been comprehensively studied and can impact medical decision-making. We hypothesize that most children with trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 will have abnormal findings on airway endoscopy.

Methods

This a 10-year retrospective analysis of children with trisomy 13 or trisomy 18 who underwent endoscopic airway evaluation at a single center between 2011 and 2021. A total of 31 patients were evaluated.

Results

Thirty-one patients were included and underwent flexible bronchoscopy by a pediatric pulmonologist, often in conjunction with rigid bronchoscopy performed by pediatric otolaryngology. Findings were typically complimentary. All patients had at least one clinically significant finding on evaluation, and most patients had both upper and lower airway, as well as static and dynamic airway findings. The most common airway findings in children with trisomy 13 and 18 include tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia, laryngomalacia, hypopharyngeal collapse, glossoptosis, and bronchial compression.

Conclusion

These findings can have significant implications for clinical care, and thus knowledge of trends has the potential to improve counseling on expected clinical course, presurgical planning, and informed consent before interventions.

### Treatment of severe bronchomalacia with expanding endobronchial stents… [^6baacdb7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Respiratory compromise from tracheobronchomalacia in children varies from mild to severe, but can result in either reflex apnea or death. Such severe cases may be unresponsive to aggressive medical management, and surgical options must be considered. Current surgical alternatives are limited and are associated with many potentially undesirable complications. Failure rates are often high. We present two infants with profound lifethreatening airway malacia treated by endoscopic placement of a self-expanding endobronchial stent. A description of their anomaly, surgical management, and long-term care is included. The expandable stent may obviate the need for complex high-risk surgical procedures and prolonged ventilatory support. Mair EA, Parsons DS, Lally KP.

### Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for tracheostomy in preterm infants [^a67c353a]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Severe BPD is a known significant risk factor for tracheostomy placement and adverse respiratory outcomes in the first 2 years of life with over two‐thirds of our cohort having severe BPD as the indication for tracheostomy. One‐third had a diagnosis of acquired airway obstruction (subglottic stenosis, tracheomalacia) upon airway examination with obstruction remaining a common indication for tracheostomy placement. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) has been diagnosed in 50% of preterm infants < 32 week gestation by dynamic computed tomography and 10%–48% of infants by bronchoscopy. It is likely that the rate of TBM was underestimated in our cohort since the presence of TBM was not assessed in all airway exams due to instability of many of the infants undergoing the procedure that may have precluded discontinuation of PEEP and spontaneous respiration needed to visualize TBM as well as variability in the practice patterns of the ENT and pediatric surgeons that performed the tracheostomies and lack of alternative imaging studies.

### A decade of using intraluminal tracheal / bronchial stents in the management of tracheomalacia and / or bronchomalacia: is it better than aortopexy? [^4889185e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

We compared the efficacy and clinical outcomes of aortopexy versus tracheal stents in the management of tracheomalacia.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of 25 consecutive patients undergoing aortopexy (n = 11; 8 boys, 3 girls) or tracheal stents (n = 14; 9 boys, 5 girls) between 1993 and 2003 was performed.

Results

Both treatment groups, aortopexy versus stents, were comparable in their mean age of diagnosis, timing of intervention, surgical indications ("dying spell" or failed extubation), and previous underlying conditions. The operative time (190 vs 72 minutes) and blood loss (26 vs 0 mL) were significantly greater in aortopexy group (P < .01). There were no perioperative deaths in either group. Interestingly, 4 of 11 patients in the aortopexy group developed pericardial effusion (P < .01). With stents in place for a mean of 15 (range 2–41) months, 3 of 8 patients with stent removal had significant granulation tissue requiring further dilatation. No death was observed in aortopexy group, whereas 1 stent-related death and 1 cardiac arrest requiring median sternotomy occurred during stent removal in 44 and 32 months' follow-up, respectively.

Conclusion

Both aortopexy and tracheal stents are effective treatment modalities in the management of tracheomalacia. However, although aortopexy is associated with early perioperative complications, tracheal stents are associated with higher failure rate and more severe stent-related morbidity and mortality.

### Tracheostomy outcomes in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^e442c82f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Posttracheostomy Airway Stenosis and Malacia Were Commonly Observed With Open Airway Reconstruction Required in 43% (n = 23/53) of the Surviving Population

Airway findings and interventions were documented in surviving patients. Overall, 98% of patients (n = 52/53) returned to the operating room (OR) for airway surveillance and/or intervention following tracheostomy placement for a median of 1.1 times per year (IQR 0.5‐1.9). During bronchoscopy surveillance, 3.8% (n = 2/52) had a subglottic cyst, and one patient (1.9%) had a posterior tracheal wall diverticulum. Notably, 69% (n = 36/52) of patients had a type of laryngotracheal stenosis. Specifically, 52% (n = 27/52) had subglottic stenosis (SGS) with 23% (n = 12/52) of them being grade 3 or 4. Tracheal stenosis was observed in 38% of patients (n = 20/52) with A‐frame deformities as the most common finding. Suprastomal collapse was common and seen in 58% of this group (n = 30/52). Tracheomalacia was seen in 35% of patients (n = 18/52) and bronchomalacia was seen in 33% (n = 17/52) with 23% having tracheobronchomalacia (n = 12/52). Of the patients who returned to the OR, 87% received some form of airway intervention (45/52, Table 6). Overall, 43% of patients (n = 23/53) required open airway reconstruction.

### Bronchopulmonary dysplasia from chest radiographs to magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography: adding value [^68c3c23e]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Trachea and large airways

In addition to the arrest in development of the pulmonary parenchyma, neonates who are born prematurely have disruption in development of the central airway. The net impact of preterm birth is that the central airway is smaller, more compliant and more susceptible to airway injury, especially in neonates who require endotracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation. Consequently, disease of the central airway is quite common in neonates with BPD. Central airway disease can be divided into dynamic and fixed central airway pathology and results in increased respiratory morbidity in these fragile infants.

Dynamic airway lesions such as tracheobronchomalacia are identified in 10–48% of neonates with BPD undergoing bronchoscopy, which is the reference standard for diagnosis. However, the true prevalence is unclear because children undergoing bronchoscopy are a heavily biased subset, and many neonates who do not undergo bronchoscopy have dynamic airway collapse (Fig. 7) based on advanced imaging techniques. Tracheobronchomalacia is associated with increased morbidity during the initial hospital admission with prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, longer hospitalization and increased need for tracheotomy. Following discharge, children with tracheobronchomalacia require more medical therapies and feeding support and have increased frequency of rehospitalization, particularly during respiratory illnesses.

### Long-term outcomes of tracheostomy-dependent children [^5cb7998e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival and decannulation rates of children with a tracheostomy.

Study Design

Ambidirectional cohort.

Setting

Tertiary children's hospital.

Methods

All patients (< 18 years) that had a tracheostomy placed between 2009 and 2020 were included and followed until 21 years of age, decannulation, or death. The Kaplan-Meier method estimated cumulative probabilities of death and decannulation.

Results

A total of 551 children underwent tracheostomy at a median age of 7.2 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.8–49.2). Children were followed for a median of 2.1 years (IQR: 0.7–4.2, range 0–11.5). The cumulative probability of mortality at 1 year was 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.4–15.1), at 5 years was 26.1% (95% CI: 21.6–31.3), and at 10 years was 41.6% (95% CI: 32.7–51.8). Ventilator dependence at index discharge (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.10–3.81, p = .03), severe neurologic disability (HR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.61–4.84, p < .001), and cardiac disease (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.08–2.65, p = .02) were associated with time to death. The cumulative probability of decannulation was 10.4% (95% CI: 8.0–13.5), 44.9% (95% CI: 39.4–50.9), and 54.1% (95% CI: 47.4–61.1) at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. Ventilator dependence (HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.31–0.60, p < .001), severe neurologic disability (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14–0.30, p < .001), and tracheostomy indicated for respiratory failure (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.96, p = .03) correlated with longer decannulation times.

Conclusion

After tracheostomy, estimated mortality approaches 42% by 10 years and decannulation approaches 54%. Children with ventilator support at discharge and severe neurological disability had poorer long-term survival and longer times to decannulation.

### Tracheal suspension with autogenous rib cartilage in a patient with severe tracheomalacia [^c52ff8cb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Tracheomalacia (TM) is characterized by pathologically collapsed segment of cartilaginous rings and membranous wall of trachea-bronchi, which results in life-threatening symptoms. TM is mainly associated with congenital malformation, surgery-based trauma and tumor compression. The common surgical approach for treating TM was aortopexy over the past decades. Recently many scholars sought to stablize malacial trachea by using endotracheal stent placement and paratracheal biomaterial scaffold, but there is no consensus with regard to radiographic assessment and standard therapeutic method for TM. Here we introduced a novel tracheal suspension technique to treat a patient with TM.

### Central airway obstruction: is it time to move forward? [^c3ed2673]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia

Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition characterized by diffuse or localized loss of rigidity of the trachea and mainstem bronchi, leading to airway collapse. If the affected portion is intrathoracic, the airway obstruction will be accentuated during expiration. More rarely, the affected portion is extra-thoracic and is more accentuated during inspiration. Congenital TBM is described more frequently in children and indicates a defect of the tracheal wall. The disorder can persist into adult life and is designated idiopathic giant trachea or Mounier-Khun syndrome. TBM may also develop along with other congenital conditions such as cystic fibrosis, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or congenital trachea-esophageal fistula. Acquired TBM is associated with a variety of conditions. Prolonged endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy trauma are the most frequent, but head and neck surgery, trauma, radiotherapy or inflammatory conditions must also be considered. The diagnosis is based on dynamic Three-dimensional CT images and direct bronchoscopic visualization to confirm significant narrowing of airway lumen during forced breathing manoeuvres. Applying continuous positive airway pressure has been proposed as a possible treatment. In patients with diffuse TBM, a silicone stent placement should be considered in preparation for a more definitive treatment such as tracheoplasty. Majed et al. purpose a self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) trial as a bridge to surgery. Other surgical approach consists in restoring the C shape of the cartilages which is lost in TBM attaching longitudinal strips of splinting material along the membranous walls of the intrathoracic trachea.

Conclusions

This clinical practice guideline addresses six priority PICO questions deemed to be of highest clinical relevance by the international panel of specialists and not previously addressed by clinical guidelines. The goal is to standardize and improve the clinical care of infants and children with tracheostomy tubes. Future research should focus on well-designed studies that use a data-informed, precision-based medicine approach to these medically complex patients. In addition, special consideration is warranted regarding implementation of these guidelines in low- and middle-income countries.

### Aortopexy as treatment for tracheo-bronchomalacia in children: an 18-year single-center experience [^004c4e3b]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define the factors influencing the outcome of aortopexy as management of tracheo-bronchomalacia.

Design

A retrospective, single-center, observational, cohort study.

Settings

Surgical services in a tertiary care hospital.

Patients

One hundred five children who underwent an aortopexy for tracheo-bronchomalacia between 1990 and 2008.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Comorbidity (categorized into three groups), surgical approach, and location of malacia were reviewed and analyzed in relation to mortality, need for a second intervention, complications, time to extubation after surgery, intensive care unit stay, and clinical improvement. Median age at surgery was 24 wks (1 wk-541 wks). Two surgical approaches were used: median sternotomy (n = 46) and left anterior parasternal (n = 59). Long-term (> 2 yrs) follow-up was available for 73 patients (median = 7.0 yrs [2–18 yrs]); 73% were asymptomatic, 18% had minor symptoms, and 9% needed either ventilation or tracheostomy. The overall mortality rate was 9%, of which one-third was airway-related. Multivariable analysis revealed that major comorbidities were a significant risk factor both for mortality and the need for further procedures (re-do surgery, tracheostomy, internal stents) in contrast to surgical approach and involvement of the bronchus. Intensive care unit stay and days of ventilation after surgery were also significantly higher in patients with major comorbidities.

Conclusions

Aortopexy proved to be an effective treatment for most cases of tracheo-bronchomalacia, but major comorbidity was associated with an adverse outcome. Our data suggest that aortopexy should be considered in most cases of severe tracheo-bronchomalacia.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^c6fbf25c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) imaging in preterm populations with PPRD — computed tomography (CT) versus bronchoscopy diagnostic performance: Ten studies of preterm infants at risk for TBM were evaluated, including some before NICU discharge in infants "age greater than 36 weeks' PMA at time of study". Definitions varied, with "airway collapse of more than 50%" used by some and grading by others as none "(0–25% collapse)", mild to moderate "(26–75% collapse)", or severe "(greater than 75% collapse)". In a prospective comparison of tracheobronchogram with dynamic spiral CT in "16 infants (15 preterm)", CT was less sensitive, correctly identifying "10 of 16 infants with tracheomalacia and 14 of 28 infants with bronchomalacia", and dynamic CT "resulted in an underestimation of opening pressure and required a larger radiation dose than bronchoscopy". In infants "less than 12 months old", bronchoscopy found malacia in "10 of 17" with "50%" premature, while CT sensitivity was "37.5%" for tracheomalacia and "75%" for bronchomalacia. In 34 pediatric patients (35% preterm) undergoing cine multidetector CT, isolated tracheomalacia was found in "four patients" and right or left bronchomalacia in "10 patients (80% with a history of cardiac surgery)", and among 29 with bronchoscopy, concordance was complete in "23" and partial in "four", with "two" CT positive/bronchoscopy negative. Dynamic CT was calculated to be "100% sensitive and 81% specific, with a positive predictive value of 90% and a negative predictive value of 100%" versus bronchoscopy; in another retrospective cohort with paired static end-inspiratory and end-expiratory CT, sensitivity was "85%" and specificity "100%". Free-breathing cine CT, defined by change in tracheal cross-sectional area (CSA), evaluated "271 children" with bronchoscopic tracheomalacia and "320 control subjects", showing significant CSA change in "Fifty-seven percent" versus "11%", with "96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 97% accuracy"; another dynamic CT series of "46 infants and children" identified "5" TBM, "5" right bronchomalacia, "8" left bronchomalacia, and "8" lobar bronchomalacia without bronchoscopy correlation.

### Tracheal anomalies associated with down syndrome: a systematic review [^a2945cc5]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

In cohort studies on DS children, the prevalence of airway malacia ranges from 4.4% to 7.1%. 11, 17 In DS children requiring endoscopic evaluation of the airway because of respiratory complaints, airway malacia was observed in 32.4%–46%. 11, 41, 44 When compared with non‐DS controls with airway complaints, airway malacia was observed significantly more often (33% in DS vs. 7.4% in controls). Furthermore, associated morbidities in DS children with airway malacia include congenital heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. 43, 70, 72 Although the severity of symptoms may differ among DS children, pediatric intensive care unit admission may be necessary. 71 Treatment for tracheobronchomalacia depends on the severity of symptoms: whereas children with mild‐to‐moderate tracheobronchomalacia may be effectively treated with medication (corticosteroids/ipratropium bromide inhalers, saline nebulizers, and/or intermittent courses of antibiotics) or supportive treatment (oxygen supply, high flow nasal canula, or nasal continuous positive airway pressure), children with severe tracheobronchomalacia require a surgical intervention. Surgical options to improve the tracheal lumen include anterior aortopexy, in which the aorta is pulled anteriorly toward the sternum, and posterior tracheopexy, in which the trachea is attached to the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. 67 Furthermore, stenting the airway with an internal stent is potentially a promising concept but currently reserved for patients who have no curative surgical options or as an alternative for tracheostomy, as stents generally lead to a wide range of problems like mucus plugging, granulation tissue/crust formation, stent migration, or difficulty/inability to remove the stent. 14, 72

3.6 Tracheal web

A tracheal web is a thin layer of tissue that narrows the tracheal lumen, but never fully occludes the trachea. It can either be congenital or acquired as a result of intubation. Only one report described a DS child with a tracheal web, covering 30% of the tracheal lumen. 41 No surgical intervention was necessary. In the non‐DS population in that study, two children with tracheal web were found, resulting in an overall prevalence of 0.6%.

### Outcomes of neonates with tracheostomy secondary to bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^4ae53162]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our data identified some clinical risk factors associated with poor outcomes at 2 years of age in single center cohort of infants with severe BPD. These results can be used to assist in counseling parents/families of infants with severe pulmonary disease. Furthermore, clinicians and families need to be diligent towards potential risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes of these infants. Modification of these risk factors may be helpful in decreasing severe respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes or death. Our data does not identify optimal timing of tracheostomy placement in these babies. Future research directed at understanding this gap will assist referral NICUs in the provision of potentially improved clinical practices to optimize these infants' health outcomes.

### Pulmonary function of children with tracheomalacia and associated clinical factors [^1f304645]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In children with TM, PEF was slightly low, while other spirometry parameters including EI were either normal or equivocal. The "knee" pattern in spirometry flow‐volume curves was found in the majority of, but not all, children. The presence of BM along with TM was significantly associated with lower FEV1, FEF 25%–75%, and PEF. These spirometry characteristics may aid clinicians in recognizing TM in children but more evidence is needed to confirm our findings. A prospective study of children with TM to precisely determine their pulmonary function at the time of FB, as well as its changes over time, is required.

### Initial experience with a new biodegradable airway stent in children: is this the stent we were waiting for? [^e2017dc9]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To report our experience with a new type of biodegradable airway stent in the setting of severe tracheobronchial obstruction in children.

Design and Methodology

We conducted a retrospective and prospective (since June 2014) study of pediatric patients with severe airway obstruction treated with biodegradable stents in our institution between 2012 and 2015. The following data were collected: demographics, indication for stenting, bronchoscopic findings, insertion technique complications, clinical outcome, stent related complications, re-stenting, and time of follow-up.

Results

Thirteen custom-made polydioxanone stents were placed in four infants (mean age, 4 months) with severe tracheobronchial obstruction: tracheomalacia (two patients), bronchomalacia (1), and diffuse tracheal stenosis (1). All the stents were bronchoscopically inserted uneventfully. Immediate and maintained clinical improvement was observed in every case. No major stent related complications have occurred and only mild or moderate granulation tissue was observed during surveillance bronchoscopy. Two patients required repeated stenting as expected. All the patients are alive and in a good respiratory condition with a follow-up ranging from 5 to 40 months.

Conclusions

Biodegradable airway stents seem to be safe, effective, and cause fewer complications than other types of stents. They can be an alternative to the classic metallic or plastic stents for severe tracheal stenosis or malacia in small children. More experience is needed in order to establish the definite clinical criteria for their use in pediatric patients. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016;51:607–612. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^d592d53b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence Base

We identified 15 studies describing rigid or flexible bronchoscopy for airway evaluation of children with tracheostomy tubes (.).

Airway evaluation as surveillance for infants and children with a tracheostomy was addressed by 14 studies. Approximately 55–87% of children were diagnosed with an airway lesion, the most common being suprastomal granulation (31–59%), subglottic stenosis (17–57%), glottic edema (37%), suprastomal collapse (2–15%), peristomal granulation (10–13%), distal tracheal granulation (5%), or tracheal wall ulceration (1–3%) (,–). Approximately 23–48% of patients were symptomatic before bronchoscopy because of increased secretions (23–78%), difficulty with tracheostomy tube changes (23%), ventilation problems (7–31%), blood-tinged secretions (10%), stoma obstruction (5%), hemoptysis (3–8%), voice complaints (1%), dysphagia (1%), aspiration (1%), air leak around the tracheostomy (1%), tracheitis (1%), or erythema around the tracheostomy stoma (1%). In three studies, airway lesions were more likely to be found bronchoscopically in symptomatic patients (70% vs. 42%, 92% vs. 73%, or with an odds ratio of 6.75). Airway lesions were also more common in patients with iHMV or who underwent tracheostomy for cardiopulmonary disease or traumatic injury in some, but not all, studies.

### Congenital subglottic cyst: a rare cause for sudden airway compromise in a newborn [^c3655607]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Subglottic cysts are retention cysts of subepithelial mucosal glands, which may be either congenital or acquired. Subglottic cysts are rare and occur at a rate of ~1.8/100 000 live births. The incidence of subglottic cysts is increasing and is thought to be secondary to the increased survival rates of premature infants. These premature infants frequently require prolonged duration of tracheal intubation (a known mechanism for the formation of acquired subglottic cysts). The mechanism is however not completely understood. Acquired cysts are presumed to be iatrogenic and secondary to repetitive piston trauma of the endotracheal tube and ventilator on subglottic mucosa. This may result in the blockage of the subglottic ducts as a result of erosion and subsequent scarring. In contrast, congenital subglottic cysts can occur in term neonates with no previous airway intervention. The subglottic region is the narrowest segment of the paediatric airway, and therefore narrowing secondary to either acquired or congenital subglottic cysts has the potential to cause rapidly progressive respiratory distress and complete airway obstruction.

The non-specific symptoms related to subglottic cysts may present a diagnostic challenge. A high index of suspicion is required to ensure appropriate and timely investigation and treatment. Common symptoms include dysphonia, dysphagia, hoarseness, stridor and dyspnoea. All of which are easier to detect in older children. This condition may be misdiagnosed as laryngomalacia, croup or subglottic stenosis, due to the similar characteristic features and the relative rarity of the congenital subglottic cysts. Diagnostic laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy are therefore routinely indicated for airway evaluation in at-risk infants.

There are, however, certain features in the history and examination to assist clinicians in differentiating these conditions. Stridor implies a narrowing in a level of the laryngotracheal pathway. Stridor during inspiration suggests obstruction above the vocal cords, in conditions such as laryngomalacia and vallecula cysts. A biphasic stridor is more typical of obstruction at the level of the vocal cords or subglottic, which may be present in conditions such as unilateral and bilateral vocal cord palsy, subglottic stenosis and subglottic cysts. Expiratory stridor is commonly associated with obstruction at the level of the trachea, in conditions such as tracheomalacia, tracheal stenosis and vascular rings.

### Pediatric tracheomalacia and the perioperative anesthetic management of thoracoscopic posterior tracheopexy [^c9b39b2b]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Tracheomalacia is a broad term used to describe an abnormally compliant trachea that can lead to exaggerated collapse and obstruction with expiration. We describe the perioperative management of a complex pediatric patient undergoing a posterior tracheopexy which is a relatively new surgical treatment, with a novel surgical approach-thoracoscopy. This procedure has competing surgical and anesthetic needs and presents unique challenges to the physicians involved in caring for these patients. We also review the current literature on pediatric tracheomalacia and examine the newest treatment options to highlight the potential anesthetic challenges and pitfalls associated with management.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pediatric tracheostomy, more specifically with respect to airway evaluation, ATS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a complete airway evaluation in children with tracheostomies prior to a decannulation attempt. Ensure the airway evaluation includes an assessment of the nose and nasopharynx, oropharynx and oral cavity, supraglottis and larynx, and subglottis, trachea, and bronchi.

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^26643b59]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Implementation

We suggest bronchoscopy for patients with worsening or persistent symptoms unresponsive to medical management and strongly recommend comprehensive airway evaluation before decannulation. In centers with limited access to equipment or operative time, these guidelines may optimize local resources. Where necessary equipment, operative time, or specialized expertise are not available, we suggest referral to a center that specializes in these procedures.

The panel noted that variations in airway lesion type, frequency, and location likely differ by patient age, underlying the rationale for recommendation 5B. Differences are also probable between infants and children with tracheostomy alone and those with iHMV. Moreover, distinctions likely exist between patients with long-term tracheostomies for neurological conditions and those with tracheostomies for double-stage airway reconstructions.

Health Equity

Access to care could influence the implementation of these recommendations. However, access may improve with a recommendation to conduct airway evaluations. Implementing surveillance measures, like evaluation of the airway before discharge, could promote equitable care.

Justification

These recommendations aim to ensure a safe and patent airway for children undergoing decannulation. Evidence was of low certainty because of limited evidence. However, there was a consensus supporting a strong recommendation for Recommendation 5B, given the potential morbidity and mortality associated with premature decannulation.

Introduction

Weaning off chronic mechanical ventilation

In cases of prolonged respiratory failure, "weaning" describes a gradual, deliberate process aimed at improving the load-to-capacity ratio of the respiratory system's mechanical and gas exchange capacities to achieve sustainable spontaneous respiration. The most extensive experience for weaning children from chronic invasive or non-invasive respiratory support involves those with chronic lung disease of prematurity, congenital malformations (e.g. tracheomalacia, congenital heart disease), and self-limited or acquired neuromuscular conditions (e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome, spinal cord injury, critical illness neuromyopathy). Clinical experience in weaning children with neuromuscular disease (NMD) from mechanical ventilation is limited and predominantly focused on extubation within intensive care units (i.e. acute-care settings).

While weaning ventilatory support shares some factors in both adult and pediatric populations, maturational changes such as variations in respiratory mechanics, diaphragm histology, anabolic demands, and developmental tolerance are unique to the pediatric population. Studies on ventilator-induced neuromuscular weakness, particularly diaphragm weakness, in children are limited. Evidence suggests that diaphragm atrophy is associated with prolonged recovery and increased need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in acute-care settings.

In children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, the median age of liberation from respiratory support is 24 months, with variability in clinical practice. However, due to the static or progressive nature of most NMDs, extrapolating from acute-care settings, prematurity, or non-neuromuscular disorders is not necessarily applicable. In fact, published experience in weaning patients with NMDs off mechanical ventilation is limited, except in select cases of congenital myotonic dystrophy. Weaning off transtracheal supports is often not considered feasible from the perspectives of safety or goals of care and frequently requires a transition to noninvasive supportive ventilation.

We identified a single prospective study comparing using a tracheobronchogram with using a dynamic spiral CT scan to diagnose TBM in 16 infants (15 preterm). Compared with bronchography, CT was less sensitive, enabling correct identification of 10 of 16 infants with tracheomalacia and 14 of 28 infants with bronchomalacia. The dynamic CT scans resulted in an underestimation of opening pressure and required a larger radiation dose than bronchograms.

In a study of 24 infants and children, two of whom had BPD, undergoing large airway evaluation through dynamic CT with three-dimensional reconstruction, 5 had TBM, 5 had right bronchomalacia, 8 had left bronchomalacia, and 8 had lobar bronchomalacia. An evaluation of the correlation with bronchoscopy results was not performed.

Several studies compared bronchoscopy and CT imaging. Ten of 17 infants less than 12 months old had airway malacia at bronchoscopy, and 50% of those infants with malacia were premature. The sensitivity of using CT to diagnose tracheomalacia was 37.5%, and the sensitivity for using CT to diagnose bronchomalacia was 75%. Among eight infants (50% preterm) evaluated by using dynamic volumetric CT without sedation to diagnose large airway disease, four patients had TBM at CT imaging, and there was 75% concordance with bronchoscopy results. Another study of 34 pediatric patients (35% preterm) who underwent a cine multidetector CT scan for clinical indications identified isolated tracheomalacia in four patients and right or left bronchomalacia in 10 patients (80% with a history of cardiac surgery). In the 29 patients who underwent bronchoscopy, there was complete concordance between bronchoscopy and CT results in 23 patients and partial concordance in four patients. Importantly, in two patients, the CT result was positive, whereas the bronchoscopy result was negative. Dynamic CT was calculated to be 100% sensitive and 81% specific, with a positive predictive value of 90% and a negative predictive value of 100% being demonstrated. Another retrospective study included 28 patients who underwent bronchoscopy for suspected tracheomalacia. Paired static end-inspiratory and end-expiratory CT was performed on 26 of 28 patients with tracheomalacia and five "control subjects" with dry cough. The CT-enabled diagnosis of tracheomalacia was determined by using the change in the cross-sectional area (CSA) at the level of maximum collapse, resulting in a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 100%. Finally, 27 children with bronchoscopic evidence of tracheomalacia and 320 control subjects were evaluated to determine the accuracy of using free-breathing cine CT for diagnosing tracheomalacia, as defined by the change in the tracheal CSA. Fifty-seven percent of patients with malacia diagnosed through bronchoscopy had a significant change in the CSA, compared with 11% of control subjects, with 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, and 97% accuracy being demonstrated.

### Tailored management of airway abnormalities in children with congenital single functional lung [^5f1df154]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Pediatric patients born with single functional lung can be associated with symptomatic airway abnormalities. Management of such patients is not only technically demanding but is also ethically challenging. This study reports our experience of managing symptomatic airway abnormalities in pediatric patients with congenital single functional lung.

Methods

Observational retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary children's hospital from January 2001 to September 2017. All children (0 to 18 years old) with congenital single functional lung (agenesis and hypoplasia) presenting with symptomatic airway abnormalities (long segment congenital tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia) and requiring surgical interventions were included in the study. Children with single functional lung secondary to non-congenital causes were excluded.

Results

A total of 16 patients with single functional lung (agenesis = 8 and hypoplasia = 8) and airway abnormalities (long segment congenital tracheal stenosis = 12 and tracheomalacia = 4) were eligible for the study. Lung abnormalities were common on the right side (n = 10, 62.5%). Associated abnormalities (cardiac and non-cardiac) were seen in 11 patients (68.8%). Surgical interventions for airway abnormalities, alone or in combination, included slide tracheoplasty (n = 12), aortopexy with or without pericardiopexy (n = 7), excision of rudimentary lung (n = 4) and placement of intrathoracic tissue expanders to reposition the mediastinum (n = 3). Nine patients (56.3%) underwent a one-stage repair while staged repairs (airway and cardiac) were performed in 7 (43.7%). Fourteen patients (87.5%) survived to hospital discharge. Of the survivors, 9 (64.2%) had stable airways not requiring respiratory support at home.

Conclusion

Management of pediatric patients with airway abnormalities in the setting of congenital single functional lung is feasible with acceptable surgical outcomes. This is facilitated by staged repairs and repositioning of mediastinum before a definitive airway repair in patients with significant comorbidities. Treatment should not be deferred to these patients if there are no obvious contraindications.

Type Of Study

Retrospective Case Control Study LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

### Pulmonary function of children with tracheomalacia and associated clinical factors [^4cbd2348]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Our findings of normal FEV 1, FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC in children with TM were consistent with most previous studies. The largest pediatric TM study of 115 children but only 45 children had spirometry undertaken, and the study reported normal FEV 1, FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC but a slight reduction in PEF (mean 74.7% SD 19.4). In another study of pulmonary function on long‐term follow up, FEV 1 and FVC were within normal population range, while FEF 25%–75% (mean 54% SD 15) and PEF (mean 60% SD 14) were low. Only small case series of children with TM reported low values and showed an improvement of FEV 1 and FEF 25%–75% following aortopexy.

Our cohort did not have an increased EI suggesting it is unlikely to be useful in clinical practice for diagnosing TM. We examined EI as it is a simple parameter to calculate from spirometry and an elevated EI (ratio > 10) may indicate an upper airway obstruction. The cut‐off of 10 was observed in children with various upper airway obstructions, including tracheal stenosis, vocal cord dysfunction, subglottic stenosis, TM/TBM and persisting laryngomalacia, and revealed sensitivity 93% and specificity 41%. However, a small study found that children born with esophageal atresia and TM had EI > 8.7 and the ratio > 8 significantly correlated with respiratory symptoms but the ratio > 10 did not. This may explain why using the traditional cut‐off of > 10 we did not find a significant relationship between EI and TM in our cohort.

Our multivariable model was used to assess whether certain features of TM are associated with altered spirometric values, and included age (as it is believed that TM improves spontaneously with growth), cross‐sectional lumen reduction, malacic length and BM involvement (as these could contribute to increased airway resistance). We found that the presence of any mainstem BM was significantly associated with lower airflow values (FEV 1, FEF 25%–75%, and EI). This could be simply explained by the addition of choke point during forced expiration, with BM acting as another choke point and effectively resulting in a series of airway resistors. As the magnitude of airflow is inversely relates to resistance, we speculate an increase in total resistance in TBM to be the mechanism for greater decreasing airflow.

### Predictors of poor outcomes in children with tracheoesophageal fistula / oesophageal atresia: an Australian experience [^9d060616]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

All infants with live births undergoing surgical repair of OA/TOF at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) from 2000 to 2016 were included. Death in the first month of life due to event unrelated to TOF was excluded. Patients were identified using an electronic operation theater database. The following information was collected: demographics (gestational age, sex, birth weight), type of OA/TOF, long gap, anastomotic leak, days to oral feeds, GI complications [gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), dysmotility, oesophageal strictures, frequency of balloon dilatations, TOF recurrence] and respiratory complications [tracheomalacia, aortopexy, tracheostomy, recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs), structural airway abnormalities]. Infants were categorized into high-risk or low-risk groups based on the presence of perioperative risk factors identified by a Canadian observational study and morbidity outcomes were compared.

Definition of variables

Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Presence of irritability, poor weight gain and/or hematemesis with or without documented oesophagitis on endoscopy or biopsy was defined as GORD.

Non-eosinophilic, eosinophilic-dominant oesophagitis and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) response

We characterized oesophagitis as non-eosinophillic-dominant (if the total eosinophils counts were < 15/hpf) and eosinophilic-dominant oesophagitis. Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) was defined as symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction with a biopsy demonstrating > 15 eosinophils per high-powered field. This was further subclassified as responsive or non-responsive to PPI despite adequately dosed treatment with PPI. Response to PPI was defined by histological remission with reduction in eosinophils count < 15/hpf associated with clinical improvement.

Long gap OA

"Long gap OA" was defined as a gap longer than 3 cm, approximately greater than the height of two vertebral bodies or described as "moderate-high" or "excessive" tension by surgeons.

Anastomotic oesophageal stricture

Anastomotic oesophageal stricture (AS) was defined as an intrinsic luminal narrowing associated with presence of clinical symptoms (dysphagia, feeding difficulties, regurgitation, foreign body obstruction, heartburn and poor weight gain) detected by barium contrast study and/or endoscopy.

Refractory oesophageal stricture

Refractory oesophageal stricture (ROS) was defined according to the ESPGHAN-ESGE Guidelines as "the inability to successfully remediate the anatomic problem to obtain age-appropriate feeding possibilities after a maximum of 5 dilatations with maximal 4 week intervals".

### Surgical management of tracheobronchomalacia in children: indications, results and techniques based on a large case [^fc19eee5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) may require surgical treatment for a range of symptoms, from chronic barking cough to severe respiratory episodes. However, there is limited consensus on surgical indications and techniques. Moreover, few reports describe the clinical outcome of TBM surgery, which includes anterior aortopexy (AA) and posterior tracheopexy (PT). Therefore, we evaluated indications, outcomes and surgical techniques in a large series of patients operated at our center for TBM.

Methods

Since 2012, surgery was performed in 143 patients: 132 AA, mostly via mini-sternotomy, and 18 PT via thoracoscopy (14 cases robot-assisted). We evaluated surgical indications and outcome, by assessing the following pre- and postoperative parameters: life-threatening episodes, barking cough, stridor, recurrent respiratory infections, reduced exercise tolerance, and dysphagia.

Results

All patients underwent preoperative dynamic endoscopic evaluation and angio-CT. Surgery (AA, PT or both) was suggested according to a combination of clinical and endoscopic findings, after multidisciplinary team evaluation. Complication and hospital stay rate were similar for AA (18.9%; 8 days) and PT (16.7%; 8 days). Clinical improvement was observed in 89.1% after AA and 93.8% after PT. Complete resolution of symptoms was observed in 54.6% after AA and 50% after PT. Seven patients required both AA and PT.

Conclusion

In our large series of pediatric patients with TBM, surgical indications were based on a combination of clinical and endoscopic findings. Multidisciplinary team discussion is fundamental for correct management of these patients. AA and PT are complementary techniques, both effective and safe.

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^cd26747b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Implications of strength of recommendations to stakeholders — Table 1 specifies that for patients, under a strong recommendation "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action", while a conditional recommendation instructs clinicians to "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences". For policy makers, a strong recommendation implies "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations, including for the use as performance indicators", whereas a conditional recommendation notes "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary across locations".

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with tracheostomy in the acute care setting [^db2e0989]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

Evidence maturity and recommendation basis — this review states the available evidence is immature; recommendations are based on low-level evidence and in some cases no recommendations could be made; recommendations were strongly influenced by committee experience; despite the low level of supporting evidence, the benefits were likely to outweigh the harms; the lack of available evidence suggests potential variability and practice based on opinion that may contribute to poor outcomes; the review highlights an opportunity for well-designed clinical trials and notes that quality-assurance project results should be published to inform more rigorous investigations.

Data on these spirometry indices may be useful in clinical practice as such data may help in both clinical assessment and our understanding of the condition. Thus, we examined various aspects of spirometry in children with TM and related their spirometry data to TM findings on FB. In children with TM, we aimed to (i) describe spirometry indices, including parameters and flow‐volume curve pattern and the EI, and (ii) evaluated if any of these indices related to bronchoscopic TM features, including cross‐sectional lumen reduction, malacic length, and bronchomalacia (BM) involvement. We hypothesized that (i) children with TM have identifiable spirometry including parameters lower than normal population range and the "knee" pattern flow‐volume curve and (ii) there is an association between these spirometry parameters and bronchoscopic TM features. We also described the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings.
