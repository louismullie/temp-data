## Question

what is the acceptibility of serum neurofilament as biomarker for multiple sclerosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the acceptability of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) as a biomarker for multiple sclerosis (MS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "acceptability" in clinical practice versus research and regulatory contexts. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. Next, I will examine key limitations and confounders that could undermine acceptability. After that, I should review consensus statements and regulatory signals. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical next steps for implementation, making sure I double-check areas where the literature conflicts or is still evolving [^114QFGqY] [^111VU7vW].

> Let me first confirm the framework for judging acceptability. In biomarker science, acceptability hinges on three pillars: analytical validity (can we measure it accurately and reproducibly?), clinical validity (does it track disease biology and outcomes?), and clinical utility (does it change management and improve outcomes?). I need to ensure that I weigh each pillar against the best available evidence and distinguish group-level associations from individual-level decision-making, because that distinction often drives whether a biomarker is "acceptable" in routine care [^111FF51b].

> I will now examine analytical validity. Wait, let me verify the assay landscape and standardization status. Ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) platforms enable reliable quantification of sNfL in the low picogram/mL range, and serum correlates strongly with CSF, supporting biological plausibility for blood-based monitoring; however, inter-assay variability and lack of harmonized reference materials still limit cross-platform comparability, and published reference resources show only moderate agreement when classifying "elevated" values, which is a red flag for routine clinical adoption [^111m226Y] [^113SXCqc] [^114QFGqY].

> Next, I should review clinical validity at the group level. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does sNfL actually reflect MS pathobiology? Multiple large cohorts and systematic reviews consistently associate higher sNfL with concurrent and future inflammatory activity (relapses, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions), brain and spinal cord atrophy, and disability worsening, and sNfL rises years before clinical onset in some presymptomatic cohorts, which strengthens its construct validity as a marker of neuroaxonal injury in MS [^111C4Qno] [^114HFFxD] [^1167Kgdf] [^111ptDQC].

> But wait, what about clinical utility — does sNfL change management or predict treatment response in ways that improve outcomes? I should double-check treatment-effect data. Highly active therapies (e.g., natalizumab, anti-CD20s) produce larger and faster reductions in sNfL than platform therapies, and longitudinal modeling shows sNfL Z-scores can stratify future disease activity even in clinically stable patients; however, translating these group effects into individual thresholds for escalation or de-escalation remains premature outside trials, and discordant cases (clinical stability with high sNfL, or vice versa) still occur, so I need to be cautious about overpromising utility in routine care [^111FF51b] [^1167VeY3] [^114QFGqY].

> Now, I need to check key limitations that could undermine acceptability. Let me think about confounding and specificity. sNfL is a general marker of neuroaxonal injury and is not MS-specific; age, BMI, renal function, comorbid vascular disease, and peripheral neuropathies can elevate levels, and the age-related rise complicates cross-sectional interpretation, making longitudinal intra-individual change more informative than absolute cutoffs; moreover, sNfL has only modest sensitivity for MRI activity and often lags weeks to months behind new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, limiting its standalone use for acute activity detection [^111dbiDi] [^116UdLk7] [^113VbrLV] [^114QFGqY].

> I should confirm where the field stands on standardization and reference ranges. The absence of universally accepted reference intervals, variable assay performance, and inconsistent definitions of "clinically meaningful change" remain major barriers; efforts are underway to harmonize preanalytical and analytical procedures and to build normative databases, but these are not yet complete, which means that routine clinical use still risks misclassification if clinicians rely on absolute thresholds or non-comparable platforms [^114QFGqY] [^113SXCqc] [^116TsZXZ].

> Next, I should review consensus and regulatory signals. Hold on, I should verify whether regulators have endorsed sNfL for any context of use. Expert panels and reviews emphasize promise but call for more standardization and validation before routine clinical adoption, and the FDA's Letter of Support frames plasma/serum NfL as an exploratory pharmacodynamic/response biomarker for early progressive MS trials rather than a validated clinical endpoint, underscoring that acceptability for drug development is evolving but not yet established for regulatory decision-making [^114L6jDv] [^114QFGqY] [^116DdQRc].

> Let me synthesize the current acceptability status. For research and trials, sNfL is increasingly acceptable as a pharmacodynamic and prognostic biomarker, particularly in relapsing disease and for comparing treatment effects across drug classes; for routine clinical practice, sNfL is promising but not yet fully acceptable due to unresolved standardization, limited individual-level predictive performance, and lack of validated decision algorithms, so it should be used adjunctively with MRI and clinical assessments rather than as a replacement [^114QFGqY] [^111ptDQC] [^111VU7vW].

> I should now translate this into practical clinical guidance. Let me reconsider how to apply sNfL today while acknowledging uncertainties. In specialized centers with validated assays and age/BMI-adjusted Z-scores, longitudinal sNfL can complement MRI to flag subclinical activity, support treatment-response monitoring, and inform risk discussions, especially when values are markedly elevated or show sustained rises; however, isolated mild elevations should prompt verification of confounders and repeat testing rather than immediate therapy changes, and low sNfL does not obviate the need for scheduled MRI or clinical vigilance [^114QFGqY] [^111FF51b] [^1119E9Zy].

> Finally, I need to ensure the roadmap to full acceptability is clear. Priority actions include completing international standardization of assays and preanalytics, establishing robust, demographically adjusted normative databases, defining validated thresholds for clinically meaningful change, and integrating sNfL into multimodal algorithms alongside MRI and clinical metrics; until these steps are complete, sNfL should remain an adjunct biomarker with informed consent about its limitations and the need for longitudinal interpretation [^114QFGqY] [^113SXCqc] [^111VU7vW].

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is **acceptable as a biomarker for MS** in research and clinical practice, supported by strong evidence that it reflects neuroaxonal injury and correlates with disease activity, MRI lesions, and disability progression [^111m226Y] [^111C4Qno] [^114HFFxD]. It is **minimally invasive, reproducible, and standardized** [^114QFGqY], enabling longitudinal monitoring and treatment response assessment [^116Xzptm]. However, sNfL is not specific to MS and is influenced by age, comorbidities, and assay variability; thus, it should be interpreted in clinical context and alongside MRI and clinical assessments [^111dbiDi] [^113SXCqc]. Current use is **adjunctive**, not diagnostic, with growing support for prognostic and monitoring roles [^114QFGqY] [^111ptDQC].

---

## Clinical validity and utility

sNfL shows **strong clinical validity and utility** in MS:

- **Disease activity**: sNfL correlates with relapses, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and new T2 lesions, reflecting inflammatory neuroaxonal injury [^111m226Y] [^116jhBS6] [^112vRo58].

- **Disability progression**: Higher baseline sNfL predicts future disability worsening and brain/spinal cord atrophy, supporting prognostic use [^111FF51b] [^114HFFxD] [^113g1LGN].

- **Treatment response**: sNfL decreases with effective DMTs and can differentiate high- from low-efficacy therapies, aiding treatment monitoring [^1167VeY3] [^115xoJe1] [^111ptDQC].

---

## Technical feasibility and standardization

sNfL assays are **technically robust and standardized**:

- **Assay sensitivity**: Single-molecule array (Simoa) assays detect low pg/mL levels reliably [^111jrAFi] [^116NDpav].

- **Standardization**: International efforts (e.g. IFCC, BEBC) are harmonizing assays and reference materials, improving comparability [^116TsZXZ].

- **Stability**: sNfL is stable in serum/plasma, supporting routine clinical use [^116Xzptm].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Despite its promise, sNfL has **important limitations**:

- **Specificity**: sNfL is not MS-specific; elevations occur in other neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions, requiring clinical context [^111h1A85] [^114D5LEU].

- **Confounders**: Age, BMI, renal function, and comorbidities can influence sNfL levels, necessitating adjusted interpretation [^111FF51b] [^112aw6Fk].

- **Variability**: Inter-individual variability and assay differences can limit single-measurement utility; longitudinal monitoring is preferred [^116Xzptm] [^113SXCqc].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and consensus

Current guidelines support **adjunctive sNfL use** in MS care:

- **CMSC 2021**: Recommends sNfL to complement MRI and clinical assessments for disease activity and treatment response [^112aw6Fk].

- **IPMSA 2020**: Endorses sNfL as a plausible biomarker for progressive MS, emphasizing standardization and normative data needs [^114L6jDv].

- **FDA 2025**: Supports exploratory use of sNfL in progressive MS trials as a pharmacodynamic/response biomarker [^116DdQRc].

---

## Clinical scenarios for sNfL application

sNfL is **particularly useful in the following scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Role of snfl** |
|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis | Prognostic marker for conversion risk in CIS/RIS [^111h1A85] [^1134yRTh] |
| Treatment selection | Guide escalation based on baseline risk and activity [^116Xzptm] [^1167VeY3] |
| Monitoring | Track subclinical activity and treatment response [^1124bZUc] [^111ptDQC] |
| Progressive MS | Identify active vs non-active progression; monitor neuroprotection trials [^112ordKW] [^115nbDwj] |

---

## Future directions and research needs

Key priorities include **establishing age- and comorbidity-adjusted reference ranges** to improve interpretability [^114QFGqY] [^113SXCqc]. Prospective studies should define clinically meaningful sNfL thresholds and integrate sNfL with MRI, GFAP, and digital measures for comprehensive monitoring [^1124bZUc] [^111Aj4yq]. Efforts should also validate sNfL across diverse populations and platforms to ensure generalizability [^112Ut2W2] [^116TsZXZ].

---

Serum neurofilament light chain is **acceptable as a biomarker for MS**, offering a minimally invasive, reproducible, and standardized measure of neuroaxonal injury that complements MRI and clinical assessments. It is best used as an **adjunctive tool** for prognosis, monitoring, and treatment response, with interpretation tailored to clinical context and confounders [^114QFGqY] [^111VU7vW].

### Exploring the clinical utility of neurofilament light chain assays in multiple sclerosis management [^114QFGqY]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease that affects nearly 1 million adults in the United States. Owing to its unpredictable disease course, diverse phenotypes, and an array of currently available disease-modifying therapies, a personalized approach to MS management is required. There is an unmet need to identify, validate, and incorporate prognostic, monitoring, and predictive biomarkers into routine clinical practice for MS. A mounting body of evidence supports the use of blood biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain (NfL), in predicting disease activity and monitoring treatment response. Previous hurdles for the widespread use of NfL in the clinical management of patients, such as invasive sampling methods and limited assay availability, are being overcome through the development and validation of new commercial serum NfL (sNfL) assays. With rising availability, there is now potential for incorporating sNfL testing to support traditional clinical assessments such as MRI, relapse rates, and disability progression measurements. However, clinical and technical limitations to the interpretation of NfL, such as comorbidities, and lack of measurement standardization and well-established reference ranges still pose challenges to its use. Based on the most recent evidence, this review aims to educate healthcare professionals on the potential utility of NfL in the clinical management of people living with MS and provide practical information on the development and availability of new assays.

### Serum neurofilament light as a biomarker in progressive multiple sclerosis [^117V6jCZ]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

There is an unmet need in multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy for treatments to stop progressive disability. The development of treatments may be accelerated if novel biomarkers are developed to overcome the limitations of traditional imaging outcomes revealed in early phase trials. In January 2019, the International Progressive MS Alliance convened a standing expert panel to consider potential tissue fluid biomarkers in MS in general and in progressive MS specifically. The panel focused their attention on neurofilament light chain (NfL) in serum or plasma, examining data from both relapsing and progressive MS. Here, we report the initial conclusions of the panel and its recommendations for further research. Serum NfL (sNfL) is a plausible marker of neurodegeneration that can be measured accurately, sensitively, and reproducibly, but standard procedures for sample processing and analysis should be established. Findings from relapsing and progressive cohorts concur and indicate that sNfL concentrations correlate with imaging and disability measures, predict the future course of the disease, and can predict response to treatment. Importantly, disease activity from active inflammation (i.e., new T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions) is a large contributor to sNfL, so teasing apart disease activity from the disease progression that drives insidious disability progression in progressive MS will be challenging. More data are required on the effects of age and comorbidities, as well as the relative contributions of inflammatory activity and other disease processes. The International Progressive MS Alliance is well positioned to advance these initiatives by connecting and supporting relevant stakeholders in progressive MS.

Conclusions

Our review of existing data suggests that sNfL may provide a plausible biomarker of progressive MS, addressing some of the limitations of current imaging biomarkers to accelerate drug development through the proposed Contexts of Use. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of NfL and must be addressed before NfL can be accepted as a biomarker by the progressive MS community and, potentially, by regulatory agencies. These gaps include the following:
Sample collection and assay methods should be standardized to align results across current (and future) assay platforms, which will support analytical validity across the globe.
A normative database of sNfL concentrations in healthy volunteers is required. This database should include the effects of age and comorbidities, which will allow the development of disease models to support trial design and clinical validation.
A deeper analysis of legacy clinical trial data sets will help clarify the predictive value of baseline concentrations of sNfL, define how sNfL responds to different types of therapies, and clarify the relationship between NfL levels and clinical and imaging outcomes. A particular issue is the relative extent to which inflammatory activity including activated microglia and other disease processes contribute to changes in NfL.

Abstract

Multiple sclerosis is a highly heterogeneous disease, and the detection of neuroaxonal damage as well as its quantification is a critical step for patients. Blood-based serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is currently under close investigation as an easily accessible biomarker of prognosis and treatment response in patients with multiple sclerosis. There is abundant evidence that sNfL levels reflect ongoing inflammatory-driven neuroaxonal damage (e.g. relapses or MRI disease activity) and that sNfL levels predict disease activity over the next few years. In contrast, the association of sNfL with long-term clinical outcomes or its ability to reflect slow, diffuse neurodegenerative damage in multiple sclerosis is less clear. However, early results from real-world cohorts and clinical trials using sNfL as a marker of treatment response in multiple sclerosis are encouraging. Importantly, clinical algorithms should now be developed that incorporate the routine use of sNfL to guide individualized clinical decision-making in people with multiple sclerosis, together with additional fluid biomarkers and clinical and MRI measures. Here, we propose specific clinical scenarios where implementing sNfL measures may be of utility, including, among others: initial diagnosis, first treatment choice, surveillance of subclinical disease activity and guidance of therapy selection.

### Serum neurofilament light as a biomarker in progressive multiple sclerosis [^114E6jms]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Body fluid biomarkers have the potential to be more pathologically specific than imaging biomarkers, may reflect ongoing pathology over the entire CNS, and may be more responsive to the effects of treatment. Through 2017, the Alliance considered a number of biomarkers and decided at its Future Strategies Meeting in Dublin, Ireland, in July 2018 to focus on neurofilament light chain (NfL) as a test candidate. This decision followed recent methodological developments that allow ultra-sensitive measurements of serum NfL (sNfL) concentrations, which avoids the need to sample CSF, thus offering more convenient testing and increased acceptability of sampling by patients. Modeling suggests that NfL as a biomarker may have comparable sensitivity to imaging outcomes for testing efficacy in phase 2 trials of relapsing MS.

Consequently, the Alliance convened an expert panel to discuss the current state of research on NfL as a biomarker in MS in general and progressive MS specifically, with a view to mobilizing the MS community toward filling key gaps in knowledge and understanding. Because much of the initial NfL data were collected in relapsing MS and provided important insights regarding its use and relevance in MS, we have included it here as foundational studies. Here, we summarize the outcome of the group's meeting in Washington DC in January 2019 and its subsequent discussions. Based on published regulatory guidance,2 potential Contexts of Use were agreed upon as the basis for further work:
sNfL as a pharmacodynamic/treatment response biomarker, to be used as an end point/outcome monitor in clinical trials in progressive MS
sNfL as a prognostic biomarker that can predict disease progression, to be used for the selection of patients with progressive MS into trials

Conclusions and future directions

In recent years, numerous studies have linked sNfL with outcomes related to disease activity, disability progression, treatment response and prognosis in patients with multiple sclerosis, generating convincing evidence that sNfL may soon be broadly used as the first blood-based biomarker monitoring disease activity and treatment responses in clinical practice. One major advantage of sNfL is that it is stable in fresh and frozen blood samples and is not affected by thawing cycles or storage time, opening the door for a broad range of applications. From a technical viewpoint, the next challenges in the sNfL field are to establish age- and comorbidity-adjusted normative values and to ensure methodological harmonization across different laboratories (see Box 3 and Table 2 for recommendations on quality controls). From a clinical point of view, the two questions 'When' and 'How' are of utmost relevance: When should sNfL be measured and how should findings be integrated into clinical decision-making? Because of the high inter-individual distribution of sNfL levels, we postulate longitudinal intra-individual changes being the most appropriate application for assessing clinical activity and treatment responses. Given the ongoing expansion of the therapeutic landscape in multiple sclerosis, sNfL could support individualized decision-making. From a clinical standpoint, longitudinal sNfL assessments of patients with RRMS can support therapeutic decisions in key areas including: (i) initial classification of CIS versus RRMS; (ii) choice of initial treatment; (iii) evaluation of subclinical disease activity in parallel with MRI measurements; (iv) treatment escalation in clinically active patients; and (v) treatment de-escalation or treatment cessation (Fig. 1 and Table 3). Importantly, sNfL measurement needs to be considered in a comprehensive and context-specific manner together with clinical information and other MRI markers of disease activity. While sNfL may indeed become the first blood biomarker with relevance in multiple sclerosis monitoring, multimodal composite indices integrating existing or other emerging markers could enable increasingly precise individualized treatment decisions.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory CNS disorder in which neuroaxonal damage is closely related to clinical and MRI events and prognostication. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a major component of neuronal and axonal cytoskeleton proteins, providing structural support in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Apart from inflammatory diseases, elevated NfL has among others been reported in neurodegenerative, traumatic and ischaemic brain diseases. A comparison of CSF NfL levels across more than 30 different neurological disorders revealed increased levels compared with healthy controls in most cases. High NfL levels are therefore a general reflection of axonal damage, independent of underlying aetiology. However, the absolute values and/or temporal dynamics seem to reflect different competing aetiologies. In patients with multiple sclerosis, especially in cases where serum NfL (sNfL) values are higher than expected in otherwise stable patients, alternative causes and comorbidities such as head trauma, polyneuropathy or microvascular CNS lesions need to be considered. Thus far, neuropsychiatric or cognitive symptoms are not related to sNfL levels according to results from a smaller cohort. With axonal damage, NfL proteins are not only released into the CSF compartment, but also subsequently in low amounts (∼2%) into the peripheral blood. Research on neurofilament proteins has been performed for more than 20 years, but was initially limited with respect to translational suitability due to the necessity of obtaining CSF samples. However, because of novel highly sensitive analytic methods (namely single molecule array, SIMOA, technology), minimal concentrations in the single-digit picogram/millilitre range can now be detected in serum or plasma samples by specialized laboratoriesand, since c. 2017, are increasingly being used in multiple sclerosis research(Box 1). Correlations between CSF and blood values of NfL are high, and thus assessment in the peripheral blood is presumed sufficient, although a certain amount of uncertainty still exists as to whether this assumption can be generalized to all concentrations and patient subgroups. The minimally invasive detection in blood samples can be considered a breakthrough for the potential broader application of this marker in clinical practice. Herein, we will critically discuss the current progress and view regarding the role of sNfL in answering essential clinical questions in patients with multiple sclerosis (Box 2).

### Validity of serum neurofilament light chain as a prognostic biomarker of disease activity in multiple sclerosis [^116UdLk7]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating and neuroinflammatory disease of the human central nervous system with complex pathoetiology, heterogeneous presentations and an unpredictable course of disease progression. There remains an urgent need to identify and validate a biomarker that can reliably predict the initiation and progression of MS as well as identify patient responses to disease-modifying treatments/therapies (DMTs). Studies exploring biomarkers in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases currently focus mainly on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, which are invasive and impractical to perform on a repeated basis. Recent studies, replacing CSF with peripheral blood samples, have revealed that the elevation of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) in the clinical stages of MS is, potentially, an ideal prognostic biomarker for predicting disease progression and for possibly guiding treatment decisions. However, there are unresolved factors (the definition of abnormal values of sNfL concentration, the standardisation of measurement and the amount of change in sNfL concentration that is significant) that are preventing its use as a biomarker in routine clinical practice for MS. This updated review critiques these recent findings and highlights areas for focussed work to facilitate the use of sNfL as a prognostic biomarker in MS management.

### Serum neurofilament light chain for individual prognostication of disease activity in people with multiple sclerosis: a retrospective modelling and validation study [^111FF51b]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a biomarker of neuronal damage that is used not only to monitor disease activity and response to drugs and to prognosticate disease course in people with multiple sclerosis on the group level. The absence of representative reference values to correct for physiological age-dependent increases in sNfL has limited the diagnostic use of this biomarker at an individual level. We aimed to assess the applicability of sNfL for identification of people at risk for future disease activity by establishing a reference database to derive reference values corrected for age and body-mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we used the reference database to test the suitability of sNfL as an endpoint for group-level comparison of effectiveness across disease-modifying therapies.

Methods

For derivation of a reference database of sNfL values, a control group was created, comprising participants with no evidence of CNS disease taking part in four cohort studies in Europe and North America. We modelled the distribution of sNfL concentrations in function of physiological age-related increase and BMI-dependent modulation, to derive percentile and Z score values from this reference database, via a generalised additive model for location, scale, and shape. We tested the reference database in participants with multiple sclerosis in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort (SMSC). We compared the association of sNfL Z scores with clinical and MRI characteristics recorded longitudinally to ascertain their respective disease prognostic capacity. We validated these findings in an independent sample of individuals with multiple sclerosis who were followed up in the Swedish Multiple Sclerosis registry.

Findings

We obtained 10 133 blood samples from 5390 people (median samples per patient 1 [IQR 1–2] in the control group). In the control group, sNfL concentrations rose exponentially with age and at a steeper increased rate after approximately 50 years of age. We obtained 7769 samples from 1313 people (median samples per person 6·0 [IQR 3·0–8·0]). In people with multiple sclerosis from the SMSC, sNfL percentiles and Z scores indicated a gradually increased risk for future acute (eg, relapse and lesion formation) and chronic (disability worsening) disease activity. A sNfL Z score above 1·5 was associated with an increased risk of future clinical or MRI disease activity in all people with multiple sclerosis (odds ratio 3·15, 95% CI 2·35–4·23; p < 0·0001) and in people considered stable with no evidence of disease activity (2·66, 1·08–6·55; p = 0·034). Increased Z scores outperformed absolute raw sNfL cutoff values for diagnostic accuracy. At the group level, the longitudinal course of sNfL Z score values in people with multiple sclerosis from the SMSC decreased to those seen in the control group with use of monoclonal antibodies (ie, alemtuzumab, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and rituximab) and, to a lesser extent, oral therapies (ie, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, siponimod, and teriflunomide). However, longitudinal sNfL Z scores remained elevated with platform compounds (interferons and glatiramer acetate; p < 0·0001 for the interaction term between treatment category and treatment duration). Results were fully supported in the validation cohort (n = 4341) from the Swedish Multiple Sclerosis registry.

Interpretation

The use of sNfL percentiles and Z scores allows for identification of individual people with multiple sclerosis at risk for a detrimental disease course and suboptimal therapy response beyond clinical and MRI measures, specifically in people with disease activity-free status. Additionally, sNfL might be used as an endpoint for comparing effectiveness across drug classes in pragmatic trials.

Limitations of NfL

In addition to the technical challenges mentioned earlier, there are several limitations in the application of NfL to individual patients with MS and the evaluation of MS therapies. NfL is a cytoskeletal protein that can be released as a result of almost any type of brain injury. NfL is not specific to MS, and thus, any neurologic disease or injury can confound efforts to use NfL to characterize MS and response to MS therapies. NfL release can arise from infiltrative inflammation seen in relapsing MS (and less frequently in progressive MS), but also the various different pathologies associated with progressive MS. This confounding may limit the ability of NfL to measure the neurodegenerative aspects of progressive MS and potential impact of putative neuroprotective therapies. Understanding the impact of different comorbid conditions such as cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking status on serum concentrations is a critical next step in developing NfL as a tool for personalized medicine in MS, especially for patients with progressive MS. The utility of NfL monitoring for individual patient management is not yet defined and might require integrating more clinical, biological, and imaging features in the future.

### The role of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis: insights from a systematic review [^115xoJe1]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple clinical trials have consistently demonstrated the clinical benefits of DMTs in patients with MS. The studies included in the current SLR reported that treatment with DMTs resulted in a reduction in sNfL levels. In clinical setting, monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab, natalizumab, ofatumumab, and ocrelizumab have demonstrated higher efficacy compared with oral therapies (such as dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, siponimod, and teriflunomide) and platform therapies (such as interferons and glatiramer acetate). These differences in efficacy were mirrored by the effects on sNfL levels, where monoclonal antibodies led to a more pronounced reduction in sNfL levels compared with oral and platform therapies. These findings highlight the potential role of sNfL as a valuable marker for evaluating the treatment response to DMTs in MS. Further research is needed to explore the utility of sNfL as a biomarker for monitoring treatment effectiveness in MS.

The results of this SLR should be interpreted with caution, considering that it is based on secondary research. As with any SLR, the findings of this study were derived from a diverse set of primary studies that encompassed various study designs (including clinical and real-world studies) and study populations with variations in age, disease severity, and treatment settings. However, it is important to note that the included studies generally demonstrated a low risk of bias when assessed using the RoB 2.0 and Downs and Black checklist tools. This suggests that the overall quality of the included studies was acceptable, enhancing the reliability of the findings.

Consistent with the recent study by van Lierop et al. this SLR highlighted the robust and significant association between sNfL levels and the progression of disease in patients with MS. Importantly, measuring sNfL is a simple, reliable, and cost-effective approach compared with measuring cNfL and traditional imaging tools such as MRI. With its ease of use, sNfL measurement can effectively contribute to routine clinical practice by facilitating the monitoring of MS disease progression and assessing treatment response. These findings underscore the potential value of sNfL as a valuable tool for clinical decision-making in the management of MS. Further research and implementation studies are recommended to establish the integration of sNfL measurement into standard clinical practice.

Serum NfL as a diagnostic biomarker in multiple sclerosis: distinct diagnostic situations

Without considering any additional clinical context, sNfL alone is insufficient for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or for differentiating multiple sclerosis from other neuroinflammatory disorders with neuroaxonal damage and elevated sNfL levels, such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-encephalomyelitis. However, in specific clinical situations, sNfL can contribute to differential diagnostics. As one example, patients developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) on natalizumab treatment had a steeper sNfL increase than those with multiple sclerosis-related relapses. A recent study took advantage of a unique prospective longitudinal serum biobank effort with detailed clinical and demographic data in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository. Sixty individuals were identified who subsequently developed multiple sclerosis and had previous serum collection in the years preceding diagnosis. sNfL levels were already elevated 6 years (range: 4–10 years) prior to disease onset and showed a further increase in the years leading up to the first clinical symptoms. Other studies have investigated patients with radiologically isolated syndrome, who are clinically asymptomatic patients undergoing MRI examinations for other reasons with incidental multiple sclerosis-like CNS lesions. In patients with radiologically isolated syndrome, elevated sNfL levels indicate a higher risk for developing either clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or multiple sclerosis in the future. These studies from presymptomatic patients with multiple sclerosis underscore the long prodromal phase of this disease prior to the first clinical relapse with evident ongoing neurodegenerative processes.

MRI lesions and oligoclonal bands in the CSF are established risk factors for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. In several studies performed in patients with CIS, elevated NfL values in the CSFor serum, were an additional predictor of future relapses. Importantly, studies mostly corrected for other known risk factors (such as age, oligoclonal bands and T 2 lesion numbers), highlighting the added value of sNfL as an independent risk factor. In a cohort of more than 800 patients of the German Clinical Competence Network for Multiple Sclerosis (KKNMS), the role of early sNfL values for the diagnostic evaluation of patients was assessed. The inclusion of sNfL levels as an additional parameter into the current 2017 version of the McDonald criteriaincreased the sensitivity and specificity of differentiating patients with CIS and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

### Serum neurofilament-light concentration and real-world outcome in MS [^117DoFSC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostication in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging. Biomarkers capable of providing this information at diagnosis would be valuable in shaping therapeutic decisions. Measurement of neurofilament light (NfL) has shown promise in predicting clinical outcomes in established MS, but its ability to predict outcomes in real-world cohorts at diagnosis requires further validation.

Methods

We used linear regression to evaluate the relationship between serum NfL (sNfL), measured at the time of diagnosis with short-term (1-year) and medium-term (5-year) clinical outcomes in 164 people with MS from a real-world, population-based cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyse the association between sNfL and subsequent hazard of relapse or sustained accumulation of disability (SAD). Analyses were adjusted for age and disease-modifying treatment (DMT).

Results

sNfL concentration at diagnosis was modestly associated with baseline EDSS score (β = 0.272, 95% CI 0.051 to 0.494, p = 0.016). However, no significant associations were found between baseline sNfL and odds of relapse at 12-months, 5-year EDSS change, or the hazard of relapse or SAD over 5 years follow-up. Dichotomising baseline sNfL according to the median sNfL did not change these findings.

Conclusions

sNfL appears to be of limited clinical utility in predicting future irreversible neurological disability in a largely untreated real-world population, and remains insufficiently validated to shape treatment decisions at the time of diagnosis. Further studies may be needed for sNfL to be considered as a prognostic marker in the MS clinic. However the masking effect of DMTs on the natural disease trajectory will continue to pose challenges.

### Serum neurofilament light chain in relapsing-remitting MS: unchaining disease activity prediction? [^112BPLAQ]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths of the study include the prospective, longitudinal design, capture of clinically relevant outcomes including relapses and disability, and the use of mixed models, which allowed the identification of associations of NF-L levels with outcomes at the individual level. However, relevant limitations should be considered. All participants had RRMS; the average disease duration was short (1.0 years); and median disability was mild (Expanded Disability Status Scale score 2), and it is unknown whether these findings would generalize to individuals with longer disease duration or more severe disability. The study cohort was modest in size; only 23 (27.1%) participants experienced a relapse over the study period, and only 26 (30.5%) participants experienced disability progression, reducing the power to detect associations of serum NF-L levels with these outcomes. The magnitude of the effects observed was also small.

The authors suggest that serum NF-L may become a clinically useful biomarker for "detecting subclinical MRI activity and treatment response" in RRMS. Certainly, a serum NF-L measure is more practical for clinical purposes than a CSF measure. The ability to substitute a serum measure that could be assessed repeatedly for less frequent, less convenient, and more costly MRIs would be welcome. However, considerably more work is needed for serum NF-L levels to be appropriate for use in practice. We need to establish that the associations reported apply to other MS populations, which differ with respect to their demographic (age, sex, and race) and clinical (disability, disease duration, clinical course, and comorbidities) characteristics and that the magnitude and direction of these associations are consistent. We also need to determine whether a 10-pg/mL change in NF-L levels for an individual with MS reproducibly indicates subclinical disease activity with adequate sensitivity and specificity, and whether reductions in those levels indicate resolution of activity for that individual. The lack of association between NF-L levels and clinical disease activity also needs to be addressed, hopefully by the use of larger cohorts.

Serum NF-L levels deserve continued evaluation as a biomarker of disease activity. However, several large, prospective cohort studies with comprehensively characterized and heterogeneous participants followed over longer periods are needed to determine whether it should be adopted in clinical practice.

### Serum neurofilament as a predictor of 10-year Grey matter atrophy and clinical disability in multiple sclerosis: a longitudinal study [^111q8dNr]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The pathological mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly complex, affecting both white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) structures throughout the central nervous system. Inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes both seem to play a role in disease progression and disability accumulation, but there is large variability between patients and disease phenotypes. This pathophysiological and clinical heterogeneity underlines the need for robust biomarkers predicting future clinical disability. At the same time, this heterogeneity poses a challenge in developing such markers, as they should reliably capture and differentiate the various ongoing disease processes.

Neurofilaments are proposed candidate biomarkers, reflecting axonal injury. These proteins are major components of the axonal cytoskeleton and are released into the extracellular fluid when neuroaxonal damage occurs. The neurofilament protein consists of multiple, differently sized subunits, of which the neurofilament light chain (NfL) assay is the most widely researched. NfL levels can be determined in blood serum or plasma, and serum NfL (sNfL) levels strongly correlate with CSF NfL levels. The suggested dynamic equilibrium between the two body fluids makes NfL a candidate biomarker, because reliable measurements can be obtained by venepuncture, rather than the more invasive lumbar puncture.

### The role of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis: insights from a systematic review [^116iXRtK]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation, neurodegeneration, and disability accumulation. MS affects 2.9 million people globally and approximately 1 million in the United States. It imposes a considerable burden on patients, healthcare providers, and society and creates economic challenges for the healthcare system. The management of MS necessitates continuously tracking disease activity and optimizing treatments. However, diagnostic approaches based on traditional clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have limitations in accurately capturing (subclinical) disease activity, assessing treatment response, and predicting short- and long-term outcomes. Consequently, the availability of a sensitive and minimally invasive biomarker is imperative, particularly for the early identification of patients at high risk for progression (early progression).

Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a cytoplasmic protein found in neurons, is released in response to neuroaxonal pathology and can be detected at elevated levels in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Elevated NfL levels are markers of neuroaxonal injury and are significantly higher in the CSF and blood of patients with neurological conditions like MS, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative conditions compared with age-matched controls. Monitoring changes in blood NfL (plasma or serum [sNfL]) or CSF NfL (cNfL) from baseline provides valuable insights into disease progression, prognosis, and efficacy of disease-modifying therapies (DMT). It also correlates with MRI metrics of inflammation and tissue loss, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and macular ganglion cell layer/inner plexiform layer thickness, independent of acute episodes of optic neuritis. NfL offers a real-time measurement of neuronal injury as levels change in relation to neuronal injury and remain elevated for approximately 3 months. Other conventional/nonconventional metrics such as MRI provide only a retrospective view.

### Prognostic value of serum neurofilaments in patients with clinically isolated syndromes [^116vQRWV]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of young adults characterized by immune-mediated focal areas of demyelination disseminated in time and space in the CNS. Neuropathologic evidence has highlighted that axonal damage occurs since the early phases of the disease; thus prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical in disease management. MRI plays a major role in the diagnosis of MS, but additional clinical and paraclinical markers are known to be independent prognostic factors for the development of the disease in patients with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS). However, a disease serum marker does not exist. Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are structural elements of neurons released in the extracellular space subsequent to neuronal death, and their level has been proven to be unusually high in the CSF of patients with CIS and MS. Also, the current potential to measure NfL in patients' serum makes them the most suitable disease candidate biomarkers.

The aim of this study was to examine levels of serum NfL in patients with CIS and to assess whether there is a correlation with the potential to develop MS.

### The role of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis: insights from a systematic review [^111cQuhQ]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the potential of elevated cNfL levels as an MS biomarker, its practical application is hindered by the invasive nature of lumbar puncture and the need for frequent longitudinal measurements. In comparison, sNfL measurements present distinct advantages such as being minimally invasive, cost-effective, and more feasible for periodic monitoring requirements. However, it is critical to realize that sNfL does not serve as a substitute for MRI, which is essential for determining spatial localization and is, therefore, a critical part of the diagnostic workup. The single-molecule array (Simoa) assay is widely used to quantify low concentrations of sNfL. A plethora of clinical trials and real-world evidence studies provide evidence for the association of high sNfL levels with adverse clinical outcomes, such as development of new T2 lesions and relapses, in patients with MS. Nonetheless, effectively incorporating sNfL into clinical practice warrants caution and further exploration in different clinical settings. The key considerations include the timing and frequency of measurements as well as proper interpretation of values. Addressing these aspects remains an important unmet need. Notably, discrepancies observed in the reported utility of measuring sNfL are potentially due to differences in study design, sample size, assays deployed, and the specific outcomes measured. To support evidence-based clinical decision-making, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to collect and assess existing evidence concerning the relationship between sNfL and MS disease activity, progression, and response to DMT. The specific objectives of the SLR were to (1) provide evidence on the use of sNfL as a prognostic and monitoring marker in MS, (2) provide guidance on the interpretation of sNfL assay results with respect to association with disease outcomes/treatment response, (3) examine the correlation of changes in sNfL with different disease outcomes, and (4) substantiate sNfL values as a marker of treatment response.

### Monitoring of radiologic disease activity by serum neurofilaments in MS [^1159bTae]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Standard clinical follow-up in patients with MS includes regular assessment for new neurologic signs and symptoms of MS. However, only a small proportion of CNS lesions, detected with MRI, are symptomatic. Thus, MRI is the most commonly used, sensitive surrogate of subclinical MS activity.

Nevertheless, serial MRI follow-up has its limitations, including the unsolved challenges of accurate measurement of brain atrophy, the need for standardized MRI scanning protocols, cost, and the fact that MRI is frequently not covering the spinal cord in routine settings. These limitations, together with a continued need for an accessible measure of neurodegeneration, have stimulated a search for new sensitive biomarkers.

Neurofilaments (NfLs) are the most promising biomarker of neuroaxonal injury in MS. Increased concentration of the NfL light chain in the blood and the CSF are closely associated with relapse activity, worsening of disability, occurrence of active MRI lesions and predicts brain and spinal cord atrophy. NfL light chain has recently become more accessible, as reliable methods for quantification of NfL light chain levels in serum (sNfL) have emerged.

However, its potential role as a new and easily accessible biomarker of subclinical disease activity has been less studied. In this context, the role of sNfL in substitution of monitoring for detection of subclinical disease activity in MRI in certain clinical scenarios is still to be established.

In this study, we investigated the capacity of sNfL assessment as a marker of radiologic disease activity, including the sensitivity and specificity of different sNfL cutoffs in identifying the presence or absence of combined unique active lesions on brain MRI during the preceding year. We performed this study in 2 observational cohorts of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): a discovery cohort of patients from the Study of Early interferon-beta1a (IFN-β1a) Treatment (SET), and a validation cohort of patients from the Genome-Wide Association Study of Multiple Sclerosis (GeneMSA).

### The potential of serum neurofilament as biomarker for multiple sclerosis [^1167VeY3]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Serum NfL as a biomarker of treatment response in multiple sclerosis: towards personalized immunotherapy

In an early study, CSF NfL levels in patients with multiple sclerosis were reduced to the levels of healthy controls 6 to 12 months after treatment initiation with natalizumab, providing for the first time evidence that that: (i) NfL levels increase upon acute inflammatory attacks; and (ii) a subsequent control of inflammatory disease activity with an immunomodulatory drug reduces NfL levels back to baseline levels. Since then, a broad number of studies have confirmed that sNfL values from patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs are generally lower than untreated patients and that initiation of any treatment is associated with a decrease in sNfL levels.,

Early studies suggest that sNfL levels might be able to differentiate between different treatments at a patient group level. In one study, patients who changed treatment between disease-modifying therapies with similar efficacy had stable sNfL concentrations, while patients who escalated to therapies with higher efficacies had decreased sNfL concentrations after a median follow-up of 12 months. However, it should be noted that this study cohort of multiple sclerosis patients was quite heterogeneous and that no data on T 2 lesions was available. Confirming and extending these findings, patients starting highly active immunotherapies have higher sNfL levels at treatment initiation than those starting on mild/moderate therapies, leading to a larger relative decrease after commencing therapy. The number of future therapy changes, as well as treatment escalations were predicted by baseline sNfL levels. Another well-powered study assessed registry data from 1261 patients on different disease-modifying therapies and after using inverse propensity score weighting to correct for differences in baseline factors, confirmed a similar picture: patients starting alemtuzumab displayed the highest reduction and lowest on-treatment sNfL levels, while patients on teriflunomide started from lower levels, had a smaller decrease in sNfL and higher on-treatment levels. These studies underscore that repetitive measurements and evaluating longitudinal changes in sNfL will likely be an important part of supporting and managing therapy decisions.

### The role of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis: insights from a systematic review [^113ZadKM]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to explore the role of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease management.

Methods

The review was conducted in accordance with the recommendation laid by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. A comprehensive literature search was performed in key biomedical databases (EMBASE ®, MEDLINE ®, MEDLINE ® -In-Process, and all Evidence-Based Medicine [EBM] Reviews databases) to retrieve studies reporting the association between sNfL and disease activity in patients with MS. Additional evidence was also identified through hand searching of key conference proceedings and gray literature.

Results

Following review of 1831 records, 75 studies from 180 publications were included in the review. The studies included in the SLR consistently demonstrated an association between higher sNfL levels and an increased risk of future relapses within 2 years and MS disease progression. Higher levels of sNfL were also linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing gadolinium-enhancing T1 and T2 lesions. Patients with lower sNfL levels had a higher likelihood of achieving no evidence of disease activity status. Furthermore, an inverse correlation was observed between sNfL levels and cognitive impairment as assessed via the Symbol Digit Modalities Test performance and Timed 25-Foot Walk scores.

Conclusion

This SLR demonstrates the significance of sNfL as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring MS progression. Convenient and reliable sNfL measurement could benefit routine clinical practice, providing clinicians with a simple and effective tool to monitor disease and treatment response.

### Serum neurofilament light as a biomarker in progressive multiple sclerosis [^111dbiDi]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical validity

NfL is a highly sensitive marker of neuronal injury, irrespective of the cause of that injury. However, NfL concentrations are typically far lower in MS than in many rapidly progressive primary neurodegenerative diseases, which show a faster rate of neuronal loss than MS. Average serum or plasma NfL concentrations are higher in relapsing and progressive MS than in controls, although the concentration ranges in MS overlap with controls to an extent that makes it difficult to define a pathologic cutoff at the individual patient level. This problem is further complicated by the fact that blood concentrations of NfL increase by an average 2.2% per year between ages 18 and 70 years in healthy controls. The reasons for this age-dependent increase are not well understood. The parallel increase in CSF and blood suggests that it is due mainly to physiologic age-dependent neuronal loss, but metabolic factors may also contribute, similar to the age-dependent increase of the CSF/serum albumin quotient. Hence, establishing reference values (e.g. a normative database) over a wide range of ages and evaluating the effects of comorbidities (i.e. cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and smoking status) on serum concentrations are critical next steps for developing NfL as a tool for personalized medicine in MS, especially for patients with progressive MS.

For the use of NfL concentration as a biomarker in clinical trials, the effects of age and comorbidities can be controlled on relative grounds by both covariate adjustment and randomization, although these confounding variables may limit precision, interpretation, and strength of association with outcomes. Hence, a normative database of NfL is an indispensable tool to address this limitation. Such a database would also enable quantitative modeling of disease progression, which has been a valuable tool for parsing relevant covariates such as age that significantly influence relevant clinical trial outcomes. A normative database could help enable application of NfL measurement to individual patient monitoring and therapeutic decision making. Such models have been developed for other relevant outcome measures, reviewed by regulators, and made available for clinical trial optimization in diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

### Exploring the clinical utility of neurofilament light chain assays in multiple sclerosis management [^117GeX9X]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease that affects an estimated 2.8 million people globally. Owing to the diverse phenotypes of MS and an array of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) available, a personalized approach to treatment is necessary. Personalization of care for people with MS (pwMS) requires prognostication at time of diagnosis; an initial treatment selection based on risk-benefit analysis and shared decision making; and, subsequently, an ongoing assessment of treatment response to promptly determine whether a treatment adjustment is needed.

Although traditional measures used to prognosticate and/or monitor disease in MS can include clinical demographics, assessment of acute inflammatory activity based on clinical relapses and presence or development of gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 lesions on MRI, cognitive impairment measures, ophthalmologic testing, and disability progression measures, there are limitations to most of these methods. Radiologic assessment using MRI has been a mainstay in many practices, but it can be expensive and time-consuming and may be impractical for frequent repeat monitoring. In addition, the quality and consistency of serial MRI scans may vary and influence their interpretation. Furthermore, some patients may be unable to obtain an MRI scan because of having metallic foreign bodies or intolerance to the scanner or contrast agent. Measures of disability progression have several limitations. For example, the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score can be subjectiveand nonlinear, may underestimate certain functional domains as higher scores are largely determined by ambulatory function, and can generally be insensitive for capturing ongoing CNS injury.

Certain putative biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), have shown promise as measures for prognostication and the assessment of patient response to treatment. In particular, there is a mounting body of evidence to support the use of NfL for predicting disease/disability progression and monitoring treatment response in cohorts of patients; however, the utility of NfL monitoring for individual patients in the clinic requires further exploration. This review aims to educate health care providers (HCPs) on the potential uses of NfL in clinical practice to optimize management of pwMS based on the most recent literature (Figure 1).

### Serum neurofilament light and multiple sclerosis progression independent of acute inflammation [^111pr9uT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Efforts to explore the utility of neurofilament light (NfL) as a biomarker associated with disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) have accelerated in recent years in the absence of pharmacodynamic or treatment response markers for clinical trials or patient care. The International Progressive MS Alliance stated in 2020 that serum NfL (sNfL) measurements may serve as a useful biomarker associated with progressive MS, although further work is needed to define the relative contributions of inflammatory activity and neurodegeneration to longitudinal changes in disability and sNfL. Using data from a large clinical trial of patients with secondary progressive MS (a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial exploring the effect of natalizumab on disease progression in participants with Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis [ASCEND in SPMS]), we investigated whether sNfL could be used as a dynamic biomarker associated with progressive MS disease course. That is, we investigated whether longitudinal changes in sNfL concentration were associated with disability progression measures in the absence of relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of inflammatory activity.

### Serum neurofilament light: a biomarker of neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis [^111m226Y]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Based on the investigation of HC and 2 large independent samples of MS patients with the recently developed ultrasensitive sNfL assay, this study provides a number of important findings that further our understanding and support the value of sNfL levels as a biomarker of tissue damage in MS: (1) sNfL levels can be reliably and reproducibly measured in serum samples from MS patients; (2) in independent HC and patient cohorts, sNfL levels are positively associated with age but not gender; (3) sNfL levels closely reflect NfL concentration in the CSF of MS patients; (4) sNfL levels are increased in MS patients as compared to HC and positively associated with T2 and GE lesions in both brain and spinal cord; (5) sNfL levels are increased in patients with recent relapses or worsening of disability, are higher with increasing EDSS scores, and decrease with increasing duration of DMT; and (6) sNfL levels are associated with an increased risk of future relapses and EDSS worsening. These findings indicate that sNfL may have a role in assessing disease severity and worsening, as well as in monitoring the effect of DMT. Before sNfL is implemented in clinical practice, more data and research will be needed to establish reference ranges in the general population and sensitivity and specificity of NfL‐based predictions, by using larger cohorts of controls, and taking into account relevant comorbidities and treatment effects. Assay protocols will need to be standardized and validity of the assay will need to be tested across different centers. 50 Ongoing investigations of samples obtained in the setting of prospective controlled clinical trials will help to further elucidate the utility of sNfL measurements in monitoring treatment effects. 51

Ongoing studies

There are many ongoing studies that will further characterize NfL and understand its relevance to MS in general and in progressive MS specifically. Many clinical trials that biobanked serum or plasma samples are analyzing NfL. A US NIH-funded study (1U01NS111678–01A1) funded in 2020 will evaluate NfL as a prognostic and monitoring biomarker in over 5,700 individuals with MS. A study funded by the US National MS Society will evaluate sNfL from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of healthy adults to assess the effects of demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities on sNfL levels and establish demographic-specific reference ranges of sNfL. A study funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation will investigate the relationship between sNfL and MRI characteristics, treatment response, and quality of life and characterize NfL turnover in the blood. NfL is being studied in other neurologic diseases too. The Biomarkers Consortium of the Foundation of the NIH aims to establish whether NfL in blood provides a prognostic marker that can accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapeutics in familial frontotemporal dementia.

Other initiatives focus on the standardization of measurements to prepare for the use of blood biomarkers in both clinical trials and routine clinical practice. For example, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry Working Group performs a round robin/commutability study of NfL in plasma and serum to study the correlation between the different assays and identify candidate Reference Materials. Future Certified Reference Materials can be used to align measurements across analytical platforms. The Standardization of Alzheimer Blood Based Biomarkers Working Group of the Alzheimer Association Global Biomarkers Standardization Consortium develops standard operating procedures for blood collection and processing for a broad range of potential markers, including NfL. These and other efforts will help further our understanding of the role of NfL in identifying new therapies and managing the disease in people living with MS.

### Temporal relationship between serum neurofilament light chain and radiologic disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis [^116Y2F6S]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MRI is a sensitive measure of focal CNS inflammation that has been validated in international consensus guidelines as a useful prognostic tool in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, MRI is expensive and cumbersome, reducing its typical use to intervals of 6 months or longer. Hence, a blood-based biomarker that identifies patients with inflammatory activity could help monitor disease activity more frequently and assess the need for a change in treatment or other management.

Neurofilaments are a structural protein specific to neurons that comprise 85% of the CNS cytoskeleton proteins. When released by injured neurons, neurofilaments pass into the CSF and eventually the serum. Neurofilaments are very stable, which makes them an attractive fluid-based biomarker to measure injury in many neurologic conditions. In patients with MS, increased serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels correlate with MS disease activity, may predict worse long-term clinical and MRI outcomes, and are reduced by disease-modifying treatments. However, the temporal dynamics of sNfL, particularly their relationship with fluctuations in disease activity measured on MRI, remain unknown.

The RESTORE trial (NCT01071083)was an exploratory, randomized, partially placebo-controlled study with the objective of exploring the course of MS disease activity and the effects of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters in participants undergoing interruption of natalizumab therapy for up to 24 weeks compared with those remaining on natalizumab. The unique study design of RESTORE involved monthly serum sampling and MRI and afforded the opportunity to correlate MRI disease activity during the planned 24-week natalizumab dosage interruption and blood-based biomarkers such as sNfL.

Understanding the temporal relationship between sNfL levels and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions provides insight into the interaction between inflammation and neuroaxonal damage, as measured by MRI and sNfL, and the relative time course of new lesions on MRI and changes in sNfL levels. Therefore, this analysis will inform how sNfL might be used as a biomarker for monitoring disease activity in patients with MS.

Serum NfL as a biomarker of disease activity in multiple sclerosis

Serum NfL, clinical activity and MRI: short-term

A broad spectrum of clinical and MRI parameters linked to inflammatory processes have demonstrated correlations to concurrently assessed sNfL levels (Table 1). Large studies in 814 and 607 patients clarified that the current Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and sNfL levels are weakly, yet significantly, associated (12% and 8% sNfL increase per EDSS step, respectively). Furthermore, sNfL levels were shown to correlate with concurrent relapses, the presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, the occurrence of new T 2 -weighted lesions, the number of new T 2 -weighted lesions, the number and volume of cortical lesions, the presence of T 1 -hypointense lesions in patients with CISand T 1 lesion volumeas well as normalized brain volume, a cross-sectional measure of brain atrophy. Here it should be noted that sNfL levels are significantly increased after a relapse or detection of a gadolinium-enhancing lesion and can persist for some time (a few weeks to several months). Other parameters thus far have demonstrated mixed results [e.g. (i) sNfL with T 2 lesion volumes with significant, and not significantcorrelations; and (ii) sNfL and deep grey-matter structures with significant, and not significant correlations] or showed no correlation with sNfL values (e.g. the presence of oligoclonal bands or vitamin D3 levels). See also Table 1 for a summary of the relationships between sNfL and different clinical/MRI parameters. Despite differences in methodological approaches across studies, all findings support that sNfL levels provide a good reflection of ongoing inflammation-driven neuroaxonal damage. This is in line with positive correlations between the inflammatory activity of multiple sclerosis lesions and axonal damage.

### Baseline serum neurofilament light chain levels differentiate aggressive from benign forms of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a 20-year follow-up cohort [^113T2CT5]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This proof-of-concept study reported an association between serum NfL and GFAP levels measured early in the course of MS and subsequent EDSS progression, showing acceptable predictive power to differentiate two groups of benign and aggressive forms of RRMS in patients with a disease duration of 20 years and an average follow-up period of approximately 18 years.

Baseline serum NfL levels have been associated with worsening of EDSS in the first year, number of relapses, and progression of brain atrophy, as measured by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in short-term prognosis studies. Regarding long-term prognosis, both baseline and longitudinal measures of NfL levels have been linked to greater cerebral MRI-based brain atrophy; however, their association with disability progression is inconsistent. In fact, studies with longer clinical follow-up periods found no relationship between baseline NfL levels and disability progression. However, a recent study with a median follow-up of approximately 7 years found an association between baseline NfL levels and a higher risk of confirmed disability progression with an EDSS ≥ 3 during the follow-up period. Additionally, there is a previous study for NfL with a similar design as that of ours, including patients with RRMS, that also demonstrates that baseline sNfL is associated with long term (18.9 years) clinical disease progression and may be a sensitive marker of subsequent poor clinical outcomes. It is worth noting that this study includes clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) in addition to RRMS in its cohort, which could have potentially influenced a positive outcome.

### Association of serum neurofilament light levels with long-term brain atrophy in patients with a first multiple sclerosis episode [^114HFFxD]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system with variable symptoms, disease course, prognosis, and response to treatment. A biomarker that could be used early in the disease course to estimate disease severity by identifying patients at risk of more aggressive disease would be useful in counseling patients and choosing disease-modifying treatments. Measures of brain atrophy and T2 hyperintense lesion burden based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), combined with clinical features at the time of diagnosis, have been used to gauge disease severity and inform treatment decisions. However, to our knowledge, standardized models based on these measures have not emerged, highlighting the need for additional sensitive, quantitative, cost-effective, and noninvasive biomarkers associated with prognosis. Despite efforts over the last decades to identify such biomarkers, there is no blood-based biomarker associated with prognosis currently available to inform clinical practice.

Neurofilament light chain, one of the intermediate filaments believed to play a key role in the growth and stability of axons, has been shown to increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum in response to neuroaxonal injury. Increased CSF and serum neurofilament light levels have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including MS, Alzheimer disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in brain trauma. In MS, elevated levels of serum neurofilament light have been shown to correlate with disease activityand worse long-term clinical and paraclinical outcomes. Although these studies demonstrate utility for serum neurofilament light level as a potential biomarker associated with disease activity and shorter-term prognosis, information is scarce on the association of serum neurofilament light level at first MS presentation with long-term disease outcomes.

There is increasing evidence to support the use of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), as a marker of acute inflammatory axonal damage, to monitor short-term disease activity, treatment response and disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, whether sNfL levels also predict disease progression and neurodegeneration over several years, and even decades, is less clear.

### Serum neurofilament light: a biomarker of neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis [^112GoBUo]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurofilament light chains (NfL) are unique to neuronal cells, are shed to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and are detectable at low concentrations in peripheral blood. Various diseases causing neuronal damage have resulted in elevated CSF concentrations. We explored the value of an ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) serum NfL (sNfL) assay in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

sNfL levels were measured in healthy controls (HC, n = 254) and two independent MS cohorts: (1) cross-sectional with paired serum and CSF samples (n = 142), and (2) longitudinal with repeated serum sampling (n = 246, median follow-up = 3.1 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 2.0–4.0). We assessed their relation to concurrent clinical, imaging, and treatment parameters and to future clinical outcomes.

Results

sNfL levels were higher in both MS cohorts than in HC (p < 0.001). We found a strong association between CSF NfL and sNfL (β = 0.589, p < 0.001). Patients with either brain or spinal (43.4pg/ml, IQR = 25.2–65.3) or both brain and spinal gadolinium-enhancing lesions (62.5pg/ml, IQR = 42.7–71.4) had higher sNfL than those without (29.6pg/ml, IQR = 20.9–41.8; β = 1.461, p = 0.005 and β = 1.902, p = 0.002, respectively). sNfL was independently associated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assessments (β = 1.105, p < 0.001) and presence of relapses (β = 1.430, p < 0.001). sNfL levels were lower under disease-modifying treatment (β = 0.818, p = 0.003). Patients with sNfL levels above the 80th, 90th, 95th, 97.5th, and 99th HC-based percentiles had higher risk of relapses (97.5th percentile: incidence rate ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–3.10, p = 0.006) and EDSS worsening (97.5th percentile: OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.07–5.42, p = 0.034).

Interpretation

These results support the value of sNfL as a sensitive and clinically meaningful blood biomarker to monitor tissue damage and the effects of therapies in MS. Ann Neurol 2017;81:857–870.

### Monitoring disease activity in multiple sclerosis using serum neurofilament light protein [^116NPJyB]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The data in this study are based on a large set of paired serum and CSF samples from a real-life cohort of patients across a wide clinical and therapeutic spectrum. They support serum NFL as a biomarker for monitoring disease activity and treatment intervention in MS. We found that serum and CSF NFL concentrations were highly correlated and reacted similarly during the different stages of MS and in response to treatment with DMTs. High serum and CSF NFL concentrations were associated with relapse and with the number of contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI. This was not confined to RRMS but was also found in patients with progressive disease course.

The effect of DMT on serum and CSF NFL concentrations was evaluated in all patients with MS regardless of whether the patients were treatment naive or on DMT at baseline. We confirmed that CSF NFL concentrations remained stable in patients who remained untreated or who switched treatment to DMT with similar efficacy, and NFL decreased in patients after initiating DMT or switching from first-line to second-line DMT. This response was also valid for serum NFL. Thus, the DMT efficacy was reflected by NFL concentrations, and serum NFL was as reliable as CSF NFL. Moreover, in patients with RRMS who were treated with effective DMT, we confirmed our previous finding in CSF that the NFL concentration in serum was not different from that in HCs.

### Monitoring of radiologic disease activity by serum neurofilaments in MS [^1124bZUc]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

NfL is a promising biomarker of neuroaxonal injurystrongly associated with measures of disease activity in MS. Given that a considerable number of patients with high sNfL levels did not have detectable lesion activity on brain MRI, further studies are needed to clarify the origin of increased sNfL in patients with radiologically stable brain MRI. Based on the results of previous research, we hypothesize that active spinal cord lesions, accelerated loss of brain volume, or subclinical inflammation of normal-appearing white and gray matter may play a role. If this hypothesis is correct, sNfL may, in addition, qualify as a sensitive surrogate biomarker of inflammation and axonal loss.

sNfL is a cumulative indicator of neuronal damage over weeks to months. Future studies are required to investigate the benefit of more frequent sNfL assessment (e.g. 6-monthly), which may represent a sensitive and accessible method for capturing subclinical disease activity in routine follow-up. Finally, assessment of the relationship between sNfL and MRI activity in different subgroups is needed to allow generalization of the results to the prevalent MS population.

This study, using discovery-validation design in 2 large MS centers, demonstrates that low levels of sNfL help identify patients with MS with no clinically relevant radiologic disease activity. In future, sNfL monitoring may potentially supplement the need for annual brain MRI monitoring in a proportion of patients with clinically stable MS and with low sNfL levels. Further research is required to understand whether high sNfL levels in the absence of new or enlarging brain lesions may signal subclinical disease activity in patients, who would otherwise be considered stable.

### Exploring the clinical utility of neurofilament light chain assays in multiple sclerosis management [^114VkFav]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical and real-world evidence continues to support the use of blood biomarkers, such as NfL, in predicting disease activity/worsening and monitoring treatment response. The recent development of sensitive blood assays has increased the convenience and accessibility of sNfL testing. As commercial assays continue to be developed and standardized and large-scale, multicenter studies are completed to determine reference ranges and cutoff values across broad populations, sNfL measurements alone or in combination show increasing promise for incorporation into routine clinical practice and shift the current treatment paradigm toward more personalized precision medicine. When coupled with traditional clinical assessments and other biomarkers, measuring sNfL holds the promise of significantly improving patient care, particularly for patients who might experience barriers to access, such as those living in rural communities, those with financial limitations, or those with disabilities. Beyond its role in patient management, NfL may be used during clinical trial development (i.e. for stratifying patients with nonrelapsing progressive MS in the context of high-efficacy therapy). Future studies will, therefore, not only contribute to improving patient management but may also have a greater impact on therapeutic advances and improving outcomes in MS.

### Association of serum neurofilament light levels with long-term brain atrophy in patients with a first multiple sclerosis episode [^111jgsjn]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is serum neurofilament light level at the time of the first demyelinating event associated with long-term brain atrophy and disease progression?

Findings

In this cohort study of 308 patients with multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome in a clinical trial of intramuscular interferon β-1a, serum neurofilament light concentrations at baseline were associated with brain atrophy progression over 5 and 10 years.

Meaning

These findings suggest that serum neurofilament light measured at the time of clinically isolated syndrome or early multiple sclerosis may be useful as a biomarker associated with disease severity stratification in early multiple sclerosis.

### The role of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis: insights from a systematic review [^112vRo58]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

RMS (studies with ≥ 80% relapsing–remitting MS [RRMS])

A positive correlation between sNfL levels and relapse activity was observed in ≥ 85% of studies investigating this outcome, and higher sNfL levels were associated with higher risk of relapses within the following 2 years (Table 3). A study by Kuhle et al. revealed that patients with high blood NfL concentrations (> 60 pg/mL) at baseline had 2.5 times more relapses compared with those with low baseline NfL concentrations (< 30 pg/mL) (difference 153%). Patients with a baseline sNfL level ≥ 16 pg/mL were reported to have a shorter mean time to the first relapse (by 100.5 days) compared with those with a baseline sNfL level < 16 pg/mL (384.3 vs. 484.8 days, p = 0.0404). As reported by Brune et al. patients with high sNfL (≥ 8 pg/mL) at baseline had an increased risk of experiencing a new clinical relapse (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38–7.8, p = 0.007) in the follow-up period. However, the association between sNfL and the occurrence of new clinical relapse was observed only among patients having sNfL ≥ 80th age-corrected percentiles. Notably, the association between recent relapse (within the past 4 months before sampling) and sNfL Z -scores was stronger compared with that with absolute sNfL concentrations. Individuals with higher sNfL Z -scores had a higher probability of relapses in the 1-year follow-up period (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.30–1.54, p < 0.0001), as indicated by a model with Z-score as a continuous predictor.

### Monitoring of radiologic disease activity by serum neurofilaments in MS [^117Bzpus]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the observations summarized above, we interpret the findings of high sNfL (adjusted for age) as an indicator of a high likelihood of disease activity that should prompt further investigations with detailed imaging of the whole neuraxis. In these instances, MRI may help explain elevated sNfL, but may also add clinically relevant information with regard to the location and extent of lesion activity. Moreover, sNfL as a marker is not specific to MS lesion activity but may also reflect neuroaxonal damage due to other reasons. Last but not least, increased sNfL levels were associated with an increased risk of future disease activity. Therefore, patients with high sNfL levels without concurrent MRI or clinical evidence of disease activity should be followed closely to detect early indicators of treatment failure. Frequent screening for high (or increasing) sNfL levels may assist physicians with clinical decision making by providing information about high probability of recent, ongoing, and future subclinical disease activity.

### Serum neurofilament light chain is a useful biomarker in pediatric multiple sclerosis [^1176ji7y]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a higher relapse rate but better clinical remission than adult-onset MS. Time to secondary progression in pediatric MS is longer, but irreversible disability is reached on average at an age 10 years younger.

Chronic disability in patients with MS is assumed to mainly be caused by neuroaxonal damage correlating with functional worsening and irreversible impairment. MRI mainly detects focal lesions, whereas axonal degeneration or involvement of gray matter as major causes of permanent disability are only partially reflected. Identification of diffuse brain parenchymal damage, subclinical disease activity, and neuroaxonal injury requires additional, new-generation biomarkers.

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has recently been shown to be a promising biomarker in numerous neurologic diseases in adultsand children. In adult-onset MS, NfL is a marker of disease activity and severity with higher serum NfL (sNfL) levels associated with an increased MRI disease activity, higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and recent relapses.sNfL was shown as predictor of disease worsening and brain and spinal cord atrophy, and revealed to be prognostic for conversion from radiologically or clinically isolated syndrome to definite MS. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) led to sNfL reductions.

To improve disease monitoring and treatment decisions in pediatric MS, a biomarker reflecting subclinical disease activity and neuroaxonal damage is needed. The aim of this study was to investigate sNfL as potential biomarker for disease activity and treatment response in pediatric MS. We hypothesized elevated sNfL levels in children with MS compared with controls and correlation with clinical parameters such as EDSS score and MRI. We also hypothesized lower sNfL levels in pediatric than in adult controls due to age dependency.

### Serum neurofilament light chain levels predict long-term disability progression in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis [^117CS6ku]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveThere is a lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers for use in progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). The study aimed to assess the potential of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels as biomarker of disability progression in patients with progressive MS.

Methods

We performed a prospective observational cohort study in 51 patients with progressive MS who participated in a 2-year phase II single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of interferon-beta. Mean (SD) follow-up duration was 13.9 (6.2) years. Levels of sNfL were measured using a single molecule array immunoassay at baseline, 1, 2 and 6 years. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to evaluate associations between sNfL levels and disability progression at short term (2 years), medium term (6 years) and long term (at the time of the last follow-up).

Results

A sNfL cut-off value of 10.2pg/mL at baseline discriminated between long-term progressors and non-progressors with a 75% sensitivity and 67% specificity (adjusted OR 7.8; 95%CI 1.8 to 46.4; p = 0.01). Similar performance to discriminate between long-term progressors and non-progressors was observed using age/body mass index-adjusted sNfL Z-scores derived from a normative database of healthy controls. A cut-off increase of 5.1pg/mL in sNfL levels between baseline and 6 years also discriminated between long-term progressors and non-progressors with a 71% sensitivity and 86% specificity (adjusted OR 49.4; 95%CI 4.4 to 2×10 3; p = 0.008).

Conclusions

sNfL can be considered a prognostic biomarker of future long-term disability progression in patients with progressive MS. These data expand the little knowledge existing on the role of sNfL as long-term prognostic biomarker in patients with progressive MS.

### Association between serum neurofilament light chain levels and long-term disease course among patients with multiple sclerosis followed up for 12 years [^111C4Qno]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Blood sample-based biomarkers that are associated with clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have not been developed.

Objective

To evaluate the potential of serum neurofilament light chain (sNFL) measurements as a biomarker of disease activity and progression in a longitudinal MS data set.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Single-center, ongoing, prospective observational cohort study of 607 patients with MS from the longitudinal EPIC (Expression, Proteomics, Imaging, Clinical) study at the University of California, San Francisco from July 1, 2004, through August 31, 2017. Clinical evaluations and sample collection were performed annually for 5 years, then at different time points for up to 12 years, with a median follow-up duration of 10 (interquartile range, 7–11) years. Serum NFL levels were measured using a sensitive single molecule array platform and compared with clinical and magnetic resonance imaging variables with the use of univariable and multivariable analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were disability progression defined as clinically significant worsening on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and brain fraction atrophy.

Results

Mean (SD) age of the 607 study participants at study entry was 42.5 (9.8) years; 423 (69.7%) were women; and all participants were of non-Hispanic European descent. Of 3911 samples sequentially collected, 3904 passed quality control for quantification of sNFL. Baseline sNFL levels showed significant associations with EDSS score (β, 1.080; 95% CI, 1.047–1.114; P < .001), MS subtype (β, 1.478; 95% CI, 1.279–1.707; P < .001), and treatment status (β, 1.120; 95% CI, 1.007–1.245; p = 0.04). A significant interaction between EDSS worsening and change in levels of sNFL over time was found (β, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.007–1.023; P < .001). Baseline sNFL levels alone were associated with approximately 11.6% of the variance in brain fraction atrophy at year 10. In a multivariable analysis that considered sex, age, and disease duration, baseline sNFL levels were associated with 18.0% of the variance in brain fraction atrophy at year 10. After 5 years' follow-up, active treatment was associated with lower levels of sNFL, with high-potency treatments associated with the greater decreases in sNFL levels compared with platform therapies (high-potency vs untreated: β, 0.946; 95% CI, 0.915–0.976; P < .001; high-potency vs platform: β, 0.972; 95% CI, 0.948–0.998; p = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that statistically significant associations of sNFL with relevant clinical and neuroimaging outcomes in MS were confirmed and extended, supporting the potential of sNFL as an objective surrogate of ongoing MS disease activity. In this data set of patients with MS who received early treatment, the prognostic power of sNFL for relapse activity and long-term disability progression was limited. Further prospective studies are necessary to assess the assay's utility for decision-making in individual patients.

### Prognostic value of serum neurofilaments in patients with clinically isolated syndromes [^1134yRTh]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the prognostic role of serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) for clinically defined multiple sclerosis (CDMS) and McDonald 2017 multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS).

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed data of patients admitted to our neurologic department between 2000 and 2015 for a first demyelinating event. We evaluated baseline serum NfL in addition to CSF, MRI, and clinical data.

Results

Among 222 patients who were enrolled (mean follow-up 100.6 months), 45 patients (20%) developed CDMS and 141 patients (63.5%) developed 2017 MS at 2 years. Serum NfL (median 22.0, interquartile range 11.6–40.4 pg/mL) was noticeably increased in patients with a recent relapse, with a high number of T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline MRI. Serum NfL was prognostic for both CDMS and McDonald 2017 MS, with a threefold and a twofold respective reduction in CDMS and 2017 MS risk in those patients with low and extremely low levels of NfL. The results remained unchanged subsequent to adjustment for such established MS prognostic factors as oligoclonal bands, Gd-enhancing lesions, and a high T2 lesion load at baseline MRI. NfL was associated with disability at baseline but not at follow-up.

Conclusions

Serum NfL have a prognostic value for CIS patient conversion to MS. NfL might play a twin role as biomarker in MS as peak level measurements can act as a quantitative marker of serious inflammatory activity, while steady-state levels can be a reflection of neurodegenerative and chronic inflammatory processes.

### Serum neurofilament light chain levels in patients with presymptomatic multiple sclerosis [^1167Kgdf]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Unrecognized demyelinating events often precede the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis (MS). Identification of these events at the time of occurrence would have implications for early diagnosis and the search of causal factors for the disease.

Objective

To assess whether serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels are elevated before the clinical MS onset.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Nested case-control study among US military personnel who have serum samples stored in the US Department of Defense Serum Repository. Serum samples were collected from 2000 to 2011; sNfL assays and data analyses were performed from 2018 to 2019. We selected 60 case patients with MS who either had 2 samples collected before onset (mean follow-up, 6.3 years) or 1 sample collected before and 1 after onset (mean follow-up, 1.3 years), among 245 previously identified case patients. For each case, we randomly selected 1 of 2 previously identified control individuals matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and dates of sample collection. The sample size was chosen based on the available funding.

Exposures

Serum NfL concentrations measured using an ultrasensitive single-molecule array assay (Simoa).

Main Outcomes and Measurements

Log-transformed sNfL concentrations in case patients and control individuals compared using conditional logistic regression and linear mixed models.

Results

Mean age at baseline was 27.5 years, and 92 of 120 participants (76.7%) were men. Serum NfL levels were higher in case patients with MS compared with their matched control individuals in samples drawn a median of 6 years (range, 4–10 years) before the clinical onset (median, 16.7 pg/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 12.6–23.1 pg/mL vs 15.2 pg/m; IQR, 10.3–19.9 pg/mL; p = 0.04). This difference increased with decreasing time to the case clinical onset (estimated coefficient for interaction with time = 0.063; p = 0.008). A within-person increase in presymptomatic sNfL levels was associated with higher MS risk (rate ratio for ≥ 5 pg/mL increase, 7.50; 95% CI, 1.72–32.80). The clinical onset was associated with a marked increase in sNfL levels (median, 25.0; IQR, 17.1–41.3 vs 45.1; IQR, 27.0–102.7 pg/mL for presymptomatic and postonset MS samples; p = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

The levels of sNfL were increased 6 years before the clinical MS onset, indicating that MS may have a prodromal phase lasting several years and that neuroaxonal damage occurs already during this phase.

### Exploring the clinical utility of neurofilament light chain assays in multiple sclerosis management [^112Ut2W2]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Improving NfL Use in Clinical Practice

Implementation and proper interpretation of NfL measurements in practice would be aided by assay standardization and establishment of context-appropriate reference values. Absolute values of NfL can vary depending on the type of assay used and biofluid tested, and lack of reference values or failure to correct for confounding variables can limit the proper utility of NfL as a biomarker for individual patients. As an example, in 1 study, although absolute levels > 23 pg/mL or a > 30% increase from baseline (taken during remission) corresponded to a 5–7-fold increase in MRI activity, neither cutoff value remained significant in patients older than 50 years. Establishing reference values across geographically and ethnically diverse populations will help ensure proper implementation in a global setting. An additional challenge is that group-level effects observed in NfL cohort studies, such as the compelling prognostic value of NfL in clinical trial data sets, translate only modestly to individual-level predictions in part because of large variability in individual patients' absolute values, especially when using a single cross-sectional measurement.

### Inflammatory and neurodegenerative serum protein biomarkers increase sensitivity to detect clinical and radiographic disease activity in multiple sclerosis [^114hidbY]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, with a variable presentation and heterogenous disease course. While the exact pathophysiology of MS remains elusive, inflammatory and degenerative processes are believed to play a role –. Identifying disease-specific biomarker sets may assist in predicting diverse disease courses, classifying patients to high versus low risk for disease activity (DA) and progression (DP) and may also provide insights into mechanisms of new inflammatory DA. Multivariate models reflecting multiple biological pathways involved in the complex pathophysiology of MS will likely increase the predictive accuracy of these biomarkers.

Most studies have focused primarily on neurofilament light chain in blood serum (sNfL) as a biomarker in MS. Concentration of sNfL has been associated with neurodegeneration in MS and correlates with manifestations of DA, including the presence of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and clinical relapse –. For example, in a recent study of over 500 samples, a significant elevation in sNfL was observed after a clinical relapse only when associated with a Gd+ lesion. In the 3 months after a Gd+ lesion, an average 35% elevation in sNfL (p < 0.0001) was reported when compared with samples from patients in remission. Similarly, an average 32.3% elevation in sNfL was observed at the time of, or prior to a Gd+ lesion (p = 0.002) versus remission. However, the observed increase in sNfL levels during a relapse has limited sensitivity and specificity and is of the same magnitude as the group-level coefficient of variation seen across populations of healthy individuals, thus rendering this metric insufficient for clinical decision-making.

### Serum levels of neurofilament light chains in pediatric multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vBeje]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple sclerosis is a neuro-inflammatory disease that affects adults and children and causes somatic and cognitive symptoms. Diagnosis after the first clinical symptoms is challenging, involves laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging work-up and is often inconclusive unless subsequent clinical attacks occur. Neurofilament light chains are structural proteins within neurons. Levels of this marker in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma and serum are consistently higher in patients with an initial clinical demyelinating attack that later go on to develop multiple sclerosis. Evidence concerning serum levels of this biomarker in children with multiple sclerosis is scarce. Our aim is to review and analyze the evidence available for patients with multiple sclerosis, under the age of 18.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database, and ProQuest. Human studies that provided data on serum levels of Neurofilament light chains in pediatric patients with MS, measured at the time of the first demyelinating attack and before treatment were included in meta-analysis.

Results

Three studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. 157 pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis and 270 hospital-based controls that did not present with this condition were included in the analysis. A fixed effects meta-analysis showed that the standardized mean difference between patients and controls is 1.82, with a 95% confidence interval of [1.56–2.08].

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with multiple sclerosis show higher levels of serum neurofilament light chains at their first clinical demyelinating attack compared to pediatric hospital-based controls.

### High serum neurofilament light chain levels correlate with brain atrophy and physical disability in multiple sclerosis [^117E9DYp]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a promising biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). In cross-sectional studies, sNfL has been associated with disease activity and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes; however, it is still unclear to what extent in particular high sNfL levels impact on subsequent disease evolution.

Methods

sNfL was quantified by an ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) in 199 pwMS (median age = 34.2years, 64.3% female) and 49 controls. All pwMS underwent 3-T MRI to assess global and compartmental normalized brain volumes, T2-lesion load, and cortical mean thickness. Follow-up data and serum samples were available in 144 pwMS (median follow-up time = 3.8years). Linear and binary logistic models were used to estimate the independent contribution of sNfL for changes in MRI and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Age-corrected sNfL z-scores from a normative database of healthy controls were used for sensitivity analyses.

Results

High sNfL levels at baseline were associated with atrophy measures of the whole brain (standardized beta coefficient βj = -0.352, p < 0.001), white matter (βj = -0.229, p = 0.007), thalamus (βj = -0.372, p = 0.004), and putamen (βj = -1.687, p = 0.012). pwMS with high levels of sNfL at baseline and follow-up had a greater risk of EDSS worsening (p = 0.007).

Conclusions

Already single time point elevation of sNfL has a distinct effect on brain volume changes over a short-term period, and repeated high levels of sNfL indicate accumulating physical disability. Serial assessment of sNfL may provide added value in the clinical management of pwMS.

### Serum neurofilament light chain levels are increased in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome [^111fDW59]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) represents a promising biomarker for axonal injury. We present the first exploratory study on serum NfL in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and healthy controls.

Methods

We investigated serum NfL levels in 100 patients with CIS with a short conversion interval to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (fast converters (FC), median (IQR) conversion time: 110 days (79–139)); 98 patients with non-converting CIS (non-converters (NC), follow-up: 6.5 years (5.3–7.9)); and 92 healthy controls.

Results

NfL levels were higher in FC (24.1 pg/mL (13.5–51.8)) and NC (19.3 pg/mL (13.6–35.2)) than in healthy controls (7.9 pg/mL (5.6–17.2)) (OR = 5.85; 95% CI 2.63 to 13.02; p = 1.5 × 10(-5) and OR = 7.03; 95% CI 2.85 to 17.34; p = 2.3 × 10(-5), respectively). When grouping FC and NC, increased serum NfL concentration was also associated with increasing numbers of T2 hyperintense MRI lesions (OR = 2.36; 95% CI 1.21 to 4.59; p = 0.011), gadolinium-enhancing lesions (OR = 2.69; 95% CI 1.13 to 6.41; p = 0.026) and higher disability scores (OR = 2.54; 95% CI 1.21 to 5.31; p = 0.013) at CIS diagnosis.

Conclusions

If replicated in future studies, serum NfL may represent a reliable and easily accessible biomarker of early axonal damage in CIS and MS.

### Serum phosphorylated neurofilament-heavy chain levels in multiple sclerosis patients [^1112vH4b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated whether the measurement of serum phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) titre is likely to be a valid biomarker of axonal injury in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Serum pNF-H concentrations were measured by ELISA in cases with relapsing-remitting (RR)-MS (n = 81), secondary progressive (SP) MS (n = 13) and primary progressive (PP)-MS; n = 6) MS; first demyelinating event (FDE; n = 82); and unaffected controls (n = 135). A subset of MS cases (n = 45) were re-sampled on one or multiple occasions. The Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) and MRI measures were used to evaluate associations between serum pNF-H status, disease severity and cerebral lesion load and activity.

Results

We confirmed the presence of pNF-H peptides in serum by ELISA. We showed that a high serum pNF-H titre was detectable in 9% of RR-MS and FDE cases, and 38.5% of SP-MS cases. Patients with a high serum pNF-H titre had higher average MSSS scores and T2 lesion volumes than patients with a low serum pNF-H titre. Repeated sampling of a subset of MS cases showed that pNF-H levels can fluctuate over time, likely reflecting temporal dynamics of axonal injury in MS.

Conclusions

A subset of FDE/MS cases was found to have a high serum pNF-H titre, and this was associated with changes in clinical outcome measures. We propose that routine measurement of serum pNF-H should be further investigated for monitoring axonal injury in MS.

### Neurofilaments in progressive multiple sclerosis: a systematic review [^111ptDQC]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurofilament proteins have been extensively studied in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, where they are promising biomarkers of disease activity and treatment response. Their role in progressive multiple sclerosis, where there is a particularly urgent need for improved biomarkers, is less clear. The objectives of this systematic review are to summarise the literature on neurofilament light and heavy in progressive multiple sclerosis, addressing key questions.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus identified 355 potential sources. 76 relevant sources were qualitatively reviewed using QUADAS-2 criteria, and 17 were identified as at low risk of bias. We summarise the findings from all relevant sources, and separately from the 17 high-quality studies.

Results

Differences in neurofilament light between relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis appear to be explained by differences in covariates. Neurofilament light is consistently associated with current inflammatory activity and future brain atrophy in progressive multiple sclerosis, and is consistently shown to be a marker of treatment response with immunosuppressive disease-modifying therapies. Associations with current or future disability are inconsistent, and there is no evidence of NFL being a responsive marker of purportedly neuroprotective treatments. Evidence on neurofilament heavy is more limited and inconsistent.

Conclusions

Neurofilament light has shown consistent utility as a biomarker of neuroinflammation, future brain atrophy and immunosuppressive treatment response at a group level. Neither neurofilament light or heavy has shown a consistent treatment response to neuroprotective disease-modifying therapies, which will require further data from successful randomised controlled trials.

### Longitudinal evaluation of serum neurofilament light levels in normal healthy volunteers: defining a threshold of concern [^111sPzZF]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neurofilament light (NfL) is a member of a family of neuron-specific proteins critical to the neuronal cytoskeleton. Upon damage to neurons in either the central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS), NfL is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Elevations in serum or plasma NfL have been found in a wide variety of diseases or injury states affecting the CNS, from chronic neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis to acute injury such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke. Likewise, elevations in serum or plasma NfL have been found in relation to PNS injury from various causes, such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy or Guillain-Barré syndrome.

The half-life of soluble NfL in serum has been estimated to be 43 days, which positions NfL as a durable, non-invasive biomarker of neuronal damage days or even weeks following acute injury, or in response to chronic degenerative conditions. Conversely, longitudinal monitoring of changes in NfL in neurological diseases offers a potential biomarker of disease activity or severity. In this context, NfL has been adopted as a therapy response biomarker in several clinical trials, including tofersen, which was recently accepted by the FDA for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Notably, serum/plasma NfL is a sensitive biomarker of neuronal damage, often appearing ahead of overt damage and functional changes measured by other methods. A large UK Biobank cohort study found that plasma NfL levels were elevated in ALS patients 2 years prior to diagnosis. A Danish cohort found evidence of a subset of MS patients with elevated plasma NfL up to 9 years prior to first clinical symptom onset. Certain genetic neurologic disorders have offered the opportunity to characterize potential biomarkers in a pre-symptomatic phase of disease. In spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and type 3 (SCA3), for example, NfL increases have been detected in patients prior to clinical onset of ataxia in multiple cohorts.

### Assessing neurofilaments as biomarkers of neuroprotection in progressive multiple sclerosis: from the MS-STAT randomized controlled trial [^115nbDwj]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Few treatments are available for progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS), with most restricted to those with active inflammatory disease. Treatments for nonactive PMSmay require an alternative approach, utilizing neuroprotective mechanisms alone or in combination with immunomodulation. One such candidate neuroprotective treatment is simvastatin, which in the MS-STAT trial demonstrated a 43% reduction in annualized brain atrophy, in addition to benefits on secondary physical and cognitive outcomes. No differences were noted on a panel of immunologic markers, supporting a neuroprotective rather than immunomodulatory mechanism. The phase 3 MS-STAT2 study is ongoing (NCT03387670).

Blood neurofilament light (NfL) is a biomarker of neuroaxonal injury and an appealing surrogate outcome measure for trials in relapsing-remitting MS. It is less well studied in PMS. Initiation of immunosuppressive disease-modifying treatment is associated with a reduction in blood NfL in PMS cohorts, but an important question remains over the ability of NfL to capture the treatment effect of purportedly neuroprotective therapies. Clarifying this is an important goal of the progressive MS alliance, with implications on future phase 2 trial design. Data for blood neurofilament heavy (NfH) are more limited, but it may have utility as a biomarker of neuroprotection.

Here, we analyze serum NfL and NfH from the MS-STAT trial. We use the known positive effect of simvastatin on whole brain atrophy to interrogate our primary research question: whether serum NfL and NfH may act as biomarkers of neuroprotective treatment with simvastatin in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). We additionally perform further analyses to examine the relationships between serum neurofilaments and established MRI and clinical variables.

### Agreement between published reference resources for neurofilament light chain levels in people with multiple sclerosis [^113SXCqc]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the agreement between published reference resources for neurofilament light chain (NfL) applied to a large population of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Six published reference resources were used to classify NfL in participants in the Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) network as elevated or normal and to derive age-specific NfL Z -scores. NfL values were classified as elevated if they exceeded the > 95th percentile (i.e. Z -score > 1.645) of the age-specific reference range. Furthermore, age-specific NfL Z -scores could be derived for 4 of 6 reference resources.

Results

NfL measurements were assessed from 12,855 visits of 6,687 people with MS (median 2 samples per individual [range 1–7]). The mean ± SD age was 47.1 ± 11.7 years, 72.1% of participants were female, disease duration was 15.0 ± 10.6 years, body mass index was 28.6 ± 6.9 kg/m 2, and serum NfL was 12.87 ± 12.86 pg/mL. Depending on the selection of the reference resource, the proportion of NfL measurements classified as elevated varied from 3.7% to 30.9%. The kappa coefficient across the 6 reference resources used was 0.576 (95% CI 0.571–0.580) indicating moderate agreement. Spearman correlations between Z -scores derived from the various reference resources exceeded 0.90; however, concordance coefficients were lower, ranging from 0.72 to 0.89.

Discussion

Interpretation of blood NfL values may vary markedly depending on the selection of the reference resource. Borderline elevated values should be interpreted with caution, and future studies should focus on standardizing NfL measurement and reporting across laboratories/platforms, better characterizing the effects of confounding/influencing factors, and defining the performance of NfL (including as part of multimodal predictive algorithms) for prediction of disease-specific outcomes.

### Neurofilament light chain serum levels mirror age and disability in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: a cross-sectional study [^111CQjJw]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Secondary progression, determined as the steady deterioration independent of relapse activity or focal inflammation, is a key feature of chronic multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently defined solely by clinical assessment, this often therapy-changing MS course is diagnosed inconsistently and often with a significant delay. Neurofilament light chain serum (sNfL) levels have emerged as a promising biomarker for acute and chronic neuroaxonal damage in relapsing and progressive MS disease courses, especially because recent methodological efforts have led to an increased diagnostic accuracy in the distinction of pathologic sNfL values from serum levels observed in healthy controls. Evidence is accumulating that sNfL levels have a predictive value for the risk of disability progression in MS. The aim of our study was to assess sNfL levels in a cohort of patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS) recruited from a primary health care center to elucidate whether this measure of parenchymal loss is associated with clinical and paraclinical parameters in patients with SP-MS.

Correlations between serum and CSF NFL were ρ = 0.620 (95% CI 0.558–0.675, p < 0.001) for patients with MS, ρ = 0.385 (95% CI 0.092–0.616, p < 0.001) for HCs, and ρ = 0.740 (95% CI 0.571–0.849, p < 0.001) for patients with OND (figure 3, A–C). Disease duration, age, and sex did not significantly influence CSF or serum NFL concentrations. In 158 patients with MS, CSF/serum albumin ratio, which is a biomarker for blood-brain barrier integrity, did not correlate with NFL concentration.

### Reliability of serum neurofilament light and glial fibrillary acidic protein for detecting disease activity upon discontinuation of first-line disease-modifying therapy in stable multiple sclerosis (DOT-MS) [^113grAto]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Serum neurofilament light is known to be associated with disease activity, and has been used and proposed as a treatment response biomarker. Investigation into the clinical application of biomarkers in context of de-escalation is ongoing. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of serum NfL and GFAP levels to discriminate participants with disease activity and stable disease. In the DOT-MS cohort, participants with "significant" disease activity and "any" MRI activity showed a clear increase in their NfL levels, while this was not apparent for GFAP levels. We did not see a difference in biomarker levels before disease activity. Based on the models' performance, NfL levels were useful to detect disease activity due to high specificity, while GFAP levels were not discriminative of disease activity or stable disease.

### Prognostic value of serum neurofilaments in patients with clinically isolated syndromes [^113MKK7J]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Several studies have shown that axonal damage occurs from the very early phases of MS. Therefore, early diagnosis has been the major objective of evolving diagnostic criteria for the disease.MRI has played a key role in this issue since its introduction. Several other biomarkers are also associated with the risk of developing MS independently of MRI, among which the presence and number of CSF OCBs have been revealed to be crucial for the stratification of risk at patient level. NfL level in the CSF has been previously shown to be a risk factor for conversion to MS in CIS patients, but the recent possibility of measuring this structural protein also in the serum would make NfL an ideal and easy-to-measure biomarker for a more accurate prognosis at the time of the first clinical demyelinating event.

Several studieshave already reported higher levels of CSF NfL in CIS patients when compared to healthy controls, and in a recent studythey have been shown to be prognostic both for CDMS and McDonald 2010 MS. A linear relationship between CSF and serum NfL has also been previously reported, and we have highlighted here that serum NfL levels mirror in particular CSF levels in patients with blood–brain barrier damage as evidenced by the presence of Gd-enhancing lesions. The main result of the current study is the prognostic value of serum NfL both for CDMS and McDonald 2017 MS, here reported for the first time. As expected, we observed significant associations between serum NfL and patient age, disability, and lesion load at baseline, but we have also found NfL levels are influenced by inflammatory measures, with serum NfL levels higher in patients evaluated close to the onset of a clinical relapse or with Gd-enhancing lesions at brain MRI. A high T2 lesion load and the presence of enhancing lesions at baseline MRI are signs of persistent or recurrent active disease and therefore predictors of a shorter time to a second relapse, and the fact that NfL are also higher in these patients may confirm the aggressive nature of the underlying pathologic process and explain why the serum biomarkers also resulted prognostic for a second attack.

### Identification and management of subclinical disease activity in early multiple sclerosis: a review [^112aw6Fk]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Molecular markers: focus on NfL

Multiple studies have reported elevated NfL levels in the peripheral blood and CSF of patients with MS. Neurofilaments are neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins located within myelinated CNS and peripheral nervous system neurons that are released into the surrounding milieu upon neuronal damage (e.g. as a result of acute inflammation-mediated axonal damage). NfL has been evaluated extensively in MS (Table 2) and shows great potential as a biomarker in monitoring disease activity in MS.

Table 2
Examples of studies investigating NfL and GFAP as biomarkers in MS

BPF brain parenchymal fraction, BVL brain volume loss, CIS clinically isolated syndrome, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, EDSS Expanded Disability Status Scale, GFAP glial fibrillary acidic protein, HET high-efficacy therapy, MRI magnetic resonance imaging, MS multiple sclerosis, NfL neurofilament light chain, PMS progressive multiple sclerosis, RRMS relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, SPMS secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, WM white matter

The 2021 Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) Consensus Statement on Neurofilament Biomarkers in MS highlighted potential applications for NfL measurements for clinical decision-making during the course of MS, adding that serum and/or CSF NfL could complement MRI monitoring for detecting underlying inflammatory activity and informing risk of future MS disease burden.

There is a growing body of evidence to support NfL as a prognostic marker in early MS because it can predict MRI lesions, brain atrophy, and disability progression up to 10 years in advance (Table 2). However, unresolved questions around cutoff values for NfL concentration and standardization of NfL measurement currently preclude its use as a biomarker in clinical practice. In addition, the prognostic value of NfL level in progressive forms of MS is less clear due to the current knowledge gaps.

Understanding the confounding factors that can affect NfL levels, such as age, obesity, diabetes, kidney function, and certain types of drugs, as well as assay standardization, will facilitate clinical implementation of this biomarker. In addition, the use of NfL for diagnosis in real-world clinical practice requires normative NfL data with which to interpret baseline serum levels and to define clinically meaningful changes.

### Serum GFAP and NfL levels differentiate subsequent progression and disease activity in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis [^113SPutP]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the CNS. The majority of patients manifest the disease with a clinically relapsing-remitting course and later transition to a secondary progressive phase of relentless disability accrual. About 20% of patients with MS experience their first symptoms at the progressive stage and are diagnosed as primary progressive MS. Secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS are referred together as progressive MS. The transition to a clinical progressive MS phenotype reflects a shift from a disease sustained by the peripheral immune system to a self-sustaining pathology localized to the CNS. Disability progression occurring independently from a relapse is a hallmark of progressive MS, but does occur also in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. The 2 phases of MS are in a continuum where biology and clinical phenotype slowly transition from one phase to another. Defining a patient as progressive MS rather than relapsing-remitting MS is therefore challenging and may only be correctly classified years after the biological transition has taken place.

### Temporal relationship between serum neurofilament light chain and radiologic disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis [^116LApFB]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels correlate with multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity, but the dynamics of this correlation are unknown. We evaluated the relationship between sNfL levels and radiologic MS disease activity through monthly assessments during the 24-week natalizumab treatment interruption period in RESTORE (NCT01071083).

Methods

In the RESTORE trial, participants with relapsing forms of MS who had received natalizumab for ≥ 12 months were randomized to either continue or stop natalizumab and followed with MRI and blood draws every 4 weeks to week 28 and again at week 52 The sNfL was measured, and its dynamics were correlated with the development of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions. Log-linear trend in sNfL levels were modeled longitudinally using generalized estimating equations with robust variance estimator from baseline to week 28.

Results

Of 175 patients enrolled in RESTORE, 166 had serum samples for analysis. Participants with Gd+ lesions were younger (37.7 vs 43.1, p = 0.001) and had lower Expanded Disability Status Scale scores at baseline (2.7 vs 3.4, p = 0.017) than participants without Gd+ lesions. sNfL levels increased in participants with Gd+ lesions (n = 65) compared with those without (n = 101, mean change from baseline to maximum sNfL value, 12.1 vs 3.2 pg/mL, respectively; p = 0.003). As the number of Gd+ lesions increased, peak median sNfL change also increased by 1.4, 3.0, 4.3, and 19.6 pg/mL in the Gd+ lesion groups of 1 (n = 12), 2–3 (n = 18), 4–9 (n = 21), and ≥ 10 (n = 14) lesions, respectively. However, 46 of 65 (71%) participants with Gd+ lesions did not increase above the 95th percentile threshold of the group without Gd+ lesions. The initial increase of sNfL typically trailed the first observation of Gd+ lesions, and the peak increase in sNfL was a median [interquartile range] of 8 [0, 12] weeks after the first appearance of the Gd+ lesion.

Discussion

Although sNfL correlated with the presence of Gd+ lesions, most participants with Gd+ lesions did not have elevations in sNfL levels. These observations have implications for the use and interpretation of sNfL as a biomarker for monitoring MS disease activity in controlled trials and clinical practice.

### Serum neurofilament as a predictor of disease worsening and brain and spinal cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis [^113g1LGN]. Brain (2018). Low credibility.

Neuro-axonal injury is a key factor in the development of permanent disability in multiple sclerosis. Neurofilament light chain in peripheral blood has recently emerged as a biofluid marker reflecting neuro-axonal damage in this disease. We aimed at comparing serum neurofilament light chain levels in multiple sclerosis and healthy controls, to determine their association with measures of disease activity and their ability to predict future clinical worsening as well as brain and spinal cord volume loss. Neurofilament light chain was measured by single molecule array assay in 2183 serum samples collected as part of an ongoing cohort study from 259 patients with multiple sclerosis (189 relapsing and 70 progressive) and 259 healthy control subjects. Clinical assessment, serum sampling and MRI were done annually; median follow-up time was 6.5 years. Brain volumes were quantified by structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy, and structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy, cross-sectional, cervical spinal cord volumes using spinal cord image analyser (cordial). Results were analysed using ordinary linear regression models and generalized estimating equation modelling. Serum neurofilament light chain was higher in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome or relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis as well as in patients with secondary or primary progressive multiple sclerosis than in healthy controls (age adjusted P < 0.001 for both). Serum neurofilament light chain above the 90th percentile of healthy controls values was an independent predictor of Expanded Disability Status Scale worsening in the subsequent year (P < 0.001). The probability of Expanded Disability Status Scale worsening gradually increased by higher serum neurofilament light chain percentile category. Contrast enhancing and new/enlarging lesions were independently associated with increased serum neurofilament light chain (17.8% and 4.9% increase per lesion respectively; P < 0.001). The higher the serum neurofilament light chain percentile level, the more pronounced was future brain and cervical spinal volume loss: serum neurofilament light chain above the 97.5th percentile was associated with an additional average loss in brain volume of 1.5% (P < 0.001) and spinal cord volume of 2.5% over 5 years (P = 0.009). Serum neurofilament light chain correlated with concurrent and future clinical and MRI measures of disease activity and severity. High serum neurofilament light chain levels were associated with both brain and spinal cord volume loss. Neurofilament light chain levels are a real-time, easy to measure marker of neuro-axonal injury that is conceptually more comprehensive than brain MRI.

### Serum GFAP and NfL levels differentiate subsequent progression and disease activity in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis [^112ordKW]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The accurate enrollment of patients with progressive MS in clinical trials is in fact critical to succeed in identifying effective therapies for progressive MS. Treatments that affect the peripheral immune system reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS or patients with active secondary progressive MS but have so far been disappointing in treating nonactive progressive MS. In contrast, patients with active progressive MS may respond to highly effective therapies, making the accurate identification of this patient group crucial. Designations of active and nonactive progressive MS are now being routinely used in clinical trials; however, there are no easily accessible biomarkers that can enable high-frequency monitoring of disease activity.

The study of the biology of progression and the evaluation of new treatments require the identification of biologically progressive patients. Neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation are pathologic hallmarks of progressive MS. Blood biomarkers emerged as an easily accessible tool that allows for repeated quantification of biological processes from a blood sample. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are cytoskeletal proteins of, respectively, neurons and astrocytes. NfL emerged as a biomarker specific for neuronal damage, whose levels increase with relapses or new MRI lesionsand decrease with effective treatment. In studies with a majority of patients with relapsing-remitting MS, NfL levels were also prognostic for disability, and CNS atrophy. On the other hand, GFAP is postulated to be a biomarker of astrocytic damage, and reactive astrogliosis. GFAP has been less investigated than NfL, and evidence collected in blood and CSF has demonstrated contrasting findings regarding its association with acute disease activity. The joint use of these biomarkers for stratifying patients with progressive MS has not been explored.

We therefore sought to evaluate serum NfL (sNfL) and serum GFAP (sGFAP) as predictors of progression within patients with MS at high risk of having an underlying progressive pathology, who were also stratified into those with active and nonactive disease. In our MS cohort, we investigated (1) the ability of sNfL and sGFAP to discriminate active from nonactive patients and (2) the prognostic value of sGFAP and sNfL to identify subsequent disease progression.

Figure 3
Correlation between serum and CSF NFL in patients with MS, HCs, and patients with ONDs

Correlation between NFL concentrations in serum and CSF (A) in patients with MS was ρ = 0.620 (95% CI 0.558–0.675, p < 0.001), (B) in HCs was ρ = 0.385 (95% CI 0.092–0.616, p < 0.001), and (C) in patients with OND was ρ = 0.740 (95% CI 0.571–0.849, p < 0.001). CI = confidence interval; HC = healthy control; MS = multiple sclerosis; NFL = neurofilament light; OND = other neurological disorder or symptom.

The arbitrary cutoff value for increased NFL concentration in serum was defined as 18.2 ng/L, which is 2 SDs above the mean NFL concentration in HCs. The age-dependent changes of CSF NFL were calculated by subtracting the expected level for the given age following the linear relationship reported in healthy individuals (i.e. 11.8 ng/L × age − 95 ng/L)from the measured NFL level.

The number of patients with RRMS with disease activity, along with the number of patients with RRMS with elevated NFL concentrations in serum and in CSF, was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Patients with progressive MS were excluded because increased NFL concentration in this group may be due to other degenerative processes and may not be confined to inflammatory activity. Patients with RRMS without disease activity had normal serum NFL concentrations in 93.4% of the cases and normal CSF NFL concentrations in 80% of the cases. To evaluate the value of increased NFL concentration in serum and CSF as a screening test for disease activity in RRMS, a ROC curve was constructed (figure 4). The area under the curve (AUC) for serum NFL was 0.663 (95% CI 0.591–0.735, 80% specificity and 45% sensitivity), and the AUC for CSF NFL was 0.774 (95% CI 0.714–0.835, 75% specificity and 67% sensitivity).

### Inflammatory and neurodegenerative serum protein biomarkers increase sensitivity to detect clinical and radiographic disease activity in multiple sclerosis [^117GW6er]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The multifaceted nature of multiple sclerosis requires quantitative biomarkers that can provide insights related to diverse physiological pathways. To this end, proteomic analysis of deeply-phenotyped serum samples, biological pathway modeling, and network analysis were performed to elucidate inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes, identifying sensitive biomarkers of multiple sclerosis disease activity. Here, we evaluated the concentrations of > 1400 serum proteins in 630 samples from three multiple sclerosis cohorts for association with clinical and radiographic new disease activity. Twenty proteins were associated with increased clinical and radiographic multiple sclerosis disease activity for inclusion in a custom assay panel. Serum neurofilament light chain showed the strongest univariate correlation with gadolinium lesion activity, clinical relapse status, and annualized relapse rate. Multivariate modeling outperformed univariate for all endpoints. A comprehensive biomarker panel including the twenty proteins identified in this study could serve to characterize disease activity for a patient with multiple sclerosis.

### Association of serum neurofilament light levels with long-term brain atrophy in patients with a first multiple sclerosis episode [^113A7NGN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Data are needed on the potential long-term prognostic association of serum neurofilament light in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Objective

To evaluate serum neurofilament light as a biomarker associated with long-term disease outcomes in clinically isolated syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc cohort study used data from the Controlled High-Risk Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention Study, a 36-month, multicenter, placebo-controlled interferon β-1a randomized clinical trial conducted from April 1996 to March 2000, and its long-term (5- and 10-year) extension study from February 2001 to March 2009. Participants included individuals with a symptomatic initial demyelinating event and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions suggestive of MS. Data were analyzed from April 2017 through 2019.

Exposure

The variable of interest was naturally occurring serum neurofilament light concentration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion number, T2 lesion volume, and brain parenchymal fraction, a measure of brain atrophy were measured at baseline and 5 and 10 years. Multivariate regression models evaluated whether age, sex, and baseline covariates, including serum neurofilament light, brain parenchymal fraction, Expanded Disability Status Scale, Gd+ lesion count, and T2 lesion volume, were associated with brain parenchymal fraction changes over 5 and 10 years.

Results

Among 308 included participants (mean [SD] age, 33.2 [7.6] years; 234 [76.0%] women), baseline serum neurofilament light concentrations were associated with Gd+ lesions (Spearman r = 0.41; P < .001) and T2 lesion volume (Spearman r = 0.42; P < .001). Among covariates for brain parenchymal fraction change, serum neurofilament light concentration had the greatest correlation with change in brain parenchymal fraction at 5 years (Spearman r = -0.38; P < .001) and was the only variable associated with brain parenchymal fraction at 10 years (Spearman r = -0.45; P < .001). Participants in the highest vs lowest baseline serum neurofilament light tertiles showed brain parenchymal fraction reduction at 5 years (-1.83% [95% CI, -1.49% to -2.18%] vs -0.95% [95% CI, -0.78% to -1.12%]; P < .001) and 10 years (-3.54% [95% CI, -2.90% to -4.17%] vs -1.90% [95% CI, -1.43% to -2.37%]; P < .001). At 5 years, 6 of 45 participants (13.3%) in the highest neurofilament tertile and 2 of 52 participants (3.8%) in the lowest neurofilament tertile achieved an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3.5 or greater.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that higher baseline serum neurofilament light levels were associated with increased brain atrophy over 5 and 10 years. These findings suggest that serum neurofilament light could be a biomarker associated with disease severity stratification in early MS and may help to guide intervention.

### Neurofilament light chain as a discriminator of disease activity status in MOG antibody-associated disease [^113nomRF]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Disability in patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) tends to occur incrementally, as a consequence of attacks, and is generally not attributed to progression independent from relapses. Subclinical disease activity is infrequent, generally not requiring surveillance. As a result, acute disease activity is presently detected through neurologic examination and imaging in case of new symptoms or worsening of disability. However, this approach may be insufficient in the presence of subtle symptoms or during symptom presentation without deterioration of clinical deficits or MRI abnormalities.

In this context, although structural biomarkers are validated and used for identifying disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), previous studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding the utility of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) and serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) as monitoring biomarkers in MOGAD. The limited generalizability of previous studies may result from the small sized cohorts, the low incidence of attacks during follow-up, and the lack of biomarker value adjustments for clinical and demographic features.

To address the above-mentioned challenges, we conducted a multicenter study aiming to characterize the dynamics of sNfL and sGFAP following attacks, and to investigate whether sNfL and sGFAP Z scores can be used to discriminate the status of disease activity (remission vs attacks) in patients with MOGAD.

### Temporal dynamics of plasma neurofilament light in blood donors with preclinical multiple sclerosis [^115WjxuR]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In healthy individuals, serum NfL increases by approximately 3%, with every year of age. The body mass index (BMI) may also affect NfL levels. NfL seems to show minor day-to-day intrapersonal variation, but some degree of interindividual variation. In patients with MS, a doubling of individual serum NfL levels has been associated with an increased risk of a subsequent MS relapse.

Two studies have investigated serum NfL levels preclinically in MS. Both found that serum NfL levels were increased in patients with MS compared with healthy controls, up to 6 and 10 years before first symptom, respectively. Furthermore, one of them found that an intrapersonal increase in serum NfL was associated with an increased risk of MS, based on 2 samples per person. This is consistent with a study that showed that high CSF NfL levels in individuals with RIS were associated with a shorter time to MS development. Taken together, these studies indicate that MS pathology starts up to 10 years before the first demyelinating symptom and that the disease process could therefore already be advanced at the time of diagnosis. However, they do not clarify whether presymptomatic NfL levels fluctuate as a reflection of intermittent, clinically silent disease activity or if they display a stable, modest elevation. Thus, longitudinal studies of NfL dynamics in presymptomatic MS are needed.

In this study, we aim to investigate the intraindividual NfL dynamics during the presymptomatic phase of MS.

### Temporal relationship between serum neurofilament light chain and radiologic disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis [^115wExG5]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has limitations. As a post hoc analysis, these results should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. Multiple Gd+ lesions in the same patient, sometimes developing sequentially over time and each with a potentially different contribution of sNfL, were combined within the same patient to a single sNfL value at each time point. Thus, the contribution of each Gd+ lesion to sNfL levels could not be determined. Furthermore, some Gd+ lesions may have been short-lived and not detected within 4-week MRI intervals. Since Gd+ lesions did not appear until week 12 or later of the 28-week treatment interruption period, there was limited time to explore subsequent sNfL pharmacokinetics beyond 12–16 weeks after Gd+ lesion development. The sNfL peak and subsequent resolution might have occurred at time points later than this study's follow-up or at times with missing samples. While missingness was assumed to be random, we do not have evidence for this. Since our analysis focused on the peak sNfL observed, missing sNfL measurements would, at worst, render our study conservative by underrepresenting of the true peak in sNfL.

In conclusion, approximately two-thirds of participants with the onset of new Gd+ lesions (46/65) did not have sNfL levels that crossed the 95th percentile threshold, and most sNfL elevations were after the initial appearance of Gd+ lesions. Although monthly paired MRI and serum sampling demonstrated an association between sNfL and MRI as indicators of disease activity, sNfL did not correlate closely with onset of new Gd+ lesions. These attributes need to be recognized when considering implementation of sNfL as a biomarker for MS disease activity and individual management of patients with MS.

### Serum neurofilament levels and PML risk in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab [^113oLv3i]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite its proved efficacy for patients with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the use of natalizumab (NTZ) is limited due to the increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In addition to existing PML risk stratification algorithms based on NTZ treatment duration, previous immunosuppressive therapies, and JC virus index, other biomarkers may certainly contribute to estimate the risk of PML at an individual level.

Numerous studies suggest that the concentration of neurofilament light chain (NFL) in peripheral blood and CSF is a promising biomarker in MS. In a recent study, the serum NFL levels measured with an electrochemiluminescence assay were proposed as a biomarker for early identification of PML in patients with MS under NTZ treatment. In the present study, we aimed to expand on the potential for serum NFL levels measured with single molecule array (Simoa) to predict the risk of PML in a prospective cohort of NTZ-treated patients. We also aimed to discriminate PML from MS relapses based on serum NFL levels.

### Serum neurofilament light: a biomarker of neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis [^116NDpav]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Intra‐ and interassay variability of the assay was evaluated with 3 native serum and 3 native CSF samples in 22 and 12 consecutive runs on independent days, respectively. For serum, the mean coefficients of variation (CVs) of duplicate determinations for concentration were 5.6% (13.3pg/ml, sample 1), 6.9% (22.5pg/ml, sample 2), and 5.3% (236.5pg/ml, sample 3). In CSF, the mean intra‐assay CVs were 2.5% (572.6pg/ml, sample 1), 0.7% (1,601.8pg/ml, sample 2), and 3.8% (6,110.2pg/ml, sample 3). Interassay CVs for serum were 11.3% (sample 1), 9.3% (sample 2), and 6.4% (sample 3). In CSF, interassay CVs were 10.1% (sample 1), 6.2% (sample 2), and 15.5% (sample 3). We used the concentration of the lowest calibrator fulfilling acceptance criteria (accuracy = 80–120%, CV of duplicate determination ≤ 20%) as an estimate of the analytical sensitivity. 32 The analytical sensitivity was 0.32pg/ml. All samples produced signals above the analytical sensitivity of the assay. Few samples with intra‐assay CVs > 20% were repeat measured. Recovery rates ([concentration of spiked sample − concentration of native sample]/spiked concentration × 100) were tested in 4 serum and 4 CSF samples from HC spiked with 5, 50, and 200pg/ml and 500 and 2,000pg/ml of NfL, respectively. The mean recovery after spiking was 107% for serum and 121% for CSF. Parallelism and linearity of the assay for serum and CSF were confirmed by serial dilution experiments. 32

This study had several aims: (1) to obtain a pilot estimate of the distribution of sNfL concentrations in HC and to investigate the potential influence of age and gender; (2) to compare paired sNfL and CSF NfL levels in MS patients; (3) to investigate the association between sNfL and number of T2 and contrast‐enhancing lesions in brain and spinal cord; (4) to investigate the association between sNfL and clinical features, including occurrence of relapses, worsening of disability, and treatment status; and (5) to test whether elevated sNfL levels can predict later disease activity and disability worsening.

### Serum neurofilament light chain is a useful biomarker in pediatric multiple sclerosis [^111wqZMv]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, van der Vuurst de Vries et al.showed that CSF NfL is a promising predictive marker for disease course in children with CIS and later MS diagnosis. In addition to these findings, the results of this study highly suggest that sNfL is also a useful biomarker for monitoring disease activity and treatment response in pediatric MS. Access via blood samples, made possible by the Simoa technology, with high correlations to CSF measurements, is an important step toward everyday clinical practice implementation, especially in the pediatric setting. sNfL has the potential to guide treatment decisions to an individualized treatment regime, especially in patients with highly active disease course and the necessity of change in therapy due to ongoing or recurring disease activity. A treatment goal of reaching sNfL levels, e.g. below the 90th percentile could be a possible strategy for future individualized treatment decisions, yet the clinical relevance of a certain threshold should first be evaluated in long-term studies. In addition, in the case of particularly high sNfL values at disease onset, this biomarker might be the basis to directly start a highly potent immunomodulatory therapy.

### Profiling individual clinical responses by high-frequency serum neurofilament assessment in MS [^1176Us41]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate individual neurofilament light chain (NfL) variation over the time of disease course and the potential of NfL measurement to predict treatment response in patients with MS.

Methods

We investigated 15 patients with MS after immune reconstitution treatment with alemtuzumab (ATZ). Monthly serum NfL (sNFL) measurements were correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), MRI, and relapse activity over an observational period of up to 102 months.

Results

Before ATZ, sNfL was significantly increased in correlation with previous relapse/MRI activity. After ATZ, sNfL decreased quickly within the first 6 months. In patients classified as NEDA-3, sNfL declined and persisted at an individual low steady-state level of < 8 pg/mL. During follow-up, 34 sNfL peaks with a > 20 fold increase could be detected, which were associated with clinical or MRI disease activity. Even patient-reported relapse-suspicious symptoms, which have not been confirmed because relapses were accompanied by sNfL, increase, proposing sNfL assessment as a marker for relapse activity. sNfL started to increase earliest 5 months before, peaked at clinical onset, and recovered within 4–5 months. sNfL presented at higher levels in active patients requiring ATZ retreatment compared with responder patients. During 2 documented pregnancies, sNfL was at a low level, whereas a postpartum transient sNfL increase was seen without any signs of activity.

Conclusions

This study applied a long-term high-frequency sNfL assessment in an ATZ-treated cohort, allowing a holistic profiling on the individual level and highlighted that sNfL can eminently complement the individual clinical and MRI monitoring in clinical practice.

### Profiling individual clinical responses by high-frequency serum neurofilament assessment in MS [^116phScd]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The evaluation of sNfL is a promising opportunity to evaluate MS disease activity. While measurement of NfL in CSF has already demonstrated a significant correlation with inflammatory disease activity, fourth-generation immunoassays allow the implementation of sNfL measurement from patients' blood as "easy-to-measure" marker to reflect acute neuroaxonal damage. Of particular interest is the proof that sNfL levels can be used to separate not only patients with MS from healthy controls but also to separate patients with MS with and without persistent clinical and subclinical MRI disease activity. In previous studies, increased sNfL levels in patients with MS have been independently associated with disability and relapse status and suggested to be a predictive marker for future relapses and disability worsening. Further data have proved that patients on disease-modifying treatment had lower sNfL levels than untreated patients. In this line, another study found that patients who switched from injectable therapies to fingolimod had significantly lower sNfL levels than staying on injectables. Associations between disease activity and treatment-related reductions in sNfL levels were confirmed by another study in a large independent cohort of patients with relapsing-remitting MS. A longitudinal observational study demonstrated that patients with increased sNfL levels at baseline, independent of other clinical and MRI variables, experienced significantly more brain and spinal cord volume loss over 2 and 5 years of follow-up. Nevertheless, detailed data on high-frequency measurements of sNfL levels in patients with MS are still missing. This could assist their implementation into clinical practice by profiling individual sNfL dynamics during active vs stable disease. This is especially interesting for patients treated with immune reconstitution therapies as ATZ. Different response profiles to ATZ have been described so far, which only were defined by clinical characteristics as relapse activity and disability as well as repeated MRI analysis.

### Temporal relationship between serum neurofilament light chain and radiologic disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis [^113VbrLV]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In general, we did not see the first increase in sNfL until after initial development of Gd+ lesions and observed a peak increase in sNfL an average of 9 weeks after the first Gd+ lesion was seen. It appears to take at least several weeks for NfL to start being released from CNS tissue with inflammatory injury and become measurable in the peripheral blood. This delay is important for clinicians to recognize when interpreting sNfL measures in clinical practice. sNfL levels remained elevated after resolution of Gd+ lesions in many participants. The time course of sNfL resolution is difficult to assess in this study because most participants had a gap in sNfL sampling between 12–16 weeks after Gd+ lesion development and the final study visit. sNfL levels remained low and stable in participants who continued on natalizumab, as well as in participants who discontinued natalizumab and did not develop Gd+ lesions. This finding is in agreement with results from a large clinical trial in secondary progressive MS, where natalizumab was shown to reduce sNfL concentrations compared with placebo, with or without evidence of acute inflammatory disease activity. A more recent study, using data from the same clinical trial, concluded that sNfL was not associated with disability progression in the absence of relapses and MRI evidence of inflammatory disease activity. Taken together, these observations suggest that sNfL could be used as a biomarker for inflammatory disease activity, but the relation to disability progression independent of relapses or new lesion formation is still controversial.

The large majority (80%) of sNfL elevations followed the appearance of the first Gd+ lesions, which led us to find sNfL a relatively specific biomarker of MRI disease activity in MS (82%–91.9% specificity), but somewhat low sensitivity (27.9%–42.6% sensitive). Analyses of age-adjusted sNfL levels yielded similar results. Through closer disease activity monitoring, sNfL might still contribute to improving outcomes in MS. Serial imaging for clinically stable patients is costly and often impractical; sNfL could be a marker of subclinical disease activity both in clinical trials that may require frequent imaging, such as phase 2 studies in relapsing MS or in routine clinical practice. However, our study highlights the limitations of sNfL for monitoring disease activity: Its elevation was delayed weeks to several months after Gd+ development and was, in this 28-week study, an insensitive marker of the acute focal inflammation observed on MRI. Another caveat is that elevated levels of sNfL could be attributed to non-MS–related complications.

Classification of Evidence

Our primary research question was to ascertain whether serum NFL levels can identify NTZ-treated patients with MS who will develop PML. The classification of evidence assigned to this question is Class I.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analysis was performed by using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. The distribution of serum NFL levels was tested for normality with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Afterward, paired and unpaired nonparametric tests were applied for comparisons of mean NFL levels among groups. When needed, analysis was adjusted by age and disease duration. Quantitative data are presented as mean values ± SD unless otherwise stated. Differences were considered statistically significant when p values were below 0.05. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to determine the best cutoff values based on serum NFL levels and the respective sensitivities and specificities.

Data Availability

All data analyzed during this study will be shared anonymized by request of a qualified investigator to the corresponding author.

GeneMSA

Similar to the SET cohort, in the GeneMSA cohort, higher sNfL levels correlated with greater numbers of MRI lesions (figure 3). sNfL greater than the 90th percentile was found in 184 (27.7%) samples and identified patients with any active MRI lesions during the preceding year with 80% (95% CI = 77%–85%) specificity, patients with ≥ 2 active lesions with 79% (95% CI = 77%–83%) specificity, and patients with ≥ 3 active lesions with 78% (95% CI = 76%–83%) specificity. sNfL ≤ 30th percentile was observed in 129 (19.4%) of samples and identified patients with active MRI lesions with 93% (95% CI = 89%–96%) sensitivity, patients with < 2 active lesions with 95% (95% CI = 91%–98%) sensitivity, and patients with < 3 active lesions with 92% (95% CI = 87%–97%) sensitivity (table 2). Separate analysis of time points did not show important differences (supplementary table e-3).

### Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain levels reflect different mechanisms of disease progression under B-cell depleting treatment in multiple sclerosis [^115in5JK]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of the central nervous system with 2 main pathophysiological hallmarks: neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Accumulating evidence suggests that acute focal inflammatory activity (relapses and lesion formation) overlaps with brain‐diffuse, "non‐relapsing" mechanisms, which clinically manifest as continuous worsening of neurological functions or "progression". High efficacy disease modifying therapies in MS, such as anti‐CD20 B cell depleting therapies (BCDT), have the capacity to almost completely suppress acute focal inflammatory activity, which contrasts with the small delay of progression. This constellation has coined the terms "smouldering MS" and "progression independent of relapse activity" (PIRA). Therefore, patients with MS (pwMS) under BCDT may provide an optimal population to study the association of biomarkers with underlying progression.

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is indicative of neuroaxonal injury and has been established in recent years as a biomarker reflecting disease activity in real‐time and to correlate with future brain volume loss. Moreover, sNfL is a drug response marker as concentrations decrease under disease modifying therapy and can capture disease activity in patients that seem stable on clinical or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) grounds.sNfL is now increasingly used as the endpoint measure in clinical trialing and for monitoring treatment response in individual patient care. Important for the evaluation of drug efficacy on PIRA, post hoc clinical trial studies suggested that increased on‐treatment sNfL concentrations could predict future brain volume loss and disability worsening.,

Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) has been recently described as biomarker associated with disease severity, brain volume loss and future progression in MS; sGFAP may be as well a drug response marker in progressive MS.GFAP is a major cytoskeletal protein of astrocytes, whose blood concentrations increase on reactive astrogliosis and astrocytic damage.

### Reliability of serum neurofilament light and glial fibrillary acidic protein for detecting disease activity upon discontinuation of first-line disease-modifying therapy in stable multiple sclerosis (DOT-MS) [^111zHtVy]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurofilament light(NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) are associated with disease activity in multiple sclerosis(MS), however use in monitoring remains limited. The ability of these biomarkers to detect disease activity upon treatment discontinuation was studied.

Methods

Long-term stable relapse-onset MS patients were to continue or discontinue their first-line disease-modifying therapy(DMT) to study the safety of DMT discontinuation(DOT-MS trial NCT04260711). "Significant" disease activity was defined as clinical relapse, ≥ 3 new lesions or ≥ 2 contrast-enhancing lesions. MRI and sampling were performed at baseline, month 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24. Associations of delta biomarker levels and NfL z-score(age and body mass index derived) with "significant" disease activity were tested. Cut-off values for biomarkers to detect disease activity were calculated.

Results

45(50.5%) participants discontinued their DMT. Eight(all discontinued DMT) had "significant" disease activity, which was associated with an increase in NfL levels(OR:1.13 [1.03–1.33], p = 0.04) and NfL z-scores(OR:2.17 [0.98–5.22], p = 0.06), but not with GFAP(p = 0.52). Delta NfL had the highest ability to detect "significant" disease activity(AUC:0.88 [0.76–0.99]), with the best calculated cut-off of 46.4% increase(AUC:0.68, sensitivity 0.57, specificity 0.96).

Discussion

NfL may be useful to identify, but not predict, disease activity after DMT discontinuation in MS. GFAP levels were not discriminatory for disease activity.

### Neurofilament light in CSF and serum is a sensitive marker for axonal white matter injury in MS [^116UJUDu]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown the potential for serum NF-L to be an indicator of MS risk in clinically isolated syndromeand was recently reported to correlate with CSF levels and MRI measures in patients with MS. Our study provides further evidence for a strong correlation between NF-L in serum and CSF and represents an important advancement since the analytical sensitivity of our serum assay is 25-fold higher than previously reported. This facilitates the quantification of serum NF-L in neurologically normal controls, as well as in individuals with mild impairment, which was not possible before. Hence, serum NF-L may provide an easier and less invasive alternative to the determination of NF-L in CSF and gives essentially the same information.

Although we believe that our data reliably reflect NF-L release to CSF and serum in conjunction with small local, mainly white matter injury reliably, the data need to be interpreted with caution. We have only examined a small number of patients with PMS. Although the injury made by catheter insertion followed a standardized procedure, allowing variation of the response to a uniform lesion to be measured with accuracy, the inflicted injury was artificial in nature. Hence, it is perhaps not straightforward to extrapolate these findings directly to other clinical situations. Repeated and paired sampling in both CSF and serum is unique and has enabled us in this study to follow the dynamics of NF-L in both compartments simultaneously. However, one drawback regarding our ability to study the dynamics of NF-L over time was constrained by the relatively long period from the damage-inducing event to the first sampling occasion 1 month afterward. Thus, we cannot determine when the peak of NF-L occurs after a white matter lesion. From the strong correlation between serum and CSF levels of NF-L, this question may be resolved in future studies utilizing frequent blood sampling in relation to known white matter lesion–inducing events.

In this study, we report that NF-L in CSF appears to be a sensitive and specific marker for white matter axonal damage in the CNS. The correlation between NF-L levels in serum and CSF shows promise for serum NF-L as a valuable biomarker to follow the individual dynamics of a CNS damage-inducing event closely.

sNfL Levels Predict the Future Development of New Persistent T1 Hypointense Lesions

The NaloMS cohort is a prospective observational cohort designed to assess the long-term relevance of sNfL as a biomarker in patients with MS. MRI data obtained within ± 12 months of sNfL assessment were available for 153/221 patients with CIS and RRMS with a median follow-up of 5.7 years (range 4.3–7.3 years). First, we built a univariate correlation matrix of different markers of disease activity to unravel associations between sNfL and clinical and MRI parameters (Figure 1A). sNfL levels at study entry correlated with signs of inflammatory activity at baseline such as number of Gd+ lesions (r = 0.391, p < 0.001), T2 hyperintense lesion number (r = 0.185, p = 0.022), and T2 hyperintense lesion number at y6 (r = 0.232, p = 0.004). Moreover, development of new T2 hyperintense lesions after 6 years correlated with y0 sNfL values (r = 0.280, p < 0.001). Whereas a significant correlation between sNfL and y0 EDSS (r = 0.104, p = 0.199) and y6 EDSS (r = 0.053, p = 0.5131) and EDSS change over time (r = −0.024, p = 0.769) was lacking, we observed a correlation between y0 sNfL and development of new T1 hypointense lesions (r = 0.336, p < 0.001). This observation shows that although initially high y0 sNfL values reflect current inflammatory activity, they also have a predictive value for the future development of new T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense lesions.

### Temporal relationship between serum neurofilament light chain and radiologic disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis [^111xTDed]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

There is a need for standardized fluid biomarkers that can inform the clinical practice of neurology. Serum concentrations of NfL have emerged as a promising biomarker for acute axonal injury and neurologic disease activity. As a potential measure of disease activity, sNfL could lend insight into the presence and evolution of neuroinflammatory diseases when clinical presentations of disease activity are less sensitive to tissue injury. In this study, we explored the association between sNfL levels and development of Gd+ lesions on brain MRI to better understand how sNfL might reflect the dynamics of MS focal inflammatory disease activity. As expected, average sNfL levels increased among participants who developed Gd+ lesions compared with those who did not. In general, a high number of Gd+ lesions were associated with high sNfL levels. However, increased sNfL was not consistently observed with Gd+ lesions, and indeed was particularly uncommon in patients with only a few Gd+ lesions. Even with very high Gd+ lesion levels, many participants showed no increase in sNfL that was greater than their baseline level, which may explain why Gd+ lesion volume was not a significant factor when modeling increased sNfL. In addition, large variability in sNfL increases were observed among participants, even those with similar numbers of Gd+ lesions, suggesting that there may be differing levels of tissue injury associated with each Gd+ lesion.

### Impact of dietary intervention on serum neurofilament light chain in multiple sclerosis [^114H1XFQ]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), effective therapeutic strategies and sensitive biomarkers to evaluate drug efficacy and disease course are urgently needed. Serum neurofilament light chain protein (sNfL) has recently been suggested as a promising candidate for a reliable, easy-to-use biomarker of neuroaxonal damage that accurately detects changes over both long and short time intervals in MS. After axonal injury, NfL is elevated in both the CSF and in the peripheral blood, where it can be measured by highly sensitive single molecule assays (SiMoA). Studies have suggested a possible role of caloric restriction (CR) and adapted ketogenic diet (AKD) on neuroinflammation in MS and other neurologic disorders. The observed diet-induced improvement of neuronal resistance and axonal survival are clearly neuroprotective, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated whether AKD and CR in comparison to common diet (CD) may affect neurodegeneration as measured by sNfL levels in MS.

### Fluid phase biomarkers in multiple sclerosis [^1156a87U]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is highly heterogenic disorder with respect to clinical course, diagnosis, and treatment response. There is an urgent need to search for simply and reliable fluid body biomarker which would assist the diagnosis and prediction of clinical and treatment prognosis.

Recent Findings

'Traditional' MS biomarkers, with exception of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands, still are having limited clinical value. Therefore, there is growing interest in novel molecules and ingredients. The most robust results have been generated with regard to cerebrospinal fluid and serum levels of neurofilament light chains (NfL). However, there are still some limitations related to specificity of NfL which delays its use in everyday practice. We present a new approach to search for biomarkers involving extracellular RNA, particularly microRNA (miRNA), and small extracellular vesicles. MiRNA represents an important molecular mechanism influencing gene expression, including those involved in MS pathogenesis and extracellular vesicles transfer multiple cargo, including myelin molecules from parental cells of central nervous system to the long-distance targets.

Summary

MiRNAs which control gene expression in cells involved in autoimmune processes in MS as well as extracellular vesicles transferring myelin content might generate a new promising categories of biomarkers of MS.

### Profiling individual clinical responses by high-frequency serum neurofilament assessment in MS [^117MmVUD]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Alemtuzumab (ATZ; Lemtrada, Sanofi) is a humanized monoclonal antibody and represents one of the most effective treatments for active relapsing-remitting MS. ATZ might produce a durable therapeutic response as a consequence of a permanent rebalancing of the immune system. It has introduced the immune reconstitution therapy as a new therapeutic induction therapy-like concept in MS. The definition of clinical response profiles after ATZ dosing is crucial to the identification of patients who need retreatment or switching to other therapy. Until now, primarily clinical characteristics such as relapse activity, disability, and repeated MRI analysis have been used to define response profiles to MS treatment. However, this approach has several limitations because even high-frequency clinical and MRI assessment is not sensitive enough to detect all neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative activity, and additional biomarkers are needed to complement clinical- and MRI-derived information.

In particular, reliable quantification and longitudinal follow-up evaluation of neuroaxonal damage would be important for assessing MS disease activity, monitoring treatment response, facilitating treatment development, and determining prognosis. The neurofilament proteins that represent one of the main cytoskeletal constitutes in neurons show promise in this context because their levels rise upon neuroaxonal damage not only in the CSF but also in blood, indicating neuroaxonal injury independent of causal pathways. Different studies presented that neurofilament light chain (NfL) is increased in the CSF of patients with clinically isolated syndrome and MS and correlates with MRI activity, disability, and relapse activity. Third-generation (electrochemiluminescence) and particularly fourth-generation (single-molecule array [SIMOA]) assays enable the reliable measurement of neurofilaments throughout the range of concentrations found in blood samples. Previous studies suggest serum (s)NfL as a potential predictive marker for MS disease outcome. Nevertheless data and studies are missing that clarify how sNfL measurements develop over time, at relapse, or remission and whether sNfL level may be able to predict treatment response.

In this study, we analyzed individual long-term series of sNfL levels in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS after immune reconstitution treatment with ATZ using high-frequency sNfL assessment over a long observational period of up to 102 months. By this approach, we aim to observe sNfL changes in the MS disease course and stratify the potential to predict disease activity vs remission and treatment response in patients with MS in clinical practice.

### Assessing disease progression and treatment response in progressive multiple sclerosis [^111Aj4yq]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Progressive multiple sclerosis poses a considerable challenge in the evaluation of disease progression and treatment response owing to its multifaceted pathophysiology. Traditional clinical measures such as the Expanded Disability Status Scale are limited in capturing the full scope of disease and treatment effects. Advanced imaging techniques, including MRI and PET scans, have emerged as valuable tools for the assessment of neurodegenerative processes, including the respective role of adaptive and innate immunity, detailed insights into brain and spinal cord atrophy, lesion dynamics and grey matter damage. The potential of cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers is increasingly recognized, with neurofilament light chain levels being a notable indicator of neuro-axonal damage. Moreover, patient-reported outcomes are crucial for reflecting the subjective experience of disease progression and treatment efficacy, covering aspects such as fatigue, cognitive function and overall quality of life. The future incorporation of digital technologies and wearable devices in research and clinical practice promises to enhance our understanding of functional impairments and disease progression. This Review offers a comprehensive examination of these diverse evaluation tools, highlighting their combined use in accurately assessing disease progression and treatment efficacy in progressive multiple sclerosis, thereby guiding more effective therapeutic strategies.

### Assessment of axonal injury in multiple sclerosis: combined analysis of serum light-chain neurofilaments and diffusion tensor imaging [^116XG5Mr]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a predominant autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system in young adults. This disease is characterised by inflammation of the central nervous system, resulting in demyelination, axonal damage and degenerative alterations. Axonal injury is the primary driver of the progression and stability of neurological deficits in MS. The diagnosis of MS is determined by a combination of factors, including a thorough medical history, neurological clinical examination and MRI of the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, elevated levels of CXCL13 and neurofilaments in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may indicate a more unfavourable prognosis for patients. Neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a vital component of the neuronal cytoskeleton and plays a critical role in axonal growth, stability and intracellular transport. Neurofilaments or their degenerative products are released into the extracellular fluid following axonal injury and subsequently detected in the CSF and blood. The levels of neurofilaments in the serum and CSF are correlated with relapses, neurological impairment, MRI lesion load and treatment outcomes in MS patients, as shown by Reinert et al. The assessment of neurofilament levels as a biochemical indicator of axonal damage holds promise for application in prognostication, diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Conventional MRI is regarded as the gold standard technique for MS diagnosis, in addition to clinical examination. However, there is only a poor link between patient disability during recurrence and clinical signs on conventional MRI. Additionally, conventional MRI only offers qualitative information and cannot distinguish between demyelination and axonal damage. Axonal damage, demyelination and a combination of both can be distinguished using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an advanced MRI method that assesses the diffusion of water molecules in various directions. This is done by modelling quantities such as the axial diffusivity (AD, diffusion along axons), radial diffusivity (RD, diffusion across axons and myelin) and fractional anisotropy (FA, which reflects the directionality of water molecule diffusion) of the brain fibres. With this imaging technique, brain plaque physiology and pathophysiology can be estimated using quantitative image data. Given the high incidence of MS, it is necessary to investigate plaque physiology using a reliable imaging method in conjunction with a biochemical marker to enhance disease treatment and prognosis for relapse. The aim of this investigation was to assess axonal damage using DTI in patients with MS and to quantify serum NFL levels as a biochemical indicator of axonal damage. To ascertain whether there is a connection between these in vivo imaging and biochemical indicators of axonal pathology in MS, this study examined the relationship between DTI-derived metrics of lesions and serum NFL levels. Determining the precise relationship between DTI and NFL will shed light on the potential of each method to be used as a non-invasive biomarker of neurodegeneration and disease progression for MS patient prognosis and treatment response monitoring.

### Serum neurofilaments increase at progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy onset in natalizumab-treated multiple sclerosis patients [^111iaTk7]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab-treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab-treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10-fold higher than in the pre-PML condition and in natalizumab-treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab-treated patients, NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML. Ann Neurol 2019;85:606–610.

### Serum glial fibrillary acidic protein and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers in multiple sclerosis… [^114eesNY]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

For this nested study, participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria: cohort 1, patients with MS and either stable or worsening disability and similar baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale scores with no relapses during the entire follow-up; and cohort 2, all SMSC study patients who had initiated and continued B-cell–depleting treatment. Exposures Patients received standard immunotherapies or were untreated. Main Outcomes and Measures In cohort 1, sGFAP and sNfL levels were measured longitudinally using Simoa assays. Healthy control samples served as the reference. In cohort 2, sGFAP and sNfL levels were determined cross-sectionally.

Three groups of patients with MS with extreme phenotypes were compared: patients with either stable MS or worsening disability23 had similar baseline EDSS scores and no relapses during the entire follow-up; the focal inflammation group consisted of patients with relapsing MS from whom serum samples were acquired both during active disease phase and remission. Blood samples were collected within 8 days from the clinical visit and stored at −80 °C following standardized procedures. 26 sGFAP and sNfL concentrations were measured in duplicate with the ultrasensitive single molecule array technology. In cohort 1, samples were measured using the singleplex Simoa GFAP Discovery Kit on the HD-X analyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions. sNfL levels had been measured in a previous study4 using the Simoa Nf-Light kit.

In cohort 2, samples were measured using the Neurology 2-plex B assay according to manufacturer's instructions. Further details, including information on magnetic resonance imaging assessment methods, are in the eMethods in Supplement 1. Current results suggest that increased levels of sGFAP were associated with pure progression/PIRA, although this biomarker is largely inert to acute disease activity. Higher baseline sNfL levels were prognostic for white matter volume loss, and baseline sGFAP specifically prognosticated gray matter loss, a previously proposed proxy for disease progression. 27, 28 These findings from serum analysis are fully congruent with those of Axelsson et al in CSF. 14.

### Letter of support… [^116DdQRc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

We are issuing this Letter of Support to the International Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Alliance to encourage the further study and use of neurofilament light chain measured in plasma or serum as an exploratory pharmacodynamic/response biomarker for early clinical trials in progressive multiple sclerosis. Loss of volume is not pathologically specific, depends upon many factors such as tissue hydration, and thus follows a complicated trajectory after starting treatment. Neurofilament light, a neuroaxonal cytoskeletal protein released upon neuronal damage, may have the potential to reflect ongoing pathology over the entire CNS, and thus may be more responsive to the effects of treatment. We support the International Progressive MS Alliance's proposal for the further study of NfL to.

MS patients in response to treatment; however, instances were observed where NfL levels decreased in the absence of clinical outcomes being met, and also where NfL levels did not significantly change despite clinical outcomes being met. Further understanding of these apparently discordant trial results is necessary. Additional supportive evidence for NfL in relapsing MS patients may be potentially relevant for. progressive MS. Further studies of NfL using legacy trial biobanks and ongoing trials may help to clarify the relationship of changes in NfL concentrations with disability measures, including the time course of NfL changes and their clinical meaningfulness. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of NfL and must be addressed before NfL can be.

suitable as a pharmacodynamic/response biomarker in early progressive MS clinical trials, including:

- Sample collection and assay methods should be standardized in order to align results across current assay platforms, which will support analytical validity.
- A normative database of NfL concentrations in healthy volunteers and patients with MS is. imperative. We encourage exploration of serum or plasma NfL as a pharmacodynamic/response biomarker in early progressive MS clinical trials. We will consider data collection on this biomarker to be exploratory in nature. We believe data sharing and integrating data across trials can foster an accelerated path for progressive MS drug development programs. If sponsors intend to include.

### Challenges and opportunities for the promising biomarker blood neurofilament light chain… [^111VU7vW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The field of biomarkers has witnessed significant advances in the last decade with the introduction of new, highly sensitive tests to measure central nervous system –derived proteins in blood. One of the most studied biomarkers is neurofilament light chain, a cytoskeleton protein proposed to be a robust marker of neurodegeneration. With increased analytical capacity to measure NfL levels in the blood, NfL has emerged as a promising marker of real-time disease activity and treatment response in multiple sclerosis. Indeed, NfL has been proposed to be the neurological equivalent of an established inflammation marker, C-reactive protein. However, the application of NfL measurement as a tool for clinical decision-making and research still faces barriers due to gaps in knowledge about the biology behind NfL release in blood, factors influencing NfL concentration, and their correct interpretation in health and disease.
