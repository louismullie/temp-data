## Question

Best oral antibiotic for pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best oral antibiotic is for community-acquired pneumonia in adults managed as outpatients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are dealing with outpatient CAP versus inpatient or health care–associated entities. Then, I should stratify by the presence or absence of comorbidities because that drives regimen choice. Next, I will weigh antimicrobial stewardship principles, especially avoiding overly broad agents when narrower options are effective. After that, I will verify the specific first-line regimens and doses recommended by high-credibility guidelines, and consider local macrolide resistance. Finally, I will confirm caveats such as oral step-down in inpatients and synthesize a concise recommendation with dosing and rationale anchored in guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the scope: oral therapy is most relevant for outpatients with CAP; HAP/VAP are different syndromes with different empiric choices, and hospitalized patients may need IV therapy with subsequent oral step-down once clinically stable, so I should keep step-down in mind but focus recommendations on outpatients here [^114VYMRp].

> I need to ensure I correctly stratify by patient characteristics, because guidelines separate outpatients without comorbidities from those with comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, or asplenia, and these categories determine whether narrow monotherapy or broader combination therapy is indicated [^114NQhP1] [^117KRFW6] [^116EUyQ5].

> Next, I should review stewardship principles before naming a "best" option, since the optimal regimen should balance efficacy with minimizing collateral harm like C. difficile and resistance; the AWaRe framework and editorial commentary emphasize prioritizing Access agents such as amoxicillin or doxycycline when appropriate, and minimizing Watch agents like respiratory fluoroquinolones when alternatives suffice [^115ZzQTE].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line choices for otherwise healthy adult outpatients with CAP. The ATS/IDSA 2019 guideline recommends high-dose amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, with macrolide monotherapy reserved only where local Streptococcus pneumoniae macrolide resistance is under 25 percent, which I should explicitly note to avoid overuse of macrolides [^112EaToB] [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought macrolides could be a universal first-line option, but I need to correct that — macrolide monotherapy is conditional on low local resistance, and there are population-level concerns about macrolide resistance and possible cardiovascular adverse events that further temper routine use, so amoxicillin is the more stewardship-concordant default when no comorbidities are present [^115Q2y7p] [^notfound] [^116EUyQ5].

> Let me consider why amoxicillin edges out doxycycline as the "best" oral agent in healthy outpatients. Amoxicillin provides excellent pneumococcal coverage with a narrow spectrum and favorable safety, aligning with Access-first stewardship and guideline preference, whereas doxycycline is a reasonable alternative, particularly for beta-lactam intolerance, but local pneumococcal susceptibility may be less consistent and should be checked if available [^112EaToB] [^116EUyQ5] [^115ZzQTE].

> I will now examine patients with comorbidities, because this is where many make an error. At first, I considered whether a single oral agent like high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate could suffice, but I should double-check the recommendations — ATS/IDSA and AAFP endorse either beta-lactam plus macrolide, beta-lactam plus doxycycline, or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with combination therapy preferred to ensure coverage of atypicals and more resistant pneumococci in this risk group [^114NQhP1] [^117KRFW6] [^111GDt9s].

> Hmm, wait a minute, among these comorbidity regimens, I need to ensure stewardship is respected. Given macrolide resistance and adverse effect concerns, beta-lactam plus doxycycline is a compelling choice; specifically, amoxicillin/clavulanate combined with doxycycline balances broader coverage with a moderate spectrum and avoids Watch-class fluoroquinolones when feasible, reserving fluoroquinolone monotherapy for those who cannot tolerate combination therapy or where adherence or access constraints preclude it [^114NQhP1] [^117KRFW6] [^115ZzQTE] [^111GDt9s].

> I should confirm the role and risks of respiratory fluoroquinolones here. They are effective and guideline-endorsed alternatives but belong to the Watch group and carry safety warnings including tendinopathy, neuropathy, CNS effects, dysglycemia, and higher C. difficile risk; thus, they should be minimized unless combination therapy is unsuitable or contraindicated for the patient [^115ZzQTE] [^116bo2sQ].

> Next, I should review oral step-down for hospitalized patients, even though the question centers on outpatients. Once clinically stable and able to take oral medications, continuing with an oral agent in the same class as the effective IV regimen is reasonable, and early IV-to-oral switch strategies reduce length of stay without compromising outcomes, but the initial inpatient regimen selection remains distinct from outpatient empiric choices [^notfound] [^114VYMRp].

> Let me reconsider duration briefly to avoid overgeneralization. For outpatients, many programs target about five days, ensuring clinical stability before stopping; for inpatients with non-severe CAP who stabilize, newer ATS guidance allows consideration of less than five days with a minimum of three days, but I need to emphasize this applies in carefully selected inpatients after stability criteria are met, not as a blanket outpatient rule [^113DyKsv] [^115qR2bM].

> Putting this together, I should clearly state the synthesis. For healthy adult outpatients without comorbidities, the best oral antibiotic is high-dose amoxicillin 1 g three times daily as first choice, with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as a suitable alternative when beta-lactams are not appropriate, and macrolide monotherapy only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25 percent and patient-specific risks are acceptable [^112EaToB] [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5]. For outpatients with comorbidities, no single narrow-spectrum oral agent is sufficient; amoxicillin/clavulanate plus doxycycline represents a stewardship-aligned regimen providing necessary breadth, with a respiratory fluoroquinolone reserved for those who cannot use combination therapy or when clinical logistics mandate it [^114NQhP1] [^117KRFW6] [^111GDt9s] [^115ZzQTE].

The optimal oral antibiotic for pneumonia depends on patient comorbidities and local resistance patterns [^114NQhP1]. For **healthy outpatients without comorbidities**, use **amoxicillin 1 g PO TID** [^112EaToB] or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID [^116EUyQ5]; macrolides are an option only if local pneumococcal resistance is < 25% [^115Q2y7p]. For **outpatients with comorbidities**, use amoxicillin/clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin [^114NQhP1] plus a macrolide or doxycycline [^117KRFW6], or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily) [^111GDt9s]. For **pediatric patients**, amoxicillin is first-line [^114DFwpz]; macrolides are reserved for suspected atypical pathogens [^114DFwpz] [^notfound]. Treatment duration is typically 5–7 days [^114NQhP1], with shorter courses (minimum 3 days) if clinical stability is achieved [^113DyKsv] [^111rJW34].

## Recommended oral antibiotics for pneumonia

### Adults without comorbidities

- **Amoxicillin**: 1 g PO TID [^112EaToB] [^116EUyQ5].
- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg PO BID [^112EaToB] [^116EUyQ5].
- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin or clarithromycin only if local pneumococcal resistance is < 25% [^115Q2y7p] [^115NsVZp].

---

### Adults with comorbidities

- **Amoxicillin/clavulanate**: Preferred beta-lactam [^114NQhP1] [^111GDt9s].
- **Third-generation cephalosporins**: Cefpodoxime or cefuroxime plus a macrolide or doxycycline [^114NQhP1] [^117KRFW6].
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily [^114NQhP1] [^1143br6R].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **amoxicillin** is first-line therapy [^114DFwpz], and **macrolides** are reserved for suspected atypical pathogens [^114DFwpz] [^1135VCBy].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

Several factors influence **oral antibiotic selection** for pneumonia:

- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Older adults and those with chronic conditions may require broader-spectrum antibiotics [^114NQhP1] [^117J4ouG].
- **Severity of illness**: Severe cases may necessitate combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy [^114NQhP1] [^11724DLT].
- **Local resistance patterns**: High resistance rates may limit the use of certain antibiotics, such as macrolides [^115Q2y7p] [^115NsVZp].
- **Patient allergies and contraindications**: Allergies to beta-lactams or macrolides necessitate alternative regimens [^114NQhP1] [^1113jsxi].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic efficacy

Clinical trials and guidelines **support the efficacy** of recommended oral antibiotics. Amoxicillin is a first-line option for uncomplicated pneumonia [^112EaToB]; doxycycline is an alternative [^116EUyQ5]; macrolides are appropriate in areas with low resistance rates [^115Q2y7p]; and fluoroquinolones are suitable as monotherapy for patients with comorbidities or severe illness.

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic duration varies with clinical stability and severity [^114NQhP1] [^111rJW34]. The **standard course** is 5–7 days for most patients [^114NQhP1], and **shorter courses** have a minimum of 3 days for clinically stable patients [^113DyKsv] [^114VYMRp].

---

## Potential side effects and contraindications

Each antibiotic class has specific side effects and contraindications:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Common side effects** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-lactams | - Allergic reactions <br/> - Gastrointestinal upset [^114NQhP1] | - Allergy to beta-lactams |
| Macrolides | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - QT prolongation [^113xXLZv] | - Allergy to macrolides <br/> - QT prolongation |
| Fluoroquinolones | - Tendon rupture <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - CNS effects [^116bo2sQ] | - Allergy to fluoroquinolones <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - Tendon disorders |
| Tetracyclines | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Photosensitivity [^1135VCBy] | - Pregnancy <br/> - Children under 8 years |

---

## Special considerations

Immunocompromised patients may need **broader-spectrum antibiotics** or **combination therapy** [^117F8r49]. Pregnant patients should avoid **tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones**; **beta-lactams** are preferred. Patients with chronic lung disease may require **broader-spectrum antibiotics** [^114NQhP1] due to increased risk of **resistant pathogens** [^117J4ouG].

---

The optimal oral antibiotic for pneumonia depends on **patient-specific factors**, **illness severity**, and **local resistance patterns**. Amoxicillin, doxycycline, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones are effective options, and treatment typically lasts 5–7 days [^116EUyQ5] [^114NQhP1].

Regarding the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, particularly with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in an outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering a combination therapy of a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) together with a macrolide. The recommended macrolide options include azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day followed by 250 mg PO daily, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily. Alternatively, a monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone can be administered, such as levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily. This approach is applicable to outpatients with CAP who have comorbidities including chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^115iwg2w]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria, reasons for admitting hospitalized patients to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP. The guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern and that appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

- **Summary**: The cost, morbidity, and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These are heterogeneous groups of patients, so it is important to use risk stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients. In particular, it is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy to minimize the risks of treatment failure and the morbidity associated with CAP.

### Overview of recent studies of community-acquired pneumonia [^115nsRFh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). High credibility.

All recent studies of antibacterial drugs for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration have been designed as noninferiority studies. We provide a summary of results from seven recent clinical studies of oral antibacterial drugs for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. In these studies, the majority of patients enrolled had Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team scores of I or II. The percentage of randomized subjects with pathogens identified at baseline ranged from 47% to 76%, and the percentage of subjects with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated at baseline ranged from approximately 6% to 20%.

The primary endpoint in these studies was clinical cure, assessed 7 to 21 days after completion of therapy. Clinical cure rates were over 80% in the intent-to-treat populations and over 90% in the per-protocol populations. We also briefly summarize the results from several recently submitted clinical studies of intravenously administered antibacterial drugs for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, in which we found similar results.

### Cost-effectiveness of full-course oral levofloxacin in severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116aJf3A]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Oral levofloxacin is as efficient as sequential antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The authors assessed whether oral levofloxacin treatment of patients with severe CAP, followed up for 30 days, would save money. Over a 12-month period, 129 hospitalized patients with severe non-intensive care unit CAP were randomly assigned to receive either oral levofloxacin or sequential antibiotic treatment. Direct and indirect costs were compared over a 30-day period from several perspectives. CAP resolved in 71 out of 77 oral levofloxacin (92%) and in 34 out of 37 sequential antibiotic treatment patients (92%). Patients' characteristics, treatment duration, hospital length of stay, and mortality were similar in both groups. Drug acquisition costs were 1.7 times smaller in oral levofloxacin patients, who were less often transferred to rehabilitation centers, but they used more physicians' visits during follow-up, and their total costs were lower. As only a minority of patients was still active, inability to work and, hence, indirect costs were similar in both groups. In this study, oral levofloxacin for severe non-intensive care unit community-acquired pneumonia was equally effective as sequential antibiotic treatment but did not lead to major cost savings except for drug acquisition costs. External factors linked with patients' characteristics and/or medical practice are likely to play a role and should be addressed.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nd7cJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children under 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages, the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only one of the eight RCTs was from a high-income country, and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which eight were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over traditional strategies. Shorter courses may prevent the development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: What is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion. This involves an emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions.

This article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States five years after the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults.

- **Recent studies and recommendations**: Focus on managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP.
- **New data and additional guidelines**: These further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection.

Furthermore, an appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### What factors influence physicians' decisions to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia [^116Yi6GD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

One of the major factors influencing the length of stay for patients with community-acquired pneumonia is the timing of conversion from intravenous to oral antibiotics. We measured physician attitudes and beliefs about the antibiotic switch decision and assessed physician characteristics associated with practice beliefs.

- **Design**: Written survey assessing attitudes about the antibiotic conversion decision.

- **Setting**: Seven teaching and non-teaching hospitals in Pittsburgh, Pa.

- **Participants**: Three hundred forty-five generalist and specialist attending physicians who manage pneumonia in seven hospitals.

- **Measurements and results**: Factors rated as "very important" to the antibiotic conversion decision were absence of suppurative infection (93%), ability to maintain oral intake (79%), respiratory rate at baseline (64%), no positive blood cultures (63%), normal temperature (62%), oxygenation at baseline (55%), and mental status at baseline (50%). The median thresholds at which physicians believed a typical patient could be converted to oral therapy were temperature ≤ 100 mm Hg and room air oxygen saturation ≥ 90%. Fifty-eight percent of physicians felt that "patients should be afebrile for 24 hours before conversion to oral antibiotics", and 19% said "patients should receive a standard duration of intravenous antibiotics". In univariate analyses, pulmonary and infectious diseases physicians were the most predisposed towards earlier conversion.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: A consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardizing initial empirical therapy. However, society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

- **Research question**: There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

- **Study design and methods**: This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

- **Results**: The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. Consensus was achieved in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

- **Interpretation**: This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113i3MJ9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe CAP, to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity, we found no evidence of, or even a trend toward, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups. Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes.

For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis of 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults. Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced.

Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would be beneficial.

### Telithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a pooled analysis [^1152kMva]. Respiratory Medicine (2003).

The efficacy of telithromycin has been assessed in six Phase III studies involving adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a degree of severity compatible with oral therapy. Patients received telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days in three open-label studies (n = 870) and three randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled studies (n = 503). Comparator antibacterials were amoxicillin 1000 mg three times daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, and trovafloxacin 200 mg once daily. Clinical and bacteriological outcomes were assessed 7–14 days post-therapy. Among telithromycin-treated patients, per-protocol clinical cure rates were 93.1% and 91.0% for the open-label and comparative studies, respectively. Telithromycin treatment was as effective as the comparator agents. High eradication and clinical cure rates were observed for infections caused by key pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, including isolates resistant to penicillin G and/or erythromycin A (95.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (89.5%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (90%). Telithromycin was also highly effective in patients with infections caused by atypical and/or intracellular pathogens and those at increased risk of morbidity. Telithromycin was generally well tolerated. Telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days offers a convenient and well-tolerated first-line oral therapy for the empirical treatment of mild to moderate CAP.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often remains unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

- **Guidelines and organizations**: Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others.

By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

- **Results**: The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Community-Acquired Pneumonia: A Review [^117J4ouG]. JAMA (2024). Low credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease se

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^115HC8Uh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, covering both typical and atypical pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and need for adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2007); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

- **Main results**: Twenty-five trials were included, encompassing 5244 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend toward improved outcomes.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggest that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to efficacy.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous-to-oral lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: The Phase III Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia (LEAP 1) trial [^116bo2sQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) produces significant morbidity and mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes approximately 5% to 15% of all community-acquired pneumonias in the United States, with higher rates in Europe. Other etiological bacterial pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with atypical pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. New therapies are needed due to resistance to existing antibiotics, as Streptococcus pneumoniae has shown resistance to β-lactams, clindamycin, tetracyclines, and macrolides, with resistance rates up to 40%. Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has also been observed. Antimicrobial stewardship and safety concerns with antibiotics further necessitate the development of new therapies. For instance, fluoroquinolones have a black box warning for tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and hypoglycemia.

The novel pleuromutilin antibiotic lefamulin inhibits the 50S ribosomal subunit at the peptidyl transferase center. Lefamulin is active in vitro against the previously mentioned CABP pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); its activity is unaffected by resistance mechanisms to β-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and glycopeptides. Lefamulin has a favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile; the intravenous (IV) and oral dosing regimens used in the clinical trials achieve comparable drug exposures. The drug achieves rapid and predictable penetration into human tissues, although additional text needed for the completion of the previous sentence seems to have been truncated.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin/sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: An open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^113zaTNU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens and is one of the most common infections around the world. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*, or viruses such as the influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0%, and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8%, 100%, and 1.0%, respectively. Antibiotics were therefore selected based on presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, and severity.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both antibiotics are effective against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has…

### Early identification and treatment of pneumonia: A call to action [^1165Nxp2]. The Lancet Global Health (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical trials show that children with fast-breathing pneumonia can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. As a result, many low-income and middle-income countries have now adopted policies for community case management of sick children in underserved communities, as recommended by WHO and UNICEF. Evidence shows that when children are treated in accordance with these standard case management guidelines, either at health facilities or by community health workers (CHWs), they receive prompt treatment, antibiotics are used more appropriately, and mortality is reduced. Recently, WHO released new guidelines for the treatment of lower chest indrawing pneumonia with oral amoxicillin on an outpatient basis. The rationale for these new guidelines was not only to reduce societal costs (due to less hospitalization) but also because they deliver better outcomes.

The WHO pneumonia management guideline is presumptive, based on the identification of clinical signs in children with cough or difficult breathing and on treatment with antibiotics. Some argue that CHWs have insufficient capacity to correctly manage pneumonia and that the evidence of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for fast-breathing pneumonia is questionable, especially when wheeze is present. However, CHWs who receive appropriate training, adequate supervision, and have access to necessary drugs and supplies have demonstrated the ability to provide quality care for pneumonia. Although wheeze is more common in viral infections and often responds well to bronchodilators, a placebo-controlled double-blind trial showed higher c

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous-to-oral lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: The Phase III LEAP 1 Trial [^111ZRBQm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Patients**: This study enrolled 551 patients at 66 centers across 18 countries between February 2016 and May 2017. Approximately 25% of patients were enrolled before the protocol amendment noted above. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups, with the noted exception that 47.8% and 39.3% of patients were aged ≥ 65 years in the lefamulin and moxifloxacin groups, respectively.

- **Baseline characteristics (intent-to-treat population)**:

In the safety analysis set, the median (range) study drug treatment duration was considered. A single dose of a study drug on a calendar day counted as a full day of treatment.

- **Patient disposition**: See Table 1 for definitions of the patient populations. Abbreviations used include CABP (community-acquired bacterial pneumonia), CE (clinically evaluable), IACR (investigator assessment of clinical response), ITT (intent-to-treat), microITT (microbiological ITT), microITT-2 (microbiological ITT-2), mITT (modified ITT), MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and TOC (test of cure). Patients met the criteria for CABP, received at least the prespecified minimal amount of the intended dose of the study drug and minimum duration of treatment, IACR was not indeterminate, did not receive a concomitant antibacterial therapy (other than adjunctive linezolid) that is potentially effective against CABP pathogens (except in the case of clinical failure), and had no other confounding factors that interfered with the outcome assessment.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting.

The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for *Streptococcus pneumoniae* plus atypical pathogens. In contrast, Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe, these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent.

Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant *S. pneumoniae*. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first-choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: The CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^115fvY6X]. JAMA (2021). High credibility.

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear. This study aimed to determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to a higher dose and whether a 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

This multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial involved 824 children aged 6 months and older with clinically diagnosed CAP. These children received amoxicillin upon discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and one in Ireland, from February 2017 to April 2019. The last trial visit was on May 21, 2019.

Children were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive oral amoxicillin at either a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/day; n = 410) or a higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/day; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was set at 8%. Secondary outcomes included the severity and duration of nine parent-reported CAP symptoms, three antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

In the results, out of the 824 participants randomized into the four groups, 814 received at least one dose of the trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females). The primary outcome data were available for 789 (97%) participants. For the lower versus higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% of the lower dose group compared to 12.4% of the higher dose group.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^111rJW34]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Optimal antibiotic use is vital for effectively treating infections and protecting patients from antibiotic-associated adverse events, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and multidrug-resistant organisms. Pneumonia is the most common indication for inpatient antibiotic therapy and a major contributor to antibiotic overuse. Despite guidelines recommending a shorter antibiotic course, the majority of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) receive an excessive duration of therapy.

Several studies have demonstrated that antibiotic stewardship interventions can decrease excessive-duration antibiotic therapy for CAP, but data from large multihospital collaboratives are lacking. In 2017, the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS), a statewide collaborative quality initiative (CQI), began collecting data, sharing best practices, and benchmarking performance related to antibiotic duration for uncomplicated CAP. The resulting antibiotic use and patient outcomes from the first three years are described here.

### Omadacycline for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia [^113HB9Rg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Omadacycline, a new once-daily aminomethylcycline antibiotic agent that can be administered intravenously or orally, reaches high concentrations in pulmonary tissues and is active against common pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (Pneumonia Severity Index risk class II, III, or IV) to receive omadacycline (100 mg intravenously every 12 hours for two doses, then 100 mg intravenously every 24 hours) or moxifloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 24 hours). A transition to oral omadacycline (300 mg every 24 hours) or moxifloxacin (400 mg every 24 hours), respectively, was allowed after 3 days; the total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. The primary end point was early clinical response, defined as survival with improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea) and no worsening of symptoms at 72 to 120 hours, without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. A secondary endpoint was investigator-assessed clinical response at a post-treatment evaluation 5 to 10 days after the last dose, with clinical response defined as resolution or improvement in signs or symptoms to the extent that further antibacterial therapy was unnecessary. A noninferiority margin of 10 percentage points was used.

- **Results**: The intention-to-treat population included 386 patients in the omadacycline group and 388 patients in the moxifloxacin group. Omadacycline was noninferior to moxifloxacin.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^114t41w2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend that empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards due to limited intensive care unit (ICU) beds or unrecognition of pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted to and managed in general wards.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 hours was collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcomes, defined as a composite of treatment failure and in-hospital death. The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment in the study.

- **Results**: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP, of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood cultures than those with non-severe CAP.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^111XgpUc]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); however, rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose, and duration.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

- **Results**: A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%). Macrolides accounted for the majority of non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by appropriate indications.

### High-dose, short-course levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia: A new treatment paradigm [^115usEk8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin demonstrates concentration-dependent bactericidal activity most closely related to the pharmacodynamic parameters of the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the ratio of peak plasma concentration (C(max)) to MIC. Increasing the dose of levofloxacin to 750 mg exploits these parameters by increasing peak drug concentrations, allowing for a shorter course of treatment without diminishing therapeutic benefit. This was demonstrated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind investigation that compared levofloxacin dosages of 750 mg per day for 5 days with 500 mg per day for 10 days for the treatment of mild to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the clinically evaluable population, the clinical success rates were 92.4% (183 of 198 persons) for the 750-mg group and 91.1% (175 of 192 persons) for the 500-mg group (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 4.4). Microbiologic eradication rates were 93.2% and 92.4% in the 750-mg and 500-mg groups, respectively. These data demonstrate that 750 mg of levofloxacin per day for 5 days is at least as effective as 500 mg per day for 10 days for treatment of mild-to-severe CAP.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms on how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are aging and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcomes. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalization or ICU admission, and the likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern.

One complicating factor is the lack of a definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients, making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events.

Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcomes in CAP patients.

### Identifying the best initial oral antibiotics for adults with community-acquired pneumonia: A network meta-analysis [^111o69Rj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare rates of clinical response and mortality for empiric oral antibiotic regimens in adults with mild-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and the reference lists of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. We included randomized trials of adults with radiologically confirmed mild to moderate CAP initially treated orally and reporting clinical cure or mortality. Abstracts and studies were reviewed in parallel for inclusion in the analysis and for data abstraction. We performed separate analyses by antibiotic medications and antibiotic classes and present the results through network diagrams and forest plots sorted by p-scores. We assessed the quality of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias framework, as well as global and local inconsistency.

- **Results**: We identified 24 studies with 9361 patients: six at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk, and 12 at high risk. Nemonoxacin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin were most likely to achieve clinical response (p-score 0.79, 0.71, and 0.69 respectively), while penicillin and amoxicillin were least likely to achieve clinical response. Levofloxacin, nemonoxacin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate were most likely to be associated with lower mortality (p-score 0.85, 0.75, 0.74, and 0.68 respectively). By antibiotic class, quinolones and macrolides were most effective for clinical response (0.71 and 0.70 respectively), with amoxicillin-clavulanate plus macrolides and beta-lactams being less effective.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114MjWSZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is uncertain. This study aims to compare the effects of antibiotics for empiric therapy of moderate to severe CAP using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

Data sources included Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to July 3, 2024.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were considered.
- **Participants**: Adults with moderate to severe CAP.
- **Interventions**: Any empiric antibiotic regimen versus another, placebo, or no treatment.
- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Paired reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.
- **Methods of data synthesis**: Frequentist random-effects NMAs were conducted addressing patient-important outcomes, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Results reveal that 143 RCTs involving 29,157 participants were eligible. Effects are compared with respiratory fluoroquinolones alone. Penicillins alone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67; RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 88 more), 2nd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.02; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 135 more), and 3rd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77; RD 42 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 102 more) or combined with a macrolide (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 111 more) may be inferior in reducing treatment failure; all findings are of low certainty.

### Challenges in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: The role of quinolones and moxifloxacin [^116kVKjd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Strategies and guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are directed toward making care cost-effective by treating patients on an outpatient basis whenever possible. The use of new fluoroquinolones could help achieve these goals. These agents are highly bioavailable and can facilitate the oral treatment of certain patients who might otherwise be admitted to the hospital as outpatients. The good absorption and bioavailability of these agents can allow moderately ill patients to rapidly achieve effective serum levels of the drug after oral administration, facilitating early discontinuation of intravenous therapy and early discharge for responding inpatients.

For inpatients or outpatients with clinical risk factors for acquiring drug-resistant pneumococci, quinolones represent a reliable monotherapy option and an effective alternative to a beta-lactam/macrolide combination. Although the in vitro differences among the various quinolones remain of unclear clinical relevance, preliminary data suggest that agents with enhanced in vitro activity against pneumococci, such as moxifloxacin, may have greater clinical efficacy. They may lead to more rapid resolution of fever and potentially less selection of future pneumococcal resistance to quinolones than agents with less intrinsic activity.

### Efficacy and safety of oral solithromycin versus oral moxifloxacin for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: a global, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial (SOLITAIRE-ORAL) [^111WiW3F]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and treatment recommendations, each with specific limitations, vary globally. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of solithromycin, a novel macrolide, with moxifloxacin for the treatment of CABP.

- **Methods**: We conducted this global, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial at 114 centres in North America, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with clinically and radiographically confirmed pneumonia of Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based central block randomisation procedure (block size of four), to receive either oral solithromycin (800 mg on day 1, 400 mg on days 2–5, placebo on days 6–7) or oral moxifloxacin (400 mg on days 1–7). Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, PORT risk class (II vs III or IV), and medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study sponsor, investigators, staff, and patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was early clinical response, defined as an improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, chest pain, sputum production, dyspnoea) with no worsening in any symptom at 72 hours after the first dose of study drug, with a 10% non-inferiority margin. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT-01756339.

### Clinical experience in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: Lessons from the use of fluoroquinolones [^1171TV3A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The treatment of CAP has been complicated by several factors, including the expanding spectrum of causative organisms and the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance among respiratory pathogens. Initial antimicrobial treatment for patients with CAP is usually selected empirically and should provide appropriate coverage against the most common causative organisms, including resistant strains. Respiratory fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are the only antimicrobials that are highly active against the pathogens most frequently implicated in CAP, including macrolide-resistant and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., and atypical agents.

This paper reviews recent studies involving adult patients with CAP that suggest that levofloxacin, as compared with other conventional antibiotic treatments, may be associated with better clinical outcomes.

### Reply to Huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines, and we strongly agree.

The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented, the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to ensure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP.

We recommended amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for the treatment of inpatients with CAP, given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent, if not superior, to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: Do we know when, what and for how long to treat [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries, with an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social, and economic importance of CAP, prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the disease's impact. This discussion paper critically examines the available data on the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP, considering when, how, and for how long it should be treated.

This review identifies several reasons making it difficult to establish a rational approach to treating pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty in identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, high resistance of frequent respiratory pathogens to widely used anti-infectious agents, and lack of information on CAP epidemiology changes following new vaccines against respiratory pathogens.

More research is required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and reasons for complications, better defining first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment, and strategies to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens.

### Effectiveness of oral moxifloxacin in standard first-line therapy in community-acquired pneumonia [^1143br6R]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Based on recent guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, this study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new fluoroquinolone compared with standard antimicrobial regimens in conditions that closely mimic real-world settings. In this study, 564 patients were randomized to receive either oral moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) or standard oral therapy (amoxicillin 1 g three times daily, or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, alone or in combination) for up to 14 days using a double-blind procedure. The choice between the three standard regimens was made by the clinician prior to randomization.

Clinical response, quality of life, symptoms, healthcare resources, and safety were assessed. In the per-protocol population, clinical success was reported in 201 of 215 (93.5%) and 217 of 231 (93.9%) in the moxifloxacin and standard groups, respectively, at 7–10 days post-therapy. At 28–35 days follow-up, continued clinical cure was observed in 183 of 192 (95.3%) in the moxifloxacin and 207 of 221 (93.7%) in the standard groups. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 55 of 274 (20%) moxifloxacin and 86 of 279 (31%) standard patients, with diarrhea occurring in more than 5%. Oral moxifloxacin monotherapy was as effective as and better tolerated than the optimal antibiotic strategy represented either by mono- or combination therapy (amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin) in the management of community-acquired pneumonia.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: A critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to provide a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States.

For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids.

Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: What's in a name [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to explore the clinical distinctions between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, which were traditionally recognized by the requirement for intensive care unit admission. Recently, guidelines have adopted clinical definitions to make these distinctions. This review aims to delineate the varying definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia and whether these distinctions reflect differences in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic methods, and treatment approaches.

Recent findings indicate that new definitions may not effectively identify patients at high risk of mortality, as some patients outside intensive care units can still present with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Various host factors, including genetic predispositions and underlying conditions, may affect the severity of the disease presentation. The distribution of pathogens appears similar between severe and non-severe forms. It is critical that initial antibiotic therapy for patients deemed to have severe disease includes coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delays in appropriate treatment are linked to poorer outcomes. Moreover, recent studies suggest a potential benefit of including atypical pathogen coverage in non-severe cases. Consequently, the recommended initial treatment for all community-acquired pneumonia cases includes a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone. The preventive value of pneumococcal vaccination in reducing severe disease episodes remains uncertain.

Current guidelines do not adequately identify pati…

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in terms of empiric antibiotic therapy for inpatient settings with non-severe CAP, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend considering combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone) and doxycycline 100 mg BID. This is suggested as an alternative option for adult patients with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones.

### Azithromycin [^113xXLZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **14 clinical studies**:

- **Community-acquired pneumonia**: In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia conducted in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial conducted in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates — cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — among the 84 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was conducted on baseline and final visit specimens. The following combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates were obtained from the evaluable groups:

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes at 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were assessed through these studies.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^1131ADAR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment. CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

- **Objectives**: Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, and Merck Sharp & Dohme.

### Effectiveness of early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics in severe community acquired pneumonia: Multicentre randomised trial [^114VYMRp]. BMJ (2006). High credibility.

The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of an early switch to oral antibiotics with the standard 7-day course of intravenous antibiotics in cases of severe community-acquired pneumonia. To achieve this, a multicentre randomised controlled trial was conducted across five teaching hospitals and two university medical centres in the Netherlands.

A total of 302 patients were recruited to participate in the study; these were individuals in non-intensive care wards diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Out of these, 265 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study.

The intervention involved three days of intravenous antibiotic treatment. Once the patients were clinically stable, they were switched to oral antibiotics or continued with intravenous antibiotics for a total of seven days.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study focused on clinical cure and the duration of hospital stay. Results indicated that 302 patients were initially randomised, with an average age of 69.5 years and a mean pneumonia severity score of 112.7. However, 37 patients were excluded due to early dropout before day 3, leaving 265 participants for intention-to-treat analysis. Mortality rates by day 28 were 4% in the intervention group and 6% in the control group, representing a mean difference of 2% (95% confidence interval -3% to 8%). The clinical cure rate was 83% in the intervention group compared to 85% in the control group, resulting in a difference of 2% (-7% to 10%).

The duration of intravenous treatment and the length of hospital stay were both reduced in the intervention group. Specifically, the mean differences were 3.4 days for intravenous treatment (3.6 versus 7.0 days; confidence interval 2.8 to 3.9) and 1.9 days for hospital stay (9.6 versus 11.5 days; confidence interval 0.6 to 3.2).

In conclusion, the early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia is both safe and effective, significantly reducing the length of hospital stay by nearly two days.
