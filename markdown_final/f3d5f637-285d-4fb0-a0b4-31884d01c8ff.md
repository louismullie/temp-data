## Question

What is oppressor do you give for hypovolemic shock

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which vasopressor to give for hypovolemic shock and how to use it safely and effectively in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hypovolemic shock and whether vasopressors are even indicated. Then, I should verify the hierarchy of vasopressors across shock states and extract what applies to hypovolemia. Next, I will review direct evidence comparing agents in mixed shock cohorts, including hypovolemic subgroups. After that, I need to check dosing, timing, and access considerations, including permissive hypotension in trauma. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with monitoring and caveats, and I should double-check for any conflicting data or exceptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: hypovolemic shock is primarily a problem of decreased preload and stroke volume due to blood or plasma volume loss, so the cornerstone is rapid hemorrhage control and volume replacement. Vasopressors are not first-line and can worsen tissue ischemia if used in place of fluids, but they may be temporizing adjuncts when hypotension is life-threatening or when permissive strategies are employed while definitive control is pursued [^115B8o81] [^113TV9Ww] [^115QMhsU].

> Wait, let me verify the general vasopressor hierarchy before I overgeneralize to hypovolemia: across undifferentiated shock and vasodilatory states, norepinephrine is consistently favored as first-line because it provides potent alpha-1 vasoconstriction with meaningful beta-1 inotropy and fewer arrhythmias than dopamine. This is reflected in contemporary emergency medicine and critical care reviews and is mechanistically coherent for restoring perfusion pressure while supporting contractility [^116Y4EwT] [^114hkDpJ].

> I should confirm direct comparative evidence in mixed shock populations that included hypovolemic patients. The SOAP-II randomized trial showed no mortality difference overall between dopamine and norepinephrine, but dopamine caused significantly more arrhythmias, and importantly, in the hypovolemic subgroup there was no mortality signal favoring dopamine, supporting the safety and reasonableness of norepinephrine when a vasopressor is needed in hypovolemia [^116Y4EwT] [^111TQtBn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about trauma-specific hemorrhagic shock; I initially thought vasopressors might be broadly contraindicated there, but I need to check nuance. Contemporary trauma and critical care literature suggest that vasopressors can be used transiently to sustain life-threatening hypotension while pursuing hemorrhage control, ideally within permissive hypotension frameworks and balanced resuscitation with blood products; norepinephrine is the most commonly referenced agent in this context, though evidence quality is limited and clinician judgment is essential [^113TV9Ww] [^114SozyA] [^117Rp3Ug].

> Let me consider dosing and access pragmatics. When vasopressors are required before central access, starting norepinephrine peripherally through a large-bore, well-secured IV in or proximal to the antecubital fossa is acceptable for short durations with close monitoring, with typical starting doses in the 0.05–0.5 mcg/kg/min range titrated to a MAP target while fluids and source control proceed in parallel. I should double-check that this peripheral-start approach is supported by guidelines and emergency care statements, which it is, albeit with weak evidence and emphasis on safety and rapid transition to central access when feasible [^115XPUyB] [^115LhiBg] [^115QMhsU].

> Next, I should review alternatives and why they are less attractive here. Dopamine increases arrhythmias without outcome benefit versus norepinephrine, epinephrine can raise MAP but may increase lactate and complicate perfusion assessment, phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 that can compromise stroke volume and regional perfusion, and vasopressin is generally reserved as an adjunct in vasodilatory shock rather than as first-line in hypovolemia. These positions align with randomized data and guideline commentary on agent selection and safety profiles [^116Y4EwT] [^112pNbmR] [^112nKF8Z].

> I need to ensure the timing and targets are appropriate. In life-threatening hypotension, it is reasonable to start norepinephrine concurrently with or even just before completion of initial fluids to rapidly restore MAP and coronary perfusion, while in trauma without TBI permissive hypotension with systolic blood pressure around 80–90 mmHg is often targeted until hemorrhage control, and in TBI a higher SBP threshold is used to protect cerebral perfusion. These strategies balance ischemia risk against the harms of excessive fluids and uncontrolled bleeding [^113TV9Ww] [^114SozyA].

> But wait, what if the shock phenotype is not purely hypovolemic or is refractory despite fluids and norepinephrine? I should confirm that mixed shock with vasodilatory components may warrant adjunct vasopressin to achieve a norepinephrine-sparing effect, although this evidence base is strongest in septic shock and should be extrapolated cautiously to isolated hemorrhagic hypovolemia. Continuous reassessment of volume status, bleeding control, and end-organ perfusion is mandatory to avoid vasoconstrictor-induced ischemia [^112nKF8Z] [^111AYW9B].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and double-check it aligns with evidence: control bleeding and begin balanced resuscitation with blood products when available. If MAP remains below life-sustaining thresholds or organ perfusion is threatened, start norepinephrine peripherally at 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min and titrate to the lowest effective dose while fluids continue. In trauma without TBI, target permissive hypotension when safe. In TBI, prioritize cerebral perfusion with higher blood pressure targets. Transition to central access promptly and de-escalate vasopressors as volume and hemorrhage control improve. This plan reflects current trauma and critical care principles and the comparative vasopressor evidence base [^113TV9Ww] [^115QMhsU] [^116Y4EwT] [^112AAVRd].

> Final check and conclusion: for hypovolemic shock, vasopressors are adjuncts, not substitutes for volume and source control. When a vasopressor is required, norepinephrine is the preferred first-line agent because it reliably restores perfusion pressure with inotropic support and a safer arrhythmia profile than dopamine, supported by randomized data in mixed shock cohorts and contemporary reviews. Use the lowest effective dose, consider early initiation in life-threatening hypotension, employ peripheral starts only transiently with close monitoring, and tailor targets to the clinical context, especially in trauma with permissive hypotension strategies until definitive hemorrhage control is achieved [^116Y4EwT] [^112BoBYN] [^113TV9Ww] [^112AAVRd].

In hypovolemic shock, **vasopressors are not first-line**; prioritize rapid hemorrhage control and isotonic crystalloid/blood product resuscitation [^115B8o81] [^116gRQoq]. If persistent, life-threatening hypotension remains despite fluids, **start norepinephrine** (0.01–0.05 mcg/kg/min) to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and perfusion while definitive control is pursued [^111TxQxg]. Avoid dopamine due to arrhythmias; use vasopressin or epinephrine only if norepinephrine is unavailable or inadequate, and titrate to the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^116Y4EwT] [^114hkDpJ].

---

## Indications for vasopressor use in hypovolemic shock

Vasopressors are indicated in hypovolemic shock **only when**:

- **Persistent hypotension**: MAP < 65 mmHg or SBP < 90 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation and hemorrhage control [^notfound].
- **Life-threatening hypotension**: Immediate threat to organ perfusion or life, requiring temporary support while definitive therapy is pursued [^116wjSHU].
- **Contraindications to fluids**: Severe pulmonary edema, heart failure, or other conditions where aggressive fluids are harmful [^notfound].

---

## Recommended vasopressor agents

| **Vasopressor** | **Mechanism of action** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Norepinephrine | α1-adrenergic agonist causing vasoconstriction and increased SVR | 0.01–0.05 mcg/kg/min IV infusion | First-line due to potent vasoconstriction and minimal arrhythmias; monitor for tissue ischemia [^111TxQxg] [^116Y4EwT] |
| Vasopressin | V₁ receptor agonist causing vasoconstriction | 0.03–0.04 units/min IV infusion | Second-line or adjunct; consider if norepinephrine is inadequate or contraindicated [^111AYW9B] |
| Epinephrine | α and β agonist increasing SVR and cardiac output | 0.05–0.3 mcg/kg/min IV infusion | Alternative when norepinephrine is unavailable or ineffective; higher arrhythmia risk [^112nKF8Z] |

---

## Vasopressor agents to avoid or use with caution

- **Dopamine**: Associated with higher arrhythmia rates and mortality in shock; avoid as first-line [^116Y4EwT] [^112Et3WA].
- **Phenylephrine**: Pure α-agonist that may reduce cardiac output; use cautiously, especially in cardiogenic shock [^112pNbmR].
- **Vasopressin**: Use cautiously in hemorrhagic shock due to potential mesenteric ischemia [^116wjSHU].

---

## Clinical targets and monitoring parameters

When initiating vasopressors in hypovolemic shock, **titrate to**:

- **Mean arterial pressure (MAP)**: Maintain ≥ 65 mmHg to preserve organ perfusion [^notfound].
- **Systolic blood pressure (SBP)**: Maintain ≥ 90 mmHg in trauma patients without traumatic brain injury (TBI) [^notfound].
- **Urine output**: Target ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr as an indicator of renal perfusion [^112YrZZS].
- **Lactate levels**: Monitor for clearance indicating improved tissue perfusion [^115LhiBg].
- **Mental status and capillary refill**: Assess for signs of improved perfusion [^114fvkcb].

---

## Potential risks and complications

Vasopressor therapy in hypovolemic shock carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Tissue ischemia**: Excessive vasoconstriction can cause limb, mesenteric, or renal ischemia [^114hkDpJ].
- **Arrhythmias**: Particularly with dopamine and epinephrine [^116vggqb].
- **Fluid overload**: Vasopressors can mask hypovolemia, leading to over-resuscitation and pulmonary edema [^notfound].
- **Coagulopathy**: Vasopressors may exacerbate coagulopathy in hemorrhagic shock [^notfound].

---

## Integration with fluid resuscitation and hemorrhage control

Vasopressors must be integrated with **aggressive hemorrhage control** and **fluid resuscitation**:

- **Hemorrhage control**: Direct pressure, tourniquets, surgical intervention, or embolization [^notfound].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or Lactated Ringer's) and blood products (PRBCs, plasma, platelets) [^116gRQoq].
- **Permissive hypotension**: Allow SBP 80–90 mmHg in trauma without TBI to limit bleeding until definitive control [^113TV9Ww].

---

## Special considerations in traumatic hypovolemic shock

In traumatic hypovolemic shock, **vasopressors should be used cautiously** and only as a bridge to definitive hemorrhage control. Permissive hypotension is recommended to limit bleeding and coagulopathy, and vasopressors may be considered in TBI to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) ≥ 60 mmHg [^113TV9Ww] [^116wjSHU].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **fluids first** and vasopressors only for refractory hypotension or when fluids are contraindicated. Norepinephrine is the **preferred first-line vasopressor** due to its efficacy and safety profile [^115FTBqq] [^112nKF8Z].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line vasopressor**: Norepinephrine (0.01–0.05 mcg/kg/min) [^111TxQxg].
- **Second-line vasopressor**: Vasopressin (0.03–0.04 units/min) or epinephrine (0.05–0.3 mcg/kg/min) if norepinephrine is inadequate [^111AYW9B] [^112nKF8Z].
- **Avoid**: Dopamine due to higher arrhythmia risk [^116Y4EwT].
- **Targets**: MAP ≥ 65 mmHg, SBP ≥ 90 mmHg, urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr, lactate clearance [^111q4gC9] [^114fvkcb].
- **Integration**: Use with hemorrhage control and fluid resuscitation; consider permissive hypotension in trauma [^115B8o81] [^113TV9Ww].

---

Vasopressors are adjuncts in hypovolemic shock, used only when fluids and hemorrhage control fail to restore perfusion. Norepinephrine is **first-line**, with vasopressin or epinephrine as alternatives, and therapy must be carefully titrated to minimize ischemia and other complications.

### Effects of very early start of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock: a propensity score-based analysis [^112Pewt4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection and prompt reversion of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion are key elements in the treatment of patients with septic shock. Fluid administration is widely accepted as the first-line therapy followed by vasopressor use in persistently hypotensive patients or in those in whom arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Studies on implementation of therapeutic bundles in sepsis and recent randomized controlled trials on early goal-directed therapy in septic shock highlighted the importance of the initial fluid loading and turned this into a standard for the clinical practice. Indeed, current guidelines on sepsis management emphasize on the administration of at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of identification of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but a recommendation on the timing to start vasopressor support was not clearly stated. Nevertheless, a recent update on the last recommendations of Surviving Sepsis Campaign claims for an immediate start of resuscitation and treatment in a "1-h bundle" including the use of vasopressors in the case of life-threatening hypotension, during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Although this initiative embraces the concept of sepsis as a medical emergency, the level of evidence for these recommendations is quite limited and remains debatable.

### A clinical review of vasopressors in emergency medicine [^111TxQxg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressor medications raise blood pressure through vasoconstriction and are essential in reversing the hypotension seen in many critically ill patients. Previously, vasopressor administration was largely limited to continuous infusions through central venous access.

Objectives Of The Review

This review addresses the clinical use of vasopressors in various shock states, including practical considerations and innovations in vasopressor administration. The focus is on the clinical administration of vasopressors across a range of shock states, including hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock.

Discussion

Criteria for starting vasopressors are not clearly defined, though early use may be beneficial. A number of physiologic factors affect the body's response to vasopressors, such as acidosis and adrenal insufficiency. Peripheral and push-dose administration of vasopressors are becoming more common. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation and vasopressors play a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The use of vasopressors is more controversial in hypovolemic shock, as the preferred treatment is correction of the volume deficit. Evidence for vasopressors is limited in cardiogenic shock. For obstructive shock, vasopressors can temporize a patient's blood pressure until definitive therapy can reverse the underlying cause.

Conclusion

Across the categories of shock states, norepinephrine has wide applicability and is a reasonable first-line agent for shock of uncertain etiology. Keeping a broad differential when hypotension is refractory to vasopressors may help to identify adjunctive treatments in physiologic states that impair vasopressor effectiveness. Peripheral administration of vasopressors is safe and facilitates early administration, which may help to improve outcomes in some shock states.

Arch Surg. 1973; 107: 176–180. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.1973.01350200050013 Glucagon infused into Macaca rhesus monkeys in hypovolemic shock significantly improved splanchnic microcirculatory perfusion, increased pH, and decreased phosphate, lactate, amino acid, and fatty acid levels as compared to the controls. Further, in vitro rat liver perfusion studies showed that glucagon significantly increased lactic acid extraction, even after reducing oxygen pressure and perfusant flow to a minimum. Thus, in addition to its cardiotonic and vasodilatory effects, glucagon was shown in this study to improve perfusion in the splanchnic microcirculation and to decrease anaerobic metabolites. These findings support its use in the treatment of hypovolemic shock. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116Xkvmv]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a long-standing initiative of Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine designed to improve mortality from sepsis. The Campaign has released four sets of guidelines, with another due to be published in 2021. Although recommendations within the SSC guidelines have been associated with improved outcomes, the guidelines are often unable to make more specific recommendations in multiple areas of clinical importance due to ongoing gaps in the literature.

In an attempt to define priorities for research within the field of sepsis, SSC created a research committee that was charged with developing a list of research questions related to sepsis. This led to the joint publication of "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities for Sepsis and Septic Shock" in Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine in August 2018. The initial document presented a broad overview, identifying 26 questions to explore as research priorities in several domains with an explicit intention to publish separate papers with more detailed descriptions for each domain in the future. This article is the second in a series of manuscripts (following a prior effort devoted to basic science research), which will expand upon the three research questions related to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors originating from the broader publication.

### Timing of norepinephrine initiation in patients with septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ssggg]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Early norepinephrine use in septic shock can increase cardiac output through an increase in cardiac preload and/or contractility and improve microcirculation and tissue oxygenation. However, the use of vasopressors is not without consequences. Risk of well-known adverse reactions, such as arrhythmias, may have been increased for patients with prolonged exposure to vasopressors, potentially adding to the increased mortality rate. Another main argument is that high doses of exogenous norepinephrine may have deleterious consequences such as myocardial cell injury, oxidative stress, and alteration of sepsis-associated immunomodulation. Splanchnic hypoperfusion is also an important concern when norepinephrine is given early. No matter what, norepinephrine remains the primary vasopressor in septic shock, and the existing evidence suggests that it remains a safe and effective first-line medication for septic shock.

At present, there is no uniform definition of "early" or "late" norepinephrine initiation in patients with septic shock, and the five studies included in our meta-analysis have different definitions of the early and late groups. We listed a table (Table 3) to illustrate each author's definition of the early and late groups. The recent Hour-1 Bundle supported by the SSC recommends starting vasopressors within the first hour of resuscitation if initial fluid loading does not restore minimum MAP. Indeed, norepinephrine infusion can be safely started before ICU admission, even in intermediate care without intensivist supervision. Delays in initiation of vasopressor therapy following the first documentation of hypotension in septic shock are modestly associated with increased specific organ failure and mortality risk. We now need a large multicenter phase 3 RCT of early norepinephrine initiation powered for mortality and organ dysfunction. In a word, early may be better.

### Mobilisation of critically ill patients receiving norepinephrine: a retrospective cohort study [^116Dy83M]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vasoactive drugs are essential in managing vasodilatory shock, not responsive to volume therapy. They are also administered in cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. Vasopressors generally bind to specific (e.g. adrenergic) receptors, thereby creating vasoconstriction and raising the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Sustaining an adequate MAP is crucial to organ perfusion; however, vasopressors also cause adverse effects, including tachycardia and arrhythmias. For most clinical conditions requiring vasoactive drugs, norepinephrine is the first-line therapy.

Vasopressors are an indicator of hemodynamic instability and are perceived as a barrier to starting early mobilisation, resulting in less mobilisation. While sufficient mobilisation of patients is a crucial step in rehabilitation in the intensive care unit (ICU), too much mobilisation, especially active forms, inherits the potential of harm.

There is little to no expert consensus on safe doses of vasoactive drugs in the mobilisation of the critically ill, as well as a lack of quantitative data. A systematic review of safety criteria in early mobilisation in 2017 stated that there was no reported safe dose of vasoactive drugs up to which mobilisation can be recommended. A recent systematic review came to the same conclusion and pointed out that data concerning a safe dose of norepinephrine for early mobilisation is inconclusive.

This report focuses on norepinephrine since it is the most often used vasopressor. Consequently, this study aims to identify the impact of norepinephrine on mobilisation in general and in a dose-specific manner.

### Vasopressor support in septic shock [^113xYFGN]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

When fluid administration fails to restore an adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion in patients with septic shock, therapy with vasopressor agents should be initiated. The ultimate goals of such therapy in patients with shock are to restore effective tissue perfusion and to normalize cellular metabolism. Although arterial pressure is the end point of vasopressor therapy, and the restoration of adequate pressure is the criterion of effectiveness, BP does not always equate to blood flow; so, the precise BP goal to target is not necessarily the same in all patients. There has been longstanding debate about whether one catecholamine vasopressor agent is superior to another, but different agents have different effects on pressure and flow. The argument about which catecholamine is best in a given situation is best transformed into a discussion about which agent is best suited to implement the therapeutic strategy chosen. Despite the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, an underlying approach to its hemodynamic support can be formulated that takes both pressure and perfusion into account when choosing therapeutic interventions. The efficacy of hemodynamic therapy in sepsis should be assessed by monitoring a combination of clinical and hemodynamic parameters. How to optimize regional blood and microcirculatory blood flow remains uncertain. Thus, specific end points for therapy are debatable and are likely to evolve. Nonetheless, the idea that clinicians should define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis remains a fundamental principle.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^111yuQiB]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic analysis demonstrated that colloids are more efficient than crystalloids in reaching hemodynamic goals. However, colloids are significantly more expensive than crystalloids, and there are no large-scale studies convincingly demonstrating a beneficial effect of colloids on patient-centric outcomes. It may not be fair to generalize amongst colloids, where the type of colloid also impacts outcome. The most straightforward example is hydroxyethyl starches, which are associated with a higher degree of renal injury and possible risk of death, without any clear benefits and, are therefore, not recommended for use in sepsis.

There is a robust body of evidence evaluating the effects of albumin administration in critical illness in general and, more specifically, in sepsis and septic shock, either as a primary comparison or as a subset analysis of a larger trial. This has resulted in a suggestion from SSC to use albumin in addition to crystalloids for initial resuscitation and subsequent intravascular volume replacement in patients with sepsis and septic shock when patients require substantial amounts of crystalloids. This recommendation is largely based on 1) the ALBIOS trial which reported albumin may be associated with decreased mortality in the subgroup of patients with septic shock and hypoalbuminemia and 2) the SAFE trial which showed no benefit to albumin in overall survival in critical illness but a decreased mortality in the subgroup of patients with sepsis. Importantly, in the ALBIOS trial, albumin was administered in hypoalbuminemic septic patients in an attempt to maintain a serum albumin level of 30 g per liter or more. In addition, albumin was given as a daily dose (up to 300 mL of 20% albumin) for 7 days. In contrast, a recent single-center trial of 360 septic patients with cancer failed to show beneficial effects for the addition of albumin on 30-day mortality. Notably, studies comparing colloids with crystalloids used saline as a comparator. If buffered solutions are indeed superior to saline, the potential benefits of colloids reported in previous trials may have been related to disadvantages related to the saline comparator and should be investigated further, perhaps in the setting of a three-armed trial with a saline arm, a buffered solutions arm, and an albumin arm. Studies evaluating albumin primary test albumin as a maintenance fluid rather than a resuscitation fluid in the stages of initial resuscitation, primarily after crystalloids, have proved ineffective. There may be a role to evaluate albumin as a supplemental resuscitation fluid following initial resuscitation with crystalloids. Finally, there are no large-scale studies evaluating albumin as a resuscitation fluid, triggered by hemodynamic endpoints.

Vasoactive agent management in septic shock — Use norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor and target a MAP of 65 mm Hg. Consider invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure. If central access is not yet available, consider initiating vasopressors peripherally, and when using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein proximal to the antecubital fossa. If MAP is inadequate despite low-to-moderate dose norepinephrine, consider adding vasopressin. If cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion is present despite adequate volume status and blood pressure, consider adding dobutamine or switching to epinephrine. Strong recommendations are displayed in green, and weak recommendations are displayed in yellow.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^114P8Wsu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

Epinephrine positioning among vasopressors — The evidence regarding the optimal therapeutic strategy for shock requiring high dose vasopressors is scant. Epinephrine has been suggested as second or third-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock, and in an indirect comparison a network meta-analysis did not find any significant difference between epinephrine and vasopressin in terms of mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47–1.88). Epinephrine might be useful in refractory septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction.

### Emergency medicine updates: management of sepsis and septic shock [^114fvkcb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Emergency physicians play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning the management of sepsis and septic shock for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome, and rapid diagnosis and management are essential. Antimicrobials should be administered as soon as possible, as delays are associated with increased mortality. Resuscitation targets include mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg, mental status, capillary refill time, lactate, and urine output. Intravenous fluid resuscitation plays an integral role in those who are fluid responsive. Balanced crystalloids and normal saline are both reasonable options for resuscitation. Early vasopressors should be initiated in those who are not fluid-responsive. Norepinephrine is the recommended first-line vasopressor, and if hypotension persists, vasopressin should be considered, followed by epinephrine. Administration of vasopressors through a peripheral 20-gauge or larger intravenous line is safe and effective. Steroids such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone should be considered in those with refractory septic shock.

Conclusion

An understanding of the recent updates in the literature concerning sepsis and septic shock can assist emergency clinicians and improve the care of these patients.

Septic shock — practical targets and dosing with vasopressors: In summary, norepinephrine should be used as a first-line vasopressor, with epinephrine and dopamine as alternatives if not available, and a MAP of 65 mmHg should be targeted for patients with septic shock receiving vasopressors. Healthcare professionals may consider initiating invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure monitoring and, if central access has not been obtained, consider starting vasopressors peripherally. Should MAP targets not be met despite low-to-moderate dose norepinephrine, healthcare professionals may consider adding vasopressin; the usual dose range for norepinephrine is 0.25 to 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, and if the MAP remains inadequate, healthcare professionals may consider adding epinephrine.

### Management of bleeding and coagulopathy following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^116wjSHU]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

The first step in shock resuscitation is to rapidly restore mean arterial pressure and systemic blood flow to prevent regional hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Fluid resuscitation is the first strategy applied to restore mean arterial pressure in hemorrhagic shock. However, vasopressor agents may also be transiently required to sustain life and maintain tissue perfusion in the presence of life-threatening hypotension, even when fluid expansion is in progress and hypovolaemia has not yet been corrected.

Norepinephrine (NE) is often used to restore arterial pressure in septic and haemorrhagic shock. It is now recommended as the agent of choice for this purpose during septic shock. NE is a sympathomimetic agent with predominantly vasoconstrictive effects. Arterial α-adrenergic stimulation increases arterial resistance and may increase cardiac afterload, and NE exerts both arterial and venous α-adrenergic stimulation. Indeed, in addition to its arterial vasoconstrictor effect, NE induces venoconstriction at the level of the splanchnic circulation in particular, which increases the pressure in capacitance vessels and actively shifts splanchnic blood volume to the systemic circulation. This venous adrenergic stimulation may recruit some blood from the venous unstressed volume, that is, the blood volume filling the blood vessels, without generating an intravascular pressure. Moreover, stimulation of β₂-adrenergic receptors decreases venous resistance and increases venous return.

Animal studies using models of uncontrolled hemorrhage have suggested that NE infusion reduces the amount of fluid resuscitation required to achieve a given arterial pressure target, is associated with lower blood loss and significantly improves survival. However, the effects of NE have not been rigorously investigated in humans with haemorrhagic shock. An interim analysis performed during an ongoing multi-centre prospective cohort study suggested that the early use of vasopressors for haemodynamic support after haemorrhagic shock may be deleterious compared to aggressive volume resuscitation and should be used cautiously. This study has several limitations, however. First, this was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study and was not designed to answer the specific hypothesis tested and, second, the group receiving vasopressors had a higher rate of thoracotomy. Thus, a prospective study to define the effect of vasopressors in haemorrhagic shock is clearly needed. Vasopressors may be useful if used transiently to sustain arterial pressure and maintain tissue perfusion in face of a life-threatening hypotension. If used, it is essential to respect the recommended objectives for arterial pressure (systolic arterial pressure 80 to 90 mmHg).

### Hypovolemic shock and edema due to increased capillary permeability… [^112aSxzN]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A patient had fatal hypovolemic shock and edema. As in previously reported cases, the mechanism of shock appears to be loss of protein and fluid from the vascular bed. Extensive studies of all patients have revealed no cause for this extraordinary vascular permeability. Analysis of the reported cases suggests that subsequent patients with this syndrome should have analyses performed to determine the presence of vascular reactants such as kinins. A study of these cases suggests a method of treatment of similar episodes of hypovolemic shock. Observations from this case and the one previously reported from this center suggest that vasopressor agents such as catecholamines probably are contraindicated.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^117GBfE1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis remains the most common cause of vasodilatory shock worldwide. International consensus guidelines describe specific recommendations regarding treatment. These include the timing of important interventions comprising blood culture collection, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood glucose targets, use of steroids, and restoration of optimal hemodynamic status. The mainstay of treatment with regard to restoring and maintaining optimal hemodynamic status is rapid and appropriate fluid bolus therapy (FBT) which, if insufficient, is followed by vasopressor therapy to maintain an acceptable mean arterial pressure (MAP). Despite this approach being a cornerstone of therapeutic guidelines, there is a lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating a survival benefit associated with the use of one vasopressor over another. Although current consensus guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor, both selection and timing of second-line therapy in refractory hypotension due to septic shock is highly variable. Indeed, in a recent survey of practice, only 14% of respondents cited a predefined dose of the first agent as the stimulus for additional therapy. Selection of the vasopressor agent is also variable and further complicated by the recent data related to a "new" vasopressor, angiotensin II, which is currently only available in the USA.

### Vasopressor and inotropic support in septic shock: an evidence-based review [^113ETdXN]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for vasopressor and inotropic support in septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and to improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

An arterial catheter should be placed as soon as possible in patients with septic shock. Vasopressors are indicated to maintain mean arterial pressure of < 65 mm Hg, both during and following adequate fluid resuscitation. Norepinephrine or dopamine are the vasopressors of choice in the treatment of septic shock. Norepinephrine may be combined with dobutamine when cardiac output is being measured. Epinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin are not recommended as first-line agents in the treatment of septic shock. Vasopressin may be considered for salvage therapy. Low-dose dopamine is not recommended for the purpose of renal protection. Dobutamine is recommended as the agent of choice to increase cardiac output but should not be used for the purpose of increasing cardiac output above physiologic levels.

### Vasopressor therapy in critically ill patients with shock [^114hkDpJ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressors are administered to critically ill patients with vasodilatory shock not responsive to volume resuscitation, and less often in cardiogenic shock, and hypovolemic shock.

Objectives

The objectives are to review safety and efficacy of vasopressors, pathophysiology, agents that decrease vasopressor dose, predictive biomarkers, β₁-blockers, and directions for research.

Methods

The quality of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

Results

Vasopressors bind adrenergic: α1, α2, β1, β2; vasopressin: AVPR₁a, AVPR₁B, AVPR₂; angiotensin II: AG₁, AG₂; and dopamine: DA₁, DA₂ receptors inducing vasoconstriction. Vasopressor choice and dose vary because of patients and physician practice. Adverse effects include excessive vasoconstriction, organ ischemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, tachycardia, and tachyarrhythmias. No randomized controlled trials of vasopressors showed a significant difference in 28-day mortality rate. Norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor in vasodilatory shock after adequate volume resuscitation. Some strategies that decrease norepinephrine dose (vasopressin, angiotensin II) have not decreased 28-day mortality while corticosteroids have decreased 28-day mortality significantly in some (two large trials) but not all trials. In norepinephrine-refractory patients, vasopressin or epinephrine may be added. A new vasopressor, angiotensin II, may be useful in profoundly hypotensive patients. Dobutamine may be added because vasopressors may decrease ventricular contractility. Dopamine is recommended only in bradycardic patients. There are potent vasopressors with limited evidence (e.g. methylene blue, metaraminol) and novel vasopressors in development (selepressin).

Conclusions

Norepinephrine is first choice followed by vasopressin or epinephrine. Angiotensin II and dopamine have limited indications. In future, predictive biomarkers may guide vasopressor selection and novel vasopressors may emerge.

### Timing of norepinephrine initiation in patients with septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112dYvqS]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Septic shock is one of the most challenging problems in critical care medicine. With an increasing annual incidence in the developed world, mortality remains between 25 and 50% of those afflicted. Patients with septic shock can be identified with a clinical construct of sepsis with persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg and having a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation. The 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Bundle recommends administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, rapidly administering 30 ml/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L and applying vasopressors if the patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg within the first hour.

The pathophysiology of septic shock is complex and involves vasodilatation, relative and absolute hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, increased metabolic rate, and altered regional and microvascular blood flow. Besides relative and absolute hypovolemia, decreased vascular tone is one of the major characteristics of septic shock causing hypotension. Norepinephrine is both an alpha1- and beta1-agonist and is therefore able to increase vascular tone and contractility. Recent guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor in septic shock.

So far, most studies have focused on the rational use of different types of vasopressors. However, it is the timing of vasopressor therapy, rather than the specific agent, that appears to be crucial. Studies comparing different agents have not clarified the optimal agents, and none have addressed the optimal timing. The present data show that the time from the onset of septic shock to initial norepinephrine administration is an important determinant of survival, but a recommendation on the timing to start norepinephrine support was not clearly stated.

Since the optimal timing of the initiation of norepinephrine remains unknown and whether the benefits or harm of norepinephrine introduction even preceding fluid resuscitation has not been still answered, we conducted a meta-analysis which extracted results from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies to evaluate the impact of early and late start of norepinephrine support on clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock.

Vasoactive agents — rationale and supporting evidence note that "Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine as a vasoconstrictor", and a "systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs" found "a lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and lower risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine". A "randomized blinded study comparing epinephrine with norepinephrine in patients with shock showed no difference in 90-day mortality (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63–1.25) and vasopressor-free days". Regarding vasopressin, levels "decrease to normal range in most patients between 24 and 48 hours" and it "is usually administered at a fixed dose of 0.03 units/min" with "up to 0.06 units/min" used in clinical trials; in VANISH, "There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in 28-day mortality".

### Vasoactive drugs in circulatory shock [^111fVfGo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Shock occurs when failure of the cardiovascular system compromises tissue perfusion. When fluid administration fails to restore adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion in patients with shock, therapy with vasoactive agents should be initiated. The key to selecting among vasoactive agents is to make the choice in the context of the goals of therapy. The ultimate goals of hemodynamic therapy in shock are to restore effective tissue perfusion and to normalize cellular metabolism. The clinician needs to consider ways of achieving those goals and the mechanisms of action of potential therapies. Armed with this knowledge, it becomes easier to match the mechanism of action of a particular agent to the goals of therapy. When this is done, differences among various agents are seen primarily as differences in mechanisms of action, and discussions about which agent is "best" are transformed into consideration of which agent is best suited to implement the therapeutic strategy that has been selected in a given clinical context. Despite the complex pathophysiology of shock, use of vasoactive agents for hemodynamic support of patients with shock can be guided by an underlying approach in which clinicians define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis.

KDOQI commentary — vasopressor selection and dopamine safety in shock with risk of acute kidney injury (AKI): The Work Group notes that "fluid resuscitation is typically insufficient to fully restore blood pressure to normal levels, which is critical for the prevention and management of AKI", and that "whether one vasopressor is more effective for patients with or at risk of AKI is unknown". Regarding dopamine, in a large trial "the use of dopamine was associated with more adverse events in those with sepsis and with an increased risk of death in those with cardiogenic shock", and in a meta-analysis "dopamine was associated with an increased risk of death and arrhythmias", leading to the conclusion that "Thus, we believe that dopamine should be used with caution as the first-line agent of choice in patients with shock at present".

### Vasopressors and inotropes in sepsis [^113QyUMF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressor and inotropes are beneficial in shock states. Norepinephrine is considered the first-line vasopressor for patients with sepsis-associated hypotension. Dobutamine is considered the first-line inotrope in sepsis, and should be considered for patients with evidence of myocardial dysfunction or ongoing signs of hypoperfusion. Vasopressor and inotrope therapy has complex effects that are often difficult to predict; emergency providers should consider the physiology and clinical trial data. It is essential to continually reevaluate the patient to determine if the selected treatment is having the intended result.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115LhiBg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Septic shock vasopressors — agent choice, targets, and access: Norepinephrine is an excellent first-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock, and early vasopressors can be administered through a well-secured nondistal peripheral IV catheter. We recommend titrating vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg unless the patient has baseline hypertension and evidence of hypoperfusion with a MAP of more than 65, and adding vasopressin (0.03 to 0.04 U/min) is a reasonable approach to reduce norepinephrine requirements and decrease complications, especially at high doses. In patients with ongoing hypotension despite high doses of norepinephrine, or in patients with echocardiographic evidence of myocardial depression, epinephrine is a second-line vasopressor and inotropic agent. Current limited data suggest that early administration of peripheral norepinephrine through large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters for short intervals with appropriate monitoring is safe during resuscitation, and clinicians should consider titration to improve markers of organ perfusion (urine output, lactate) in patients with baseline hypertension.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^115Cncz8]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite its apparent simplicity, fluid therapy is complex. Fluids are drugs, inconsistently effective and endowed with notable deleterious effects. Like any medicine, they must be administered at the right dose and only to patients who need them. To guide fluid therapy, rather than relying on an identical strategy for all patients, it is possible to personalize decisions. Consider the characteristics of the patient (the severity of the vasodilation, the importance of the fluid accumulation), his/her clinical history (to assess the depth of the initial hypovolaemia), his/her physiological conditions (in particular preload responsiveness), should logically ensure effective and safe fluid delivery and removal. If these individual criteria are not considered, clinical studies investigating the various fluid therapy strategies are and will remain negative.

Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" with a remark that vasopressin is "usually started when the dose of norepinephrine is in the range of 0.25–0.5 μg/kg/ min"; if MAP remains inadequate despite norepinephrine and vasopressin, "we suggest adding epinephrine. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence"; and "we suggest against using terlipressin. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence".

Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence". Remark: "When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa".

### Fluid resuscitation in acute medicine: what is the current situation? [^11538Y59]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The administration of intravenous fluids for resuscitation is the most common intervention in acute medicine. There is increasing evidence that the type of fluid may directly affect patient-centred outcomes. There is a lack of evidence that colloids confer clinical benefit over crystalloids and they may be associated with harm. Hydroxyethyl starch preparations are associated with increased mortality and use of renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis; albumin is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Crystalloids, such as saline or balanced salt solutions, are increasingly recommended as first-line resuscitation fluids for the majority of patients with hypovolaemia. There is emerging evidence that saline may be associated with adverse outcomes due to the development of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis, although the safety of balanced salt solutions has not been established. Fluid requirements vary over the course of critical illness. The excessive use of fluids during the resuscitative period is associated with increased cumulative fluid balance and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. The selection of fluid depends on the clinical context in which it is administered and requires careful consideration of the dose and potential for toxicity. There is an urgent need to conduct further high-quality randomized controlled trials of currently available fluid therapy in patients with critical illness.

### Timing of vasopressor initiation and mortality in septic shock: a cohort study [^1114HHNY]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advancements in understanding and treatment, septic shock remains a worldwide healthcare problem. With an increasing annual incidence in the developed world, mortality remains between 25 and 50% of those afflicted. The pathophysiology of septic shock is complex and involves vasodilatation, relative and absolute hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, increased metabolic rate and altered regional and microvascular blood flow. Septic shock appears to cause a loss of autoregulation, making the perfusion of many vital organs and tissues dependent on blood pressure. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation of sepsis has been suggested to have a critical role in optimization of organ perfusion, preservation of end organ function and improvement of survival.

Hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation therapy is a defining criterion in the diagnosis of septic shock. To maintain organ perfusion, current guidelines recommend maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg with fluid therapy and vasopressors even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign this recommendation is considered 'strong' although supporting evidence is considered 'weak'.

Many studies have compared different vasopressor agents for the resuscitation of septic shock but very few have investigated the role that the timing of vasopressor initiation in relation to hypotension onset plays in outcome.

### Efficacy and safety of vasopressin as first-line treatment of distributive and hemorrhagic shock States [^114nBKGu]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Norepinephrine remains the first-line option to manage patients with circulatory shock. Limited evidence exists evaluating noncatecholamine compounds as first-line monotherapy for managing noncardiogenic shock. Objective: To compare vasopressin monotherapy with norepinephrine monotherapy for reversal of distributive and hemorrhagic shock. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including adult patients who were diagnosed with hypovolemic or septic shock, received fluids, and received norepinephrine or vasopressin monotherapy for at least 1 hour. Patients excluded lacked a clear diagnosis, were initiated on 2 or more vasopressors at once, or underwent cardiac surgery. The primary outcome was time to shock reversal. Secondary outcomes included mortality, lengths of stay, and safety end points. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was performed incorporating baseline and treatment variables. Results: A total of 85 and 160 patients were treated with vasopressin and norepinephrine, respectively. A decrease in time to shock reversal was observed in the vasopressin group (58.32 hours [95% CI, 50.88–66.00] vs 74.64 hours [95% CI, 60.96–88.32], P = 0.004). Mortality was lower in the vasopressin group (25% vs 41%, P = 0.01), and intensive care unit length of stay was longer (13 days [interquartile range, IQR = 7–19] vs 7 days [IQR = 5–9], P = 0.006). Remaining secondary outcomes were similar. The multivariable analysis revealed no difference in time to shock reversal. Conclusion and Relevance: First-line vasopressin exhibited faster time to distributive shock reversal in the unadjusted analysis but failed to maintain this difference in the multivariable analysis. These findings support safe use of vasopressin as first-line therapy or as an alternative to norepinephrine in distributive shock.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^112YrZZS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Rivers and coll. demonstrated that a strategy of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) decreases the in-hospital mortality of patients who are taken to the emergency department in septic shock.

An organized approach to the haemodynamic support to sepsis includes use of fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy and inotropic therapy.

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may present ineffective perfusion. Poor tissues perfusion may cause a global tissue hypoxia, often associated to an elevated serum lactate level. A serum lactate value greater than 4 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) is correlated with poorer outcomes, even if hypotension is not yet present. Fluid resuscitation should be started as early as possible.

According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines during the first 6 hrs of resuscitation, the goals of initial resuscitation of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should include all of the following as one part of a treatment protocol:

- Central venous pressure 8 to 12 mm Hg

- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mm Hg

- Urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/hr

- Central venous (superior vena cava) or mixed venous oxygen saturation > 70% or > 65%, respectively

The early hypovolemic phase of sepsis must be always treated by providing appropriate high volume resuscitation.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that fluid challenge in patients with suspected hypovolemia be started with ≥ 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300–500 mL of colloids over 30 mins. More rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion.

As the volume of distribution is less large for colloids than for crystalloids, resuscitation with colloids requires less fluid to achieve the same goals. A colloid equivalent is an acceptable alternative to crystalloid. Crystalloids are less expensive.

### Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock [^111TQtBn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

The study SOAP II was published by De Backer D and colleagues in 2010 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SOAP II study, the trial question was: what is the role of dopamine as first-line vasopressor agent in patients with shock? In the SOAP II study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SOAP II study, the population was: 1679 patients (723 female, 956 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with shock. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; already received a vasopressor agent (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, or phenylephrine) for > 4 hours during the current episode of shock; serious arrhythmia, such as rapid AF (> 160 beats/min) or VT; or declared brain-dead. In the SOAP II study, the interventions were: n = 858 dopamine (dose determined according to the patient's body weight, could be increased or decreased by 2 mcg/kg/min) n = 821 norepinephrine (dose determined according to the patient's body weight, could be increased or decreased by 0.02 mcg/kg/min). In the SOAP II study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at 28 days (52.5% vs. 48.5%; OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.42). In the SOAP II study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in required open-label norepinephrine therapy (26% vs. 20%; RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.07) Significant increase in open-label vasopressors not needed (12.6 vs. 14.2; MD 1.6, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.76). In the SOAP II study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in arrhythmic events (24.1% vs. 12.4%, p < 0.001). In the SOAP II study, the conclusion was: in patients with shock, dopamine was not superior to norepinephrine with respect to death at 28 days.

### Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock [^116Y4EwT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 microg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 microg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events.

Results

The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P = 0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P = 0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P = 0.19 for septic shock, and P = 0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan-Meier analyses).

Conclusions

Although there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00314704.)

### Are we close to the ideal intravenous fluid? [^113fy4d3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The approach to i.v. fluid therapy for hypovolaemia may significantly influence outcomes for patients who experience a systemic inflammatory response after sepsis, trauma, or major surgery. Currently, there is no single i.v. fluid agent that meets all the criteria for the ideal treatment for hypovolaemia. The physician must choose the best available agent(s) for each patient, and then decide when and how much to administer. Findings from large randomized trials suggest that some colloid-based fluids, particularly starch-based colloids, may be harmful in some situations, but it is unclear whether they should be withdrawn from use completely. Meanwhile, crystalloid fluids, such as saline 0.9% and Ringer's lactate, are more frequently used, but debate continues over which preparation is preferable. Perhaps most importantly, it remains unclear how to select the optimal dose of fluid in different patients and different clinical scenarios. There is good reason to believe that both inadequate and excessive i.v. fluid administration may lead to poor outcomes, including increased risk of infection and organ dysfunction, for hypovolaemic patients. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on this topic and identify some key pitfalls and some areas of agreed best practice.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^117X1wjx]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We propose the notion of "broad spectrum vasopressors" wherein patients with septic shock are started on multiple vasopressors with a different mechanism of action simultaneously while the vasopressor sensitivity is assessed. Vasopressor sensitivity could be assessed by sequential removal of vasopressors or developing a vasopressor sensitivity panel. Once the vasopressor sensitivities are assessed, then the vasopressors are de-escalated accordingly. However, this concept is hampered by several issues. Firstly, there is currently no bedside test that predicts the blood pressure response to catecholamines, vasopressin, or angiotensin II. Secondly, not all of these vasopressors are currently available worldwide due to either a lack of regulatory approval or cost considerations. Thirdly, there are no prospective data supporting this approach. Despite these hurdles, we feel that this is a testable hypothesis: Does time to sensitive vasopressor response improve outcomes in septic shock? We suggest this is a question worth answering and may prove an essential approach in managing these critically ill individuals.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics (e.g. home medicines and chronic disease conditions)? A decisional process to determine how to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response in order to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion, yet there is a lack of evidence as to how to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.
2) What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?
3) Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to use vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease)?
4) Which agent should be considered as second-line therapy, and does this change based upon patient characteristics?
5) What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include (but are not limited to) need for renal replacement therapy, new arrhythmias, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, digit necrosis, and quality of life. This is vital to understand since adding an adjunctive agent to reduce the dose of norepinephrine without improving survival or reducing adverse events would result in increased costs, possibly without improving patient-centric clinical outcomes.
6) When should patients receive fluid resuscitation versus vasopressor initiation versus both?
7) When should angiotensin II be initiated? Although the ATHOS-3 trial established the efficacy of angiotensin II as a vasopressor agent to raise blood pressure, important questions remain regarding angiotensin II's role in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of comparative data and potential safety concerns related to the higher rate of thromboembolism observed in clinical trials to date. Although an argument can be made for the benefits of multimodal vasopressor therapy, more outcome and comparative data are necessary both to determine if angiotensin II is clearly beneficial in subpopulations (such as potentially in patients requiring renal replacement therapy) or is potentially harmful when compared with a strategy that does not use this agent.
8) What is the role of phenylephrine, if any, in the management of sepsis?
9) What is the ideal target MAP in septic patients?
10) How do chronic comorbidities (hypertension, CKD), and baseline medications, impact both goal MAP and vasopressor response?
11) What is the cost effectiveness of different vasopressor strategies? Although cost of care has traditionally not been prioritized, it is a significant factor in the clinical environment where utility and efficiency are measured by stakeholders. Understanding that healthcare economics vary widely between countries, in an environment where healthcare costs are rapidly increasing, evaluations of vasopressors need to factor in costs.
12) How should vasopressor therapies be weaned?

### Effective hemodynamic monitoring [^114ewmZ5]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Minimizing the volume of resuscitation using vasopressors early

At the early phases of resuscitation, fluid and vasopressor administration is often required. While the classical approach suggested to initiate vasopressors after fluid completion in persistently hypotensive patients, initiating early vasopressors limits the administered fluid volume and minimizes hypotension time. In experimental septic shock, early administration of norepinephrine reduced lactate and decreased the volume of fluids required to achieve hemodynamic resuscitation. In humans with septic shock, observational data suggest that delayed vasopressor administration is associated with increased mortality. Early vasopressor use is physiologically sound in vasodilatory shock, as it reverses the vasodilation-induced shift of blood from the stressed to unstressed volume. Using a propensity matched analysis of sepsis patients, early introduction of vasopressors was associated with less fluid and improved survival, though not confirmed in another retrospective study which found that similar amounts of fluids were given in early and later vasopressor groups and the use of vasopressors early was associated with a higher mortality. Whether this association reflects more severely ill patients requiring vasopressors early or the independent impact of vasopressors is unknown. In a pilot randomized trial of sepsis with hypotension, administration of fixed dose norepinephrine (0.05 μg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹) within 1 h of hypotension resulted in less fluid administration, less cardiogenic pulmonary edema, fewer arrhythmias and a lower mortality. The CLOVERS trial comparing crystalloid liberal or vasopressors in the early resuscitation in sepsis from the PETAL network was stopped for futility, while the CLASSIC trail showed no difference in mortality between these two treatments.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^1155jewV]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of hemodynamic treatment of septic shock is fluid resuscitation followed by vasopressors where fluids alone are insufficient to achieve target blood pressure. Norepinephrine, a catecholamine, is the first-line vasopressor used worldwide but given that all routinely used catecholamines target the same adrenergic receptors, many clinicians may add a non-catecholamine vasopressor where refractory hypotension due to septic shock is present. However, the timing of this additional intervention is variable. This decision is based on three key factors: availability, familiarity, and safety profile. In our opinion, further consideration should be potential vasopressor response because following appropriate volume resuscitation, the response to different vasopressor classes is neither uniform nor predictable. Critically ill patients who are non-responders to high-dose catecholamines have a dismal outcome. Similarly, patients have a variable response to non-catecholamine agents including vasopressin and angiotensin II: but where patients exhibit a blood pressure response the outcomes are improved over non-responders. This variable responsiveness to vasopressors is similar to the clinical approach of anti-microbial sensitivity. In this commentary, the authors propose the concept of "broad spectrum vasopressors" wherein patients with septic shock are started on multiple vasopressors with a different mechanism of action simultaneously while the vasopressor sensitivity is assessed. Once the vasopressor sensitivities are assessed, then the vasopressors are 'de-escalated' accordingly. We believe that this concept may offer a new approach to the treatment of septic shock.

### Vasoplegia treatments: the past, the present, and the future [^114VN5Gy]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegia is a ubiquitous phenomenon in all advanced shock states, including septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, and anaphylactic shock. Its pathophysiology is complex, involving various mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle cells such as G protein-coupled receptor desensitization (adrenoceptors, vasopressin 1 receptors, angiotensin type 1 receptors), alteration of second messenger pathways, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, and increased production of nitric oxide. This review, based on a critical appraisal of the literature, discusses the main current treatments and future approaches. Our improved understanding of these mechanisms is progressively changing our therapeutic approach to vasoplegia from a standardized to a personalized multimodal treatment with the prescription of several vasopressors. While norepinephrine is confirmed as first line therapy for the treatment of vasoplegia, the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines also consider that the best therapeutic management of vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors could be a combination of multiple vasopressors, including norepinephrine and early prescription of vasopressin. This new approach is seemingly justified by the need to limit adrenoceptor desensitization as well as sympathetic overactivation given its subsequent deleterious impacts on hemodynamics and inflammation. Finally, based on new pathophysiological data, two potential drugs, selepressin and angiotensin II, are currently being evaluated.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^115HGXce]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shock is common and associated with mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). In the physiological state, blood pressure is maintained within normal range by the interplay of three major mechanisms: the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin system, and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. However, in patients with vasodilatory shock, these homeostatic mechanisms are disturbed. When hypotension is not resolved solely by fluid resuscitation, vasopressor agents are the cornerstone of shock management to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).

It is common among clinicians and researchers to use the dose of vasopressor agents to grade the severity of shock. Norepinephrine has been recommended as the first-line vasopressor since 2004, and the latest guidelines suggest starting vasopressin on top of norepinephrine when a target MAP is not achieved. On the other hand, many uncertainties remain in the care of shock, including how and when to start other vasopressor agents. Although new vasopressors (e.g. angiotensin II, methylene blue) have become popular in intensive care practice, there is little evidence from high-quality randomized trials and no clear recommendation in the guidelines to guide clinical decisions on when and how to initiate these new vasopressor agents so far. In addition, there are conditions where these and other vasopressors are used with or without norepinephrine, such as catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Since different vasopressors have different pharmacological characteristics and effects on hemodynamics, a calculation formula that reflects the potency of each vasopressor is frequently necessary to describe the degree of vasopressor support in a standardized manner. This is especially true when designing and conducting clinical trials.

### Role of vasopressin in the management of septic shock [^1162NcME]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Vasopressin is a potent vasopressor for improving organ perfusion during septic shock. The rationale for the use of vasopressin is its relative deficiency of plasma levels and hypersensitivity to its vasopressor effects during septic shock. Growing evidence suggests that low-dose (< 0.04 U/min) vasopressin is safe and effective for the treatment of vasodilatory shock. Although it is being used more frequently, there are no randomized clinical trials comparing vasopressin as a first-line agent to commonly used vasopressors. However, vasopressin causes arterial smooth muscle cell contraction through a non-catecholamine receptor pathway, thus it represents an attractive adjunct to the management of septic shock, especially when catecholamines are ineffective.

### Early versus delayed administration of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock [^116xJTGi]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is the most challenging problem in critical care medicine and has a very high mortality. Owing to the complex pathophysiology, the outcomes for septic shock patients remain disappointing. Rivers et al. demonstrated that early goal-directed therapy provided significant benefits with respect to outcomes for septic shock patients. However, massive fluid resuscitation may increase extravascular edema, aggravate pulmonary dysfunction and compromise tissue oxygenation. Therefore, investigating the rational use of vasopressors in septic shock is very important. Thus far, most studies have focused on the rational use of different types of vasopressors, and the third edition of the guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock also concentrates on the choice of vasopressors. However, it is the timing of vasopressor therapy, rather than the specific agent, that appears to be crucial. The current guidelines recommend that vasopressors (norepinephrine as the first choice) be administered for hypotension refractory to initial fluid resuscitation and to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg, and this should be completed within six hours. According to the guidelines, physicians currently prefer fluid resuscitation without vasopressors until a lack of hypotension correction is confirmed. However, this may result in prolonged hypotension, and valuable time may have passed. For example, some vital organs could be damaged irreversibly because of low perfusion. In addition, some researchers have argued that early initiation of norepinephrine administration, especially when hypovolemia has not been resolved, can adversely affect vital organ microcirculatory blood flow and perfusion. Hence, this retrospective study examined the relationship between delay in initial norepinephrine administration and hospital mortality and investigated the effects of early norepinephrine administration on septic shock.

### Expert statement for the management of hypovolemia in sepsis [^116R57vV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hypovolemia is frequent in patients with sepsis and may contribute to worse outcome. The management of these patients is impeded by the low quality of the evidence for many of the specific components of the care. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and controversies in this field and give expert statements for the management of hypovolemia in patients with sepsis including triggers and targets for fluid therapy and volumes and types of fluid to be given. Finally, we point to unanswered questions and suggest a roadmap for future research.

### Phenylephrine versus norepinephrine for initial hemodynamic support of patients with septic shock: a randomized, controlled trial [^1163saWt]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This is the first prospective, randomized, controlled study comparing systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine infusion in the early phase of septic shock. Our results suggest that phenylephrine – when administered as a first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock – is effective in increasing the MAP without compromising gastrointestinal and hepatosplanchnic perfusion as compared with norepinephrine.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^113FXjer]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Amongst patients with sepsis the most severely affected will be in septic shock, defined as a requirement for vasopressor therapy and a raised serum lactate. The mortality rate in this patient population is in the region of 35–40%. Although incompletely understood in terms of mechanism, patients with septic shock are at high risk for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). This syndrome accounts for almost half of all cases of AKI seen in the critically ill, and results in a further increase in mortality of up to 70%. Understanding specific risk factors for AKI, as well as possible preventative measures, is therefore of vital importance in the management of critically ill septic patients.

Vasopressors are the mainstay of vasodilatory shock management. In addition to classically used catecholamines, non-adrenergic vasopressors are commercially available that target either the vasopressin pathway or renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends intravenous crystalloid resuscitation as well as norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Where norepinephrine alone is insufficient, it is suggested that vasopressin be added as a second agent. However, the SSC describe the evidence underpinning these recommendations as high quality only when first line norepinephrine is compared to dopamine. When compared to other catecholamines and non-adrenergic vasopressors the evidence is of moderate, low or very low quality. In addition, the evidence underpinning the recommendation of vasopressin, where a second agent is required, is of moderate quality. This paucity of good quality evidence perhaps contributes to the apparent variation in standards of care relating to vasopressors. In addition, these guidelines do not fully consider cost, which can be important.

### Early norepinephrine for patients with septic shock: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^114Hm5RB]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is the most common critical condition in intensive care units, consistently associated with high mortality rates. Treatment is based on rapid correction of relative and sometimes absolute hypovolemia by fluid resuscitation. A vasopressor is added if the hemodynamic state is not corrected by correction of the hypovolemic component of acute corticosteroid insufficiency. Norepinephrine is a potent α₁ and β₁ adrenergic receptors agonist, which results in improved cardiac contractility, arterial and venous vasoconstriction and a rapid increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Norepinephrine is the preferred first-line vasopressor agent.

However, the optimal timing for initiating vasopressor therapy during the resuscitative process remains a subject of debate. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign does not specifically address when norepinephrine should be started in relation to correcting the hypovolemic component of septic shock, although it is suggested that it be started early in cases of life-threatening hypotension. Early administration of norepinephrine may restore arterial pressure more rapidly than fluid resuscitation alone, it may increase cardiac preload by recruiting some unstressed blood volume, and also recruit some cardiac contractility. Nevertheless, starting norepinephrine before the hypovolemic part of septic shock has been corrected may induce excessive vasoconstriction and induce tissue ischemia. Moreover, initiating norepinephrine earlier may increase the time of exposure to catecholamines and total dosage administered, the latter being possibly associated with poor prognosis.

To settle the debate, few studies only are currently available. Some of these have been previously reviewed and meta-analyzed in the journal, but some were more recently published. Thus, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the timing of norepinephrine administration in patients with septic shock.

SUMMARY

This report expands on clinical concepts outlined in "Fluid Resuscitation and Vasopressor Therapy", previously identified as priorities by the SSC Research Committee. The authors aimed to provide clinicians and researchers with a detailed and informative summary of pressing questions that require investigation in the realms of fluid resuscitation strategies and vasopressor administration. Optimal approaches to fluid resuscitation and application of vasopressor therapies have evolved over the past decade as knowledge accumulates in the field, necessitating iterations to previous questions. In a domain of sepsis research as ripe as shock treatment, we hope that this review serves as a roadmap for future trials in the field of septic shock treatment.

### A global perspective on vasoactive agents in shock [^111mCpqr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We set out to summarize the current knowledge on vasoactive drugs and their use in the management of shock to inform physicians' practices.

Methods

This is a narrative review by a multidisciplinary, multinational-from six continents-panel of experts including physicians, a pharmacist, trialists, and scientists.

Results and Conclusions

Vasoactive drugs are an essential part of shock management. Catecholamines are the most commonly used vasoactive agents in the intensive care unit, and among them norepinephrine is the first-line therapy in most clinical conditions. Inotropes are indicated when myocardial function is depressed and dobutamine remains the first-line therapy. Vasoactive drugs have a narrow therapeutic spectrum and expose the patients to potentially lethal complications. Thus, these agents require precise therapeutic targets, close monitoring with titration to the minimal efficacious dose and should be weaned as promptly as possible. Moreover, the use of vasoactive drugs in shock requires an individualized approach. Vasopressin and possibly angiotensin II may be useful owing to their norepinephrine-sparing effects.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^116Pcsok]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

During septic shock, vasopressor infusion is usually started only after having corrected the hypovolaemic component of circulatory failure, even in the most severe patients. However, earlier administration of norepinephrine, simultaneously with fluid resuscitation, should be considered in some cases. Duration and depth of hypotension strongly worsen outcomes in septic shock patients. However, the response of arterial pressure to volume expansion is inconstant, delayed, and transitory. In the case of profound, life-threatening hypotension, relying only on fluids to restore blood pressure may unduly prolong hypotension and organ hypoperfusion. Conversely, norepinephrine rapidly increases and better stabilizes arterial pressure. By binding venous adrenergic receptors, it transforms part of the unstressed blood volume into stressed blood volume. It increases the mean systemic filling pressure and increases the fluid-induced increase in mean systemic filling pressure, as observed in septic shock patients. This may improve end-organ perfusion, as shown by some animal studies. Two observational studies comparing early vs. later administration of norepinephrine in septic shock patients using a propensity score showed that early administration reduced the administered fluid volume and day-28 mortality. Conversely, in another propensity score-based study, norepinephrine administration within the first hour following shock diagnosis increased day-28 mortality. The only randomized controlled study that compared the early administration of norepinephrine alone to a placebo showed that the early continuous administration of norepinephrine at a fixed dose of 0.05 µg/kg/min, with norepinephrine added in open label, showed that shock control was achieved more often than in the placebo group. The choice of starting norepinephrine administration early should be adapted to the patient's condition. Logically, it should first be addressed to patients with profound hypotension, when the arterial tone is very low, as suggested by a low diastolic blood pressure (e.g. ≤ 40 mmHg), or by a high diastolic shock index (heart rate/diastolic blood pressure) (e.g. ≥ 3). Early administration of norepinephrine should also be considered in patients in whom fluid accumulation is likely to occur or in whom fluid accumulation would be particularly deleterious (in case of acute respiratory distress syndrome or intra-abdominal hypertension for example).

Question 3: What Is the Optimal Approach to Selection, Dose Titration, and Escalation of Vasopressor Therapy?

What is known.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is determined, in part, by signaling through pharmacologically distinct families of receptors. Vasopressor agents are currently available that work by altering signaling via catecholamines, vasopressin receptors, and the renin/angiotensin system.

Norepinephrine is recommended as a first-line vasopressor agent for the treatment of septic shock. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials reported that norepinephrine use resulted in lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and decreased risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine. Survey studies of intensivists reflect preferences for norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor agent, reflecting clinician agreement with guideline recommendations.

In studies of vasopressin as both an adjunctive treatment and as a first-line therapy, results have been mixed. Although vasopressin did not alter mortality when added to norepinephrine, in a finding contrary to an a priori hypothesis, a subset demonstrated a potential and unexpected survival benefit in patients with less severe septic shock (norepinephrine < 15 µg/min). However, a subsequent study failed to confirm any survival benefit with vasopressin therapy although a reduced need for renal replacement therapy compared with norepinephrine was noted. A consistent norepinephrine-sparing effect has been observed with vasopressin in doses of 0.01–0.03 U/min, leading to its recommendation as an adjunctive therapy.

More recently, angiotensin II was compared with placebo in a randomized controlled trial of 321 patients with vasodilatory shock requiring greater than 0.2 µg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Angiotensin II was effective in achieving the primary endpoint for the study by increasing the MAP by greater than 10 mm Hg or pressure greater than 75 mm Hg. However, no difference was observed in the secondary endpoint of survival. A subsequent subgroup analysis of this trial demonstrated improved survival in 105 patients requiring renal replacement therapy at the time of randomization to angiotensin II, although this finding needs to be further investigated in a prospective, randomized trial.

### Timing of vasopressin addition to norepinephrine and efficacy outcomes in patients with septic shock [^114WnhB5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor in septic shock followed by addition of vasopressin to achieve a goal mean arterial pressure. Limited evidence exists evaluating how the timing of vasopressin addition affects clinical outcomes in septic shock.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether the timing of the addition of vasopressin to norepinephrine affects shock resolution.

Methods

This was a multi-site, single system, retrospective cohort, institutional review board (IRB)-approved study examining adult patients with septic shock who received norepinephrine and vasopressin. Patients were divided and statistically analyzed in two subgroups: early vasopressin addition (< 3 hours) and late vasopressin addition (≥ 3 hours). The primary outcome was time to shock resolution, defined as vasopressor free for at least 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included norepinephrine dose at 3 hours after initiation of vasopressin, in-hospital mortality, and intensive care unit length of stay.

Results

A total of 243 patients were included in this study. A statistically significant decrease in time to shock resolution was observed in the early vasopressin addition group compared to the late vasopressin addition group (37.6 hours vs 60.7 hours; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.07 [1.48–2.89; P = < 0.001]). The early addition of vasopressin did not affect norepinephrine dose or in-hospital mortality but did lead to a decreased intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (4.3 days vs 5.3 days, P = 0.02).

Conclusion and Relevance

Addition of vasopressin to norepinephrine within 3 hours was associated with a faster time to shock resolution. These findings suggest a potential for improved clinical outcomes with earlier vasopressin addition.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^112uWBTn]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors and fluids are the cornerstones for the treatment of shock. The current international guidelines on shock recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor and vasopressin as the second-line vasopressor. In clinical practice, due to drug availability, local practice variations, special settings, and ongoing research, several alternative vasoconstrictors and adjuncts are used in the absence of precise equivalent doses. Norepinephrine equivalence (NEE) is frequently used in clinical trials to overcome this heterogeneity and describe vasopressor support in a standardized manner. NEE quantifies the total amount of vasopressors, considering the potency of each such agent, which typically includes catecholamines, derivatives, and vasopressin. Intensive care studies use NEE as an eligibility criterion and also an outcome measure. On the other hand, NEE has several pitfalls which clinicians should know, important the lack of conversion of novel vasopressors such as angiotensin II and also adjuncts such as methylene blue, including a lack of high-quality data to support the equation and validate its predictive performance in all types of critical care practice. This review describes the history of NEE and suggests an updated formula incorporating novel vasopressors and adjuncts.

### Vasopressors for hypotensive shock [^111vp1sH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Initial goal-directed resuscitation for hypotensive shock usually includes administration of intravenous fluids, followed by initiation of vasopressors. Despite obvious immediate effects of vasopressors on haemodynamics, their effect on patient-relevant outcomes remains controversial. This review was published originally in 2004 and was updated in 2011 and again in 2016.

Objectives

Our objective was to compare the effect of one vasopressor regimen (vasopressor alone, or in combination) versus another vasopressor regimen on mortality in critically ill participants with shock. We further aimed to investigate effects on other patient-relevant outcomes and to assess the influence of bias on the robustness of our effect estimates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015 Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS and PsycINFO (from inception to June 2015). We performed the original search in November 2003. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries to identify ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing various vasopressor regimens for hypotensive shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors abstracted data independently. They discussed disagreements between them and resolved differences by consulting with a third review author. We used a random-effects model to combine quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified 28 RCTs (3497 participants) with 1773 mortality outcomes. Six different vasopressors, given alone or in combination, were studied in 12 different comparisons. All 28 studies reported mortality outcomes; 12 studies reported length of stay. Investigators reported other morbidity outcomes in a variable and heterogeneous way. No data were available on quality of life nor on anxiety and depression outcomes. We classified 11 studies as having low risk of bias for the primary outcome of mortality; only four studies fulfilled all trial quality criteria. In summary, researchers reported no differences in total mortality in any comparisons of different vasopressors or combinations in any of the pre-defined analyses (evidence quality ranging from high to very low). More arrhythmias were observed in participants treated with dopamine than in those treated with norepinephrine (high-quality evidence). These findings were consistent among the few large studies and among studies with different levels of within-study bias risk.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of substantial differences in total mortality between several vasopressors. Dopamine increases the risk of arrhythmia compared with norepinephrine and might increase mortality. Otherwise, evidence of any other differences between any of the six vasopressors examined is insufficient. We identified low risk of bias and high-quality evidence for the comparison of norepinephrine versus dopamine and moderate to very low-quality evidence for all other comparisons, mainly because single comparisons occasionally were based on only a few participants. Increasing evidence indicates that the treatment goals most often employed are of limited clinical value. Our findings suggest that major changes in clinical practice are not needed, but that selection of vasopressors could be better individualised and could be based on clinical variables reflecting hypoperfusion.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116JnXM9]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

Septic shock vasopressor selection — first-line norepinephrine and adjunct vasopressin: Considering cost and availability, the panel "have issued a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as first line agent instead of vasopressin", and, for combination therapy, they "issue a weak recommendation for adding vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine". Recognizing access variability, the panel notes that "availability of, and experience with, norepinephrine may vary", and if norepinephrine is unavailable, "either dopamine or epinephrine can be used with special attention given to the risk of arrhythmias".

### Understanding how clinicians personalize fluid and vasopressor decisions in early sepsis management [^1143pY2b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for up to 1 in every 2 hospital deaths in the US. Patients who develop sepsis-induced hypotension are typically treated using intravenous (IV) fluids, with vasopressors reserved for refractory hypotension and shock. Traditional recommendations to administer vasopressors via central venous access have also historically limited how quickly vasopressors can be started. Because central lines take time to place, clinicians often rely on fluids to support blood pressure during central line placement. However, there has been recent concern that aggressive fluid resuscitation and fluid overload may increase organ failure and mortality in patients with sepsis. Concurrently, emerging data have demonstrated that administering vasopressors through peripheral IVs (PIVs) is safe, which may help facilitate earlier vasopressor initiation. As a result, there has been increasing interest in restricting fluid volumes and starting vasopressors earlier.

To date, clinical trials comparing fluid-restrictive, early vasopressor treatment vs fluid-liberal strategies in patients with sepsis have yielded neutral results. However, these trials have used generalized protocols and broad clinical criteria, rather than personalized approaches, to guide resuscitation. Little is known about how clinicians make decisions about fluid and vasopressor administration in practice. Understanding existing resuscitation approaches and how clinicians personalize resuscitation decisions is important to informing future clinical trials aimed at optimizing sepsis resuscitation.

In this study, we sought to determine clinical factors associated with clinician decisions about fluid administration, vasopressor initiation, and vasopressor route in early sepsis using a randomized vignette survey method. This survey design has been demonstrated to elicit preferences and predict behavior, providing insight into clinician decision-making.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^112pNbmR]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II work through different pathways, there are multiple agents that can impact the sympathetic system via altering levels of alpha and beta selectivity. Depending on the clinical scenario, additional stimulation or alpha or beta receptors could have potentially beneficial or deleterious effects. In this context, epinephrine is suggested as an additive agent to raise MAP and reduces the dose of norepinephrine in cases of refractory shock. Although it is effective in raising MAP, epinephrine is not recommended as a first-line agent since clinical trials demonstrate a lack of a mortality benefit, supported further by a meta-analysis of vasopressor trials. Of note, epinephrine may increase lactate production via its activity on skeletal β₂ receptors, complicating the interpretation of lactate clearance and evaluating perfusion. Phenylephrine represents a complementary vasopressor that could be used. Given its selective α₁ agonist activity, the pharmacology of phenylephrine may appear attractive in a high output hypotensive state; however, this agent has the potential to cause splanchnic vasoconstriction. Notably, in a recent analysis of the effects of a nationwide shortage of norepinephrine, phenylephrine was the most commonly substituted vasopressor and was associated with increased mortality. Although correlation is not equivalent to causation, this is not supportive of earlier usage of phenylephrine. Further, dopamine works not only through dopamine receptors at lower doses but also signals through alpha receptors at higher doses. In a randomized trial comparing norepinephrine to dopamine, mortality outcomes were similar with both drugs; however, dopamine was associated with a higher occurrence of arrhythmias, which limits its utility if other agents are available. In addition, the rising cost of available vasopressors challenges their application in clinical care. In an environment where there are concerns due to the rising cost of healthcare and an increasing emphasis on value, the cost of vasopressor drugs is under scrutiny in order to justify use.

### Early administration of norepinephrine increases cardiac preload and cardiac output in septic patients with life-threatening hypotension [^115hDcwm]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

International recommendations have placed either norepinephrine or dopamine as a first-line vasopressor during septic shock. Norepinephrine is considered more potent and induces fewer adverse effects than dopamine. However, the effects of norepinephrine on cardiac output and heart function of sepsis patients are uncertain. Norepinephrine can increase cardiac output through several mechanisms: (a) improvement of the left ventricular function explained by two effects: direct β₁-agonist inotropic effect and α-agonist-mediated restoration of diastolic arterial pressure that represents the driving pressure for coronary perfusion of the left heart; (b) increase in cardiac preload secondary to the α-agonist-mediated decrease in systemic venous capacitance. Conversely, norepinephrine could decrease cardiac output owing to an increase in left ventricular afterload. This latter effect is assumed to be significant if the left ventricular function is already impaired or if an excessive mean arterial pressure (MAP) is targeted, or both. Variable results were reported in studies examining the effects of norepinephrine on cardiac output in septic-shock patients. This variability can be ascribed to differences in the underlying cardiac function, or the level of MAP actually achieved, or the degree of prior preload optimization or a combination of these. In most previous studies, the cardiac output was not altered by norepinephrine, but the drug was administered under conditions of a hyperdynamic state, generally after abundant fluid administration. Because of the recent emphasis on urgent and aggressive resuscitation as a key issue in the management of septic shock, current international guidelines recommend to administer a vasopressor early to sustain life and maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension, even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. We hypothesized that under such conditions, norepinephrine is capable of increasing cardiac output through an increase in cardiac preload. We aimed at checking this hypothesis in an observational study performed in a series of septic-shock patients who early received norepinephrine to maintain perfusion in the face of life-threatening hypotension. We paid particular attention to patients with prior left ventricular dysfunction and particularly when a high MAP value was achieved.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^114SozyA]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Crystalloid-based fluid resuscitation has long been a cornerstone in the initial management of trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock. However, its benefit is increasingly questioned as it is suspected to increase bleeding and worsen coagulopathy. The emergence of alternative strategies like permissive hypotension and vasopressor use lead to a shift in early trauma care practices. Critical appraisal of current evidence is necessary to guide clinicians and outline research perspectives.

Main Text

Current guidelines for managing trauma-induced hemorrhagic shock suggest titrating fluids and using vasopressors to achieve minimal blood pressure targets until hemorrhage is controlled. In case of traumatic brain injury with severe hemorrhage, blood pressure target increases. The scientific literature supporting these recommendations is limited, and several aspects remain the subject of ongoing scientific debate. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing evidence on low-volume fluid resuscitation during the first hours of trauma management, with an emphasis on its integration with permissive hypotension, vasopressor use and cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury. The review also highlights the limitations of current guidelines, particularly the lack of robust evidence supporting specific type of fluid, volumes and administration protocols tailored to specific trauma scenarios and populations. Emerging technologies such as point-of-care diagnostics, integrated monitoring systems, and machine learning hold promise for enhancing clinical decision-making in trauma care. These innovations could play a crucial role, ultimately helping clinicians address critical unanswered questions in trauma management and improve patient survival.

Conclusions

Crystalloid-based resuscitation remains relevant in early trauma care, but its application must be reassessed considering recent evidence and evolving practices. Further research is essential to refine fluid resuscitation guidelines, particularly in defining safe fluid volumes and the role of vasopressors. The integration of advanced monitoring technologies may offer new opportunities to optimize trauma care and improve outcomes.

### Vasopressors for shock [^113t7xFz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Besides reversing the underlying cause, the first line treatment for the symptoms of shock is usually the administration of intravenous fluids. If this method is not successful, vasopressors such as dopamine, dobutamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline and vasopressin are recommended. It is unclear if there is a vasopressor of choice, either for the treatment of particular forms of shock or for the treatment of shock in general.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of vasopressors for circulatory shock in critically ill patients. Our main aim was to assess whether particular vasopressors reduce overall mortality. We also intended to identify whether the choice of vasopressor influences outcomes such as length-of-stay in the intensive care unit and health-related quality of life.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and PsychINFO:all from inception to November 2003; for randomized controlled trials. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing various vasopressors, vasopressors with placebo or vasopressors with intravenous fluids for the treatment of any kind of circulatory failure (shock). Mortality was the main outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Disagreement between two reviewers was discussed and resolved with a third reviewer. We used random effects models for combining quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified eight randomized controlled trials. Reporting of methodological details was for many items not satisfactory: only two studies reported allocation concealment, and two that the outcome assessor was blind to the intervention. Two studies compared norepinephrine plus dobutamine with epinephrine alone in patients with septic shock (52 patients, relative risk of death 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.67). Three studies compared norepinephrine with dopamine in patients with septic shock (62 patients, relative risk 0.88, 0.57 to 1.36). Two studies compared vasopressin with placebo in patients with septic shock (58 patients, relative risk 1.04, 0.06 to 19.33). One study compared terlipressin with norepinephrine in patients with refractory hypotension after general anaesthesia but there were no deaths (20 patients).

Reviewers' Conclusions

The current available evidence is not suited to inform clinical practice. We were unable to determine whether a particular vasopressor is superior to other agents in the treatment of states of shock.

### Vasopressors for hypotensive shock [^116eY4La]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Initial goal directed resuscitation for shock usually includes the administration of intravenous fluids, followed by initiating vasopressors. Despite obvious immediate effects of vasopressors on haemodynamics their effect on patient relevant outcomes remains controversial. This review was originally published in 2004 and was updated in 2011.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to assess whether particular vasopressors reduce overall mortality, morbidity, and health-related quality of life.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and PsycINFO (from inception to March 2010). The original search was performed in November 2003. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing various vasopressor regimens for hypotensive shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors abstracted data independently. Disagreement between the authors was discussed and resolved with a third author. We used a random-effects model for combining quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified 23 randomized controlled trials involving 3212 patients, with 1629 mortality outcomes. Six different vasopressors, alone or in combination, were studied in 11 different comparisons. All 23 studies reported mortality outcomes; length of stay was reported in nine studies. Other morbidity outcomes were reported in a variable and heterogeneous way. No data were available on quality of life or anxiety and depression outcomes. We classified 10 studies as being at low risk of bias for the primary outcome mortality; only four studies fulfilled all trial quality items. In summary, there was no difference in mortality in any of the comparisons between different vasopressors or combinations. More arrhythmias were observed in patients treated with dopamine compared to norepinephrine. Norepinephrine versus dopamine, as the largest comparison in 1400 patients from six trials, yielded almost equivalence (RR 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.03). Vasopressors used as add-on therapy in comparison to placebo were not effective either. These findings were consistent among the few large studies as well as in studies with different levels of within-study bias risk.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence of no difference in mortality between norepinephrine and dopamine. Dopamine appeared to increase the risk for arrhythmia. There is not sufficient evidence of any difference between any of the six vasopressors examined. Probably the choice of vasopressors in patients with shock does not influence the outcome, rather than any vasoactive effect per se. There is not sufficient evidence that any one of the investigated vasopressors is clearly superior over others.

### Norepinephrine for early shock control in sepsis [^114Ux4vh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

There is clear need for a large, randomized trial to demonstrate the clinical significance of initiating vasopressors alongside or earlier during volume resuscitation before an argument can be made to change current practices. However, the CENSER (Early Use of Norepinephrine in Septic Shock Resuscitation) trial not only demonstrates proof of concept that early norepinephrine use leads to faster MAP control but also provides insights into the pharmacokinetic nature of this effect and its implications for the extremes of patient care.

### How we escalate vasopressor and corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock [^113z1ks1]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is defined by the need for vasopressor agents to correct hypotension and lactic acidosis resulting from infection, with 30%-40% case fatality rates. The care of patients with worsening septic shock involves multiple treatment decisions involving vasopressor choices and adjunctive treatments. In this edition of "How I Do It", we provide a case-based discussion of common clinical decisions regarding choice of first-line vasopressor, BP targets, route of vasopressor delivery, use of secondary vasopressors, and adjunctive medications. We also consider diagnostic approaches, treatment, and monitoring strategies for the patient with worsening shock, as well as approaches to difficult weaning of vasopressors.

### Early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock: current evidence and future directions [^117RRzT1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The optimal timing of vasopressors relative to fluid infusion remains more controversial. Recently, a large multi-center observational study was undertaken in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia to address this question. In a retrospective analysis of 2,849 patients with septic shock, investigators found that mortality was lowest when vasopressors were delayed by 1 hour and infused from hours 1 to 6 following onset of shock. These findings are consistent with those of other retrospective cohort studies that support the early initiation of vasopressors. This approach may decrease the volume of fluids necessary to maintain blood pressure. Indeed, patients in the recent ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe trials were more likely to receive vasopressors and required less fluids than patients in the original study by Rivers and colleagues (Table 2). Still, prospective randomized trials are needed to elucidate the optimal timing of vasopressors and volume of fluids during initial resuscitation.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113KRqXV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc₂). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### Best vasopressor for advanced vasodilatory shock: should vasopressin be part of the mix? [^114gRdYU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, a number of additional and highly relevant studies have been published addressing the issue of vasopressor use during septic shock. While these new results are provocative, none of the studies are definitive. In sum, they suggest that maybe we should not be thinking of one vasopressor versus another in a winner-takes-all sense. Rather, we should be looking for the best balance of vasopressor agents and, further, the choice likely depends on clinical context. Clinical context may drive the choice of adrenergic agonist; for example, norepinephrine may be superior to dopamine when the potential for arrhythmias is of concern. Norepinephrine may be superior to epinephrine if elevated lactate associated with epinephrine use confounds the clinical picture. The Vasopressin and Septic Shock Trial (VASST) identified an effective dose of arginine vasopressin (AVP) when adrenergic agonist doses are low, but higher doses of AVP may be appropriate in the context of very high adrenergic agonist doses. The effect may be a direct beneficial AVP effect or indirect sparing of adrenergic agonist use. The choice to add AVP may also be influenced by the clinical context, including renal function or the concomitant use of corticosteroids. These interim conclusions, in truth, are hypotheses warranting randomized controlled trials adequately powered to test for survival differences in these severely ill patients.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^11688QRk]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor in patients with septic shock. For many years, there has been growing evidence that high doses of norepinephrine might have cardiac and immunological adverse effects and be associated with poorer outcomes. Current SSC guidelines therefore suggest adding vasopressin, a non-catecholaminergic vasopressor, as a second-line vasopressor rather than increasing the norepinephrine dose in patients requiring doses of norepinephrine base > 0.25–0.50 µg/kg/min, after excluding persistent hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. Vasopressin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction through its specific receptor, the arginine vasopressin receptor V1. Up to one-third of patients with septic shock may have vasopressin deficiency, which contributes to refractory septic shock. Vasopressin use is associated with a norepinephrine-sparing effect, which may in turn reduce the complications induced by high-doses of norepinephrine, by decreasing the vasopressor load: this is the concept of decatecholaminization. Nevertheless, the use of vasopressin in patients with septic shock has not yet demonstrated clear benefits in terms of patient outcomes, such as less cardiotoxicity, reduced use of renal replacement therapy or decreased mortality. The heterogeneity in the use of vasopressin and the definition of early vasopressin administration between different studies as well as many unresolved issues regarding the use of vasopressin in patients with septic shock could explain the absence of clear and relevant clinical benefits. Thus, the identification of subgroups of patients likely to benefit the most from vasopressin, the management of vasopressin administration (time to initiation, optimal doses, weaning strategy) and a better understanding of the interactions between vasopressin and corticosteroids represent major areas of research for future studies.

Shock management — vasopressor selection: With regard to vasopressor support in patients with shock, dopamine is associated with an increased rate of complications in patients with septic and cardiogenic shock compared to norepinephrine, and norepinephrine should be used as a first-line agent over dopamine unless there are specific contraindications to the use of norepinephrine.

### Choice of vasopressor in septic shock: does it matter? [^114bHW5Z]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Septic shock is a medical emergency that is associated with mortality rates of 40–70%. Prompt recognition and institution of effective therapy is required for optimal outcome. When the shock state persists after adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy is required to improve and maintain adequate tissue/organ perfusion in an attempt to improve survival and prevent the development of multiple organ dysfunction and failure. Controversy surrounding the optimum choice of vasopressor strategy to utilize in the management of patients with septic shock continues. A recent randomized study of epinephrine compared to norepinephrine (plus dobutamine when indicated) leads to more questions than answers.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^114wV993]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Vasopressor therapy is fundamental to the management of septic shock, and this condition is commonly complicated by AKI. Individual and classes of vasopressors have differing pharmacodynamic effects on the renal vasculature and perfusion. However, vasopressor studies reporting renal outcomes in this patient population yield limited and heterogeneous data. This results in a paucity of evidence for an effect of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes. Future researchers should focus not only on large, appropriately powered, RCTs of vasopressor effect on standardised renal outcomes, but also on smaller, more targeted trials where specific or enhanced sub-populations of septic shock patients are given specific vasopressors at particular doses and their renal outcomes explored.

### Phenylephrine versus norepinephrine for initial hemodynamic support of patients with septic shock: a randomized, controlled trial [^116Je53y]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- There are no differences between norepinephrine and phenylephrine in terms of systemic hemodynamics when they are administered as a first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock.

- Phenylephrine is less effective than norepinephrine to counteract sepsis-related arterial hypotension.

- Phenylephrine does not impair gastrointestinal mucosal perfusion.

- Delayed administration of phenylephrine in septic shock patients causes a more pronounced hepatosplanchnic vasoconstriction as compared with norepinephrine.

- Phenylephrine – when administered as a first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock – is effective for increasing the MAP without compromising gastrointestinal and hepatosplanchnic perfusion, as compared with norepinephrine administration.

### Challenging the rationale of routine vasopressor therapy for management of hypotension [^116ybJFk]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is persuasive evidence, including the present report by Dubin and colleagues, of a dissociation between increases in arterial pressure produced by vasopressor agents and improvement in microvascular perfusion and delivery of vital substrates. Especially in settings of septic shock, the current routine administration of adrenergic vasopressor therapy therefore may fail to reverse the primary defect.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^116pRiFn]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock — vasopressor initiation and escalation (SSC): Vasopressin is typically used at a fixed dose of 0.03 units per minute, and a systematic review of 10 RCTs by the SSC found reduced mortality when vasopressin was combined with norepinephrine versus norepinephrine alone (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99) with no difference in risks of digital ischemia or arrhythmias. A new weak recommendation from the SSC suggests that for adults with septic shock, vasopressors should be started by peripheral intravenous access to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured, and there is a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as the first-line agent. Alternatives to norepinephrine, if not available, include epinephrine or dopamine; if MAP levels remain inadequate despite norepinephrine, it is suggested to add vasopressin rather than escalating the dose of norepinephrine, and if MAP levels remain inadequate despite norepinephrine and vasopressin, it is suggested to add epinephrine. For septic shock with cardiac dysfunction and persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, the SSC suggests adding either dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone, while a new weak recommendation suggests against using levosimendan.

### Are crystalloid-based fluid expansion strategies still relevant in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock? [^113TV9Ww]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite major growth and improvements in trauma systems, circulatory shock remains a leading cause of trauma deaths worldwide. The highest mortality rates in severe hemorrhage have been observed in the first hours following trauma giving prehospital care a significant role. By decreasing intravascular blood volume, severe hemorrhage can lead to a state of shock defined as inadequate tissue perfusion due to decreased cardiac output. Aimed at restoring intravascular volume and therefore cardiac output, fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of prehospital trauma care. Its clinical benefit remains however insufficiently characterized and documented harm stems from excessive fluid resuscitation. Indeed, aggressive fluid resuscitation has been suspected of exacerbating acute bleeding by increasing hydrostatic pressure and decreasing clot firmness. Permissive hypotension based on maintaining blood pressure at lower-than-normal levels to ensure minimal organ perfusion emerged to address such concerns. Restrictive fluid expansion strategies combined with vasopressor use could represent an alternative.

Current recommendations suggest for traumatic hemorrhagic shock without severe head injury, to titrate fluids and use vasopressors to maintain permissive hypotension (target systolic blood pressure 80–90 mmHg) until hemorrhage control. If traumatic brain injury is associated to severe hemorrhage, guidelines recommend targeting a systolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg. Isotonic crystalloid solutions are recommended as first line for fluid expansion. The level of evidence for these recommendations is however weak and several aspects remain a matter of scientific controversy. The aim of this perspective is to review the available evidence on low volume fluid resuscitation in the first six hours of trauma management and its articulation with permissive hypotension, vasopressor use and cerebral perfusion pressure in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although they represent exciting alternatives, this review will not address the use of blood products. Further evidence is required to establish their benefit or harm in early trauma resuscitation. Blood products are also not immediately available in all systems, and in consequence fluids remain a first line treatment. This perspective will focus on the evidence and rationale of crystalloid fluids in humans in the first hours of trauma induced hemorrhagic shock. A structured search of literature was conducted and restricted to human studies only. The supplementary material details the search and selection strategy.

### Vasopressors in trauma: a never event? [^117Rp3Ug]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Vasopressor use in severely injured trauma patients is discouraged due to concerns that vasoconstriction will worsen organ perfusion and result in increased mortality and organ failure in hypotensive trauma patients. Hypotensive resuscitation is advocated based on limited data that lower systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure will result in improved mortality. It is classically taught that hypotension and hypovolemia in trauma are associated with peripheral vasoconstriction. However, the pathophysiology of traumatic shock is complex and involves multiple neurohormonal interactions that are ultimately manifested by an initial sympathoexcitatory phase that attempts to compensate for acute blood loss and is characterized by vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and preserved mean arterial blood pressure. The subsequent hypotension observed in hemorrhagic shock reflects a sympathoinhibitory vasodilation phase. The objectives of hemodynamic resuscitation in hypotensive trauma patients are restoring adequate intravascular volume with a balanced ratio of blood products, correcting pathologic coagulopathy, and maintaining organ perfusion. Persistent hypotension and hypoperfusion are associated with worse coagulopathy and organ function. The practice of hypotensive resuscitation would appear counterintuitive to the goals of traumatic shock resuscitation and is not supported by consistent clinical data. In addition, excessive volume resuscitation is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, in the resuscitation of traumatic shock, it is necessary to target an appropriate balance with intravascular volume and vascular tone. It would appear logical that vasopressors may be useful in traumatic shock resuscitation to counteract vasodilation in hemorrhage as well as other clinical conditions such as traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and vasodilation of general anesthetics. The purpose of this article is to discuss the controversy of vasopressors in hypotensive trauma patients and advocate for a nuanced approach to vasopressor administration in the resuscitation of traumatic shock.

### Effects of fluid resuscitation with colloids vs crystalloids on mortality in critically ill patients presenting with hypovolemic shock: the CRISTAL randomized trial [^116gRQoq]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Evidence supporting the choice of intravenous colloid vs crystalloid solutions for management of hypovolemic shock remains unclear.

Objective

To test whether use of colloids compared with crystalloids for fluid resuscitation alters mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypovolemic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, randomized clinical trial stratified by case mix (sepsis, trauma, or hypovolemic shock without sepsis or trauma). Therapy in the Colloids Versus Crystalloids for the Resuscitation of the Critically Ill (CRISTAL) trial was open label but outcome assessment was blinded to treatment assignment. Recruitment began in February 2003 and ended in August 2012 of 2857 sequential ICU patients treated at 57 ICUs in France, Belgium, North Africa, and Canada; follow-up ended in November 2012.

Interventions

Colloids (n = 1414; gelatins, dextrans, hydroxyethyl starches, or 4% or 20% of albumin) or crystalloids (n = 1443; isotonic or hypertonic saline or Ringer lactate solution) for all fluid interventions other than fluid maintenance throughout the ICU stay.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was death within 28 days. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality; and days alive and not receiving renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor therapy.

Results

Within 28 days, there were 359 deaths (25.4%) in colloids group vs 390 deaths (27.0%) in crystalloids group (relative risk [RR], 0.96 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.04]; p = 0.26). Within 90 days, there were 434 deaths (30.7%) in colloids group vs 493 deaths (34.2%) in crystalloids group (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]; p = 0.03). Renal replacement therapy was used in 156 (11.0%) in colloids group vs 181 (12.5%) in crystalloids group (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.03]; p = 0.19). There were more days alive without mechanical ventilation in the colloids group vs the crystalloids group by 7 days (mean: 2.1 vs 1.8 days, respectively; mean difference, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.48] days; p = 0.01) and by 28 days (mean: 14.6 vs 13.5 days; mean difference, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.14 to 2.06] days; p = 0.01) and alive without vasopressor therapy by 7 days (mean: 5.0 vs 4.7 days; mean difference, 0.30 [95% CI, -0.03 to 0.50] days; p = 0.04) and by 28 days (mean: 16.2 vs 15.2 days; mean difference, 1.04 [95% CI, -0.04 to 2.10] days; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ICU patients with hypovolemia, the use of colloids vs crystalloids did not result in a significant difference in 28-day mortality. Although 90-day mortality was lower among patients receiving colloids, this finding should be considered exploratory and requires further study before reaching conclusions about efficacy.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^111FndTD]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid and vasopressor management in septic shock remains controversial. In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of dynamic measures (stroke volume change during passive leg raise) to guide resuscitation and improve patient outcome.

Research Question

Will resuscitation that is guided by dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock improve patient outcomes?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 13 hospitals in the United States and United Kingdom. Patients presented to EDs with sepsis that was associated hypotension and anticipated ICU admission. Intervention arm patients were assessed for fluid responsiveness before clinically driven fluid bolus or increase in vasopressors occurred. The protocol included reassessment and therapy as indicated by the passive leg raise result. The control arm received usual care. The primary clinical outcome was positive fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge, whichever occurred first.

Results

In modified intent-to-treat analysis that included 83 intervention and 41 usual care eligible patients, fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge was significantly lower (-1.37 L favoring the intervention arm; 0.65 ± 2.85 L intervention arm vs 2.02 ± 3.44 L usual care arm; p = 0.021. Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy (5.1% vs 17.5%; p = 0.04) or mechanical ventilation (17.7% vs 34.1%; p = 0.04) in the intervention arm compared with usual care. In the all-randomized intent-to-treat population (102 intervention, 48 usual care), there were no significant differences in safety signals.

Interpretation

Physiologically informed fluid and vasopressor resuscitation with the use of the passive leg raise-induced stroke volume change to guide management of septic shock is safe and demonstrated lower net fluid balance and reductions in the risk of renal and respiratory failure. Dynamic assessments to guide fluid administration may improve outcomes for patients with septic shock compared with usual care.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^114KwXEg]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cardiogenic shock, more specifically with respect to vasopressors, ESC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering a vasopressor, preferably norepinephrine, to increase BP and vital organ perfusion in patients with cardiogenic shock.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^114hYn3R]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified ten individual guidelines which might be used by clinicians to guide fluid therapy in sepsis in LIC. The contents of recommendations demonstrate a general shift over time in evidence and practice in a number of ways: (1) crystalloid superiority over colloid; (2) lower initial volumes accompanied by dynamic monitoring of response; (3) shift away from CVP and SvO 2 monitoring as a proxy target for treatment, towards the dynamic assessment of markers of tissue perfusion and end-organ damage; (4) the use of a breadth of clinical signs and markers of end-organ damage to promote treatment escalation; and (5) robust superiority evidence for norepinephrine as first-line pressor in septic shock.

The performance of guidelines against AGREE II criteria varied widely, with overall average scores ranging from 34.8 to 83.0%. Most guidelines performed well in terms of specifically defining their objectives and target population and providing a clear and unambiguous presentation of their final recommendations. Stakeholder involvement was minimal except within NICE and Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, both of which included lay representatives on their guideline development committees and allowed for stakeholder feedback and comment prior to publication. We also identified a concerning lack of explicit consideration of real-world "applicability", with few guidelines providing explicit guidance on implementing published recommendations or considering the likely resource implications of doing so. These omissions may be particularly relevant to applying guideline recommendations in LIC, where the front-line impact of sparse resources may be particularly acute.

### Early may Be better: early low-dose norepinephrine in septic shock [^116rtUNB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Thus, NE remains the primary vasopressor in septic shock, but the existing evidence underlines the importance of early appropriate treatment in sepsis. The current RCT suggests that early low-dose NE may be superior to current standard care. We now need a large multicenter phase 3 RCT of early low-dose NE powered for mortality and organ dysfunction.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^1143VCCo]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

During septic shock, vasopressors, first and foremost norepinephrine, are administered to restore tissue perfusion pressure. For a long time, the rule was to start vasopressors only after correcting the hypovolaemic component of circulatory failure, even in most severe patients. However, starting norepinephrine earlier, simultaneously with fluid resuscitation, should be considered. Initiating infusion peripherally may avoid delays in norepinephrine administration, as recognized by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. As this attitude is safe when low doses are used, the real question is: what may be the advantages of early start of norepinephrine?

### What is the best vasopressor for the treatment of shock?… [^111xNnyC]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Consensus guidelines recommend that dopamine or norepinephrine be the first-choice vasopressor for patients in shock. Dopamine may increase splanchnic and renal perfusion more than norepinephrine, but observational studies have reported that it is also associated with a greater risk of death. The true benefits of these agents compared with each other are unknown. De Backer and colleagues conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial to determine if using norepinephrine instead of dopamine could reduce the death rate among patients in shock. The Study: The authors enrolled 1, 679 adult patients in shock who received dopamine or norepinephrine. If hypotension persisted with the maximal drug dosage, open-label norepinephrine was added. Patients were excluded for serious arrhythmias or if they had already received a vasopressor for more than four hours during the current episode of shock. The primary end point was the rate of death at 28 days. Secondary end points included the rates of death in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, and the duration of stay in the intensive care unit. Overall mortality rates were similar; however, subgroup analysis found that dopamine was associated with a higher risk of death in patients with cardiogenic shock. Arrhythmias were nearly twice as common in the dopamine group compared with the norepinephrine group, with atrial fibrillation being the most common arrhythmia with either agent.

There was nearly a fourfold greater discontinuation rate with dopamine because of severe arrhythmias, compared with norepinephrine. Conclusion: The authors conclude that although there is no overall difference in the rate of death between patients treated with dopamine or norepinephrine, dopamine is associated with more arrhythmias and increased mortality among patients with cardiogenic shock.
