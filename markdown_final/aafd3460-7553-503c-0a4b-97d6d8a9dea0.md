## Question

What’s the treatment for pre diabetes with evidence

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for prediabetes with evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining prediabetes and the strength of evidence for prevention. Then, I should verify first-line therapy and its magnitude of benefit. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options, especially metformin, and when they are appropriate. After that, I need to consider emerging agents like GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. I should also review special populations and implementation barriers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, making sure each claim is supported by high-quality sources and that I double-check any figures before stating them.

> Let me first confirm the condition and its risk. Prediabetes is defined by impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or HbA1c 5.7–6.4%, and it confers a substantial risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, with annual progression around 5–10% and lifetime risk commonly cited near 60–70%, though I should note that progression estimates vary by phenotype and population, so I will anchor to authoritative summaries rather than a single study [^50523009] [^512f7e0c].

> Next, I should review the hierarchy of evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I prioritize interventions with the highest-quality evidence. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on lifestyle modification as first-line therapy, supported by RCTs and meta-analyses showing consistent reductions in diabetes incidence, whereas pharmacotherapy is reserved for selected high-risk patients or when lifestyle is insufficient, reflecting weaker or more conditional evidence bases [^6dba54e3] [^8b89a89f] [^c9ed3e12].

> I will now examine lifestyle interventions as first-line therapy. The Diabetes Prevention Program and its translations demonstrate that structured programs targeting 5–7% weight loss and at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity reduce diabetes incidence by about 58% over roughly 3 years, with benefits persisting in long-term follow-up; meta-analyses corroborate a pooled relative risk reduction around 0.78, and exercise-based interventions improve HbA1c by about 0.24% on average, which is clinically meaningful for cardiometabolic risk reduction [^4bfc90b1] [^6dba54e3] [^55018ed9].

> Wait, let me verify the components that make lifestyle programs effective. Nutrition should be individualized and culturally congruent, emphasizing whole-food, plant-predominant patterns and caloric reduction to achieve weight loss; physical activity should include both aerobic and resistance training using SMART goals and the FITT framework; behavior change support via coaching, motivational interviewing, and CBT improves adherence; and continuity of care with scheduled follow-up sustains outcomes, which is repeatedly emphasized in contemporary lifestyle medicine guidelines [^91b2866a] [^37a145b2] [^fd8b7671] [^ac0a4731].

> Now, I should review pharmacologic therapy and its indications. Metformin is the most evidence-based option, reducing progression by about 31% in the DPP and by roughly 18% in longer-term follow-up, with particular benefit in those with BMI ≥ 35, age < 60, fasting glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL, or prior gestational diabetes; importantly, metformin is not FDA-approved for prediabetes, so use is off-label and should be individualized after lifestyle failure or in high-risk patients who cannot engage in lifestyle therapy [^4bfc90b1] [^6dba54e3] [^eb4a4ca2].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of recommendations. The USPSTF gives lifestyle interventions an A rating for prediabetes, while metformin receives a B rating with conditional benefit, and the VA/DoD suggests metformin only after lifestyle modification in high-risk adults, reflecting weak recommendations and low-to-moderate certainty evidence for pharmacotherapy in prediabetes specifically [^6dba54e3] [^a698672f].

> Next, I should review emerging pharmacologic options. GLP-1 receptor agonists show large effects on weight and glycemia and have high-certainty evidence for diabetes prevention in some analyses, with liraglutide and semaglutide demonstrating substantial risk reductions; however, long-term safety, cost, and durability after discontinuation remain uncertain, so these are not yet standard for prediabetes but may be considered in select high-risk patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome after shared decision-making [^dbe34e3b] [^7df3793b].

> I need to check SGLT2 inhibitors as well. In adults with prediabetes who also have heart failure or chronic kidney disease, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce new-onset diabetes by about 20% in pooled analyses, suggesting a disease-modifying effect in the cardiorenal space; again, this is not a general prediabetes indication, but it strengthens the case for use in the right comorbidity profile [^7df3793b] [^51fcc1d5].

> But wait, what about other agents. Acarbose and thiazolidinediones have evidence for delaying diabetes, yet adverse effects and lack of hard outcome benefits limit routine use; orlistat has modest evidence for prevention but gastrointestinal side effects and limited uptake constrain its role, reinforcing that lifestyle and metformin remain the core strategies pending stronger outcome data [^246270be] [^dbe34e3b].

> I should confirm special populations and implementation realities. In older adults, lifestyle programs are recommended and covered by Medicare, whereas metformin is generally not recommended for diabetes prevention due to limited evidence and lack of FDA approval; in women with prior gestational diabetes, metformin's benefit approximates lifestyle and is reasonable; in adolescents, evidence is sparse and lifestyle-first approaches are advised; across settings, real-world uptake of DPP is low, with only about 4% of eligible adults participating nationally, and metformin prescribing remains uncommon, highlighting system-level barriers and the need for streamlined referrals and decision support [^c671a99b] [^3a028a6e] [^fb13bf81] [^ff7ba975] [^0fb8182d].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, confirm prediabetes with repeat testing and stratify risk using BMI, age, fasting glucose or HbA1c trajectory, family history, and prior GDM. Second, initiate an evidence-based lifestyle program with structured weight loss, physical activity, and behavior support, setting SMART goals and arranging follow-up every 3–6 months. Third, if HbA1c rises, weight loss is under 3–5% after 6–12 months, or risk is high, consider metformin after discussing off-label use, monitoring for GI effects and B12 deficiency. Fourth, in patients with obesity and high cardiometabolic risk who fail lifestyle, consider GLP-1 RAs with shared decision-making. Fifth, in those with HF or CKD and prediabetes, consider SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal benefit with the added advantage of diabetes prevention. Throughout, address blood pressure, lipids, and smoking cessation, and embed continuity of care to sustain behavior change [^6dba54e3] [^91b2866a] [^3a028a6e] [^7df3793b].

> Hold on, I should verify uncertainties and explicitly state them. Long-term mortality and cardiovascular benefits of prediabetes interventions remain unproven, as lifestyle trials have not shown reductions in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality to date, and pharmacotherapy trials are underpowered for hard outcomes; cost-effectiveness looks favorable for lifestyle and metformin, but real-world implementation lags; and while vitamin D has emerging but still limited evidence for modest diabetes risk reduction in high-risk prediabetes, it should not replace lifestyle or metformin and should be framed as adjunctive in deficient or insufficient patients [^1a38e81c] [^082f0f6b] [^3ca0fba3] [^92b2b2f1].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and reference-aligned. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone with the strongest and most consistent evidence for preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes in prediabetes, metformin is a reasonable second-line option for high-risk patients or when lifestyle is insufficient, and GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered in selected high-risk patients with obesity or cardiorenal disease, recognizing that these latter strategies await broader endorsement and longer-term outcome data; shared decision-making, risk stratification, and system-level supports are essential to close the implementation gap [^6dba54e3] [^8b89a89f] [^7df3793b] [^ff7ba975].

---

The cornerstone of prediabetes management is **intensive lifestyle modification** [^8b89a89f] — weight loss of 5–7% [^4bfc90b1] and at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity [^notfound] — which reduces diabetes risk by 58% [^4bfc90b1] and is superior to medication [^4bfc90b1]. Metformin is the **first-line pharmacologic option** [^8b89a89f] for high-risk patients (age < 60, BMI ≥ 35, prior GDM, or progressive hyperglycemia) [^eb4a4ca2], reducing risk by 31% [^8b89a89f] and is cost-saving [^082f0f6b]. GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. liraglutide, semaglutide) are effective for obesity-related prediabetes [^dbe34e3b] but are not first-line due to cost and long-term safety data needs [^notfound]. Structured programs (e.g. Diabetes Prevention Program) [^4bfc90b1] and digital tools improve adherence and outcomes [^dbe34e3b]. Regular monitoring of glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors is essential [^notfound], and vitamin D may be considered in deficient patients [^3ca0fba3].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are the **foundation of prediabetes management** [^8b89a89f], with robust evidence supporting their effectiveness in preventing or delaying progression to type 2 diabetes [^6dba54e3].

- **Weight loss**: Achieving a weight loss of 5–7% of initial body weight significantly reduces diabetes risk [^4bfc90b1].

- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g. brisk walking) is recommended [^notfound].

- **Dietary modifications**: Emphasis on whole foods, plant-predominant diets, reduced caloric intake, and avoidance of processed foods and sugary beverages [^91b2866a].

- **Behavioral support**: Structured programs, motivational interviewing, and cognitive-behavioral strategies enhance adherence and sustainability [^6fcc392c].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacotherapy is considered when lifestyle interventions are insufficient or when patients are at **high risk of progression** [^8b89a89f].

| **Medication** | **Evidence summary** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Metformin | - Reduces diabetes risk by 31% [^8b89a89f] <br/> - Particularly effective in younger patients, those with BMI ≥ 35, and those with prior gestational diabetes [^eb4a4ca2] <br/> - Cost-effective and safe [^8b89a89f] | First-line pharmacologic therapy [^8b89a89f] |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. liraglutide, semaglutide) | - Significant weight loss and glycemic improvement [^7df3793b] <br/> - Effective in obesity-related prediabetes [^dbe34e3b] | Consider in patients with obesity or high cardiovascular risk [^notfound] |
| SGLT2 inhibitors | - Modest reduction in diabetes progression [^7df3793b] <br/> - Cardiorenal benefits in high-risk patients [^notfound] | Consider in patients with cardiovascular or renal comorbidities [^notfound] |
| Acarbose | - Delays progression to diabetes [^246270be] <br/> - Limited by gastrointestinal side effects | Alternative option in selected patients [^f9682708] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of glycemic parameters (fasting glucose, HbA1c) and cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, lipids) is essential to track progression and adjust interventions [^notfound]. Continuity of care with structured follow-up visits improves adherence and outcomes [^e1307d4a].

---

## Emerging therapies and research gaps

Emerging therapies such as **SGLT2 inhibitors** [^7df3793b] and **GLP-1 receptor agonists** [^dbe34e3b] show promise but require further research to establish long-term safety and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, **personalized medicine approaches** targeting specific phenotypes (e.g. impaired fasting glucose vs. impaired glucose tolerance) may optimize outcomes [^5c5df066].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Intensive lifestyle modification (weight loss, physical activity, dietary changes, behavioral support) [^8b89a89f].

- **Second-line therapy**: Metformin for high-risk patients or those not achieving lifestyle goals [^8b89a89f].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors in selected high-risk patients [^7df3793b].

- **Monitoring**: Regular glycemic and cardiovascular risk assessment [^notfound].

---

Lifestyle interventions remain the **cornerstone of prediabetes management**, with metformin as the primary pharmacologic option for high-risk patients. Emerging therapies show promise but require further research.

### Efficacy of exercise-based interventions for prediabetes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^bc13b17d]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In this context, umbrella reviews—also known as meta-reviews or overviews of reviews—have been proposed as a strategy to address these limitations by evaluating and synthesising the highest level of evidence from multiple reviews into a cohesive framework.This approach offers several distinct advantages: (1) it provides a comprehensive overview of the entire evidence landscape, potentially offering a more reliable foundation for informing evidence-based guidelines compared to individual systematic reviews; (2) it enables comparison of diverse exercise modalities within a unified analytical framework; (3) it enhances statistical power through large-scale meta-analyses, allowing for more precise estimates of intervention effects; (4) it assesses and addresses the heterogeneity and methodological quality issues in existing reviews, making them an invaluable resource for researchers, clinicians, and allied healthcare professional seeking to navigate complex evidence landscapes.

To the best of our knowledge, no umbrella review has been conducted to date examining exercise-based interventions for prediabetes. Considering the alarming rise in prevalence rates of prediabetes and the substantial increase in relevant evidence published through systematic reviews and meta-analyses in recent years, an umbrella review addressing the aforementioned research gaps to further establish the benefits and applications of various types of exercise interventions among individuals with prediabetes appears timely. Therefore, the primary aim of this review was to provide the most comprehensive synthesis of evidence to date by: (1) quantifying the overall efficacy of exercise-based interventions on glycaemic control and related cardiometabolic parameters in prediabetes; (2) comparing the relative effectiveness of different exercise modalities; and (3) critically appraising the methodological quality of existing evidence. By addressing these objectives, this study seeks to deliver actionable insights for clinicians and policymakers, informing evidence-based strategies to optimise exercise prescriptions for prediabetes management. These findings will also identify key research priorities, guiding future research to reduce the global burden of prediabetes and its associated complications.

### Interventions for reversing prediabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^246270be]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Several interventions have been found to be effective for reversing prediabetes in adults. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the effectiveness of such interventions.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published between January 1, 2000 and June 27, 2018. RCTs in adults with prediabetes, testing nonsurgical interventions lasting for ≥3 months, and reporting the number of participants achieving normal glucose levels at intervention end were eligible. The pooled risk difference and number needed to treat for achieving normoglycemia were estimated using a random-effects, arm-based network meta-analysis. The strength of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Data were obtained in 2018 and analyzed in 2019 and 2021.

Results

Of 54 studies included in the systematic review, 47 were meta-analyzed (n=26,460, mean age=53 years, 46% male, 31% White). Studies included 27 arms testing lifestyle modification interventions, 25 testing medications, 5 testing dietary supplements, and 10 testing Chinese medicine. There were 35 control/placebo arms. At a median follow-up of 1.6 years, more participants in the lifestyle modification groups achieved normoglycemia than those in the control (risk difference=0.18, number needed to treat=6). The strength of the evidence was strong for lifestyle modification. Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, more participants receiving glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (risk difference=0.47, number needed to treat=2), α-glucosidase inhibitors (risk difference=0.29, number needed to treat=4), and insulin sensitizers (risk difference=0.23, number needed to treat=4) achieved normoglycemia than control. The strength of evidence was moderate for these medications.

Discussion

Although several pharmacological approaches can reverse prediabetes, lifestyle modification provides the strongest evidence of effectiveness and should remain the recommended approach to address this condition.

### Decision models of prediabetes populations: a systematic review [^8fe467f8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

With evidence supporting the use of preventive interventions for prediabetes populations and the use of novel biomarkers to stratify the risk of progression, there is a need to evaluate their cost-effectiveness across jurisdictions. Our aim is to summarize and assess the quality and validity of decision models and model-based economic evaluations of populations with prediabetes, to evaluate their potential use for the assessment of novel prevention strategies and to discuss the knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities.

Materials and Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, EconLit and NHS EED between 2000 and 2018 for studies reporting computer simulation models of the natural history of individuals with prediabetes and/or we used decision models to evaluate the impact of treatment strategies on these populations. Data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines and assessed using modelling checklists. Two reviewers independently assessed 50% of the titles and abstracts to determine whether a full text review was needed. Of these, 10% was assessed by each reviewer to cross-reference the decision to proceed to full review. Using a standardized form and double extraction, each of four reviewers extracted 50% of the identified studies.

Results

A total of 29 published decision models that simulate prediabetes populations were identified. Studies showed large variations in the definition of prediabetes and model structure. The inclusion of complications in prediabetes (n=8) and type 2 diabetes (n=17) health states also varied. A minority of studies simulated annual changes in risk factors (glycaemia, HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, lipids) as individuals progressed in the models (n=7) and accounted for heterogeneity among individuals with prediabetes (n=7).

Conclusions

Current prediabetes decision models have considerable limitations in terms of their quality and validity and do not allow evaluation of stratified strategies using novel biomarkers, highlighting a clear need for more comprehensive prediabetes decision models.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6dba54e3]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes—interventions for prediabetes. Lifestyle interventions for persons with prediabetes reduced progression to diabetes (pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Metformin reduced diabetes incidence in pooled trials (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and, in DPP subgroup analyses, the effect was greater at higher body mass index, with a reduction in diabetes incidence of 53% [95% CI, 36% to 65%] for BMI ≥ 35 vs 3% [95% CI, −36% to 30%] for BMI of 22 to <30. In DPP, metformin produced greater weight loss than placebo (−2.0 kg [95% CI, −3.2 to −0.8 kg]) and increased high-density lipoprotein levels after 3 years (difference between groups, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.65]).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e87d5144]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Prediabetes—pharmacologic prevention and evidence quality: We recommend that clinicians continue monitoring the most up-to-date research for evidence-based changes in practice management related to prediabetes. The evidence informing this area is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group’s confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, with sample sizes low and follow-up varying from 6.0 months to 3.5 years. In patients who are poor candidates for metformin, the benefits of using an alternative medication to prevent progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus slightly outweighed the potential harm of side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. Accordingly, in adults with prediabetes who have participated in healthy lifestyle modification and remain at high risk for progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest evaluating patient characteristics (e.g., age, life expectancy, co-occurring conditions, BMI, other risk factors) and offering metformin or other select medications to reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus (...) [^3a028a6e]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • Prediabetes is not a diagnosis but rather an opportunity to prevent or delay a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. • Intensive lifestyle programs are the most effective intervention for preventing or delaying a diagnosis of diabetes in patients with prediabetes. • In patients with prediabetes, metformin therapy will slow the progression to type 2 diabetes, although less effectively than lifestyle programs over time. • In patients who have had gestational diabetes, the benefits of metformin therapy are similar to those of lifestyle programs. From the AFP Editors. Classifying screening test results as indicative of prediabetes shows an increased risk of a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and provides an opportunity for prevention. Criteria for prediabetes, including A1C levels of 5. 7 to
6. 4, fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 mg per dL, or two-hour glucose of 140 to 199 mg per dL after a 75-mg oral glucose load, identify individuals for whom diabetes prevention will be beneficial. Medications Medications can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes but are less effective than lifestyle programs. Metformin has the strongest evidence, whereas liraglutide, insulin, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, orlistat, and phentermine/topiramate all have some evidence of benefit. Initially, metformin is nearly as effective as lifestyle modification; however, over time, lifestyle interventions demonstrate clear superiority. In patients with previous gestational diabetes, metformin reduces diabetes incidence by 50%, equivalent to lifestyle changes. Because long-term use of metformin can lead to vitamin B 12 deficiency, monitoring vitamin B 12 levels should be considered. Cardiovascular Risk Prevention Because diabetes increases cardiovascular risk, identifying prediabetes provides an opportunity to reduce that risk.

Treating hypertension, dyslipidemia, and tobacco dependence should be considered. Because smoking cessation can increase diabetes risk for several years, tobacco cessation should be combined with diabetes prevention. The USPSTF and ADA suggest three-year screening intervals and lifestyle interventions, metformin, or both for patients with prediabetes. This ADA guideline adds more specifics to these recommendations. —Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Diabetes in older adults [^61263d2f]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

What is the evidence for preventing and treating diabetes and its common comorbidities in older adults?

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes

Older adults are at high risk for both diabetes and prediabetes, with surveillance data suggesting that half of older adults have the latter. The ADA recommends that overweight adults with risk factors—and all adults aged ≥45 years—be screened in the clinical setting every 1–3 years using either an FPG test, A1C, or oral glucose tolerance test. The recommendations are based on substantial indirect evidence for the benefits of early treatment of type 2 diabetes, the fact that type 2 diabetes is typically present for years before clinical diagnosis, and the evidence that signs of complications are prevalent in “newly diagnosed” patients.

The benefits of identification of prediabetes and asymptomatic type 2 diabetes in older adults depend on whether primary or secondary preventive interventions would likely be effective and on the anticipated timeframe of the benefit of interventions versus the patient’s life expectancy. Most would agree that a functional and generally healthy 66-year-old individual should be offered diabetes screening since interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes or the complications of type 2 diabetes would likely be beneficial given the presumption of decades of remaining life. Most would also agree that finding prediabetes or early type 2 diabetes in a 95-year-old individual with advanced dementia would be unlikely to provide benefit.

### Prediabetes [^5c5df066]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^6099567f]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

An estimated 13% of all US adults (18 years or older) have diabetes, and 34.5% meet criteria for prediabetes. The prevalences of prediabetes and diabetes are higher in older adults. Estimates of the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes vary widely, perhaps because of differences in the definition of prediabetes or the heterogeneity of prediabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases of blindness among adults in the US. It is also associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and was estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death in the US in 2017. Screening asymptomatic adults for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes may allow earlier detection, diagnosis, and treatment, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes.

Objective

To update its 2015 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults and preventive interventions for those with prediabetes.

Population

Nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (defined as a body mass index ≥25 and ≥30, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. (B recommendation).

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^afc9c5cf]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes is common and is a leading cause of morbidity and disability.

Objective

To review the evidence on screening for prediabetes and diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through September 2019; references; and experts; literature surveillance through May 21, 2021.

Study Selection

English-language controlled studies evaluating screening or interventions for prediabetes or diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings; meta-analyses conducted when at least 3 similar studies were available.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms.

Results

The review included 89 publications (N=68 882). Two randomized clinical trials (RCTs) (25 120 participants) found no significant difference between screening and control groups for all-cause or cause-specific mortality at 10 years. For harms (eg, anxiety or worry), the trials reported no significant differences between screening and control groups. For recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, 5 RCTs (5138 participants) were included. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, health outcomes were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin. For example, for all-cause mortality the relative risk (RR) was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96) over 20 years (10-year posttrial assessment). For overweight persons, intensive glucose control with metformin improved health outcomes at the 10-year follow-up (eg, all-cause mortality: RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.91]), and benefits were maintained longer term. Lifestyle interventions (most involving >360 minutes) for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes were associated with reductions in the incidence of diabetes (23 RCTs; pooled RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.88]). Lifestyle interventions were also associated with improved intermediate outcomes, such as reduced weight, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (pooled weighted mean difference, -1.7 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.8] and -1.2 mm Hg [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.4], respectively). Metformin was associated with a significant reduction in diabetes incidence (pooled RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.83]) and reduction in weight and body mass index.

Conclusions and Relevance

Trials of screening for diabetes found no significant mortality benefit but had insufficient data to assess other health outcomes; evidence on harms of screening was limited. For persons with recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, interventions improved health outcomes; for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes, interventions were associated with reduced incidence of diabetes and improvement in other intermediate outcomes.

For treatment, grade A is “Systematic reviewa of randomized trials,” grade B includes “Randomized trials, or observational studies with dramatic effects or highly consistent evidence,” and grade C includes “Non-randomized or historically controlled studies, including case-control and observational studies.” Additional A-level exemplars are listed for harm (“Systematic reviewa of randomized trials, nested case-control studies, or observational studies with dramatic effectb”), diagnosis (“Systematic reviewa of cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding”), and prognosis (“Systematic reviewa of inception cohort studiesc”). Lower grades include “Case reports, mechanism-based reasoning, or reasoning from first principles” (grade D) and an X category for “Exceptional situations where validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit over harm.” Footnotes specify that “A systematic review may be downgraded to level B because of study limitations, heterogeneity, or imprecision” and define inception cohorts as “A group of individuals identified for subsequent study at an early, uniform point in the course of the specified health condition, or before the condition develops.”

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^799042a5]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale—benefits and harms of screening and interventions states that “The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence that screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes leads to improvements in mortality or cardiovascular morbidity,” but “found adequate evidence that interventions for newly diagnosed diabetes have a moderate benefit in reducing all-cause mortality, diabetes-related mortality, and risk of myocardial infarction after 10 to 20 years of intervention.” It also “found convincing evidence that preventive interventions, in particular lifestyle interventions, in persons identified as having prediabetes have a moderate benefit in reducing the progression to type 2 diabetes,” notes that “Other preventive interventions are also effective in reducing the progression to type 2 diabetes,” and “found adequate evidence to bound the harms of screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and treatment of screen-detected or recently diagnosed prediabetes and type 2 diabetes as no greater than small.” Overall, “The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and offering or referring patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions has a moderate net benefit.”

### Approach to the patient with prediabetes [^726300e3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Prediabetes consists of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance and is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, microvascular, and macrovascular disease. The values used to define prediabetes are arbitrary, because prediabetes represents an intermediary category along the continuum from normal glucose levels and tolerance to overt hyperglycemia. The progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes occurs over many years, strong evidence to support intervention to delay the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Large, randomized prospective studies with lifestyle intervention and/or various modes of pharmacotherapy have demonstrated successful delay of diabetes. Several issues in the management of prediabetes remain controversial, such as the role of pharmacotherapy and when to escalate treatment. This article will review some of the issues surrounding the identification and treatment of prediabetes, with an interpretation of the available data to help guide management.

### Review of prediabetes (...) [^a9abe268]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Entezari-Maleki T. Review of Prediabetes. JAMA. 2023; 330: 563–564. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2023. 9956. To the Editor A recent Review1 about the diagnosis and management of prediabetes suggested lifestyle modification as first-line therapy for prediabetes, with a larger benefit than metformin. To date, randomized clinical trials of several medications, including acarbose, pioglitazone, and metformin, have revealed a potential benefit in delaying the progression of diabetes. 1 Although currently the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any drug for prevention of diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends metformin for high-risk individuals with prediabetes. 1 However, the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the prevention of prediabetes should be considered.

A systematic review and meta-analysis2 of 4 RCTs with 5655 participants demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes and heart failure or chronic kidney disease. A pooled analysis3 of the DAPA-CKD and DAPA-HF trials with 4003 participants had previously shown a significantly lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the dapagliflozin group than the placebo group over a median 21. 2 months. Of note, among participants in this study who developed diabetes, more than 90% had prediabetes at baseline. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study4 of 30 adults with prediabetes and prehypertension showed that dapagliflozin, 10 mg once daily for 90 days, significantly reduced the incidence of both prediabetes and prehypertension in 26.

9%, and body weight, body mass index, and blood pressure were also reduced. Based on available evidence, SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered in treatment of prediabetes. However, larger RCTs are needed to provide robust evidence. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### The early treatment of type 2 diabetes [^22f10634]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis--increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention--with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes--and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.

### Lower-intensity interventions for prediabetes: a systematic review [^2d6999ac]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systematic reviews of interventions for diabetes prevention have focused on lifestyle interventions, including the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and translations of the DPP. However, nationally, few people with prediabetes have joined or completed a DPP, with one cited barrier being committing to a yearlong program. This study was a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of lower-intensity lifestyle interventions for prediabetes on weight change, glycemia, and health behaviors.

Methods

English-language studies from PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from 2000 to February 23, 2022 were searched for RCTs of nonpregnant adults with prediabetes and elevated BMI and lower-intensity interventions (defined as ≤12 months and <14 sessions over 6 months). Two reviewers independently identified 11 trials, assessed study quality (using Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and extracted data serially. A qualitative synthesis was conducted by outcome.

Results

Only 1 of 11 trials of lower-intensity interventions was of high quality (>80% follow-up rate and low risk of bias). This 6-month study compared an app with standardized dietary advice, showing a 3-kg greater body weight reduction and 0.2% greater reduction of HbA1c.

Discussion

The evidence on lower-intensity lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention is limited by the small number and methodologic weaknesses of previous trials, and future research is needed in this area. Given the low uptake of and retention in evidence-based high-intensity programs, future work is needed to investigate the effectiveness of novel lower-intensity interventions offered with established DPP content of varying duration and intensity.

### A systematic approach to treating early metabolic disease and prediabetes [^082f0f6b]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

A clinical treatment approach either values preventing type 2 diabetes or it does not. Clinicians cannot abdicate the decision with a patient in front of them. No decision to promote metabolic health is a decision not to promote metabolic health. So, each clinician must answer whether attempting to prevent type 2 diabetes helps. The evidence suggests it does. Importantly, there is no economic rationale for withholding lifestyle intervention or metformin as both are cost-saving in attempting to prevent of type 2 diabetes. A key point in the preceding sentence is the word “attempting” as adherence significantly waned over time in the group assigned to receive metformin. Even so, diabetes prevalence remained lower with metformin, and cost-savings were achieved. Therefore, even if the evidence suggesting a macro- and microvascular benefit from not developing type 2 diabetes is discounted, the primary interventions to delay or prevent new-onset type 2 diabetes are cost-saving, with the added benefit of avoiding type 2 diabetes in some patients as highlighted above. Indeed, as illustrated above and in the literature, type 2 diabetes impacts a range of patient-centered outcomes. Thus, lifestyle intervention and metformin should be deployed systematically to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare spending.

### Screening adults for type 2 diabetes: a review of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^eaadfe3f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

More than 19 million Americans are affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is undiagnosed in one third of these persons. In addition, it is estimated that more than 54 million adults have prediabetes. Debate continues over the benefits and harms of screening and then treating adults who have asymptomatic diabetes or prediabetes.

Purpose

To update the 2003 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force review on the evidence for potential benefits and harms of screening adults for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in primary care settings.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies and systematic reviews published in English between March 2001 and July 2007.

Study Selection

Trials and observational studies that directly addressed the effectiveness and adverse effects of screening interventions were included. Randomized, controlled trials were used to assess the effectiveness of diabetes and prediabetes treatments. For diabetes interventions, trials of patients with disease for 1 year or less were included, as well as trials comparing outcomes among diabetic and nondiabetic patients.

Data Extraction

Relevant data were abstracted in duplicate into a standardized template.

Data Synthesis

Data were synthesized in a qualitative manner, and a random-effects meta-analysis of the effects of interventions in prediabetes on the incidence of diabetes was performed.

Limitations

Most of the data on diabetes treatment were not from primary trial data but from subgroup analyses. Participants in intensive lifestyle interventions for prediabetes may not be representative of general prediabetic populations.

Conclusion

Direct evidence is lacking on the health benefits of detecting type 2 diabetes by either targeted or mass screening, and indirect evidence also fails to demonstrate health benefits for screening general populations. Persons with hypertension probably benefit from screening, because blood pressure targets for persons with diabetes are lower than those for persons without diabetes. Intensive lifestyle and pharmacotherapeutic interventions reduce the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, but few data examine the effect of these interventions on long-term health outcomes.

### Efficacy of exercise-based interventions for prediabetes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^4b223244]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prediabetes, also referred to as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), borderline diabetes, intermediate hyperglycaemia, and non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, is characterised by blood glucose levels elevated above normal but below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas 11th Edition,an estimated 634.8 million adults (12.0%) globally had IGT, and 487.7 million (9.2%) had IFG in 2024. Historically, the IDF reported 318 million adults with IGT in 2015, indicating a near doubling over the past decade, with an approximate annual increase of 6–7% driven by rising obesity rates, aging populations, and sedentary lifestyles. Projections estimate the prevalence of IGT and IFG will reach 846.5 million (12.9%) and 647.5 million (9.8%) by 2050, respectively, further amplifying the global health burden.Notably, these figures, based on epidemiological modeling, may underestimate the true prevalence, as many cases remain undiagnosed due to limited screening and asymptomatic presentation.

Prediabetes represents a significant public health challenge due to its strong association with an increased risk of progressing to T2DM, metabolic syndrome, and other comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD)., Approximately 60–70% of individuals with prediabetes may develop T2DM over their lifetime, with annual progression rates of 5–10% depending on risk factors such as obesity and ethnicity. The economic burden is substantial, with global healthcare costs for prediabetes and T2DM exceeding USD 1 trillion in 2024, a 338% increase over the past 17 years due to rising medical interventions and productivity losses.Prediabetes also often coexists with metabolic syndrome, characterised by abdominal obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, which collectively amplify cardiometabolic risk. A meta-analysis of 129 studies, including over 10 million individuals, found that prediabetes was associated with a 13% increased relative risk of all-cause mortality, 15% for CVD, 16% for coronary heart disease, and 14% for stroke over a median follow-up of 9.8 years compared to normoglycaemia.Lifestyle factors, including physical inactivity, are central to the development and progression of prediabetes, underscoring the urgent need for cost-effective, accessible, and scalable interventions.

### Efficacy of exercise-based interventions for prediabetes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^55018ed9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first umbrella review evaluating the efficacy of exercise-based interventions in ameliorating glycaemic and cardiometabolic responses in individuals with prediabetes. Synthesising 12 systematic reviews with meta-analyses, encompassing 162 primary studies and 18,583 participants with prediabetes, our findings establish physical exercise as a pivotal lifestyle strategy for managing prediabetes. Our overall meta-analyses demonstrate that exercise-based interventions significantly improve all glycaemic control parameters—HbA1c, FBG, OGTT, FBI, and HOMA-IR (all p < 0.001). Notably, these improvements are considered practically significant. For instance, the observed reduction in HbA1c (WMD: −0.24%; 95% CI: −0.32 to −0.17) aligns with the threshold of a 0.3% (3 mmol/mol) reduction, which is generally recognised as clinically meaningful for reducing long-term diabetic complications.Secondary (cardiometabolic) outcomes, including TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, BM, BMI, SBP, and DBP, also exhibited consistent improvements. These findings are consistent with guidelines from authoritative health organisations advocating physical exercise for glycaemic control and cardiometabolic risk reduction,,,underscoring the utility of regular exercise on broad wellbeing outcomes.

### A systematic approach to treating early metabolic disease and prediabetes [^9c70eae3]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

A Way Forward

Overweight, obesity, and prediabetes must be diagnosed for two key reasons. First, this enables population health approaches to improve patient care and outcomes. With a diagnosis, these efforts can be done efficiently. Population health studies in hypertension and diabetes have demonstrated improvements in care, and patient identification is simplified when International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes can be searched electronically. Without a diagnosis, population health initiatives become less efficient if they must start with screening. Specific to prediabetes, when patients are already screened for type 2 diabetes in practice, the return on investment of screening is diminished when prediabetes is identified… but not diagnosed. Second, patients receiving a diagnosis should receive a plan in a progress note for the new problem identified as standard care. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that diagnosed obesity prompts action by clinicians. However, many patients with prediabetes receive no diagnosis and no intervention. Regardless of intervention, the diagnosis of overweight, obesity, or prediabetes can be done at no added cost (as screening is already being done) and can improve the process for continued screening for progression to overt metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes. By formalizing a follow-up plan for subsequent screening, it may be possible to limit patients being lost to follow-up and later presenting with significant glucose elevations as their new baseline or other advanced metabolic disease.

Recommendations for screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have been established by multiple guidelines. Patients lost to follow-up with prediabetes who later present with type 2 diabetes and significantly elevated glucose appear to be at substantially higher risk for complications. Conversely, patients benefit from the early treatment and control of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the benefit of early treatment and control of type 2 diabetes is likely underestimated as newer medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes significantly reduce cardiovascular events. Given the benefit of early treatment and control of type 2 diabetes, and the harm associated with developing type 2 diabetes versus not developing type 2 diabetes, we propose it is appropriate for clinicians to operate with the understanding that patients significantly benefit when they do not develop type 2 diabetes. Among various populations, the interventions which appear to have the clearest data regarding diabetes prevention and cardiovascular benefit are intensive lifestyle intervention, metformin, pioglitazone, and liraglutide and semaglutide [–,,]. As such, we propose these interventions should be systematically deployed as supported by evidence and guideline for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

### Interventions for prediabetes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^dbe34e3b]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This umbrella review synthesized evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing adverse outcomes in individuals with prediabetes.

Methods

A total of 23 meta-analyses comprising 602 RCTs and over 30,000 participants were analyzed from databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane through February 1, 2025. Interventions evaluated included both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies compared to placebo or usual care. Studies reporting only bio-humoral markers were excluded. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.

Results

Among 15 evaluated interventions, four were supported by high-certainty evidence for diabetes prevention: GLP-1 receptor agonists (RR = 0.26), liraglutide/exenatide/semaglutide (OR = 0.29), orlistat (OR = 0.67), and structured self-care programs (OR = 0.58). High-certainty evidence also supported modest reductions in systolic blood pressure (∼2-3 mmHg) from lifestyle interventions, digital health tools, and liraglutide. Significant reductions in BMI and waist circumference were observed with pharmacologic agents, aerobic exercise, and digital platforms. However, metformin combined with lifestyle changes did not yield notable anthropometric benefits.

Conclusion

These findings underscore the value of a multidimensional and personalized approach to prediabetes management, emphasizing evidence-based pharmacological options alongside behavioral and digital health strategies.

### A systematic approach to treating early metabolic disease and prediabetes [^ef1391c9]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

More is Needed

Greater action is needed to systematically deploy interventions known to be effective in treating overweight, obesity, and prediabetes. Two key approaches include health system protocol and electronic health record decision information support. Health system protocol is needed to prompt clinician behavior. No medication has a specific US Food and Drug Administration-approved indication for prediabetes, though medications are approved for obesity and overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with weight-related comorbidity). However, evidence and guideline strongly support “off-label” use for prediabetes. As such, health systems must enact protocols to encourage evidence-based treatments and destigmatize off-label pharmacotherapy for prediabetes in addition to streamlining the appropriate use of medications for weight loss and standardize referrals to bariatric surgery. Decision information support can facilitate these efforts by promoting the consistent diagnosis of overweight, obesity, and prediabetes. Moreover, it can be paired with one-click referral to community lifestyle interventions partnered with the National Diabetes Prevention Program. It is in these programs where patients can receive the education and support needed to adopt healthy patterns of diet and exercise. Additionally, based on predetermined parameters, decision information support can identify patients that may be indicated for pharmacologic or surgical treatment.

The health system approaches outlined above can be implemented broadly today. Research is needed to refine replicable methods to deploy these interventions. However, the 20-plus-year trends in obesity and diabetes suggest systemic factors negatively impacting metabolic health. One analysis identified Sugar Research Foundation sponsored research as problematic, the timing of which roughly corresponded to the start of the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Now many commonly purchased food items contain added sugars, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality. The food supply must be examined and addressed to enable healthy choices, without the economic burden of “organic” items which are also less accessible. Through public health approaches to improve the food supply it may be possible to improve the metabolic health of whole populations by addressing excess (and empty) calories, insufficient vitamin D, insufficient dietary fiber, and insufficient healthy proteins.

### Lifestyle interventions for treatment and remission of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in adults: implications for clinicians [^4c209e77]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes—US and global prevalence, costs, and healthy lifestyle adherence are summarized as follows: In the United States, over 38 million people have diabetes, of whom approximately 90-95% have type 2 diabetes; among US adults, the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes are 14.7% and 38.0%, respectively. Diabetes and prediabetes account for $413 billion and $43 billion of annual healthcare spending, respectively, and people with diabetes account for 25% of total health care dollars. Globally, about 1.3 billion people are expected to be living with diabetes by the year 2050, with projected annual expenditures for T2D exceeding $1 trillion. Despite evidence for benefits of lifestyle interventions, only about 20% of US adults surveyed in 2020 reported a healthy lifestyle that included at least 4 behaviors, with component prevalences of healthy diet (25% prevalence), healthy weight (25%), never smoking (58%), sufficient physical activity (69%), and moderate or lighter alcohol consumption (91%).

Prediabetes can be identified by impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose 100 to 125 mg/dL), impaired glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test result 140 to 199 mg/dL, 2 hours after ingesting 75 g of glucose), or A1C 5.7% to 6.4%, and progression risk is greatest with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, progressive glycemia within the prediabetes range, or meeting a combination of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or metabolic syndrome criteria (any 2 out of 3).

### Metformin plus lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1c90fa63]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, the efficacy of adding lifestyle interventions to metformin versus lifestyle interventions alone in individuals with prediabetes is still inconclusive. Previous meta-analyses revealed that adding metformin to lifestyle interventions was comparable to lifestyle interventions alone. Nevertheless, these meta-analyses had some problems. First, they included a small number of RCTs. Second, they did not specifically compare the effect of adding metformin to lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone. Furthermore, published RCTs, which were not included in the previous meta-analyses, showed conflicting results [,–]. Moreover, in multiple subgroup analyses of the Diabetes Prevention Program, metformin showed a protective impact on lipid control, inflammation, metabolic syndrome, and coronary artery calcium; suggesting benefits for metformin in individuals with prediabetes that extend beyond diabetes prevention. Finally, although the ADA guidelines recommended considering metformin for certain individuals with prediabetes, the adherence of physicians to these recommendations remains unclear, particularly with contradicting views in the literature on the true benefit of the medication.

Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to update the evidence from all published RCTs, comparing the clinical and biochemical effectiveness of adding metformin to lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone in individuals with prediabetes.

### Decision models of prediabetes populations: a systematic review [^83b53109]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

With evidence supporting the use of preventive interventions for prediabetes populations and the use of novel biomarkers to stratify the risk of progression, there is a need to evaluate their cost‐effectiveness across jurisdictions. Our aim is to summarize and assess the quality and validity of decision models and model‐based economic evaluations of populations with prediabetes, to evaluate their potential use for the assessment of novel prevention strategies and to discuss the knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities.

Materials and methods

We searched Medline, Embase, EconLit and NHS EED between 2000 and 2018 for studies reporting computer simulation models of the natural history of individuals with prediabetes and/or we used decision models to evaluate the impact of treatment strategies on these populations. Data were extracted following PRISMA guidelines and assessed using modelling checklists. Two reviewers independently assessed 50% of the titles and abstracts to determine whether a full text review was needed. Of these, 10% was assessed by each reviewer to cross‐reference the decision to proceed to full review. Using a standardized form and double extraction, each of four reviewers extracted 50% of the identified studies.

Results

A total of 29 published decision models that simulate prediabetes populations were identified. Studies showed large variations in the definition of prediabetes and model structure. The inclusion of complications in prediabetes (n = 8) and type 2 diabetes (n = 17) health states also varied. A minority of studies simulated annual changes in risk factors (glycaemia, HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, lipids) as individuals progressed in the models (n = 7) and accounted for heterogeneity among individuals with prediabetes (n = 7).

Conclusions

Current prediabetes decision models have considerable limitations in terms of their quality and validity and do not allow evaluation of stratified strategies using novel biomarkers, highlighting a clear need for more comprehensive prediabetes decision models.

Research needs and gaps—more studies are needed on the effects of screening on health outcomes that enroll populations reflective of the prevalence of diabetes in the US, particularly racial and ethnic groups that have a higher prevalence of diabetes than White persons; more US data are needed on the effects of lifestyle interventions and medical treatments for screen-detected prediabetes and diabetes on health outcomes over a longer follow-up period; more research is needed on how best to increase uptake of lifestyle interventions, especially among populations at highest risk for progression to diabetes and adverse health outcomes; clinical trials and additional modeling studies are needed to better elucidate the optimal frequency of screening and the age at which to start and stop screening; and more research is needed on the natural history of prediabetes, including the identification of factors associated with risk of progression to diabetes or reversion to normoglycemia.

### Vitamin D role and use in prediabetes [^537f064d]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of vitamin D in prediabetes on the basis of evidence from human studies.

Methods

English-language literature in MEDLINE (January 1969-July 2009) was searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials of vitamin D deficiency and treatment in prediabetes, including impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and metabolic syndrome. Search terms included hyperglycemia, glucose, glycohemoglobin, insulin resistance, diabetes, homeostasis model assessment, insulin secretion, vitamin D, and related terms. Publications were also identified from review articles and references in the found articles. Abstracts, conference proceedings, case reports, and letters were excluded. Articles concerning only type 1 and type 2 diabetes, hemodialysis, or hyperparathyroidism and studies in children were also excluded.

Results

Vitamin D insufficiency is defined by a circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration less than 30 ng/mL, and it is prevalent in the United States (77% of the population). Most cross-sectional and prospective studies in various populations show inverse association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and fasting plasma glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, hemoglobin A1c, metabolic syndrome, and incidence of prediabetes. A few clinical trials suggest beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in prediabetes, including improved insulin secretion, basal fasting insulin sensitivity, and postprandial peripheral insulin resistance. The limitations of the studies are small sample size, short duration of follow-up, lack of control groups, and inability to achieve vitamin D sufficiency with treatment.

Conclusion

Available data suggest that achieving vitamin D sufficiency may be beneficial in patients with prediabetes, although clinical trials are needed to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Continuity of care for lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (T2D) carries a “Strong recommendation based on RCTs, systematic reviews, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.” The abbreviated action statement profile states “Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B, based on over 20 systematic reviews, several meta-analyses, and RCTs that demonstrate consistent benefits related to continuity of care for people with T2D,” with “Level of confidence in evidence: High.” Reported benefits are “Maintain person engagement in care; promote success and sustainability; establish clear goals and expectations regarding the need for future care; and assess the need to alter the management plan based on the person’s needs,” and risks/costs include “Time counseling individuals and expense of follow-up visits (e.g., treatment, medical supplies, transportation etc.).” Implications for practice note the purpose “to describe considerations for establishing a comprehensive plan of care for lifestyle interventions, specifying frequency of visits, duration of care, oversight for pharmacologic therapy, and potential follow-up for people with prediabetes, T2D, or a history of GDM.” Continuity of care is defined as “the ongoing process followed by the interdisciplinary care team to collaborate for the purpose of providing high quality care over time that supports positive experience for individuals and a sustained, stable relationship with the person’s clinicians,” and it is noted that “the GDG agreed that continuity may be inadequately discussed or specified as a part of the person’s care plan.”

### Lifestyle interventions for treatment and remission of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in adults: implications for clinicians [^db419300]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2025). High credibility.

KAS 14: Adjusting pharmacologic therapy—For adults with prediabetes, T2D, or a history of GDM, the clinician or HCP should adjust the type and dosing of an individual’s pharmacologic therapy based on the impact of lifestyle intervention on their medication needs, with a recommendation based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is described as Grade B regarding the need for deprescribing, dangers of hypoglycemia, and lack of previous guidance on deprescribing based on 8 systematic reviews, and Grade C regarding the likelihood of lifestyle interventions to necessitate deprescribing and potential hypoglycemia based on several non-randomized, observational, or alternative method designed studies. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium; benefits include avoiding adverse effects from hypoglycemia or overmedication, avoiding hypotension, minimizing weight gain, enabling prescribed lifestyle changes, and promoting sustainability of changes; risks, harm, and cost include person anxiety regarding changes in therapy, that some medications may be costly or not covered by insurance, and short-term, permissive hyperglycemia. Implications for practice state that the purpose of this statement is to provide guidance to clinicians for adjusting the type and dosing of pharmacological therapy for people with T2D who are engaging in intensive or moderate therapeutic lifestyle change interventions, particularly when the goal is to achieve remission, and that any adjustment should also consider how the medication change may impact comorbid conditions such as chronic kidney disease, heart failure (with reduced or preserved ejection fraction), or a history of myocardial infarction.

### Screening for diabetes and prediabetes [^7b72cea4]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is preceded by prediabetes and latent diabetes (lasts 9-12 years). Key dysglycemia screening tests are fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A 1C . Screen-detected T2DM benefits from multifactorial management of cardiovascular risk beyond glycemia. Prediabetes is best addressed by lifestyle modification, with the goal of preventing T2DM. Although there is no trial evidence of prediabetes/T2DM screening effectiveness, simulations suggest that clinic-based opportunistic screening of high-risk individuals is cost-effective. The most rigorous extant recommendations are those of the American Diabetes Association and US Preventive Services Task Force, which advise opportunistic 3-yearly screening.

### Prediabetes: a high-risk state for diabetes development [^50523009]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Prediabetes (intermediate hyperglycaemia) is a high-risk state for diabetes that is defined by glycaemic variables that are higher than normal, but lower than diabetes thresholds. 5-10% of people per year with prediabetes will progress to diabetes, with the same proportion converting back to normoglycaemia. Prevalence of prediabetes is increasing worldwide and experts have projected that more than 470 million people will have prediabetes by 2030. Prediabetes is associated with the simultaneous presence of insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction-abnormalities that start before glucose changes are detectable. Observational evidence shows associations between prediabetes and early forms of nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, small fibre neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and increased risk of macrovascular disease. Multifactorial risk scores using non-invasive measures and blood-based metabolic traits, in addition to glycaemic values, could optimise estimation of diabetes risk. For prediabetic individuals, lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, with evidence of a 40-70% relative-risk reduction. Accumulating data also show potential benefits from pharmacotherapy.

Vitamin D—empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

### Continuous glucose monitoring for prediabetes: roles, evidence, and gaps [^c9522e2f]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed the care of patients with diabetes, and there is great potential to extend these benefits to prediabetes. The recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of over-the-counter CGMs has increased interest for use in individuals with prediabetes. It is of particular interest to use CGM to guide early individualized lifestyle interventions to prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes and support reversion to normoglycemia. In this review, we discuss published evidence regarding CGM metrics in normoglycemia, briefly review the use of CGM to diagnose prediabetes, and review available evidence for CGM use during lifestyle interventions in individuals with prediabetes. Future studies are needed to validate CGM metrics for prediabetes and evaluate effects of early intervention with CGM in this population.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^6f1f241e]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In this commentary I will evaluate whether prediabetes should be treated pharmacologically. To consider this question, certain information concerning prediabetes is relevant.

Background Information

(1) Prediabetes is not independently associated with cardiovascular disease; the other factors in the metabolic syndrome increase that risk; (2) various tests and criteria for diagnosing prediabetes are recommended, yielding prevalences varying from 6% to 38% depending on which are used; (3) one-third of patients with prediabetes revert to normal over time; (4) up to two-thirds of patients with prediabetes do not develop diabetes; (5) people with prediabetes have insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion; (6) although pharmacological treatment of the dysglycemia temporarily lowers it, when the drugs are discontinued, incident diabetes develops similarly as that in those who received placebos; (7) when the drugs are discontinued, there are no changes in insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion; (8) incident diabetes was similar at 10 years in people remaining on metformin in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study compared with those who did not receive the drug; (9) no current drugs will directly increase insulin secretion (except sulfonylureas and glinides which have not been used to treat prediabetes because of hypoglycemia concerns); (10) sufficient weight loss to lower insulin resistance by nutritional means is challenging and especially difficult to maintain.

Conclusions

Pharmacological treatment of the dysglycemia of prediabetes is not warranted. On the other hand, the ability of high doses of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonists and the combination of a GLP-1 receptor agonist and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) to lower weight by 15% and 20%, respectively, deserves consideration for the treatment of prediabetes. This amount of weight loss should decrease insulin resistance, allowing endogenous insulin secretion to be more effective and lower the risk for developing diabetes.

UKPDS reported major hypoglycemic events in 1% to 1. 8% of participants receiving sulfonylureas or insulin Lifestyle interventions: 2 studies found no or few musculoskeletal adverse events; DPP found higher rates of musculoskeletal symptoms among the intensive lifestyle intervention group. For medications, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and AGIs were all associated with a reduction in diabetes j.

Good: 6 Fair: 30 High for lifestyle interventions and metformin Low for other medicationsk Two trials had >5 y of follow-up; 1 had >10 y of follow-up One trial reported reduction in both diabetes incidence and long-term adverse health outcomes with more than the 5-y follow-up, finding that a 6-y lifestyle intervention yielded an absolute decrease in diabetes incidence of 24% and was associated with 10% fewer deaths and 8% fewer cardiovascular deaths over 30 y. For recently diagnosed diabetes, 5 RCTs were included. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, health outcomes were improved with intensive glucose control with sulfonylureas or insulin. For example, for all-cause mortality the relative risk was 0. 87 over 20 years.

For overweight persons, intensive glucose control with metformin improved health outcomes at the 10-year follow-up, and benefits were maintained longer term. Lifestyle interventions for obese or overweight persons with prediabetes were associated with reductions in the incidence of diabetes.

### Gender-related affecting factors of prediabetes on its 10-year outcome [^23a38003]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diabetes has been a huge burden in China, where the incidence of diabetes has reached 11.6% and prediabetes 50.1% among adults.What is worse, there has been a long-running controversy about the management and treatment of prediabetes. There is evidence indicating that both, lifestyle interventions and drug treatments can substantially reduce the risk of progression to diabetes in high-risk individuals.However, lifestyle change is difficult to implement and maintain, while for drug treatment, the benefits of prevention need to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects.Research is urgently needed to strengthen the evidence-based treatment guidelines for Chinese patients with prediabetes or diabetes. Our study, lasting for a decade, provides a chance to observe the 10-year outcomes of prediabetes and to explore its gender-related risk factors, thus being beneficial to the understanding of prediabetes in the general population. The major findings of our study were: (1) 22.5% participants with prediabetes had restored normal glucose regulation, 48.2% remained in a prediabetic state, and 29.3% progressed to diabetes. No gender difference was observed in the change of glucose regulation. (2) Age, 2 h glucose, triglycerides, smoking status, and physical activity in males, and fasting glucose, waist circumference, baseline hypertension, and family history of diabetes in females, are significantly associated with development of diabetes. (3) Physical activity in males and waist circumference in females are important factors in the restoration to normal glucose regulation in participants with prediabetes.

### Review of prediabetes (...) [^51fcc1d5]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor A recent Review1 about the diagnosis and management of prediabetes suggested lifestyle modification as first-line therapy for prediabetes, with a larger benefit than metformin. To date, randomized clinical trials of several medications, including acarbose, pioglitazone, and metformin, have revealed a potential benefit in delaying the progression of diabetes. 1 Although currently the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any drug for prevention of diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends metformin for high-risk individuals with prediabetes. 1 However, the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the prevention of prediabetes should be considered.

A systematic review and meta-analysis2 of 4 RCTs with 5655 participants demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes and heart failure or chronic kidney disease. A pooled analysis3 of the DAPA-CKD and DAPA-HF trials with 4003 participants had previously shown a significantly lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the dapagliflozin group than the placebo group over a median 21. 2 months. Of note, among participants in this study who developed diabetes, more than 90% had prediabetes at baseline. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study4 of 30 adults with prediabetes and prehypertension showed that dapagliflozin, 10 mg once daily for 90 days, significantly reduced the incidence of both prediabetes and prehypertension in 26.

9%, and body weight, body mass index, and blood pressure were also reduced. Based on available evidence, SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered in treatment of prediabetes. However, larger RCTs are needed to provide robust evidence. Entezari-Maleki T. Review of Prediabetes. JAMA. 2023; 330: 563–564. doi:

Finally, the natural history of prediabetes is somewhat reassuring. Approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes. In the placebo arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS), 65% of participants had not developed diabetes 5.7 years after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) had ended. Similarly, 69% of people with prediabetes in the Framingham Offspring Study had not developed diabetes 27 to 30 years later. In people with prediabetes who were older than 60 years enrolled in the Swedish National Study on Aging who were followed for 12 years, 23% died and 13% developed diabetes. Even assuming that all the individuals who died had developed diabetes before doing so (highly unlikely), 64% of those still living would not have developed diabetes. Furthermore, a mean of one-third, with a wide range of 13–69% depending on the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose prediabetes and euglycemia, returned to normal glucose regulation over time.

### Long-term effect of lifestyle interventions on the cardiovascular and all-cause mortality of subjects with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1a38e81c]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lifestyle interventions improve the metabolic control of individuals with hyperglycemia.

Purpose

We aimed to determine the effect of lifestyle interventions on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in this population.

Data Sources

Searches were made through MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and Web of Science (no date/language restriction, until 15 May 2022).

Study Selection

We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of subjects with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, comparing intensive lifestyle interventions with usual care, with a minimum of 2 years of active intervention.

Data Extraction

Data from the 11 RCTs selected were extracted in duplicate. A frequentist and arm-based meta-analysis was performed with random-effects models to estimate relative risk (RR) for mortality, and heterogeneity was assessed through I2 metrics. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to confirm the findings.

Data Synthesis

Lifestyle interventions were not superior to usual care in reducing cardiovascular (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79-1.23) or all-cause (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.85-1.03) mortality. Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses showed no influence of type of intervention, mean follow-up, age, glycemic status, geographical location, risk of bias, or weight change. All of these results were confirmed with the GLMM. Most studies had a low risk of bias according to the RoB 2.0 tool and the certainty of evidence was moderate for both outcomes.

Limitations

Most studies had a low risk of bias according to the RoB 2.0 tool, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach resulted in moderate certainty of evidence for both outcomes. Differences in lifestyle programs and in usual care between the studies should be considered in the interpretation of our results.

Conclusions

Intensive lifestyle interventions implemented so far did not show superiority to usual care in reducing cardiovascular or all-cause mortality for subjects with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^eb4a4ca2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF preventive interventions for persons with prediabetes state that both lifestyle interventions focused on diet and physical activity and metformin have demonstrated efficacy in preventing or delaying progression to diabetes; however, metformin has not been approved for this specific indication by the US Food and Drug Administration. Lifestyle interventions were effective in all subgroups, while subgroup analyses suggest that metformin was effective in persons younger than 60 years, in persons with a BMI of 35 or greater, in persons with a fasting plasma glucose level of 110 mg/dL (6.11 mmol/L) or greater, or in persons with a history of gestational diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have a beneficial effect on weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels, whereas metformin has a beneficial effect on weight but does not appear to affect blood pressure or to consistently improve lipid levels.

### Efficacy of exercise-based interventions for prediabetes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^94726bbf]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

Reviews that involved any type of exercise-based intervention were included. Exercise is defined as a planned, structured, and repetitive physical activity with the goal of improving or maintaining physical fitness. Papers were eligible irrespective of exercise modality (e.g. aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, mind-body exercises, or other forms of exercise training), setting (e.g. laboratory, or community facility), or dose (e.g. weekly frequency and volume). Interventions of at least two weeks’ duration were included (i.e. possible minimum time frame to observe meaningful cardiometabolic health parameters changes in typical intervention studies). Reviews involving dietary or lifestyle interventions were included only if these interventions were applied equally to all participants, including those in the comparator group. Studies where only the intervention or control group received additional components (e.g. specific supplementation or a particular diet) were excluded to avoid confounding.

Type of comparator

Reviews that involved non-active control comparison groups were included. Reviews with no comparison groups, or those comparing with baseline values only, were excluded. Additionally, studies involving participants receiving usual care, which may include general lifestyle advice (but without specific intervention or programme prescription), were also included as acceptable comparators, ensuring consistency with our focus on exercise-based interventions. This approach allowed for the inclusion of real-world settings where usual care might provide broad guidance, while maintaining the integrity of the exercise intervention as the primary variable of interest.

Types of outcomes

The primary outcome measures for this umbrella review were glycaemic responses, as indicated by HbA1c, FBG, OGTT, FBI, and HOMA-IR. Secondary outcome measures related to cardiometabolic health included total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), body mass (BM), body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Types of studies

This umbrella review included systematic reviews with meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals and available in full text in English. Only reviews synthesising randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected, as RCTs provide high-quality evidence with minimal bias due to randomisation.Non-RCT reviews, narrative reviews, scoping reviews, or abstracts were excluded to maintain evidence quality.

### Metformin plus lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^805694f2]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines when performing this systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, our study was carried out per the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis of Interventions. We registered our study protocol on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023458096).

Literature search

On August 1, 2023, we performed a comprehensive literature search on four electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central) using the following keywords: lifestyle, metformin, prediabetes, glucose intolerance, and impaired fasting glucose. In addition, we performed manual citation analysis for all the references of the included studies and relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. On March 20, 2024, we updated our search again for other potential publications. We provide the detailed search strategy and results for each database in Supplementary Table 1.

Eligibility criteria

We considered all RCTs comparing lifestyle interventions plus metformin versus lifestyle interventions alone or lifestyle interventions plus placebo in individuals with prediabetes either with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, or both. Our population was not restricted to a specific age group. Therefore, RCTs including adults or adolescents were included. Lifestyle interventions were defined as diet or exercise interventions offering more than the provision of general information or advice, which are considered “standard care”. However, we were interested in more intensive care such as goal setting and individually tailored information to ensure the implementation of these interventions in the study population. Included studies had to assess at least one of our outcome measurements. We excluded studies comparing adding metformin to lifestyle interventions versus metformin alone. Similarly, studies comparing lifestyle interventions versus metformin were also excluded. RCTs including individuals with concomitant use of other antidiabetic drugs were excluded. Finally, animal studies, conference abstracts, and studies that were not in English were excluded.

Primary and secondary outcomes

Our primary outcomes included the incidence of type 2 diabetes and glycemic control measurements, such as HbA1c and FPG levels, which are important indicators of diabetes risk. Secondary outcomes included clinical and biochemical parameters, which provide insights about the overall health status and risk factors associated with diabetes, such as blood pressure, plasma lipids, insulin resistance, and weight measurements (Table 1).

Screening of the literature search results

The literature search results were screened in a two-step process. Initially, the titles and abstracts of all articles were assessed for eligibility. Subsequently, full-text screening was conducted for the studies that met our eligibility criteria.

Prediabetes interventions—lifestyle, metformin, and other agents: The DPP randomized persons with IGT to placebo, a structured lifestyle intervention, or metformin with average follow-up of 2.8 years; metformin decreased progression to DM but was inferior to lifestyle, which reduced DM incidence by 58% compared with placebo. Metformin was particularly effective in persons with A1C 6.1 to 6.4%, those age <60 years, and women with prior GDM. With respect to DM prevention, metformin, acarbose, or TZDs can be used to prevent progression to T2D, and a meta-analysis of 16 RCTs encompassing 28,772 participants found lifestyle approaches superior to DM drug-based approaches in DM prevention.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^fb13bf81]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Of youths diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, many develop microvascular complications by young adulthood.

Objective

To review the evidence on benefits and harms of screening children and adolescents for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Data Sources

PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 3, 2021; references; experts; literature surveillance through July 22, 2022.

Study Selection

English-language controlled studies evaluating screening or interventions for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes that was screen detected or recently diagnosed.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; qualitative synthesis of findings.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes-related morbidity, development of diabetes, quality of life, and harms.

Results

This review included 8 publications (856 participants; mean age, 14 years [range, 10-17 years]). Of those, 6 were from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study. No eligible studies directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. One randomized clinical trial (RCT) (TODAY; n=699 adolescents with obesity; mean age, 14 years) comparing metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus lifestyle intervention reported that 2 youths with recently diagnosed diabetes developed kidney impairment (0 vs 1 vs 1, respectively; P>.99) and 11 developed diabetic ketoacidosis (5 vs 3 vs 3, respectively; P=.70). One RCT of 75 adolescents (mean age, 13 years) with obesity with prediabetes compared an intensive lifestyle intervention with standard care and reported that no participants in either group developed diabetes, although follow-up was only 6 months. Regarding harms of interventions, 2 RCTs assessing different comparisons enrolled youths with recently diagnosed diabetes. Major hypoglycemic events were reported by less than 1% of participants. Minor hypoglycemic events were more common among youths treated with metformin plus rosiglitazone than among those treated with metformin or metformin plus lifestyle intervention in TODAY (8.2% vs 4.3% vs 3.4%, P=.05). In 1 study, gastrointestinal adverse events were more commonly reported by those taking metformin than by those taking placebo (abdominal pain: 25% vs 12%; nausea/vomiting: 17% vs 10%; P not reported).

Conclusions and Relevance

No eligible studies directly evaluated the benefits or harms of screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. For youths with prediabetes or recently diagnosed (not screen-detected) diabetes, the only eligible trials reported few health outcomes and found no difference between groups, although evidence was limited by substantial imprecision and a duration of follow-up likely insufficient to assess health outcomes.

KAS 10: Identify need for psychological interventions—in adults with prediabetes, T2D, or a history of GDM—the clinician or HCP should identify or refer to someone who can identify serious mental illness (e.g., severe mood/affective, anxiety, or psychotic disorders) and, for those experiencing stress or symptoms of depression or anxiety, prescribe mindfulness-based, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or CBT-based interventions to improve diabetes clinical outcomes; this is a Recommendation based on RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Evidence is Grade B, based on 10 combined systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 2 systematic reviews, and 9 RCTs, with level of confidence in evidence high, and the page notes a higher risk of depression that is 2-3 times that of the general population and risk of anxiety about 20% more than the general population.

KAS 2: Assessment of baseline lifestyle habits—The clinician or healthcare provider (HCP) should assess baseline lifestyle habits in adults with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes (T2D) or a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with regards to the 6 pillars of lifestyle medicine, educate about opportunities to improve behaviors, and evaluate readiness to change. Strong recommendation based on RCTs, systematic review, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A, based on 2 systematic reviews and 14 RCTs on education, coaching, and motivational interviewing in adults with prediabetes and T2D, with a high level of confidence in evidence. Benefits include establishing a baseline, raising awareness, gaining insights into the individual’s understanding and self-awareness of lifestyle habits, and identifying areas for improvement, while risks include individual anxiety or sense of stigma, shame, judgment, blame or embarrassment, and time burden involved in assessment. Implications for practice emphasize providing a framework to pragmatically assess baseline habits, educate about opportunities to improve behaviors, and personalize delivery to facilitate action steps toward improved health behaviors and sustainable change.

KAS 4: Prescribing aerobic and muscle strength physical activity—The clinician or HCP should prescribe physical activity, with an emphasis on aerobic and muscle strength training, by establishing SMART goals and using the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, type) framework for implementation for adults with prediabetes, T2D, or a history of GDM. Strong recommendation based on RCTs and systematic reviews with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A, based on 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 2 RCTs, and 2 longitudinal cohort studies; level of confidence in evidence is High. Benefits include improved glucose management, health related quality of life (HRQOL), and cardiometabolic markers, with fewer major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); risks include injury from improper activity, hypoglycemia, overexercise, ischemic and arrhythmogenic heart disease, and cost of access to equipment or facilities. Some individuals with physical limitations or disabilities may be unable to adhere to all recommendations and may therefore require additional evaluation or counseling when prescribing aerobic or muscle-strengthening activity.

INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is common, costly, and responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the U.S. The total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was estimated to be $327 billion,with more than 200,000 people dying each year, making it the seventh leading cause of death.Nationally, an estimated 30.3 million people have diabetes, and an additional 84.1 million (33.9%) adults have prediabetes.Prediabetes is a serious health condition characterized by blood glucose levels that are elevated, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes.People with prediabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, and tend to have higher healthcare utilization and expenditures. –

Individuals with prediabetes can mitigate their clinical and economic risks by participating in a structured, evidenced-based lifestyle change program (LCP), such as the one offered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)–led National Diabetes Prevention Program (n= ational DPP). The National DPP is a partnership of public and private organizations working to reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes by building the infrastructure for nationwide delivery of a yearlong LCP.The program is modeled after the DPP research study,and subsequent translational studies, – to prevent or delay onset of type 2 diabetes. DPP participants lost on average 5%–7% of their body weight and reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58% for adults aged 25 years or older and 71% for those aged 60 years or older.Early results from CDC’s National DPP showed an average weight loss of 4.2%, with 35.5% of participants achieving 5% or more weight loss.The Community Preventive Services Task Force and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued recommendations for clinicians, specifying screening and testing guidelines, and suggesting that all patients with laboratory results in the prediabetes range be referred to an evidence-based type 2 diabetes prevention programto reduce type 2 diabetes riskand improve cardiometabolic risk factors.

### Decision models of prediabetes populations: a systematic review [^f3cd0f2c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, with over 90% of individuals with diabetes having type 2 diabetes (T2D). 1 Major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke are common in individuals with diabetes and there is a highly significant association between glycaemic levels and the development of diabetes‐related complications. 2

Early identification and management of individuals at risk of T2D provides an opportunity to prevent or delay its development. Individuals with prediabetes, a condition characterized by intermediate hyperglycaemia, that is, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), are at high risk of developing diabetes. 3 In addition, individuals with prediabetes may face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, early stage nephropathy, chronic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy. 3

Lifestyle interventions in the form of diet and physical activity 4, 5, 6, 7 and/or pharmacological interventions 8, 9 have been shown to prevent or delay the onset of T2D in individuals with prediabetes. New developments concerning biomarkers for glycaemic deterioration potentially allow a more detailed stratification of the risk of developing diabetes, its progression and evaluation of novel treatments. 10, 11, 12 Such risk stratification strategies, based on biomarkers and clinical characteristics, could allow optimizing the management of individuals with prediabetes and diabetes based on expected treatment response, pharmacological or non‐pharmacological, the likelihood of developing diabetes or complications and the potential for disease remission. 13, 14

As the number of preventive interventions for individuals with prediabetes grows, based on risk stratification or not, there is an increased need to assess whether the potential health gains justify the cost of implementation. Decision analysis models, based on computer simulations, are well suited to provide such evidence in the setting and time frame of interest to decision makers. 15 This is particularly relevant in prediabetes and diabetes, which develop over a long period of time. 1, 16, 17

Panel 1: Understanding the Role of the Healthcare System in Quality Improvement in Supporting People With Cardiometabolic Disorders

Role of Medications in Decreasing Cardiovascular Risk

An expansive portfolio of drug therapies is available for the treatment of DM and prediabetes. DM treatment is rapidly evolving. Some medications show favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with DM and CVD; promising results have been recorded in cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke, renal disease, and heart failure. The evidence base for favorable cardiovascular outcomes for these DM medications is growing. However, many additional questions still need to be addressed before evidence‐based recommendations can be implemented and widespread adoption can occur. Providers and specialists are still trying to understand how to interpret these clinical trial results, and to determine which patients are the best candidates for certain types of medications. Among the clinical questions are the following:
Which medications, if any, should be given to patients with prediabetes?
Who should make the treatment decisions and monitor for safety and side effects—the primary care physician, healthcare provider, endocrinologist, or the diabetologist?
What are the implications of these medications on healthcare costs?

Many of these questions must be addressed before current guidelines and reimbursement models can change, and before providers are likely to change their behavior.

### Metformin plus lifestyle interventions versus lifestyle interventions alone for the delay or prevention of type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^211a2b48]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Quality assessment

Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the included clinical trials using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs, which involves five domains: randomization process (selection bias), deviation from intended interventions (performance bias), outcome measurement (detection bias), missing outcome data (attrition bias), selection of reported results (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias. The authors’ assessment decisions were categorized as ‘Low risk of bias’, ‘High risk of bias’, or ‘Some concerns’. Any discrepancies between the two authors were resolved through discussion with a third author.

Publication bias

According to Egger et al. publication bias assessment is reliable only for at least 10 pooled studies. Although our meta-analysis included 12 RCTs, we could not assess the risk of publication bias due to the insufficient number of pooled RCTs in each outcome.

### Prediabetes: lifestyle, pharmacotherapy or regulation? [^208f63d0]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Thus, trials designed to test the effects of drugs on diabetes prevention have shown success in that narrow outcome, but have not shown the benefits on hard clinical outcomes needed to underpin their widespread and long-term use. However, an alternative approach among certain subgroups might emerge from a different set of trials. Trials of GLP1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors have shown major beneficial effects on both cardiovascular and renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. So impressive have been their results that there are now other trials looking at these drug classes in people without diabetes. These studies are primarily examining the effects on hard cardiovascular and renal outcomes, but since the drugs are glucose-lowering agents, and many trial participants will be at high risk of diabetes, they are also likely to show a reduced incidence of diabetes. It may therefore turn out that having failed to show cardiovascular benefit in trials aiming to prevent diabetes, we may yet achieve diabetes prevention in trials aimed at preventing cardiovascular outcomes.

### Metformin prescription for insured adults with prediabetes from 2010 to 2012: a retrospective cohort study [^0fb8182d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Prediabetes affects 1 in 3 Americans. Both intensive lifestyle intervention and metformin can prevent or delay progression to diabetes. Over the past decade, lifestyle interventions have been translated across various settings, but little is known about the translation of evidence surrounding metformin use.

Objective

To examine metformin prescription for diabetes prevention and patient characteristics that may affect metformin prescription.

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis over a 3-year period.

Setting

Employer groups that purchased health plans from the nation's largest private insurer.

Participants

A national sample of 17 352 working-age adults with prediabetes insured for 3 continuous years between 2010 and 2012.

Measurements

Percentage of health plan enrollees with prediabetes who were prescribed metformin.

Results

Only 3.7% of patients with prediabetes were prescribed metformin over the 3-year study window. After adjustment for age, income, and education, the predicted probability of metformin prescription was almost 2 times higher among women and obese patients and more than 1.5 times higher among patients with 2 or more comorbid conditions.

Limitation

Missing data on lifestyle interventions, possible misclassification of prediabetes and metformin use, and inability to define eligible patients exactly as defined in the American Diabetes Association guidelines.

Conclusion

Evidence shows that metformin is rarely prescribed for diabetes prevention in working-age adults. Future studies are needed to understand potential barriers to wider adoption of this safe, tolerable, evidence-based, and cost-effective prediabetes therapy.

Diabetes prevention in older adults with prediabetes—In patients aged 65 years and older who have prediabetes, we recommend a lifestyle program similar to the Diabetes Prevention Program to delay progression to diabetes, whereas metformin is not recommended for diabetes prevention at this time because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication; as of 2018, a Diabetes Prevention Program–like lifestyle intervention is a covered benefit for eligible Medicare beneficiaries in the United States.

### Is the current lifestyle modification approach to diabetes prevention in the U.S. a success? [^ff7ba975]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate stage between normal glycemia and diabetes and is highly prevalent, especially in adults, but is also increasingly common in young individuals. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle modification is cost-effective in preventing diabetes. Implementation studies showed the feasibility of delivering real-world structured lifestyle modification programs adapted from the U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program trial. However, the current approach to diabetes prevention in the U.S. has been largely inadequate thus far, as evidenced by the stagnant numbers of people with prediabetes and the growing number of those with diabetes. The many gaps in the implementation of the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) can be characterized as due to macro-level barriers (failures of pay-for-performance reimbursement, an undersupply of lifestyle change programs), micro-level barriers (low and disparate reach, low referral and retention rates in the program), variable fidelity in implementation, and limitations of a one-size-fits-all intervention. All of these issues point to a need for reexamining strategies for diabetes prevention in the U.S., which is yet to show benefits or value at the population level. This article details how prediabetes is currently suboptimally addressed in clinical practice and communities in the U.S. and articulates why there is an urgent need to rethink our approach to addressing prediabetes, possibly through integration of synergistic individual- and societal-levels approaches.

Pharmacological management of prediabetes—Research priorities include that “research into the pharmacological management of prediabetes should also include agents that often lead to weight loss” and “studies that help identify specific patient populations or characteristics that might benefit most from medications to prevent progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).” The page notes that “Metformin has been shown to decrease the risk for progression from prediabetes to T2DM, but the effect is relatively modest and varies with baseline characteristics,” and with newer agents capable of substantial weight loss and glucose-lowering, “an urgent need exists to know whether these medications are more effective in slowing the progression to T2DM,” so “studies comparing these newer agents with metformin will help determine their relative ability to protect against the development of T2DM” and clarify “the relative importance and extent of weight loss needed to slow the progression of T2DM.”

### Novel use and utility of integrated electronic health records to assess rates of prediabetes recognition and treatment: brief report from an integrated electronic health records pilot study [^a229a5cb]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This novel study is the first to describe the use of EHR-based measures for prediabetes identification, follow-up, and treatment. We found that <50% of patients had documented clinical follow-up in the EHR. In general, those patients with the highest immediate risk of progression to diabetes (based on higher baseline blood glucose levels and higher BMI) were somewhat more likely to receive follow-up. However, despite evidence from the DPP that metformin use in prediabetes patients may slow progression to diabetes, metformin use was low (<1%) and did not increase among those at highest risk. While some caution in adopting metformin may be due to a reluctance to “medicalize” prediabetes, future research should address barriers to metformin initiation among prediabetes patients and their providers and identify ways to target patients who may potentially benefit from its use.

A key barrier to the wider adoption of lifestyle interventions and metformin use may be a lack of strong evidence-based guidelines for primary care providers on appropriate care paths for prediabetes. Current American Diabetes Association evidence-based guidelines for prediabetes care do not specify metformin initiation for all patients, recommend a specific lifestyle program, or address elevated risk for cardiovascular disease in these patients within primary care settings. In addition, many lifestyle programs (such as that implemented by the DPP) and nutrition counseling are not broadly available as a covered benefit, which may be an additional barrier to their adoption and use. Additional research should address which types of evidence-based prediabetes care guidelines are most effective at improving outcomes and how to best encourage widespread adoption of practical evidence-based prediabetes care by patients, clinicians, and health systems.

This study has a few limitations. We used EHR data from an integrated delivery system to define follow-up care metrics for prediabetes; while some patients may have received care outside the system, utilization data for patients in this “closed” care system are complete for most patients and validated in numerous other research studies. While we searched text notes for all evidence of prediabetes counseling, notes may not document all prediabetes discussions between physicians and patients. We used one laboratory value to determine prediabetes status; however, we used retesting as a key follow-up measure to account for appropriate validation of prediabetes in clinical practice. Finally, our results are from one integrated system with high diabetes care quality that regularly uses EHRs to measure quality ; our results may not reflect care in other settings.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^8b89a89f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline—reducing progression to type 2 diabetes in prediabetes: “In individuals with prediabetes, we recommend prescribing lifestyle modification before drug therapy to reduce plasma glucose levels,” and for those with activity limitations or not responding to lifestyle modifications, “we recommend metformin as a first pharmacologic approach to reduce plasma glucose levels.” Clinical trial evidence indicates diabetes risk can be markedly reduced by lowering plasma glucose, achievable via lifestyle intervention or drug therapy; in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), both metformin and troglitazone delayed conversion of prediabetes to diabetes. Metformin reduced risk of developing diabetes by 31% over ~4 years and by 18% during 10 and 15 years of follow-up, and at the 15-year follow-up both metformin and lifestyle interventions prevented microvascular events; metformin was also estimated to be cost-saving. Thiazolidinediones have been studied (TRIPOD, DREAM), but potential harmful effects have decreased clinical use and careful harms-to-benefits assessment is advised before considering this class.

### Great debate: pre-diabetes is not an evidence-based treatment target for cardiovascular risk reduction [^9d995170]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

With the increasing burden of diabetes as a cause of macro- and microvascular disease linked to the epidemics of obesity, attention is being paid to dysglycaemic states that predict and precede the development of type 2 diabetes. Such conditions, termed pre-diabetes, are characterized by fasting plasma glucose, or plasma glucose levels on an oral glucose tolerance test, or values of glycated haemoglobin intermediate between 'normal' values and those characterizing diabetes. These last are by definition associated, in epidemiological terms, with a higher incidence of microvascular disease-mostly retinopathy. Pre-diabetes overlaps with the components of the 'metabolic syndrome'-among which are excess visceral adiposity; hypertension; hypertriglyceridaemia; high levels of small, dense low-density lipoproteins; and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease. There is little doubt that pre-diabetes has important prognostic implications, especially for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. It is disputed, however, whether pre-diabetes is itself an actionable disease entity, in addition to the risk factors characterizing it. Because of this uncertainty, the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines chose not to include pre-diabetes as a treatment target for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, at variance from the three previous editions of such guidelines. This is spurring a debate, the Pro and Contra arguments featured in the present debate article.

Methodological quality of included reviews and primary studies

Table 3 provides a summary of the AMSTAR-2 scores. Out of the 12 included reviews, one reviewreceived a high rating of overall confidence, two reviews, received a moderate rating, while three reviews,, received a low rating, and six received,,,,, a critically low rating (see Supplementary File 10 for scoring justifications). Specifically, 10 reviews (83.3%) provided a list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusions (item 7), and all reviews used a satisfactory technique for assessing the RoB in individual studies (item 9). Nine reviews (75%) discussed heterogeneity in the results (item 14) and investigated publication bias (item 15) when conducting meta-analyses. However, only six reviews (50%) fully referred to a predefined methodology (item 2), and one (8.3%) reported on the sources of funding for the included studies (item 10). Furthermore, six reviews (50%) did not employ appropriate methods for the statistical combination of meta-analysis results (item 11) and seven reviews (58.3%) did not assess the potential impact of RoB on the results (item 12). The results regarding the certainty of evidence and RoB reported by the included reviews are presented in Supplementary File 11. Two reviews, utilised the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) tool to assess glycaemic outcomes, while one reviewprovided certainty of evidence assessments using the GRADE framework.

Umbrella review synthesis methods

The overlap in component primary studies included in all eligible reviews was assessed using the Corrected Covered Area (CCA) formula: CCA = (N−r)/(rc−r), where N is the sum of total primary studies included in all the reviews, r is the number of unique primary studies, and c is the total number of reviews. The CCA ranges from 0% to 100%, with 100% indicating that all the reviews in an umbrella review included the same component original studies, and 0% indicating that each review included entirely unique original studies. The CCA was categorised based on the following cut-offs: 0%–5% as ‘slight’; 6%–10% as ‘moderate’; 11%–15% as ‘high’ and >15% as ‘very high’ overlap.

Meta-analysis results from each included review, with standardised (i.e. standardised mean difference [SMD]) or unstandardised effect sizes (i.e. weighted mean difference [WMD] in absolute units) extracted as originally reported, were displayed in forest plots. Data reported by each review were cross-checked with original data reported by the primary studies for consistency. Aggregated results were summarised using mean ranges of effect sizes, as performed previously.

Table 7—key components of continuity of care for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving lifestyle interventions—follow-up: When beginning intensive, therapeutic lifestyle changes with people diagnosed with T2D, increased attention should be placed on person monitoring in the first few weeks, especially if the person indicates they are ready and willing to make substantive eating plan changes, and ongoing follow-up visits should be scheduled regularly to assess maintenance of lifestyle changes, based on a person’s characteristics and needs. Supporting evidence states that fostering continuity of care with regular follow-up visits promotes successful adoption of lifestyle interventions and person self-care engagement, and that maintaining that relationship for regularly scheduled follow-up favors continuity of care and person metrics.

### Prevention of diabetes mellitus in patients with prediabetes [^bbc6e457]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in patients with diabetes. Consequently, as antidiabetic medications have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit, cardiologists have been asked to weigh in regarding antidiabetic therapy. The cardiologist's role will continue to grow as antidiabetic agents with cardiovascular benefit are being studied in prediabetes as part of an evolving clinical environment. Still, current guidelines primarily recommend high-intensity lifestyle intervention or metformin for diabetes prevention. Considering that many patients cared for by a cardiologist will have prediabetes, we propose herein that cardiologists can also facilitate diabetes prevention through direct intervention, referring patients to community-based high-intensity lifestyle interventions, and through advocacy, policy, and additional guideline development. The most important messaging for a patient is that avoiding new-onset diabetes can reduce microvascular disease, reduce healthcare cost, and improve health-related quality of life. Moreover, as the mortality risk of patients with a history of myocardial infarction and diabetes is almost double that of patients with a history of myocardial infarction who are free of diabetes, there is even more potential benefit in delaying and/or avoiding diabetes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite these important health advantages, the implementation of diabetes prevention strategies is lagging. The under implementation may be exaggerated by published opinions conflicting major guidelines in addition to conflicting guideline recommendations. In conclusion, we propose cardiologists can play a key role in preventing diabetes and aligning practice patterns with guideline recommendations among endocrinology, cardiology, and primary care stake holders.

### Association of prediabetes with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome: a post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials [^04dfbc16]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the early 2000s, findings from the Diabetes Prevention Program Study showed that metformin reduces the onset of new diabetes in patients with prediabetes, which was believed to be of clinical importance. A 20-year follow-up study, however, confirmed that the treatment of prediabetes with metformin did not translate into improved clinical outcomes, questioning its therapeutic use in prediabetes. Consequently, current management of prediabetes is limited to preventative measures, such as lifestyle modification and reduction of risk factors to avoid disease progression. Metformin is currently not recommended for the treatment of prediabetes. A substantial number of patients with prediabetes do not develop diabetes or even return to normal glucose regulation, which might render early pharmacologic treatment obsolete or even put patients at risk of drug-associated side effects.

In general, prediabetes alone is not an indication for antidiabetic drug therapy. Whether there are specific subgroups (e.g. men under the age of 65 years or patients with chronic kidney disease), who might potentially benefit from pharmacological treatment, can only be shown in large, randomized trials. Such trials would require an adequate follow-up period and sample size to detect differences in clinically relevant endpoints. Current evidence suggests that patients with prediabetes should be monitored more closely to detect progression to diabetes as soon as possible. This is further supported by the fact that there is often a considerable delay from onset of diabetes to diagnosis and treatment, at which point diabetic complications might have already occurred.

### Modern management of cardiometabolic continuum: from overweight / obesity to prediabetes / type 2 diabetes mellitus. recommendations from the Eastern and Southern Europe diabetes and obesity expert group [^077d9b32]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for Treatment of the Cardiometabolic Continuum

On the basis of current evidence, and clinical experiences, Eastern and Southern Europe Diabetes and Obesity Expert Group members developed the following recommendations on the management of obesity and T2D. We believe that the goal of therapy should focus on the shift from glucose-centred care to the management of obesity and cardiovascular complications. Such an approach would translate into beneficial clinical outcomes of therapy.

Recommendations:
The introduction of a first-line drug for T2D is recommended immediately at diagnosis but should always be combined with non-pharmacological measures of a healthy lifestyle.
In most cases, the first-line treatment is metformin combined with lifestyle intervention. However, we may also choose to introduce other antihyperglycaemic drugs as a first-line option depending on the patient’s cardiovascular and renal comorbidities. The decision should be individually based, taking into account comorbidities and baseline and target glycaemia levels.
If metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, treatment can be started with a drug from another pharmacological group, depending on the clinical priority of treatment.
Intensive individualised management of T2D should be introduced to postpone disease progression, and lower the risk of cardiorenal complications even if intensive hyperglycaemic therapy is not continued: HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/ml) in young subjects without complications and using medication with minimal hypoglycaemia risk. HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) if achievable without causing hypoglycaemia. HbA1c 7.5–8.0% (59–64 mmol/mol) in older patients with significant comorbidities (including CVD), or individuals who are prone to hypoglycaemia.
Disease-modifying approach in prediabetes, T2D and obesity is recommended meaning early lifestyle interventions accompanied by appropriate treatment to enable disease development hampering or even diabetes remission.
The identification of patients who are at a higher risk of delay in the intensification of the treatment (treatment intensification should be offered after 3 months from the failure to achieve metabolic goals).
Risk stratification should be performed in patients with obesity and/or T2D to define their treatment goals and adjust therapy.
CV and renal status should be checked at least once a year. Efficacy assessment as well as evaluation of possible side effects and adherence to existing pharmacological treatment are needed.
Early combination therapy is recommended in patients with T2D and obesity.
If HbA1c levels are ≥ 1.5–2.0% above the individual’s target goal, another antihyperglycaemic drug can be introduced together with metformin to increase the likelihood of achieving the glycaemic target.
Antidiabetic drug dosing adjustments, substitutions and/or addition of new antihyperglycaemic group drugs are necessary to maintain or achieve HbA1c targets. The introduction of antihyperglycaemic therapy should be monitored at 1- to 3-month intervals initially or more frequently at the discretion of the physician. Subsequently, monitoring is usually recommended within a period of 3 to 6 months.
GLP-1 RAs, especially liraglutide, semaglutide or dulaglutide, should be used in the treatment of patients with T2D and established CVD.
GLP-1 RAs are recommended as a treatment in patients with obesity to limit the risk of T2D development and decrease additional risk of other comorbidities.
The use of dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide is recommended since it provides a stronger HbA1c decrease and additional BW loss benefit in patients with obesity and T2D compared with GLP-1 RAs alone.
Non-pharmacological measures should be regularly monitored and repromoted at all follow-up examinations.
It is recommended to use an individualised approach and to adjust intensive lifestyle interventions (such as low-calorie diets, and structured exercise) in combination with pharmacotherapy to patients’ requirements, capabilities and comorbidities.
Recommended healthy dietary patterns should include vegetables, fruits, healthy protein sources, legumes, whole grains and vegetable oils, e.g. Mediterranean diet, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet and the low-carbohydrate diet (to a lesser extent)
Apart from focusing on the achievement of short-term weight loss goals, support actions to establish attained effects and to intensify them are recommended since maintaining the achieved BW is as important as the initial weight loss itself.
Bariatric surgery deserves attention in the treatment of T2D and obesity, especially in patients failing to attain glycaemic goals with pharmacotherapy plus lifestyle intervention.
Education of patients and physicians is recommended to decrease therapeutic inertia.
