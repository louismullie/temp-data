## Question

Problem 1. Let a, b, c be numbers different from zero, such that b(c+a) is the arithmetic mean of the numbers a(b+c) and c(a+b). If b = [2019/2020], calculate the arithmetic mean of the numbers [1/a], [1/b] and [1/c].

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the arithmetic mean of 1/a, 1/b, and 1/c, given that b(c + a) is the arithmetic mean of a(b + c) and c(a + b), with b = 2019/2020 and a, b, c all nonzero. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about translating the verbal condition into an algebraic equation. Then, I should simplify that equation to uncover the relationship among a, b, and c. Next, I will express the desired mean in terms of a, b, and c and substitute the relationship I found. Finally, I will plug in the given value of b and compute the numerical answer, making sure I verify each step along the way.

> Let me first translate the condition precisely. The statement "b(c + a) is the arithmetic mean of a(b + c) and c(a + b)" means b(c + a) equals one-half the sum of a(b + c) and c(a + b), so I should write that as b(c + a) = [1/2] [a(b + c) + c(a + b)] [^12e2773a].

> Wait, let me verify the expansion on the right-hand side before I proceed. a(b + c) expands to ab + ac, and c(a + b) expands to ac + bc, so their sum is ab + ac + ac + bc = ab + 2ac + bc, and half of that is [(ab + 2ac + bc)/2], which means the equation becomes b(c + a) = (ab + 2ac + bc)/2 [^12e2773a].

> I will now simplify the left-hand side and cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction. b(c + a) is bc + ab, so I have 2(bc + ab) = ab + 2ac + bc, which expands to 2bc + 2ab = ab + 2ac + bc [^12e2773a].

> Hold on, I should verify the cancellation next. Subtracting ab and bc from both sides leaves ab + bc = 2ac, and since all variables are nonzero, I can divide both sides by abc to get [1/c] + [1/a] = [2/b], which rearranges to [1/a] + [1/c] = [2/b] [^12e2773a].

> Now, I need to express the target quantity, the arithmetic mean of 1/a, 1/b, and 1/c. That mean is [(1/a + 1/b + 1/c)/3], and I can substitute 1/a + 1/c = 2/b into the numerator to get [(2/b + 1/b)/3] = [(3/b)/3] = [1/b] [^12e2773a].

> Let me double-check that substitution so I don't jump to conclusions. Yes, replacing 1/a + 1/c with 2/b gives exactly 3/b in the numerator, and dividing by 3 yields 1/b, so the mean simplifies neatly to 1/b regardless of the specific values of a and c, as long as the original condition holds [^12e2773a].

> Finally, I should plug in the given value of b. Since b = [2019/2020], the arithmetic mean of 1/a, 1/b, and 1/c is [1/b] = [2020/2019], which is the final answer [^12e2773a].

---

The arithmetic mean of ([1/a], [1/b], [1/c]) is ([2020/2019]).

---

Given that (b(c+a)) is the arithmetic mean of (a(b+c)) and (c(a+b)), we have:

b(c+a) = [(a(b+c) + c(a+b))/2]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

a(b+c) + c(a+b) = ab + ac + ac + bc = ab + 2ac + bc

So the equation becomes:

b(c+a) = [(ab + 2ac + bc)/2]

Multiply both sides by 2:

2b(c+a) = ab + 2ac + bc

Expand the left-hand side:

2bc + 2ab = ab + 2ac + bc

Subtract (ab + bc) from both sides:

ab + bc = 2ac

Divide both sides by (abc) (since (a, b, c ≠ 0)):

[1/c] + [1/a] = [2/b]

This implies:

[1/a] + [1/b] + [1/c] = [2/b] + [1/b] = [3/b]

Therefore, the arithmetic mean of ([1/a], [1/b], [1/c]) is:

[([1/a] + [1/b] + [1/c])/3] = [([3/b])/3] = [1/b]

Given (b = [2019/2020]), the mean is:

[1/b] = [2020/2019]

### Global reporting of progress towards elimination of hepatitis B and hepatitis C [^89d3bbb3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

The 69th World Health Assembly endorsed the global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. Achieving and measuring the 2030 targets requires a substantial increase in the capacity to test and treat viral hepatitis infections and a mechanism to monitor the progress of hepatitis elimination. This study aimed to identify the gaps in data availability or quality and create a new mechanism to monitor the progress of hepatitis elimination.

Methods

In 2020, using a questionnaire, we collected empirical, systematic, modelled, or surveyed data-reported by WHO country and WHO regional offices-on indicators of progress towards elimination of viral hepatitis, including burden of infection, incidence, mortality, and the cascade of care, and validated these data.

Findings

WHO received officially validated country-provided data from 130 countries or territories, and used partner-provided data for 70 countries or territories. We estimated that in 2019, globally, 295.9 million (3.8%) people were living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 57.8 million (0.8%) people were living with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Globally, there were more than 3.0 million new infections with HBV and HCV and more than 1.1 million deaths due to the viruses in 2019. In 2019, 30.4 million (95% CI 24.3–38.0) individuals living with hepatitis B knew their infection status and 6.6 million (5.3–8.3) people diagnosed with hepatitis B received treatment. Among people with HCV infection, 15.2 million (95% CI 12.1–19.0) had been diagnosed between 2015 and 2019, and 9.4 million (7.5–11.7) people diagnosed with hepatitis C infection were treated with direct-acting antiviral drugs between 2015 and 2019.

Interpretation

There has been notable global progress towards hepatitis elimination. In 2019, 30.4 million (10.3%) people living with hepatitis B knew their infection status, which was slightly higher than in 2015 (22.0 million; 9.0%), and 6.6 million (22.7%) of those diagnosed with hepatitis B received treatment, compared with 1.7 million (8.0%) in 2015. Mortality from hepatitis C has declined since 2019, driven by an increase in HCV treatment ten times that of the strategy baseline. However, an estimated 89.7% of HBV infections and 78.6% of HCV infections remain undiagnosed. A new global strategy for 2022–30, based on these new estimates, should be implemented urgently to scale up the screening and treatment of viral hepatitis.

### Impact of interannual and multidecadal trends on methane-climate feedbacks and sensitivity [^ae257adb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methane-climate feedback sensitivity and variability

To project future climate, historical global transient methane-climate sensitivity is understood as a function of global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomalies (Fig. 6a–b):

Fig. 6
Methane-climate feedback sensitivities and projected annual mean climate-feedback-contributions.

Sensitivities are expressed in ppb °C −1 (a, b) or ppb yr −1 °C −1 (c, d) vs time (a – c), latitudes (a), or just °C (d). For (e), the projected annual mean Δ C CH4, climate /Δ t curves are fitted based on values with both positive contributions and positive ΔGMST. The projected thick lines are based on extrapolation of global level sensitivities (d), and the thin lines are extrapolated similarly but based on a 10% higher calibration factor α. Solid and dashed lines are based on sensitivity trends since 01/2012 and 07/1985, respectively. The two open red circles represent preliminary estimates of Δ C CH4 / Δ t between 2020 and 2019, and between 2020 and 2018, based on a 75% of imbalance (referring to the σ in Supplementary Table 1). The respective error margins are based on two standard deviations across 12 months of the year. The filled red circle is based on 100% of imbalance between 2020 Dec and 2019 Dec. The 100% assumption is based on the reduced fossil fuel emissions which suggest the observed increase in C CH4 could be all driven by climate factors.

Figure 1.
Trends in the Share of Patients With Selected Pain Diagnoses in 2019 and 2020

The proportion of patients receiving a pain diagnosis is calculated as the ratio of the number of patients with pain to the number of patients with any claim in a week in 2019 and 2020. There were decreases around 3 major holidays as well as the national emergency declaration on March 13, 2020.

Table.
Changes in the Share of Patients With Pain and Patterns of Pain Treatment From 2019 to 2020 Across 3 COVID-19 Pandemic Phases a

Abbreviation: MMEs, morphine milligram equivalents.

Figure 2 A and B shows how patients with pain who could have received both opioids and nonpharmacologic therapy were treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of patients with pain receiving opioids decreased in the prepandemic period in 2020 compared with 2019 (−1.4%; 95% CI, −1.5% to −1.2%) but increased in the early pandemic period in 2020 compared with 2019 (3.5%; 95% CI, 3.3%-3.7%). In addition, the proportion of patients with pain receiving nonpharmacologic therapy was lower in the early pandemic period in 2020 compared with 2019 (−6.0%; 95% CI, −6.3% to −5.8%), which contradicts the prepandemic trends (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.4% to 0.8%). Patients with pain were also more likely to receive longer opioid prescriptions in the early pandemic in 2020 than in 2019 (mean difference, 1.07 days; 95% CI, 1.02–1.17 days), although this deviation quickly returned to the 2019 level in the later pandemic period (mean difference, 0.23 days; 95% CI, 0.19–0.30 days). Patients with pain received opioid prescriptions with higher doses in the early pandemic in 2020 than in 2019 (mean difference, 0.96 MMEs; 95% CI, 0.76–1.20 MMEs), although the dosage level decreased in the prepandemic period (mean difference, −1.37 MMEs; 95% CI, −1.52 to −1.2 MMEs) and decreased again in the later pandemic period. The observed changes in opioid and nonpharmacologic therapy for pain remain broadly similar for alternative definitions of the prepandemic, early pandemic, and later pandemic periods in 2020, exhibiting a decrease during state closures and early reopenings followed by subsequent recovery to 2019 levels.

### Methodology for ACOEM's occupational medicine practice guidelines-2025 revision [^d4371ac6]. ACOEM (2025). High credibility.

ACOEM evidence-based recommendations — classification and evidence synthesis methods are specified as follows: Strongly Recommended (A) requires at least 2 high-quality studies, Moderately Recommended (B) requires at least 1 high-quality and/or multiple moderate quality, and Recommended (C) requires at least one moderate quality study; additional categories include Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I); No Recommendation, Insufficient Evidence (I); Not Recommended, Insufficient Evidence (I); Not Recommended (C); Moderately Not Recommended (B); and Strongly Not Recommended (A). Insufficient Evidence is used to clearly denote expert consensus recommendations and, when evidence is either absent or substantially conflicting, to demarcate consensus-based recommendations. Final recommendation summaries include the numbers and strength of studies in a clearly defined "Rationale for Recommendation" section. When combined analyses are sensible, tests for homogeneity (I²) and/or random effects models are used and reported; many pooled analyses are drawn from Cochrane reviews provided they reasonably support summary estimates. However, pooled summary measures may be inappropriate for topics with population heterogeneity, different outcome measures, or substantially varying time intervals. After the systematic review, discrepancies with prior quality systematic reviews are addressed first in the Guideline development group and then in panel deliberations.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^68cfa501]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness thresholds — framework and updates explain that the 2014 ACC/AHA statement provided per–capita GDP–based thresholds such that an intervention with an ICER < $50 000 per QALY gained should be considered high value, $50 000 to < $150 000 (1-3x per capita GDP) per QALY gained should be considered intermediate value, and ≥ $150 000 per QALY gained should be considered low value. The World Health Organization's program suggested that costs less than 3 times the national annual GDP per capita per disability-adjusted life year averted should be considered cost-effective, whereas costs less than 1 times should be considered highly cost-effective; however, experts have argued this approach lacks theoretical justification, and World Health Organization experts now also advise against the use of per capita GDP-based cost effectiveness thresholds and instead suggest considering cost-effectiveness information alongside other contextual information in a transparent multicriterion decision process. The writing committee reviewed alternative approaches, including relying on US-based studies; for example, a health opportunity cost analysis estimated that at 2019 prices, for every $1000000 increase in health care expenditures 1860 persons were projected to become uninsured with 81 QALYs lost due to mortality and 15 QALYs lost due to morbidity, implying a cost-effectiveness threshold of $104 000 per QALY ($51 000 to $209 000 per QALY) in 2019 US dollars, and in the probabilistic analysis 40% of the simulations suggested the threshold was less than $100 000 per QALY.

### Forecasting the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths in China: a boltzmann function-based modeling study [^eeea60df]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing in China and has spread worldwide. As of March 19, 2020, there had been 80,967 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3,248 deaths in China. The epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan city and related regions in Hubei Province, has reported 67,800 confirmed cases and 3,132 deaths. Although the number of new confirmed cases has substantially decreased since February 13, 2020, and the outbreak appears to be approaching the late phase in China, grave concerns about the severity of the outbreak have arisen, especially how many patients will die overall. Here, we have estimated the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths by applying Boltzmann function–based regression analysis, an approach that we recently developed for estimating the potential total numbers of confirmed cases for both the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic.

### Trends of global burden related to HBV and HCV from 1990 to 2019: an age-period-cohort analysis [^6a01b0ba]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

The spread of disease related to Hepatitis B and C poses a significant public health problem. There have been a few studies that examine the effects of cohort and period on the trend of mortality caused by Hepatitis B and C. This analysis aims to use an age-period-cohort (APC) framework to explore trends in mortality attributed to Hepatitis B and C worldwide and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions between 1990 and 2019. The data for this analysis were taken from the Global Burden of Disease study, which was used to perform an APC analysis. The age effects reflect differences in exposure to risk factors at different stages of life. The period effects reflect population-wide exposures at a circumscribed year. The cohort effects indicate different risks across birth cohorts. The results of the analysis include both the net drift and local drift, which are reported as the annual percentage change and that by age group. The age-standardized mortality rate for Hepatitis B declined from 12.36 to 6.74 per 100000, and for Hepatitis C from 8.45 to 6.67 per 100000 between 1990 and 2019. The net drifts in mortality were -2.41% (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.47 to -2.34) for Hepatitis B and -1.16% (95% CI, -1.23 to -1.09) for Hepatitis C, with negative local drifts in most age groups. Mortality from Hepatitis B increased with age until 50+ years, while mortality from Hepatitis C rose steadily with age. The period effect for Hepatitis B was profound, suggesting effective national efforts in controlling the disease and the need for similar programs for Hepatitis B and C. Mortality varied across the world and had moderate to weak negative correlations with the SDI, which substantially decreases in the high-middle and middle SDI regions, but has persistently high rates in the low SDI region. Global efforts to manage Hepatitis B and C have shown positive trends, but variations in trends were observed across regions with divergent age, cohort, and period effects. The national efforts of a comprehensive strategy are crucial to further strengthen the elimination of Hepatitis B and C.

### Associations between state policies facilitating telehealth and buprenorphine episode initiation and duration early in the COVID pandemic: state telehealth policies and buprenorphine [^8b4bff8c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Analysis

To better understand the association between the change of status of state policies during COVID-19 and initiating new buprenorphine treatment episodes, we compared new treatment episodes from March 14 to December 31, 2020, to the same period in 2019. For each of the four policies we examined, we calculated the relative mean difference in new buprenorphine treatment episodes in states that (a) never had the policy, (b) implemented the policy prior to the declaration of the public health emergency, and (c) did not have the policy implemented prior to the public health emergency but implemented it in 2020 after the public health emergency.

To examine the association of state policies with buprenorphine episode treatment duration, we focused on the cohort starting treatment in March prior to the declaration of the public health emergency in 2020 (March 1–13, 2020). For each of the four policies we examined, we first compared the mean differences in buprenorphine treatment episode duration in days for episodes starting between March 1, 2020, and March 13, 2020, and between March 1, 2019, and March 13, 2019, in states that (a) never had the policy, (b) had the policy both prior to and after the declaration of the public health emergency, and (c) implemented the policy in 2020 after the public health emergency. We then estimated ordinary least square regressions for the treatment duration in days for episodes starting for these 2-week periods during 2019 and 2020, controlling for the change of status of each policy and states fixed effect, with robust error terms clustered at the state level. State participation in the IMLC was excluded from the regression analysis as there was no state IMLC policy change during 2020, as all states participating in the IMLC had started participating in 2019 or before.

### Variation in survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a multi-institutional analysis of 594 consecutive patients with coronavirus disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 49 hospitals within 21 States [^8e5c50b8]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We reviewed 594 consecutive patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 49 hospitals within 21 states and examined patient characteristics, treatments, and variation in outcomes over the course of the pandemic.

Methods

A multi-institutional database was used to assess all patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 cannulated for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 17, 2020, and December 20, 2021, inclusive, and separated from ECMO on or prior to January 14, 2022. Descriptive analysis was stratified by 4 time categories: group A = March 2020 to June 2020, group B = July 2020 to December 2020, group C = January 2021 to June 2021, group D = July 2021 to December 2021. A Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess continuous trends in survival where time was operationalized as the number of days between each patient's cannulation and that of the first patient in March 2020, controlling for multiple variables and risk factors.

Results

At hospital discharge, of 594 patients, 221 survived (37.2%) and 373 died. Throughout the study, median age [interquartile range] declined (group A = 51.0 [41.0–60.0] years, group D = 39.0 [32.0–48.0] years, P < .001); median days between Coronavirus Disease 2019 diagnosis and intubation increased (group A = 4.0 [1.0–8.5], group D = 9.0 [5.0–14.5], P < .001); and use of medications (glucocorticoids, interleukin-6 blockers, antivirals, antimalarials) and convalescent plasma fluctuated significantly (all P < .05). Estimated odds of survival varied over the study period with a decline between April 1, 2020, and November 21, 2020 (odds ratio, 0.39, 95% credible interval, 0.18–0.87, probability of reduction in survival = 95.7%), improvement between November 21, 2020, and May 17, 2021 (odds ratio, 1.85, 95% credible interval, 0.86–4.09, probability of improvement = 93.4%), and decline between May 17, 2021, and December 1, 2021 (odds ratio, 0.49, 95% credible interval, 0.19–1.44, probability of decrease = 92.1%).

Conclusions

Survival for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has fluctuated during the stages of the pandemic. Minimizing variability by adherence to best practices may refine the optimal use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a pandemic response.

Projection of the the number of cases with a changing transmission rate.

(a) in Bahia; (b) in Salvador, and (c) in the remaining 416 municipalities. The parameters κ = 1/4, p = 0.2, γ a = 1/3.5, γ s = 1/4 were fixed and h was set to zero for the capital and inland cities. The black dots correspond to the actual number of cases. The vertical dashed red lines are the dates of transition from β 0 to β 1. The blue dashed and full lines represent the evolution of the epidemic with a fixed transmission rate β 0 and with both β 0 and β 1, respectively. The shaded error bands represent 95% confidence intervals of the mean calculated using the weighted non-parametric bootstrap method. Raw data from March 6 to May 4, 2020 are shown in this graph.

These results show that the combined effects of changes in human behavior with the governmental policies of movement restriction resulted in significant decreases of the transmission rate, as measured by the β parameter. However, these efforts are still insufficient to curb the epidemic in the state, as the basic effective reproduction number still exceeds 1 (see Fig. 2), indicating a scenario of continuing growth. Next, we present the results of the consequence of this growth in local health resources.

Variations in the prevalence of amniotomy between hospitals were seen. For all births, the prevalence of amniotomy was highest at the hospitals with ≤ 1000 births annually and the lowest at hospitals with > 2000 births annually and at University hospitals. For Robson groups 1 and 3, the prevalence was generally lower; however, the pattern was similar. The hospitals with ≤ 1000 births annually had a higher prevalence than hospitals with more births. The University hospitals had the lowest prevalence in this group (p < 0.001). The same pattern was seen in the separate analysis of Robson group 1 and Robson group 3. For Robson group 1, the prevalence of amniotomy ranged from 33.6% at the hospital with the lowest prevalence to 61.8% at the hospital with the highest prevalence (Table 3).

### Patterns of US mental health-related emergency department visits during the COVID-19 pandemic [^4dd43f66]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Weekly Patterns

The Figure depicts weekly time trends over the 10 HHS regions for total ED visits, MH-related ED visits, and proportion of ED visits due to MH conditions by week. Total ED visits had a comparable stable trend for 2019 and 2020 during the weeks leading up to the second week of March (Figure, A). The mean (SD) number of weekly ED visits for each region was 135 260 (101 009) in 2019, which decreased to 115 277 (90 512) in 2020 once the global pandemic was declared (Table 1). The number of total ED visits in 2021 started lower than in 2020 and 2019 but eventually returned to 2019 levels during weeks 24 to 35, resulting in a mean (SD) of 128 022 (96 796) visits per week-region in 2021.

The absolute number of MH-related ED visits increased slightly until mid-March in 2019, while the number of MH-related visits over the same period in 2020 was higher than in 2019 and fairly stable (Figure, B). Once the global pandemic was declared in 2020, the total number of MH-related ED visits decreased sharply compared with the same weeks in 2019. While the total number of MH-related ED visits increased later in summer 2020, it remained lower than that in 2019 for similar weeks. The mean (SD) number of weekly MH-related ED visits was 9886 (7076) in 2019, which decreased to 9337 (6917) in 2020 (Table 1). The total number of MH-related ED visits in 2021 began at a lower level than in 2020 and was comparable with the 2019 level. The number of MH visits remained fairly stable throughout 2021 at levels lower than in 2019 during the same weeks. The mean (SD) total number of MH-related ED visits per week-region was 8901 (6201) in 2021.

### A plant-by-plant strategy for high-ambition coal power phaseout in China [^f44341c4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For the new "Beyond 2010" vintage, we exogenously specify the 2015 vintage to the historical values, and 2020 vintages to those currently under construction. We assume the 2015 generation values to hold true for 2020 for power plants that were operating between 2011 and 2015. We calculate projected generation from power plants that started operation (or were expected to do so in the case of dates beyond 2018) between 2016 and 2020. We add the two values to obtain an expected "Beyond 2010" vintage 2020 generation value for each province.

For 2020, total coal power generation is matched with 2018 data. Since the model runs at a five-year interval, we use 2018 generation data to approximate the trend between 2015 and 2020. Starting in the next model period of 2025, the model finds the most cost-effective pathways to achieve the 1.5 °C or 2 °C climate targets through a global carbon price. When converting to the coal plants retirement pathways (GW), our baseline value is based on the plant-level data up to May 2019, and we used a linear interpolation between the 2019 data and the first model period in 2025, and between all model periods thereafter, to calculate the annual retirement pathways.

Our scenario shows that both global and China's net CO 2 emissions peak around 2020, and then China reaches net-zero emissions by 2055 under 1.5 °C and by 2070 under 2 °C, while the world reaches net-zero carbon five years earlier under each target (Fig. 5a, b). This is associated with global and China conventional coal power generation also peaking in 2020, and being phased out around 2040 and 2050, under 1.5 °C and 2 °C, respectively (Fig. 5c, d). China's total power generation will increase to about 12,500 TWh under 2 °C and to about 14,500 TWh under 1.5 °C by 2050, mainly supplied by solar and other renewable energies (Fig. 5c).

### Why won' T you change your mind? Knowledge of operational patterns hinders learning and performance on equations [^6b833856]. Child Development (2005). Low credibility.

This study examined whether knowledge of arithmetic contributes to difficulties with equations. In Experiment 1, children (ages 7–11) completed tasks to assess their adherence to 3 operational patterns prevalent in arithmetic: (a) the strategy of performing all given operations on all given numbers, (b) the "operations = answer" problem structure, and (c) the concept that the equal sign means "the total". Next, children received a lesson on equations; then, they solved a set of equations. There was a negative relationship between adherence to the operational patterns and learning. In Experiment 2, undergraduates' knowledge of the operational patterns was activated or not. Students whose knowledge was activated did not perform as well on equations. Results suggest that early-learned patterns constrain future learning and performance.

Table 1.
Summary of the Estimated Total Numbers of COVID-19 Deaths in China

Note. SD, standard deviation; CI, confidence interval.

One issue regarding our analyses is that some COVID-19 deaths might be misreported such that the reported numbers of deaths represent a lower limit. For instance, 134 new deaths were suddenly counted from > 13,000 clinically diagnosed patients in Hubei Province on February 12, 2020 (as clearly indicated by a sudden increase in deaths) (Fig. 1 B). Another uncertainty might result from those unidentified COVID-19 deaths that occurred in the early phase of the outbreak. We applied the Monte Carlo method (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Information online) to estimate such uncertainty assuming that the relative uncertainty of the reported numbers of deaths follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 2.5%. The potential total numbers of COVID-19 deaths were estimated to be 3,260 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3187–3394) in China; 110 (95% CI, 109–112) in Hubei Province; 3,174 (95% CI, 3095–3270) outside Hubei; 2,550 (95% CI, 2494–2621) in Wuhan City; and 617 (95% CI, 607–632) outside Wuhan (Fig. 1 E and Supplementary Fig.online). These numbers are slightly higher than those estimated without uncertainty (Table 1).

### State estimation of a physical system with unknown governing equations [^794152e0]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

State estimation is concerned with reconciling noisy observations of a physical system with the mathematical model believed to predict its behaviour for the purpose of inferring unmeasurable states and denoising measurable ones 1,2. Traditional state-estimation techniques rely on strong assumptions about the form of uncertainty in mathematical models, typically that it manifests as an additive stochastic perturbation or is parametric in nature 3. Here we present a reparametrization trick for stochastic variational inference with Markov Gaussian processes that enables an approximate Bayesian approach for state estimation in which the equations governing how the system evolves over time are partially or completely unknown. In contrast to classical state-estimation techniques, our method learns the missing terms in the mathematical model and a state estimate simultaneously from an approximate Bayesian perspective. This development enables the application of state-estimation methods to problems that have so far proved to be beyond reach. Finally, although we focus on state estimation, the advancements to stochastic variational inference made here are applicable to a broader class of problems in machine learning.

### Effects of COVID-19 lockdown strategies on emergency medical services [^6fadb516]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study is to evaluate the change in the number of EMS cases by comparing the lockdown period, the non-lockdown period, and the pre-pandemic period.

Methods

In our study, 3 periods of EMS cases were compared to evaluate the effect of lockdown. The first period (Period A) included in the study was the lockdown period (01-12-2020 and 31-01-2021. The second period (period B) is the period between 01 and 10–2020 and 30-11-2020, where there was no lockdown despite the pandemic. The third period (period C) in the study is the period between 01 and 12–2019 and 31-01-2020 before the pandemic.

Results

A total of 120,989 cases in 3 periods were included in the study. It was determined that the highest number of patients were in period C (42,703, 35.3%), while the least was in period A (39,054, 32.2%). On the other hand, it was found that the number of calls was highest in period A (246,200, 35.1%), while the least was in period C (212,267, 30.2%). Response times were longer in the pandemic period than in the pre-pandemic period. Mean talk time were longer during the pandemic period. The most frequent diagnosis in period A (21.6%) and B (42.2%) was COVID-19. The second most frequent disease group in these two periods was cardiovascular diseases.

Conclusion

While the number of EMS cases decreased during the pandemic period, it decreased even more during the lockdown period. However, the number of calls increased significantly during the lockdown period, and the response times and talk times increased accordingly.

### COVID-19 related reduction in pediatric emergency healthcare utilization-a concerning trend [^5ca5d3df]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, n = 5,424 visits occurred during the analysed period between January 1st and April 19th 2019 and January 1st and April 19th of 2020 in the pediatric ED of our hospital. The mean age of all patients included in this analysis was 7.1 years (± SEM 0.1 yrs.), and 49.5% of cases were female. Given that primary pediatric care in Germany is usually provided by pediatric practices during weekdays and lockdown did not include closure of pediatric practices, in both observational periods more visits to the ED occurred during weekends. Overall, a mean of 16.4 ± SEM 1.5 visits per day on Saturday/Sunday as compared to 13.5 ± SEM 0.4 per weekday occurred. When we compared daily visit frequencies between 2019 and 2020, we observed a striking reduction in the number of patients presenting to the ED after March 16th 2020, the day that school closures and a nationwide lockdown began (Fig. 1 a).

Fig. 1
Reduced pediatric emergency healthcare utilization after the implementation of pandemic-related lockdown in Germany: A: daily number of visits between January 1st and April 19th 2019 (blue) vs. 2020 (red) including dates of COVID-19 related policy in Germany. B: visits per day in calendar weeks 12 to 15, C/D: visits per day within (C) and outside (D) ED daytime service in calendar weeks 12 to 15. E: increased proportion of daily visits of patients younger than one year (bars display mean + SEM (B-E) with overlaying dots representing single daily values, ✱✱ p ≤ 0.01, ✱✱ p ≤ 0.001)

In calendar weeks 12 to 15 of 2020, case numbers decreased by 63.8% compared to the same time period in 2019 (Table 1; Fig. 1 b). This reduction in emergency healthcare utilization was observed during daytime as well as overnight (Table 1; Fig. 1 c, d).

### Current epistemological problems in evidence based medicine [^14e22831]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence based medicine has been a topic of considerable controversy in medical and health care circles over its short lifetime, because of the claims made by its exponents about the criteria used to assess the evidence for or against the effectiveness of medical interventions. The central epistemological debates underpinning the debates about evidence based medicine are reviewed by this paper, and some areas are suggested where further work remains to be done. In particular, further work is needed on the theory of evidence and inference; causation and correlation; clinical judgment and collective knowledge; the structure of medical theory; and the nature of clinical effectiveness.

### The relationship of large city out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and the prevalence of COVID-19 [^8c0b635d]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Month by month percent change in the total number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) cases (y-axis) occurring in March, April, May and June 2020, respectively, when compared to the corresponding month by month average for the previous two years in several non-U.S. cities (x-axis).

Despite widespread stay-at-home directives and significantly fewer visitors, commuters and tourists, by April (Fig. 1 b), the absolute number of OHCA cases across all 50 cities increased from 7257 (2018–2019 averages for April) to 11,564, a one-month increase of 4307 (59.3%) collectively. Altogether, the overall mean number of OHCA cases/city in April for all 50 cities combined rose from 144 mean cases per city (averaging 2018–2019) to 231 mean cases per city in 2020 (p = 0.03). Also during April, 34 of the 50 cities experienced > 20% increases in OHCA (Fig. 1 b). Irrespective of any potential local problem with available testing during that critical early month, nearly 90% (n = 30) of these cities were already in the highest attack rate category for documented COVID-19 cases/100,000 using the most recent CDC criteria. Moreover, 13 of these 34 cities had > 1.5-fold increases in OHCA and three widely-recognized COVID-19 epicenters more than doubled their usual OHCA numbers (including a 2.5-fold increase in New York City). Meanwhile, many cities with relatively low COVID-19 prevalence in April such as Charleston, South Carolina (Figs. 1 b, 2 c) and Madison, Wisconsin (Figs. 1 b, 2 d), had no increases in OHCA compared to prior years or even lower frequencies (Fig. 1 b).

### Target control of complex networks [^8b4baa21]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Results

Model

The dynamics of most real systems is driven by nonlinear processes. However, the dynamical rules of real-world networks are so diverse that writing a general dynamical equation that captures them all is plainly impossible. Moreover, for many networks, especially biological networks, we do not even know the dynamical rules. Thus, before we explore the fully nonlinear dynamical problem, we have to understand the impact of the topological characteristics on linear control, which naturally serves as a prerequisite of the nonlinear controllability problem. Furthermore, the controllability of nonlinear systems is often structurally similar to and determined by the system's linearized dynamics. Indeed, a basic starting point for exploring the controllability of any nonlinear system is the study of the linearized version of the nonlinear dynamical system. Therefore, we start with the canonical linear time-invariant dynamics.

where, andrepresent the system's state, input and output vector, respectively.anddenote the state, input and output matrices, respectively. A captures the wiring diagram of the system; B identifies the nodes that are controlled by an external controller and u is the time-dependent input applied to the nodes in B; C is the output matrix identifying the target nodes we want to control. For a network with node set, we are interested in controlling a target node setof size. We set the output matrix C = [I (c 1), I (c 2). I (c S)], where I (i) denotes the i th row of an N × N identity matrix I. The system (A, B, C) is said to be target controllable with respect to a given target node set C if there exists a time-dependent input vector u (t) = (u 1 (t). u M (t)) T that can drive the state of the target nodes to any desired final state in finite time. Target controllability can be viewed as a special type of output controllability and the system (A, B, C) is target controllable if and only if the dimension of the output controllable subspace d (A, B, C) satisfies

### Simple solution to a common statistical problem: interpreting multiple tests [^3ce57fa0]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The misinterpretation of the results of multiple statistical tests is an error commonly made in scientific literature. When testing several outcome variables simultaneously, many researchers declare a statistically significant result for each test having a P value of < 0.05, for example. This approach ignores the fact that, based on a probability result called the Bonferroni inequality, the risk of incorrectly declaring as significant ≥ 1 test result increases with the number of tests conducted. The implication of this practice is that many scientific results are presented as statistically significant when the underlying data do not adequately support such a claim (sometimes referred to as false-positive results). Although the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test is well known among statisticians, it is not used routinely in scientific literature.

Objective

The intent of this article was to increase the awareness and understanding of the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test, thereby expanding its use.

Methods

This article describes the statistical problem and demonstrates how the use of the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test ensures that incorrect declarations of statistical significance for ≥ 1 test result are bounded by 0.05, for example.

Conclusion

The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test is an easily applied, versatile statistical tool that enables researchers to make simultaneous inferences from their data without risking an unacceptably high overall type I error rate.

### A multi-step model of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis [^d33ef0c7]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder across the world. Its burgeoning prevalence and associated societal impact makes developing effective preventative therapies a global health issue, but incomplete understanding of PD pathogenesis limits this goal. Over time, many mechanisms for disease development have been posited, including genetic, inflammatory, infectious, and other environmental exposures. Most current models of pathogenesis acknowledge the likelihood that, in most people, the development of the pathological changes that define PD is the final product of a complex interaction between many of these potential etiological factors. Although these observations suggest that PD might develop as a multistep process, empirical evidence for such an overarching framework is lacking, as are specific details such as the number of pathogenic steps required to cause the disease.

The application of techniques developed to understand another common disorder — cancer — to the field of neurodegeneration shows promise for elucidating disease mechanisms. In particular, a strong body of research demonstrates how epidemiological data can be used to infer the underlying pattern of cancer development, and whether a multistep process is likely to be present. Specifically, Armitage and Doll demonstrated that if the onset of a disease requires multiple prior steps, each with a relatively low probability of occurring per year, then a power relationship will exist between the incidence of the disease and age (Box 1 and see Webster 2019 for a full derivation)Furthermore, the exponent in this power relationship (ie, the slope of the log–log line) is one less than the total number of steps required to cause the disease. This insight has significantly enhanced the understanding of cancer biology. Furthermore, the potential utility of this approach for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions has been demonstrated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where the incidence rate was found to increase with age in a manner predicted by a multistage process requiring six events for disease development. Additionally, the contribution of single monogenic "causes" of ALS reduces the required number of steps to between two and five depending on the mutation.

For both the x- and y-axis, a particular distance anywhere along the axis should represent the same increase in quantity, although the x- and y-axis usually differ in what is measured. The y-axis, measuring frequency, should begin at zero. But the x-axis, which often measures time, need not start at zero.

### Estimating global, regional, and national daily and cumulative infections with SARS-CoV-2 through nov 14, 2021: a statistical analysis [^5284c7ec]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

R effective estimation in the past

Using daily infections, we directly estimated R effective in the past by location and day, where R effective at time t is:

The assumptions required for this estimation are the duration from infection to being infectious and the period of infectiousness, collectively represented as θ. We used ranges of 3–5 days for both assumptions to generate estimates of R effective in the past. These estimates are useful for identifying the effect of different non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission in different settings. An R effective lower than 1.0 indicates that the epidemic is shrinking, whereas an R effective higher than 1.0 indicates that the epidemic is growing.

We compared R effective to an estimate of total immunity in the population of location l at time t (presented as weekly averages), where this value is calculated as:

The proportion of the population effectively vaccinated is a function of doses administered and brand-specific efficacy and is discounted for existing natural immunity at the time of delivery.

### A computational modeling study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh [^58f762cd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally. Only three cases in Bangladesh were reported on March 8, 2020. Here, we aim to predict the epidemic progression for 1 year under different scenarios in Bangladesh. We extracted the number of daily confirmed cases from March 8 to July 20, 2020. We considered the suspected-infected-removed (SIR) model and performed a maximum likelihood-based grid search to determine the removal rate (ɣ). The transmission was modeled as a stochastic random walk process, and sequential Monte Carlo simulation was run 100 times with bootstrap fits to infer the transmission rate (β) and R t. According to the simulation, the (real) peak daily incidence of 3,600 would be followed by a steady decline, reaching below 1,000 in late January 2021. Thus, the model predicted that there would still be more than 300 cases/day even after a year. However, with proper interventions, a much steeper decline would be achieved following the peak. If we apply a combined (0.8β, 1.2ɣ) intervention, there would be less than 100 cases by mid-October, only around five odd cases at the beginning of the year 2021, and zero cases in early March 2021. The predicted total number of deaths (in status quo) after 1 year would be 8,533 which would reduce to 3,577 if combined (0.8β, 1.2ɣ) intervention is applied. We have also predicted the ideal number of tests that Bangladesh should perform and based on that redid the whole simulation. The outcome, though worse, would be manageable with interventions according to the simulation.

### Temporal associations among body mass index, fasting insulin, and systemic inflammation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^65d9e9f4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Obesity is associated with a number of noncommunicable chronic diseases and is purported to cause premature death.

Objective

To summarize evidence on the temporality of the association between higher body mass index (BMI) and 2 potential mediators: chronic inflammation and hyperinsulinemia.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1946 to August 20, 2019) and Embase (from 1974 to August 19, 2019) were searched, although only studies published in 2018 were included because of a high volume of results. The data analysis was conducted between January 2020 and October 2020.

Study Selection and Measures

Longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials that measured fasting insulin level and/or an inflammation marker and BMI with at least 3 commensurate time points were selected.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Slopes of these markers were calculated between time points and standardized. Standardized slopes were meta-regressed in later periods (period 2) with standardized slopes in earlier periods (period 1). Evidence-based items potentially indicating risk of bias were assessed.

Results

Of 1865 records, 60 eligible studies with 112 cohorts of 5603 participants were identified. Most standardized slopes were negative, meaning that participants in most studies experienced decreases in BMI, fasting insulin level, and C-reactive protein level. The association between period 1 fasting insulin level and period 2 BMI was positive and significant (β = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13–0.38; I2 = 79%): for every unit of SD change in period 1 insulin level, there was an ensuing associated change in 0.26 units of SD in period 2 BMI. The association of period 1 fasting insulin level with period 2 BMI remained significant when period 1 C-reactive protein level was added to the model (β = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.27–0.86). In this bivariable model, period 1 C-reactive protein level was not significantly associated with period 2 BMI (β = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.42 to 0.29; I2 = 81%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, the finding of temporal sequencing (in which changes in fasting insulin level precede changes in weight) is not consistent with the assertion that obesity causes noncommunicable chronic diseases and premature death by increasing levels of fasting insulin.

### Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity [^6f9c90ae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To improve the sensitivity for a large range, initially, a number of measurements with different areas are combined to uniquely define the magnetic field amplitude in a range limited by the measurement with the smallest area (Fig. 1d). Consequently, only part of the measurement time is spent on the largest area, which has the best sensitivity (but a small range), while the remainder of the time is spent on areas with a worse sensitivity. Therefore, the sensitivity of the combined measurement is strictly worse than this best sensitivity. Using halved areas (hence requiring at leastadditional areas) and the same number of iterations for each area and using no optimisations, for roughly the same σ B, the measurement time for the combined sequence. Thus, the sensitivity would becometimes worse, which is already a significant improvement compared to the straightforward case in the last paragraph.

The measurements resulting from different areas are combined via Bayes' theorem. For area A n, the measurement gives signal S n (for example the crosses/circles/triangles on the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d for three areas). The posterior probability distribution for the magnetic field B given measured signal S n iswiththe prior distribution, independent of B, andwiththe relation between the signal S and the applied field B (the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d, e). Fig. 1e visualises these equations.is a Poisson distribution (counting photons), but it can be approximated by a normal distribution (green line along y -axis in Fig. 1e) when more than ~10 photons arrive (with continuity correction). This is generally the case when the uncertainty is below the maximum uncertainty, as described later. For the first measurement, the prior distribution is flat since there is no initial knowledge about the field, and for the remainder of the measurements, the previous posterior is the new prior distribution. This results in a combined distribution as demonstrated in Fig. 1f.

### Trends in breast cancer screening in a safety-net hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic [^080b19f3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

A total of 9291 screening mammograms were performed from January 1, 2019, to January 31, 2021: 5662 during 2019, with a mean of 472 mammograms per month (95% CI, 430–514 mammograms), and 3385 in 2020 (60% of the 2019 volume) (Figure 1 A). During the first stay-at-home order (February 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020), the number of screening mammograms decreased to 194 in March (41% of baseline [mean of 472 mammograms per month during 2019]) and to 0 in April (Figure 1 B). The number of missed appointments increased during 2020, with 127 of 321 (40%) missed in March, compared with 585 of 2764 (21%) from September 2019 to January 2020 (pre–COVID-19) (Figure 1 C). During the reopening phase (June 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020), the number of screening mammograms increased but remained below baseline, except in October, when 496 mammograms were completed. The number of screening mammograms declined during the second stay-at-home order. The mobile mammography unit volume decreased from 831 during 2019 to 248 in 2020, with 0 mammograms between April and June 2020.

### Limitations to teaching children 2 + 2 = 4: typical arithmetic problems can hinder learning of mathematical equivalence [^31e4b42e]. Child Development (2008). Low credibility.

Do typical arithmetic problems hinder learning of mathematical equivalence? Second and third graders (7–9 years old; N = 80) received lessons on mathematical equivalence either with or without typical arithmetic problems (e.g., 15 + 13 = 28 vs. 28 = 28, respectively). Children then solved math equivalence problems (e.g., 3 + 9 + 5 = 6 + _), switched lesson conditions, and solved math equivalence problems again. Correct solutions were less common following instruction with typical arithmetic problems. In a supplemental experiment, fifth graders (10–11 years old; N = 19) gave fewer correct solutions after a brief intervention on mathematical equivalence that included typical arithmetic problems. Results suggest that learning is hindered when lessons activate inappropriate existing knowledge.

### Is a one-size-fits-all'12-month rule' appropriate when it comes to the last search date in systematic reviews? [^71179c4e]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

SRs are a recognised research approach for identifying, synthesising and analysing published evidence on topics of interest. Their aim is to provide a comprehensive, unbiased and trustworthy assessment of available evidence to support decision-makers in adopting policies that 'do more good than harm'. Indeed, policy makers, researchers, practitioners and public stakeholders from within and outside of healthcare, place increased emphasis on the importance of conducting SRs. Although the rationale for conducting SRs remains the same, the process of systematic reviewing has changed significantly in recent years. Technological advances and automation have helped to speed up processes such as study identification. However, additional steps in the review process, reflecting new understandings about how to ensure SR findings are robust and relevant to policy decision-makers' questions, have increased the work required. Continued increases in available published evidence have also increased the volume of research included and analysed in SRs. We suggest that there are two key factors that have significant time implications for reviewers today.

Breadth and depth of review questions impacts on the extent of work required

While historically SR questions were designed to be narrow, the Cochrane Handbook recognises that 'Increasingly, reviews are becoming broader, aiming, for example, to identify which intervention — out of a range of treatment options — is most effective, or to investigate how an intervention varies depending on implementation and participant characteristics'. Review methods have evolved, resulting in a rich diversity of SRs in relation to the types of questions, review approaches and research methods. In figure 1, we provide examples to characterise different types of reviews that explore intervention effectiveness and the questions they seek to answer. Although we focus on reviews addressing intervention effectiveness, the breadth and complexity of reviews addressing other types of question is also likely to vary.

Figure 1
Variation in the breadth and complexity of reviews addressing intervention effectiveness.

There are numerous factors that may impact on the time required to complete broad, complex or multicomponent reviews and thus increase their risk of remaining unpublished. Below we discuss six key factors.

### Selecting fitted models under epistemic uncertainty using a stochastic process on quantile functions [^bb9b7f12]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

After n refinement steps, we thus obtain a functiondefined at discrete points:which we extend to the entire interval [0, 1) by linear interpolation; see Fig. 5 d for an illustration. In practice we found that computations (specifically the risk computed by integrating) converge after about eight refinement steps.

This procedure has the important property that once a point is sampled, it does not change on further refinements:which follows from equation (67). Recall now that, as stated above, a process is self-consistent if "for small enough Δ Φ, the probability distribution at a point Φ [does] not depend on the level of refinement". Since equation (70) clearly satisfies that requirement, we see that the process obtained after infinitely many refinement steps is indeed self-consistent. We thus define the hierarchical beta (HB) process as

To complete the definition of, we need to specify how we choose the initial end pointsand. In our implementation, they are drawn from normal distributionswith Φ ∈ {0, 1}, where again c is determined via our proposed calibration procedure; this is simple and convenient, but otherwise arbitrary. We also need to explain how we choose the beta parameters α and β, which is the topic of the next subsection.

Choosing beta distribution parameters

All HB processes are monotone, continuous and self-consistent, but within this class there is still a lot of flexibility: since α and β are chosen independently for each subinterval, we can mouldinto a wide variety of statistical shapes. We use this flexibility to satisfy the two remaining desiderata: a) that realisationstrackover Φ ∈ [0, 1]; and b) that the variability ofbe proportional to. It is the goal of this subsection to give a precise mathematical meaning to those requirements.

Let x 1 ~ Beta(α, β) and x 2 = 1 − x 1. (The density function of a beta distribution is given in (24).) The mean and variance of x 1 areFor a given Φ, it may seem natural to select α and β by matchingtoandto. However both equations are tightly coupled, and we found that numerical solutions were unstable and unsatisfactory; in particular, it is not possible to make the variance large whenapproaches either 0 or 1 (otherwise the distribution of x 1 would exceed [0, 1]).

### COVID-19 related reduction in pediatric emergency healthcare utilization-a concerning trend [^f49d756f]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

This was confirmed by a separate analysis comparing the frequency of daily visits for noncommunicable diseases in calendar weeks 12 to 15 of 2019 to the same period in 2020. Here, a significant decrease (58%) (Table 1; Fig. 2 c) was observed.

Daily visits for suspected or confirmed communicable diseases displayed a significant decrease (70.2%) in the four weeks after lockdown began (Table 1; Fig. 2 c). The proportion of daily patients with infectious diseases or signs and symptoms of infection, however, did not differ significantly between calendar weeks 12 to 15 from one year to another (Table 1; Fig. 2 e).

We also investigated the specific complaints leading to pediatric ED visits in the calendar weeks 12 to 15 in 2019 and 2020. In both years, a proportion of diagnoses was either unknown or unspecific (in total 45.6% of diagnoses in 2019 and 32.9% of diagnoses in 2020). For reported diagnoses, the pattern of distribution was similar in both years. This held true even for critically ill patients. For example, during the four week period we analysed, we observed three seizures in 2019, and two seizures in 2020. As shown in Fig. 3 a, however, some variation was observed, such as a larger proportion of patients presenting with malignant or neoplastic diseases in 2020 (1.6% 2019 vs. 11.6% in 2020). This change was confirmed by comparing absolute patients numbers (Fig. 3 b). The only disease category with increased daily ER visits after the lockdown began was that of malignant/neoplastic disease (Table 1; Fig. 3). For the vast majority of noncommunicable diseases, daily visits were reduced (Fig. 2 b). For example, complaints or diagnoses affecting the gastrointestinal system showed a significant decrease of 77.8%, cases of intoxication or injury showed a significant 68.8% reduction, and diagnoses and complaints affecting the eyes or ear were reduced significantly by 89.5% in 2020 compared to 2019 (Table 1; Fig. 3).

### A multi-step model of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis [^2a43be2e]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Parkinson's disease (PD) may result from the combined effect of multiple etiological factors. The relationship between disease incidence and age, as demonstrated in the cancer literature, can be used to model a multistep pathogenic process, potentially affording unique insights into disease development.

Objectives

We tested whether the observed incidence of PD is consistent with a multistep process, estimated the number of steps required and whether this varies with age, and examined drivers of sex differences in PD incidence.

Methods

Our validated probabilistic modeling process, based on medication prescribing, generated nationwide age‐ and sex‐adjusted PD incidence data spanning 2006–2017. Models of log(incidence) versus log(age) were compared using Bayes factors, to estimate (1) if a linear relationship was present (indicative of a multistep process); (2) the relationship's slope (one less than number of steps); (3) whether slope was lower at younger ages; and (4) whether slope or y ‐intercept varied with sex.

Results

Across > 15,000 incident cases of PD, there was a clear linear relationship between log(age) and log(incidence). Evidence was strongest for a model with an initial slope of 5.2 [3.8, 6.4], an inflexion point at age 45, and beyond this a slope of 6.8 [6.4, 7.2]. There was evidence for the intercept varying by sex, but no evidence for slope being sex‐dependent.

Conclusions

The age‐specific incidence of PD is consistent with a process that develops in multiple, discrete steps – on average six before age 45 and eight after. The model supports theories emphasizing the primacy of environmental factors in driving sex differences in PD incidence. © 2021 The Authors.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2020–2021 [^4b35abd7]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

2019–2020 influenza season in US children — circulating strains, antigenic similarity, activity, and antivirals: The 2019–2020 influenza season was unusual and complicated by the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in early 2020, with influenza activity beginning early in October 2019, continuing through mid-March 2020, and then declining abruptly after social distancing measures. The season was of moderate severity, with 3 peaks of influenza-like illness activity and the highest pediatric hospitalization rate reported at 68 per 100 000 population overall. Although influenza B/Victoria predominated early, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most predominant circulating strain; A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata together represented approximately 4.1% and 0.8% of circulating strains, respectively. Antigenically, the majority of characterized A(H1N1)pdm09 (82.5%) and B/Victoria (59.7%) viruses were similar to the 2019–2020 vaccine components, whereas less than half of A(H3N2) were similar (46.5%); the predominant A(H3N2) clade was 3C.2a, subclade 3C.2a1, with cocirculation of a small proportion of 3C.3a. Susceptibility to available antiviral agents remained greater than 99% overall, but 0.5% of A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates tested by CDC exhibited highly reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and peramivir, and reduced susceptibility to baloxavir had not been reported in the United States to date. Preliminary estimates of vaccine effectiveness against medically attended influenza illness from the US Flu VE Network are shown in Table 1 and are not vaccine specific.

### Statistical analysis and optimality of neural systems [^bf829ef6]. Neuron (2021). Medium credibility.

Normative theories and statistical inference provide complementary approaches for the study of biological systems. A normative theory postulates that organisms have adapted to efficiently solve essential tasks and proceeds to mathematically work out testable consequences of such optimality; parameters that maximize the hypothesized organismal function can be derived ab initio, without reference to experimental data. In contrast, statistical inference focuses on the efficient utilization of data to learn model parameters, without reference to any a priori notion of biological function. Traditionally, these two approaches were developed independently and applied separately. Here, we unify them in a coherent Bayesian framework that embeds a normative theory into a family of maximum-entropy "optimization priors". This family defines a smooth interpolation between a data-rich inference regime and a data-limited prediction regime. Using three neuroscience datasets, we demonstrate that our framework allows one to address fundamental challenges relating to inference in high-dimensional, biological problems.

### Revealing the predictability of intrinsic structure in complex networks [^dbc2a588]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Compression algorithm

Our compression scheme builds upon the seminal paper of, which is a two-step lossless compression of graphs. First we encode a network into two binary sequences B 1, B 2, through traversing all nodes on the network from an initial node, and encode nodes' neighbors according to specific rules. In the second stage, both B 1, B 2 are compressed by an improved arithmetic encoder based on recursive splitting proposed by K. Skrettingto exploit the dependencies between the symbols of the sequence. After that we obtain two compressed binary sequences, and we define the compression length of the network L to be the total length of these two sequences:where, are the length ofand, respectively. More details about the algorithm is provided in Supplementary Note 2.

Upper and Lower Bounds of p 1 and P C

Here we demonstrate how to identify the upper and lower bounds of link prediction precision p 1 and P C. The basic idea is to transform these problems into optimization problems of certain boundary conditions. Firstly, we calculate the network's BPAA performance entropythrough its shortest compression length L * given by Eq. (3). Its un-normalized value is, and by the definition of entropy it can be written asThere are two constraints for p i s. The first is that they sum up to unity, i.e.and:as they are arranged in decreasing order.

With these boundary conditions, p 1 is maximized when the other probabilities are equal. Then it can be found that the upper bound of p 1 is given by Eq. (10).

And the minimum value of p 1 is when there are as many p i s as close to p 1 as possible, leading to a lower bound given by Eq. (11).

For predictability of the top C intervals, the upper bound corresponds to the case when the last N ∕2 − C probabilities are the same, yielding

For the lower bound of P C, the value of p C can be introduced to construct the minimization problem. It has the boundary condition of 0 ≤ p C ≤ P C ∕ C. The approximate lower bound is the solution of the following:The more detailed mathematics is provided in Supplementary Note 10.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^b27697b8]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute pain management — opinion-based evidence and survey scaling describe how nonempirical input informs the Guidelines. All opinion-based evidence relevant to each topic was considered; however, only the findings obtained from formal surveys are reported, and identical surveys were distributed to expert consultants and ASA members.

### Regional and national trends in consumption of antimicrobials in Pakistan; pre and post-COVID (2019–2021) [^ea064a2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Cumulative Consumption of Antibiotics-National Estimates

Antibiotic consumption was calculated for all antibiotics used during the study period of 3 years (2019–2021). Overall national consumption increased from 24.8 DID in 2019 to 44.1DIDs in 2021 (Figure 1 A), which is also reflected in the increase in both per-oral and intravenous administration (Figure 1 B). Regional consumption also followed the same trend, demonstrating increasing usage of antibiotics between 2020 and 2021 (Figure 1 C). For national estimates, cumulative DID represents the overall consumption of all antibiotics and showed an increase of 20 DID between years 2020 and 2021. When stratified by route of administration, an increase from 5.9 DID to 8.5 DID was observed between 2020 and 2021 in intravenous administration. The Increase in oral consumption (18 DID in 2020, 36 DID in 2021) was 2-fold and was significantly greater as compared to intravenous consumption Table 1 (P -values.01).

Figure 1.
A, DID values presented by year. Increase in consumption was observed between 2020 and 2021. B, National DID values for cumulative per-oral and intravenous consumption. Highest use was observed through per-oral route. C, DID values by Region. Region 7 had the highest DID value (70) followed by Region 1 (50) and Region 6 (45). Abbreviations: DDD, defined daily dose; DID, daily dose per 1000 inhabitants per day.

Table 1.
Comparison of DID of Most Commonly Used Antibiotics Between 2019 and 2021

Evaluation of national averages of commonly used classes of antibiotics from 2019 to 2021 demonstrated a 2–3 times increase in usage of penicillin (co-amoxiclav), third generation cephalosporin (cefixime), macrolides (azithromycin), and carbapenems. Although we did observe an increase in use of carbapenems in 2021, the scale was not significant owing to the overall low proportion of this class to the total antimicrobial consumption.

### Accurate quantification of copy-number aberrations and whole-genome duplications in multi-sample tumor sequencing data [^3a7e5714]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To address the second issue of an underdetermined system, we impose three additional and reasonable constraints. All of these constraints are optional and user-selectable. First, since we do not expect copy numbers to be arbitrarily high — especially for large genomic regions — we assume that the total copy numbers are at most a value. Second, to avoid overfitting errors in fractional copy numbers by clones with low proportions, we require a minimum clone proportionfor every tumor clone present in any sample. Third, we impose an evolutionary relationship between the tumor clones requiring that each allele of every segment s cannot be simultaneously amplified and deleted in distinct clones; i.e. either a s, i ≥ θ or a s, i ≤ θ for all clones i, where θ = 1 when there is no WGD and θ = 2 when there is a WGD. The same constraint also holds for b s, i. These constraints improve the solutions to the copy-number deconvolution problem, and are less restrictive than the ones usually applied in current methods which, for example, assume that: tumor clones have at most two copy-number states (a s, i, b s, i), (a s, j, b s, j) per segment and the difference between allele-specific copy numbers is at most 1, i.e. ∣ a s, i − a s, j ∣ ≤ 1 and ∣ b s, i − b s, j ∣ ≤ 1; or all clones have either a diploid copy-number state (1, 1) or a unique aberrant state (a, b) ≠ (1, 1) in every cluster s; or every tumor clone i has either c s, i ≥ 2 or c s, i ≤ 2 for every cluster s; or there always exist segments with total copy number equal to 2. We thus have the following problem.

Results

Patient enrollment

From 3 March 2016 to 14 January 2019, 39 patients were randomized to Arms A and B (Figs. 1 and 2, Fig Supplementary Figure 1). From 15 February 2019 to 9 September 2020, Arm C enrolled 12 patients consecutively (Figs. 1 and 2, Supplementary Figure 1). During this time, randomization was held to ensure that Arm C met its accrual goal while urelumab was still available prior to its discontinuation by BMS (Supplementary Figure 1). In October 2020 the remaining supply of urelumab expired, and any Arm C patients who remained on study were transitioned to Cy-GVAX and nivolumab (Arm B regimen) with the same schedule and dosing (without urelumab). This impacted the treatment of three Arm C patients: the 1st received urelumab with their initial four study therapy cycles, the 2nd with their initial 2 cycles, and the 3rd with only their 1st (neoadjuvant) cycle. Once enrollment in Arm C was complete, randomized enrollment to Arms A and B restarted with an additional three patients enrolled, between 25 February 2021 and 10 September 2021, before the decision to close these respective Arms due to the plans to add new treatment Arms to the platform trial. The date of data cutoff for the final analysis for Arms A, B, and C was 25 May 2022.

### The blight of the type II error: when No difference does not mean No difference [^43447622]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Much focus in research has been given to minimizing type I errors, where we incorrectly conclude that there is a difference between 2 treatments or populations. In contrast, our standard scientific method and power analysis allows for a much greater rate of type II errors, in which we fail to show a difference when, in fact, one exists (≥ 20% rate of type II errors vs ≤ 5% rate of type I errors). Additional factors that can cause type II errors may propel their prevalence to well in excess of 20%. Failure to reject the null hypothesis may be a tolerable outcome in a certain proportion of studies. However, type II errors may become dangerous when the conclusions of a study overreach, incorrectly stating that there is no difference, when, in fact, a difference exists. Type II errors resulting in overreaching conclusions may impede incremental advances in our field, as the advantages of small improvements may go undetected. To avert this danger in studies that fail to meet statistical significance, we as researchers (20% or more, vs 5% for type I errors) be precise in our conclusions stating simply that the null hypothesis could not be rejected.

### Limits on fundamental limits to computation [^98c96d2d]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

An indispensable part of our personal and working lives, computing has also become essential to industries and governments. Steady improvements in computer hardware have been supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits over the past fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires ever-increasing efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy. To help evaluate emerging technologies and increase our understanding of integrated-circuit scaling, here I review fundamental limits to computation in the areas of manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, I recapitulate how some limits were circumvented, and compare loose and tight limits. Engineering difficulties encountered by emerging technologies may indicate yet unknown limits.

### CurveCurator: a recalibrated F-statistic to assess, classify, and explore significance of dose-response curves [^d55d13ff]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

F-statistics and p -values

The basic idea behind the F-value in classical linear regression problems is to quantify how much better a more complex model (M 1 with k linear parameters) fits the data compared to a simpler model (M 0 with j linear parameters and j < k) given the n observed data points and the corresponding sum-squared errors (SSE) (Eq. 6).

Although not a linear model by nature, the log-logistic function still meets the required assumptions of random sampling, independence of observations, residual normality, and equal variance of the errors. The basic rationality behind CurveCurator's recalibrated F-statistic is similar to the linear F-statistic above. It also quantifies how much better the fitted log-logistic model (M 1) is compared to the mean model (M 0), which describes that there is no relationship between the applied dose and the observed response. We found, however, that n/k was a more appropriate scaling factor for the 4-parameter log-logistic function.

The obtained recalibrated F-value (Eq. 7) can then be used to calculate a p -value that quantifies how often a curve with a similar or bigger F-value can be found by random chance. We observed that these F-values follow a parameterized F-distribution with degrees of freedom that diverged from the case of linear models. Using extensive simulations under the null hypothesis (5 million curves for n = 5… 50), we obtained a simple quasi-linear function to calculate the "effective "degrees of freedom as a function of n (Eqs. 8–10).

### Routine vaccination coverage-worldwide, 2020 [^f22c0d4b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2020, the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) strives to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases across the life course (1). This report, which updates a previous report (2), presents global, regional, * and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends as of 2020. Changes are described in vaccination coverage and the numbers of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children as measured by receipt of the first and third doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP) in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, compared with 2019. Global estimates of coverage with the third dose of DTP (DTP3) and a polio vaccine (Pol3) decreased from 86% in 2019 to 83% in 2020. Similarly, coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) dropped from 86% in 2019 to 84% in 2020. The last year that coverage estimates were at 2020 levels was 2009 for DTP3 and 2014 for both MCV1 and Pol3. Worldwide, 22.7 million children (17% of the target population) were not vaccinated with DTP3 in 2020 compared with 19.0 million (14%) in 2019. Children who did not receive the first DTP dose (DTP1) by age 12 months (zero-dose children) accounted for 95% of the increased number. Among those who did not receive DTP3 in 2020, approximately 17.1 million (75%) were zero-dose children. Global coverage decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 estimates for the completed series of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), and rubella-containing vaccine (RCV). Full recovery from COVID-19-associated disruptions will require targeted, context-specific strategies to identify and catch up zero-dose and undervaccinated children, introduce interventions to minimize missed vaccinations, monitor coverage, and respond to program setbacks (3).

### The neural computation of inconsistent choice behavior [^52acd54a]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Measuring choice difficulty

Since each decision problem in our task is continuous, we cannot simply use ΔSV as a choice difficulty index. Moreover, choice difficulty in our task is determined by the subject's own preferences and not only by the slopes of the budget sets. For example, a risk-averse subject might struggle with steep slopes, as the temptation for allocating all tokens to one account rises. A risk-seeking subject, on the other hand, will have difficulties in moderate slopes. Therefore, we derive a novel measure for choice difficulty, which considers both subject's elicited parameters and the continuum of the budget set.

We discretized each budget line into 1000 possible bundles. We then calculated the subjective value v i, b, s of each bundle i along each budget set b for each subject s using the parameters elicited by the MMI. Next, we subtracted v i, b, s from the maximal subjective value of that budget line to obtain a Δ V i, b, s measure for each bundle along the budget set (analogous to taking the difference between two options in a binary choice design). We then averaged all the Δ V i, b, s across the 1000 bundles, and normalized the result by the endowment of the given budget set to be able to compare across trials. Formally, denote. Then:where i∈ [1, …,1000] is the bundle (N = 1000); b∈ [1, …,108] is the decision problems and s∈ [1, …,33] is the subject.

Difficult choices occur when the bundles along the budget line have similar values to the maximum value (V b, s), making the options along the line relatively similar, which results in an overall low index. Hence, the higher is our index, the easier it is to make a choice, suggesting that trials with index values closer to 0, are the more difficult choices. Hence, we refer to this index as a choice simplicity index. The normalization with Endowment b, s of the chosen bundle is aimed to minimize the problem of over-scoring trials with higher endowments. In such cases, the budget line is longer (further away from the origin), and therefore Δ V i, b, s is bigger for the mere fact that the distance between bundles is bigger.

### Cardiologist follow-up and improved outcomes of heart failure: a French nationwide cohort [^b6b0d9c8]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Survival analyses were initiated with 1 January 2020, as the baseline (time zero). Survival probabilities are illustrated using Kaplan–Meier curves, compared with log-rank tests. Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age, sex, social indicators, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, coronary artery disease, liver or pancreatic diseases, end-stage renal disease, cancer, atrial fibrillation, and treatments [beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), digoxin, ivabradine, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)], were used to assess associations between severity criteria groups and long-term prognosis. To assess the added predictive value of severity groups on top of adjustment variables, the C-index of a baseline model was calculated including all the adjustment variables and the increase in C-index when adding severity groups to the model.

In addition, the cohort was characterized based on the number of cardiology consultations in 2019 (0, 1, 2–3, or 4 or more consultations, corresponding to quartiles of consultation frequency). Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with cardiology follow-up. Subsequently, two analyses were performed to assess the relationship between cardiology follow-up in 2019 and outcomes observed after 1 January 2020. Consultations from 2019 were used to mitigate survival bias in the analysis, as patients must be alive to attend a consultation. The first analysis included the entire population, incorporating patients with de novo HF diagnosed in 2019, who consequently had < 1 year of follow-up. In this analysis, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) of ACM was assessed at 1 year based on the number of consultations in 2019 (0, 1, 2–3, or 4 or more consultations, corresponding to quartiles of the number of consultations) within each group based on predefined healthcare administrative criteria. The second analysis focused on patients with a HF diagnosis prior to 2019, excluding those with de novo HF in 2019, to ensure a minimum follow-up duration of 1 year. Additionally, the number needed to consult (NNC) to prevent one modelled death within a year (1/ΔARR) was calculated. The NNC was calculated as an exploratory measure to describe the association of cardiology consultations in 2019 with 1-year ACM risk on an absolute scale. Given the observational nature of the data, these results should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than as causal inferences.

### Three learning stages and accuracy-efficiency tradeoff of restricted boltzmann machines [^6ecc883f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The end of the correlation-learning regime and the crossover into the degradation regime is influenced by various (hyper)parameters. An absolute limit for the minimal value of Δ θ results from the class of distributions that can be represented by the RBM. This "expressivity" is controlled by the number of hidden units N. For sufficiently large N, the RBM model can approximate any target distribution with arbitrary accuracy,–; hence there is no absolute minimum for Δ θ in principle. In practice, however, the number of hidden units is limited by the available computational resources. Note that the scaling of this expressivity threshold is analyzed in some detail in ref.for the TFIC example (cf. Fig. 2).

Ceasing accuracy improvement due to limited expressivity is exemplified by Fig. 3 b in the stable regime (B ≳ 50), where we note that the achievable minimal loss decreases significantly from N = 4 to 16 to 64 (the same behavior can also be observed in Fig. 4 b, c). Employing even more hidden units, however, does not facilitate any significant gain in accuracy, and the learning characteristics for N = 256 in Fig. 3 b actually signal slightly worse performance in terms of the accuracy–efficiency tradeoff, i.e. a larger offset from the global lower bound (blue dashed line).

If N is sufficiently large, the approximations leading to a bias of the (exact) update step (4) will usually take over eventually and lead into the degradation regime even if the expressivity threshold has not yet been reached.

The first of those approximations is the use of the empirical distributionin lieu of the unknown true target distribution p (x). This may result in overfitting, a phenomenon common to many machine-learning approaches: The RBM may pick up finite-size artifacts of, particularly when the resolution of genuine features in the model distribution approaches the resolution of those features in the empirical distribution. Overfitting is the primary reason for degradation in the fourth column of Fig. 2 b, where the size of the training dataset ∣ S ∣ is rather small. Comparing the training error(solid lines, see below (4)) with the test error Δ θ (data points, see Eq. (3)), we observe that the former continues to decrease even though the latter actually increases.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^3c363d65]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

Trend in Activities Between 2010 and 2019

For most sites, the number of surgical procedures increased from 2010 to 2019 (Figure 1 and Figure 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 1): liver (14%), pancreas (38%), ovary (14%), esophagus (18%), breast (8%), and thoracic (29%) cancers. For others, a decrease was observed: stomach (−10%) and ENT (−6%). Some specific trends were observed. For colorectal cancers, the number was slightly lower in 2019 than in 2010 (−2%), but a sharp increase occurred in 2016. For urologic cancers, the number was slightly lower in 2019 than in 2010 (−1%), but a decrease in 2012–2013 was followed by a more recent increase.

Given the trends observed in previous years (Figure 1 and Figure 2), stability compared with 2019 did not appear to be a realistic assumption, except perhaps for liver cancer. It was assumed that a single model based on 2019 activities would not be the best or universal model. Hence, specific models were applied for each site and scenario.

In a deceased proband with SCD and known phenotype, "genetic testing… should include only genes with robust evidence of gene–disease association" (COR 1, LOE C-LD). "In first-degree relatives of a proband with SCD from a suspected heritable cause, phenotype-guided clinical screening is recommended and, where a genetic diagnosis is available, cascade genetic testing should be offered" (COR 1, LOE B-NR). "In families affected by SCD who have undergone genetic testing, periodic re-evaluation of the genetic test results is recommended" (COR 1, LOE B-NR).

In the linear cue combination task, the objective is to combine two cues, r 1 and r 2, encoding information about the same variable, s, in a statistically optimal way. Assuming a squared error loss function, this can be achieved by computing the mean of the posterior p (s | r 1, r 2). For a uniform prior distribution, the posterior mean is given by an expression of the form:where ϕ is the vector of preferred stimuli of input neurons and 1 is a vector of ones. This expression is approximate when the prior is not uniform over the entire real line and the quality of the approximation can become particularly bad in the high-noise regime considered in this paper. Thus, in practice, we computed posterior means numerically, rather than using the above equation. The equation is still useful, however, in helping us understand the type of computation the network needs to perform to approximate optimal probabilistic inference. During training, the two cues received by the input populations were always non-conflicting: s 1 = s 2 = s and the gains of the input populations varied from trial to trial. The network was trained to minimize the mean squared error between its output and the common s indicated by the two cues.

CPR start sequence evidence — A 2021 American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council literature update did not lead to a change in the 2020 guidance, which recommended to continue teaching the airway-breathing-circulation (A-B-C) approach for assessment in all emergencies and, for adult cardiac arrest and sudden pediatric arrest, to begin CPR with compressions followed by ventilations (compressions-airway-breathing [C-A-B]). A retrospective review in 2020 of the Cardiac Arrest Registry for Enhanced Survival analyzed cases between 2013 and 2016 from 548 cardiac arrests following drowning and reported that compression-ventilation CPR in 5- to 15-year-olds was significantly associated with neurologically favorable survival (aOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.10–6.77; P = 0.03) compared with compression-only CPR, informing the recommendation that for the drowning process, resuscitation should begin with ventilations/rescue breaths (A-B-C).

### Trends in facility-level rates ofinfections in US hospitals, 2019–2020 [^b645f2bf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused substantial changes to healthcare delivery and antibiotic prescribing beginning in March 2020. To assess pandemic impact on Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) rates, we described patients and trends in facility-level incidence, testing rates, and percent positivity during 2019–2020 in a large cohort of US hospitals.

Methods

We estimated and compared rates of community-onset CDI (CO-CDI) per 10,000 discharges, hospital-onset CDI (HO-CDI) per 10,000 patient days, and C. difficile testing rates per 10,000 discharges in 2019 and 2020. We calculated percent positivity as the number of inpatients diagnosed with CDI over the total number of discharges with a test for C. difficile. We used an interrupted time series (ITS) design with negative binomial and logistic regression models to describe level and trend changes in rates and percent positivity before and after March 2020.

Results

In pairwise comparisons, overall CO-CDI rates decreased from 20.0 to 15.8 between 2019 and 2020 (P < .0001). HO-CDI rates did not change. Using ITS, we detected decreasing monthly trends in CO-CDI (-1% per month, P = 0.0036) and HO-CDI incidence (-1% per month, P < .0001) during the baseline period, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. We detected no change in monthly trends for CO-CDI or HO-CDI incidence or percent positivity after March 2020 compared with the baseline period.

Conclusions

While there was a slight downward trajectory in CDI trends prior to March 2020, no significant change in CDI trends occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic despite changes in infection control practices, antibiotic use, and healthcare delivery.

### New designs in early clinical drug development [^d7d575af]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

The availability of an unprecedented massive amount of data has provided a magnificent window of opportunity for the development of new drugs. There are currently more drugs in development targeting cancer than any other disease. While this has brought us new waves of drugs, the counterpart is that with these new molecules we have different mechanisms of action, drug kinetics and dynamics, response types and toxicity profiles, which impair classical early clinical trial designs from being effective and efficient. What we once treated as a 'one-size-fits-all' homogeneous disease, has now been uncovered to be a rather heterogeneous condition with multiple targetable mutations. As this generates endless scenarios, it will be impossible to design single 'me-too' trials for every different disease, target, biomarker and agent. To overcome this, we must focus on improving early phase studies, undoubtedly the most critical step from bench to bedside. Goals include decreasing clinical development times, lowering research and development costs and optimizing decisions in advancing through the several phases with a higher degree of certainty in exchange for less failed attempts. We need more informative and, really, transformative early phase designs that seek to obtain the typical late phase objectives in a time continuum and to allow for more robust and efficient go/no-go decisions. With this in mind, different classes of drugs seem to fit with different designs, which present solutions to the different challenges that they pose after finding the maximum tolerated dose/optimum biological dose. This article reviews these concepts and designs and how they can adapt to this new reality in early phase investigation.

### Impact of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on radiotherapy practice at tata memorial centre, mumbai: a longitudinal cohort study [^5c8952ae]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Impact on Patient Numbers

Approximately 11,000 new patients with cancer registered at our center from March 1 to October 31, 2020. This was significantly (63%) lower compared with 2019, when approximately 30,000 new patients with cancer registered during the same period. A total of 4,256 of 4,580 (93%) patients who visited the RT department for treatment consultation during the study period in 2020 agreed to participate in this study. This was nearly half (55.1%) of the consults (n = 8,313) that were done in 2019 during the same period. The monthly variations in RT consultations for year 2020 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1 A. Paradoxically, there was a 10% increase in consultations in March 2020 as compared with 2019. In May and June, we recorded the lowest number of consultations (approximately 70% lower than 2019) in alignment with the lower patient registrations and the initial phase of total lockdown with impaired transport. The numbers gradually increased from July after the restrictions were eased out in a phased manner from June. The reduction in patient numbers was not uniform across all disease sites. Figure 1 B shows that as compared with 2019, in 2020, the proportion of patients receiving RT declined for all disease sites except breast (an increase from 17% to 24%) and pediatric, hematolymphoid, and bone soft tissue (an increase from 15.5% to 17.4%). Patients who cannot be accommodated at our center or who wish to receive RT closer to home are provided with a formal treatment referral letter. Such referrals also reduced drastically to 16.5% in 2020 compared with 44.3% in 2019 (Fig 1 C).

### Persistent tennis elbow symptoms have little prognostic value: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^47de1d20]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tennis elbow is a common painful enthesopathy of the lateral elbow that limits upper limb function and frequently results in lost time at work. Surgeons often recommend surgery if symptoms persist despite nonsurgical management, but operations for tennis elbow are inconsistent in their efficacy, and what we know about those operations often derives from observational studies that assume the condition does not continue to improve over time. This assumption is largely untested, and it may not be true; meta-analyzing results from the control arms of tennis elbow studies can help us to evaluate this premise, but to our knowledge, this has not been done.

Questions/Purposes

The aims of this systematic review were to describe the course of (1) global improvement, (2) pain, and (3) disability in participants who received no active treatment (placebo or no treatment) in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on tennis elbow. We also assessed (4) whether the duration of symptoms or placebo effect is associated with differences in symptom trajectories.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to August 12, 2019, for trials including participants with tennis elbow and a placebo or a no-treatment arm and a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. There were no language restrictions or exclusion criteria. We extracted global improvement, pain, and disability outcomes. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the risk of bias of included trials. To estimate the typical course of tennis elbow without active treatment, we pooled global improvement (the proportion of participants who reported feeling much better or completely recovered), mean pain, and mean disability using baseline, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up data. We transformed pain and disability data from the original papers so that at each timepoint the relevant outcome was expressed as change relative to baseline to account for different baseline values. We used meta-regression to assess whether the placebo effect or duration of symptoms before enrollment was associated with differences in symptom trajectories. We included 24 trials with 1085 participants who received no active treatment.

Results

The number of patients who were not improved decreased exponentially over time. The half-life of global improvement was between 2.5 and 3 months (that is, every 2.5 to 3 months, 50% of the remaining symptomatic patients reported complete recovery or greatly improved symptoms). At 1 year, 89% (189 of 213; 95% CI 80% to 97%) of patients experienced global improvement. The mean pain and disability followed a similar pattern, halving every 3 to 4 months. Eighty-eight percent of pain (95% CI 70% to 100%) and 85% of disability (95% CI 60% to 100%) had resolved by 1 year. The mean duration of symptoms before trial enrollment was not associated with differences in symptom trajectories. The trajectories of the no-treatment and placebo arms were similar, indicating that the placebo effect of the studied active treatments likely is negligible.

Conclusion

Based on the placebo or no-treatment control arms of randomized trials, about 90% of people with untreated tennis elbow achieve symptom resolution at 1 year. The probability of resolution appears to remain constant throughout the first year of follow-up and does not depend on previous symptom duration, undermining the rationale that surgery is appropriate if symptoms persist beyond a certain point of time. We recommend that clinicians inform people who are frustrated with persisting symptoms that this is not a cause for apprehension, given that spontaneous improvement is about as likely during the subsequent few months as it was early after the symptoms first appeared. Because of the high likelihood of spontaneous recovery, any active intervention needs to be justified by high levels of early efficacy and little or no risk to outperform watchful waiting.

### Abstract representations of events arise from mental errors in learning and memory [^5646fd8b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Maximum entropy model and the infinite-sequence limit

Here we provide a more thorough derivation of our maximum entropy model of human expectations, with the goal of fostering intuition. Given a matrix of erroneous transition counts, our estimate of the transition structure is given by. When observing a sequence of nodes x 1, x 2, …, in order to construct the counts, we assume that humans use the following recursive rule: where B t (i) denotes the belief, or perceived probability, that node i occurred at the previous time t. This belief, in turn, can be written in terms of the probability P (Δ t) of accidentally recalling the node that occurred Δ t time steps from the desired node at time t:

In order to make quantitative predictions about people's estimates of a transition structure, we must choose a mathematical form for P (Δ t). To do so, we leverage the free energy principle: When building mental models, the brain is finely tuned to simultaneously minimize errors and computational complexity. The average error associated with a candidate distribution Q (Δ t) is assumed to be the average distance in time of the recalled node from the target node, denoted. Furthermore, Shannon famously proved that the only suitable choice for the computational cost of a candidate distribution is its negative entropy, denoted. Taken together, the total cost associated with a distribution Q (Δ t) is given by the free energy F (Q) = βE (Q) − S (Q), where β, referred to as the inverse temperature, parameterizes the relative importance of minimizing errors versus computational costs. By minimizing F with respect to Q, we arrive at the Boltzmann distribution p (Δ t) = e − β Δ t / Z, where Z is the normalizing partition function. We emphasize that this mathematical form for P (Δ t) followed directly from our free energy assumption about resource constraints in the brain.

### The effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on children with asthma-related symptoms: a tertiary care center experience [^d5b6f29c]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute asthma exacerbations are a common cause for emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in children. Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the education system closure/total lockdown in Israel on March 2020, we have noticed a decrease in pediatric ED visits and an increase in hospitalizations of asthma exacerbations.

Objective

to examine the patterns of ED visits for asthma exacerbations during COVID-19 outbreak, in comparison to the previous year.

Methods

A retrospective study comparing asthma related ED visits and hospitalizations among children aged 2–18 years at a tertiary center in southern Israel. Three time periods were selected: 2020 A (prelockdown, 2/1/20 to 3/14/20), 2020 B (lockdown, 3/15/20 to 5/15/20) and 2020 C (postlockdown, 5/16/20 to 6/30/20) and compared to the three parallel time periods in 2019. Data regarding demographics, number of ED visits and clinical severity parameters were collected and analyzed.

Results

Five hundred and twelve children visited the ED for asthma exacerbation: 273 children during 2019 and 239 children during 2020. Lockdown period in 2020 revealed significantly fewer ED visits per day compared to the parallel calendar period in 2019 (1.8 vs. 1.43, p < .001). Significantly higher hospitalization rate (47.1% vs. 33.7%, p = .05) and longer length of stay (3.15 vs. 1.9 days, p = .03) were observed during the lockdown.

Conclusion

Lockdown is associated with fewer ED visits for asthma exacerbation, probably due to; reduced exposure to viral infections and environmental allergens, decreased availability of primary physicians and families' reluctance to arrive to the ED. ED visits during lockdown were characterized by higher hospitalization rate and longer LOS.

### Trial and error. how to avoid commonly encountered limitations of published clinical trials [^addfed85]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The randomized controlled clinical trial is the gold standard scientific method for the evaluation of diagnostic and treatment interventions. Such trials are cited frequently as the authoritative foundation for evidence-based management policies. Nevertheless, they have a number of limitations that challenge the interpretation of the results. The strength of evidence is often judged by conventional tests that rely heavily on statistical significance. Less attention has been paid to the clinical significance or the practical importance of the treatment effects. One should be cautious that extremely large studies might be more likely to find a formally statistically significant difference for a trivial effect that is not really meaningfully different from the null. Trials often employ composite end points that, although they enable assessment of nonfatal events and improve trial efficiency and statistical precision, entail a number of shortcomings that can potentially undermine the scientific validity of the conclusions drawn from these trials. Finally, clinical trials often employ extensive subgroup analysis. However, lack of attention to proper methods can lead to chance findings that might misinform research and result in suboptimal practice. Accordingly, this review highlights these limitations using numerous examples of published clinical trials and describes ways to overcome these limitations, thereby improving the interpretability of research findings.

Pooling of results

Item 3: The principal summary measures for each included outcome measure need to be stated in the methods. For quantitative analyses, where outcome measures are continuous, a justification needs to be provided for the use of (raw) mean differences (MD) and not standardised MD (SMD) and vice versa (ie, identical or different outcome measure tools used across studies, respectively). Similarly, for dichotomous outcomes, the authors should state in the methods whether OR or relative risks (RR) were used.

Item 4: An SR without a meta-analysis should ideally have some quantitative summary measures (ie, MD, SMD, OR or RR with accompanying CI) to demonstrate the treatment effect of the assessed intervention over the comparator. Where results are pooled only based on direction of effect (ie, increased, decreased or unchanged), this needs to be stated in the methods with a justification. If pooling is not possible and results are only described narratively, the reason should be stated (usually substantial clinical heterogeneity); in such cases, we question whether the article should be identified as an SR.

Item 5: When meta-analyses are performed, the model used needs to be stated (ie, fixed effects or random effects) with a justification and the statistical heterogeneity assessment (usually χ 2 and/or I 2 test) and how it was used in data syntheses. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses should also be pre-defined in the methods.

Items 6 and 7: Results should only be pooled for similar follow-up time periods which should be prespecified in the methods. Traditionally these are short term, mid term and long term. The range of these should be defined by the authors in the methods based on the population, outcome measures and interventions. Equally, assessed outcome measures should be predefined (usually as part of PICOS).

Item 8: A statement needs to be included in the section explaining how the authors dealt with missing data, which are usually methodological details of the included studies needed for the RoB assessment and descriptive statistics for quantitative analyses. For both, ideally attempts should be made to contact the authors of the RCTs for retrieval of the missing data and this should be stated. If significant statistical data of included studies cannot be retrieved (ie, sample sizes and means) these studies should be excluded from quantitative analyses; if variability statistics (SD) are missing, the authors have the option to impute these using data from other RCTs and the imputation method used should be described.

Enrollment

From 3 March 2016 to 14 January 2019, eligible patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 into the initial two treatment arms, Cy-GVAX (Arm A) or Cy-GVAX plus nivolumab (Arm B) (Supplementary Figure 1). Randomization was stratified by age of enrollment (≤ 65 and > 65 years old). In October 2018, a 3rd treatment arm (Arm C) was added for patients to receive Cy-GVAX plus nivolumab and urelumab (Supplementary Figure 1). Discontinuation of urelumab production necessitated enrolling Arm C patients consecutively in order to meet the Arm C accrual goal (15 February 2019 — 9 September 2020). Following the completion of Arm C accrual, enrollment to Arms A and B resumed in a randomized fashion (25 February 2021 — 10 September 2021). Due to plans to add new treatment Arms for this patient population, Arms A and B were then closed (4 November 2021) and a final analysis was conducted. The data reported herein reflect follow-up through 25 May 2022.

### State estimation of a physical system with unknown governing equations [^bd52fbf3]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Stochastic variational inference

Here we tackle the problem of state estimation with unknown governing equations using the machinery of stochastic variational inference (SVI). SVI is a powerful approach for approximate Bayesian inference that converts the problem of generating samples from an unnormalized density function into an optimization problem involving maximization of a stochastic approximation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Variational inference has been applied to solve a wide variety of problems in machine learning –.

SVI typically requires four ingredients: (1) priors over variables of interest; (2) a parametrized approximate posterior; (3) a tractable expression for the ELBO that admits unbiased stochastic approximations; and (4) a method for approximating gradients of expectations in the ELBO.

In the context of the problem considered here, SVI cannot be applied in a straightforward manner because we seek to estimate a function, x t, given measurements of y t, rather than a finite-dimensional vector. Here we propose a reparametrization trick for approximating expectations under Markov Gaussian processes that enables us to tackle this challenge. A high-level summary of our approach is provided in Fig. 1 and we introduce the core ingredients of our methodology in the sections that follow.

Fig. 1
Main ideas.

a, Given noisy time-series data and an observation model, our goal is to estimate the underlying state and any missing terms in the forward model. b, We specify a hierarchical prior over the state and the governing equations and then infer an approximate posterior over the state and forward model using SVI. c, We arrive with a state estimate, a method for generating forecasts with uncertainty estimates and a Bayesian estimate for missing terms in the governing equations.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA PM-1 — anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter — states that direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) are recommended over warfarin in DOAC-eligible AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). Among patients treated with warfarin, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be determined at least weekly during initiation and at least monthly when anticoagulation (INR in range) is stable (Class 1, Level of Evidence: A). In AF except with moderate or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended for assessment of stroke risk (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). For AF with mechanical heart valves, warfarin is recommended (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). Selection of anticoagulant therapy should be based on thromboembolism risk irrespective of whether the AF pattern is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent (Class 1, Level of Evidence: B). In AF, anticoagulant therapy should be individualized using shared decision-making after discussion of absolute and relative risks of stroke and bleeding and the patient's values and preferences (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C). For atrial flutter, anticoagulant therapy is recommended according to the same risk profile used for AF (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C). Reevaluation of the need for and choice of anticoagulant therapy at periodic intervals is recommended to reassess stroke and bleeding risks (Class 1, Level of Evidence: C).

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^63ecbcad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation — Friedewald accuracy limits and newer equations: the Friedewald formula is generally considered accurate within serum TG levels under 150 mg/ dL (1.7 mmol/L) and LDL-C levels of at least 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), but it underestimates LDL-C as serum TG levels increase above 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or with LDL-C levels under 70 mg/ dL (1.8 mmol/L). In people with high TG, estimated low LDL-C, diabetes, or obesity, apolipoprotein B (apoB) or non-HDL-C may be useful for assessment of ASCVD risk. The Martin-Hopkins formula is gaining wider use for calculation of LDL-C, uses an adjustable correction factor based on TG and non-HDL-C levels, and appears to have greater accuracy in nonfasting samples as well as in settings of low LDL-C and high TG; the Martin-Hopkins equation reduces the need for routine, direct measurement of LDL-C. Recently, in 2020, a new equation developed from the NIH proposes LDL-C estimation that can be used in patients with TG up to 800 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L).

For Step 2, as‑needed, concomitantly administered ICS plus SABA has Recommendation 10: Conditional, in favor of either the intervention or the comparator for ages 12 y and above, with no recommendation for ages 4‑11 y; for intermittent, higher‑dose ICS there is Recommendation 11: Conditional, against the intervention for ages 4 y and above. For Steps 3 and 4, daily and as‑needed ICS‑formoterol has no recommendation for ages 4 y and above when compared with daily same‑dose ICS plus as‑needed SABA; compared with daily higher‑dose ICS plus as‑needed SABA or with daily same‑dose ICS‑LABA plus as‑needed SABA there is Recommendation 12: Strong, in favor of the intervention for ages 4‑11 y; and compared with daily higher‑dose ICS‑LABA plus as‑needed SABA there is Recommendation 13: Conditional, in favor of the intervention for ages 12 y and above; entries marked with an asterisk indicate insufficient evidence.
