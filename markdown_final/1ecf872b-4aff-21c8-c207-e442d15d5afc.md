## Question

A 3-year-old boy is brought to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of persistent, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. His mother reports that, despite regular use of emollients and topical corticosteroids as prescribed, his eczema remains poorly controlled. There is no history of hives, urticaria, or immediate reactions (such as swelling, vomiting, or difficulty breathing) after eating any foods. On examination, he has widespread eczematous plaques but no signs of acute allergic contact dermatitis. The mother asks if allergy testing should be performed to identify possible triggers.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate approach to allergy testing in this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 3-year-old with persistent, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, no history of immediate food reactions, and poor control on emollients and topical corticosteroids should undergo allergy testing, and if so, what kind and why. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and optimizing skin-directed therapy. Then, I should verify the indications for food allergy testing in moderate-to-severe AD without immediate reactions. Next, I will consider the role of patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis. After that, I need to weigh the risks of false positives and unnecessary elimination diets. Finally, I will synthesize a guideline-concordant, stepwise recommendation with shared decision-making and follow-up checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and ensure we are not missing a mimicker or a confounder. Atopic dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by chronic, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease with a relapsing course and often elevated IgE, but I should double-check for alternative or concomitant causes like allergic contact dermatitis or irritant dermatitis, and consider biopsy or other tests only if the presentation is atypical or refractory to appropriate therapy [^69e52156] [^098c2873].

> Wait, let me verify the current management before jumping to testing. Persistent moderate-to-severe AD despite emollients and topical corticosteroids suggests either undertreatment, poor adherence, or a confounding process. I need to check potency, technique, and adherence, and consider proactive therapy, wet wraps, or escalation to topical calcineurin inhibitors or systemic options if indicated, because guidelines emphasize optimizing skin-directed therapy before pursuing allergy testing in the absence of immediate food reactions [^e8ac108b] [^e79add2f] [^1db89e5d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about food allergy testing. I initially thought that any child with moderate-to-severe AD should automatically get food allergy testing, but I should correct that. Guidelines advise against routine food allergy testing in the absence of a history consistent with immediate hypersensitivity because AD patients often have high total IgE and positive sensitization tests without true food allergy, leading to harmful, unnecessary elimination diets and failure to treat the skin disease [^23254ab5] [^65648333] [^426e770d].

> I need to check the specific indications for food allergy evaluation in moderate-to-severe AD without immediate reactions. The NIAID and AAD-aligned guidance supports considering limited food allergy testing in children under 5 years with persistent moderate-to-severe AD despite optimized topical therapy, but only when there is a reliable history of immediate reactions or when disease remains recalcitrant after confirming adherence and optimizing skin care. Even then, testing should be selective and interpreted with caution due to low positive predictive value [^5d5fe023] [^72de3356] [^d866a742].

> Let me consider the role of allergic contact dermatitis, because this is a different, often overlooked driver of recalcitrant AD. I should confirm whether there are clues such as worsening with specific emollients, topical corticosteroids, or atypical distributions, and if so, patch testing is recommended to evaluate for contact sensitization to vehicles, preservatives, fragrances, and even corticosteroids themselves, which can perpetuate dermatitis despite appropriate anti-inflammatory therapy [^b848dddc] [^5d2e6353] [^004c7427].

> I should double-check the risks of indiscriminate testing. False-positive food allergy tests are common in AD and can lead to unnecessary dietary restrictions that may impair growth, reduce quality of life, and paradoxically increase the risk of developing true IgE-mediated food allergy by removing oral tolerance, so any positive test must be correlated with clinical history and, when possible, confirmed by supervised oral food challenges before long-term avoidance is advised [^23254ab5] [^65648333] [^426e770d].

> Next, I should review what to test if, after optimizing skin care and confirming adherence, the child still has persistent moderate-to-severe AD and we suspect food triggers. In that narrow scenario, targeted testing to milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy may be considered, with the understanding that negative results are more informative than positive ones, and that any elimination should be time-limited and followed by reintroduction or challenge to confirm causality and avoid prolonged restriction [^5d5fe023] [^72de3356] [^b281fffe].

> But wait, what if the child is already eating the suspected food without immediate reactions? I need to ensure we do not remove a tolerated food based on sensitization alone, because maintaining oral exposure supports tolerance and removing it can worsen the allergy risk; thus, shared decision-making with clear counseling about the low predictive value of positive tests and the plan to reintroduce if there is no clinical improvement is essential [^426e770d] [^65648333] [^23254ab5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, verify the diagnosis and optimize skin-directed therapy, including potency-appropriate topical corticosteroids, emollients, and consider proactive strategies or escalation if needed. Second, reassess adherence and technique. Third, if disease remains recalcitrant, consider patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis, especially to topical agents. Fourth, if still uncontrolled and there is a compelling history or persistent severe disease, pursue limited, history-guided food allergy testing with a plan for supervised challenges and time-limited elimination only if clinically justified [^e8ac108b] [^b848dddc] [^5d5fe023].

> I should confirm the bottom line and ensure it aligns with guidelines. In a 3-year-old with moderate-to-severe AD, no immediate food reactions, and poor control on emollients and topical corticosteroids, routine allergy testing is not recommended. Instead, prioritize optimizing skin-directed therapy, consider patch testing if contact dermatitis is suspected, and reserve selective food allergy testing for persistent, severe cases after shared decision-making that acknowledges the high risk of false positives and the potential harms of unnecessary elimination diets [^23254ab5] [^65648333] [^b848dddc].

---

In a 3-year-old with persistent, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis despite optimized topical therapy and no history of immediate food reactions, **routine allergy testing is not recommended** [^23254ab5] because it rarely changes management and carries a high risk of false positives that can lead to harmful dietary restrictions [^65648333]. Instead, **prioritize optimizing skin care**, consider patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis if disease remains refractory [^b848dddc], and reserve food allergy testing for select cases with a convincing history of immediate reactions or failure of aggressive skin care [^5d5fe023] [^d866a742]. If testing is pursued, use targeted skin prick or specific IgE testing and confirm positive results with supervised oral food challenges [^b281fffe].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

### Food allergy testing

- **Routine food allergy testing is not recommended**: For children with atopic dermatitis without a history of immediate allergic reactions to foods, as it rarely improves outcomes and may prompt unnecessary dietary restrictions [^23254ab5] [^65648333].

- **Selective testing considerations**: In children under 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that persists despite optimized topical therapy, consider limited testing for milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy if there is a reliable history of immediate reactions or if disease remains refractory despite aggressive skin care [^5d5fe023] [^d866a742].

- **Interpretation of results**: Positive skin prick or specific IgE results indicate sensitization but not necessarily clinical allergy; confirm with supervised oral food challenges before recommending long-term avoidance [^b281fffe] [^72de3356].

---

### Environmental allergy testing

Environmental allergy testing (skin prick or specific IgE) is **not routinely recommended** in children with atopic dermatitis without clear seasonal or environmental symptom patterns, as results often show sensitization without clinical relevance and rarely guide management [^notfound].

---

### Patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis

- **Indications for patch testing**: Consider in patients with persistent or recalcitrant atopic dermatitis, atypical localization, or exacerbations without a clear cause, especially when systemic therapy is contemplated [^b848dddc] [^5d2e6353].

- **Common allergens**: Topical corticosteroids, emollients, fragrances, preservatives, and metals (e.g. nickel) are frequent culprits in children with atopic dermatitis [^2e7a49b7] [^4de67d99].

- **Clinical utility**: Identifying and avoiding contact allergens can significantly improve disease control and reduce the need for systemic therapy [^a8c885da].

---

## Risks and limitations of allergy testing

- **False positives**: Children with atopic dermatitis often have elevated total IgE and multiple sensitizations, leading to false-positive results that can prompt unnecessary dietary restrictions and anxiety [^426e770d] [^65648333].

- **Nutritional risks**: Unnecessary food elimination can cause growth impairment, nutritional deficiencies, and may increase the risk of developing true food allergy by disrupting oral tolerance [^426e770d] [^65648333].

- **Limited clinical utility**: Routine allergy testing rarely identifies actionable triggers and does not replace the need for optimized skin care and anti-inflammatory therapy [^23254ab5] [^65648333].

---

## Recommended clinical approach

Given the child's clinical scenario, the following **stepwise approach is recommended**:

| **Step** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and exclude alternative diagnoses (e.g. psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis) [^098c2873] [^3d8a1c5a] |
| 2 | Optimize skin care: reinforce regular emollients, appropriate bathing, and correct application of topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors; consider proactive therapy for relapsing disease [^e8ac108b] [^1eb501d1] |
| 3 | Assess adherence and technique, and address barriers to therapy [^f94decdd] |
| 4 | Consider patch testing if disease remains refractory or if there is suspicion of allergic contact dermatitis [^b848dddc] [^5d2e6353] |
| 5 | Reserve food allergy testing for select cases with a convincing history of immediate reactions or failure of aggressive skin care; if pursued, confirm positive results with supervised oral food challenges [^5d5fe023] [^b281fffe] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Routine allergy testing is **not recommended** for this 3-year-old with persistent, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and no history of immediate food reactions. Focus on **optimizing skin care**, consider patch testing for allergic contact dermatitis if disease remains refractory, and reserve food allergy testing for select cases with a convincing history or failure of aggressive skin care. If testing is pursued, confirm positive results with supervised oral food challenges to avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions and potential harm [^23254ab5] [^65648333] [^b281fffe].

The prevalence of atopic dermatitis is increasing, and more than 50% of children with atopic dermatitis go on to develop asthma and allergies. A better understanding of the underlying immune abnormalities of this complex chronic relapsing skin disease is needed. Although the optimal treatment approach remains to be defined, several recent studies suggest a rationale for using topical calcineurin inhibitors as early intervention and adding topical corticosteroids as rescue therapy if needed.

The burden of children suffering from chronic severe dermatitis and especially from undiagnosed confounding allergic contact dermatitis can be overwhelming for not only the patients and their families but also for their dermatologists. We report our protocol for pediatric patch testing and three pediatric cases, with severe and recalcitrant dermatitis unresponsive to systemic therapies, in whom comprehensive patch testing played a key role in management. Comprehensive patch testing allowed for the culprit allergens to be detected and subsequently avoided. With strict compliance, we were able to cease the use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. These cases illustrate the importance of patch testing in recalcitrant dermatitis within the pediatric population.

Patch testing — effects of systemic corticosteroids, topical anti-inflammatories, and antihistamines (Summary Statement 235): Patch test results are affected by oral corticosteroids but not by antihistamines (A). Immunocompromised adult patients taking oral corticosteroids (> 20 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent) may show diminished or absent reactivity, and systemic steroids in doses of less than 20 mg/d were not likely to suppress strongly positive patch test results but could suppress mild irritant responses. The skin site for application should have had no topical potent corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor applied for 5 to 7 days before testing since these agents can diminish or obliterate results. The effect of systemic corticosteroids on patch testing is less understood for children, and systemic antihistamines do not affect interpretation.

Atopic dermatitis is the leading cause of pediatric dermatology visits in developed nations. Recurrent, itchy rashes in typical locations and a family/personal history of atopy helps to identify children with disease. Most cases (85%) are diagnosed by age 5 years. Some comorbidities are age-based and may affect disease course. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy; corticosteroidphobia and side effects complicate use. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are alternatives to corticosteroids, especially in sensitive locations. Systemic therapies include antihistamines, immune suppressive agents, and phototherapy, with specific pediatric modifications. This article reviews the nuances and caveats of pediatric atopic dermatitis diagnosis and management.

### Atopic dermatitis and food allergy: best practices and knowledge gaps – A work group report from the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee and leadership institute project [^349e3b97]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) care and food allergy (FA) evaluation — Optimal skin care includes appropriate bathing recommendations, use of emollients, topical medications, wet wraps, and where indicated, systemic medications such as dupilumab. Behavioral interventions for itch and sleep should also be part of the plan, diagnosis and treatment of mental health comorbidities must be addressed, and potential evaluation for contact dermatitis should also be considered. With regard to FA, patients with immediate allergic reactions to foods should be evaluated for FA and appropriate avoidance diets recommended. In the absence of immediate reactions, appropriate management is more nuanced, and recent research points away from random testing and food elimination for the majority of patients with AD. For infants who do not respond to aggressive skin care, limited food allergens may be tested, but if testing and potential elimination diets are proposed, a frank discussion regarding the risks of false-positive testing and dietary elimination is required. Because AD significantly affects families, these patients require a comprehensive approach to management focused on education, barrier restoration, and limitation of inflammation, and potential triggers and food elimination should be handled thoughtfully and with care.

However, poor communication between doctors and patients often results in suboptimal use of such therapy. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We discuss their optimal use in primary care, and the advice and information that patients or parents of children need when using such treatment.

### Prevention of flares in children with atopic dermatitis with regular use of an emollient containing glycerol and paraffin: a randomized controlled study [^d18de6d9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Emollients are part of the standard treatment for atopic dermatitis (AD), although there is limited evidence that regular use of emollients as management therapy reduces the frequency of flares and corticosteroid consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefit of emollient use in the management of mild to moderate AD in children by assessing the ability of two different emollients (particularly V0034CR) to prevent flares and to reduce the use of corticosteroids.

Methods

In this randomized, open-label study, patients with a current flare were treated with a potent topical corticosteroid. After flare resolution, patients were centrally randomized to V0034CR emollient, reference emollient, or no emollient (1:1:1 ratio) for 12 weeks. New flares were medically assessed before being treated with a moderately potent corticosteroid.

Results

A total of 335 children 2 to 6 years of age were randomized. At 12 weeks, the percentage of patients with one or more flares was statistically significantly lower with V0034CR (35.1%) than without emollient (67.6%; p < 0.001). Fewer patients treated with V0034CR required any corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (23.6%) than patients with no emollient (43.3%) at 12 weeks. The difference was significant at all time points (p = 0.002). Patients treated with emollients had a longer time to first flare, fewer flares, higher complete remission rates, less corticosteroid consumption, lower Investigator Global Assessment scores, and lower Scoring Atopic Dermatitis scores than those who were not. V0034CR was well tolerated, with no specific safety concerns.

Conclusion

Regular emollient use in children with mild to moderate AD reduces flares and corticosteroid consumption.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^72de3356]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — coexisting allergic disease and allergy testing — The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Food Allergy Expert Panel suggests consideration of limited food allergy testing if a child < 5 years of age has moderate to severe AD and the following: persistent disease in spite of optimized management and topical therapy, a reliable history of an immediate allergic reaction after ingestion of a specific food, or both. While food allergy is less common in older age groups, when suspected, the choice of foods for testing should follow the clinical history and the most prevalent allergies in the population. Tests often performed for evaluation include skin prick testing (SPT) and serum-specific IgE level determination, and in cases of extensive eczematous lesions, prominent dermatographism, or recent oral antihistamine use, specific IgE measurement may be preferable over SPT; food-specific IgE can be measured by radioallergosorbent (RAST) or immunoCAP testing. With both tests, the negative predictive value is high (> 95%) and the specificity and positive predictive value are low (40–60%), so negative test results are helpful to rule out food allergy, whereas positive results only signify sensitization and require clinical correlation and confirmation. Higher specific IgE levels and larger wheal sizes (> 8–10 mm) are associated with a greater likelihood of reaction on challenge, and measuring total serum IgE levels alone, or to compare with allergen-specific levels, is not helpful in determining food allergy.

Food allergy evaluation in atopic dermatitis (AD) — Atopy patch tests (APT) to assess type IV hypersensitivity involve applying custom-made food material for 48 to 72 hours using 8- to 12-mm test chambers, but APT are therefore not recommended for routine use at this time. Positive skin or blood tests ideally need to be verified by controlled food challenges, and the criterion standard for diagnosing food allergy is a double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge; such challenges should be performed under the guidance of well-trained medical personnel and with emergency equipment available. Avoidance diets should be cautiously undertaken, and even if food allergies are present, effective treatment for AD is still centered on good skin care and topical therapies. In children with clinically significant food allergy, tolerance will often develop over time to milk, egg, soy, and wheat and therefore these allergens should be retested with age, whereas data are limited but there is a suggestion that food allergies starting in adult life tend to be persistent.

### Delayed patch test reaction to budesonide in an 8-year-old [^65e2344b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids are an emerging cause of allergic contact dermatitis in children that may often be missed. It is important to consider patch testing with corticosteroids to detect allergic contact dermatitis in patients with persistent or worsening of dermatitis despite topical corticoseroid treatment. However, delayed reactions (> 7 days) to topical corticosteroids may occur, leading to false-negative reactions and misdiagnosis. Herein, we report a case of an 8-year-old girl who developed a positive reaction to budesonide on day 12 of patch testing.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^f2cb2241]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) definition and epidemiology — AD is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children, but also affects many adults, follows a relapsing course, and is often associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgE) levels and a personal or family history of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma; atopic eczema is synonymous with AD. AD onset is most common between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the eruption in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age, and while the majority have resolution by adulthood, 10% to 30% do not. AD has a complex pathogenesis involving genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors that lead to a dysfunctional skin barrier and dysregulation of the immune system, notable clinical findings include erythema, edema, xerosis, erosions/excoriations, oozing and crusting, and lichenification, and pruritus is a hallmark of the condition that contributes substantially to disease burden.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

NIAID and LEAP definitions of severe eczema and egg allergy — criteria for infant risk classification are specified. For severe eczema, the LEAP study required a rash needing topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors with duration thresholds of " < 6 months of age, lasted for at least 12 out of 30 days on two occasions" or " ≥ 6 months of age, lasted for at least 12 out of 30 days on two occasions in the last 6 months", and allowed parental description or "graded ≥ 40 using the modified SCORAD evaluation". The NIAID guideline defines severe eczema as "Persistent or frequently recurring eczema with typical morphology and distribution assessed as severe by a health care provider and requiring frequent need for prescription-strength topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or other anti-inflammatory agents despite appropriate use of emollients". For egg allergy, LEAP classified children with either an SPT (skin prick test) wheal diameter " > 6 mm" to raw hen's egg white without prior tolerance or " > 3 mm" to pasteurized egg white with allergic symptoms, whereas NIAID defines egg allergy as "A history of an allergic reaction to egg and a SPT wheal diameter of 3 mm or greater with egg white extract, or a positive oral egg food challenge result".

Atopic dermatitis — food allergy testing and elimination decisions: Guidelines suggest that children less than 5 years old with moderate-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) unresponsive to topical therapy undergo testing for food allergy (FA), including oral food challenge (OFC) or a trial of elimination diet, but clinical care should always start with optimization of skin care and topical therapies; when these efforts are unsuccessful, testing can be considered, and discussions with families should address risks and benefits, as the benefit may include improvement in AD but food removal will not cure AD and risks include potential development of anaphylaxis and effects on nutrition and quality of life.

### Emollients for prevention of atopic dermatitis: 5-year findings from the BEEP randomized trial [^0daa3a04]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of emollients for preventing atopic dermatitis/eczema is controversial. The Barrier Enhancement for Eczema Prevention trial evaluated the effects of daily emollients during the first year of life on atopic dermatitis and atopic conditions to age 5years.

Methods

1394 term infants with a family history of atopic disease were randomized (1:1) to daily emollient plus standard skin-care advice (693 emollient group) or standard skin-care advice alone (701 controls). Long-term follow-up at ages 3, 4 and 5years was via parental questionnaires. Main outcomes were parental report of a clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and food allergy.

Results

Parents reported more frequent moisturizer application in the emollient group through to 5years. A clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis between 12 and 60months was reported for 188/608 (31%) in the emollient group and 178/631 (28%) in the control group (adjusted relative risk 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.30). Although more parents in the emollient group reported food reactions in the previous year at 3 and 4years, cumulative incidence of doctor-diagnosed food allergy by 5years was similar between groups (92/609 [15%] emollients and 87/632 [14%] controls, adjusted relative risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.45). Findings were similar for cumulative incidence of asthma and hay fever.

Conclusions

Daily emollient application during the first year of life does not prevent atopic dermatitis, food allergy, asthma or hay fever.

### Effective prescribing in steroid allergy: controversies and cross-reactions [^2e7a49b7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids should be considered in all patients who do not respond to, or are made worse by, the use of topical steroids. The incidence of steroid allergy in such patients is reported as 9% to 22% in adult patients and in 25% of children. It can often go undiagnosed for a long time in patients with a long history of dermatologic conditions and steroid use. Although rare, both immediate and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported to systemic corticosteroids with an incidence of 0.3%. Reported reactions range from localized eczematous eruptions to systemic reactions, anaphylaxis, and even death. Delayed type reactions to systemically administered steroids may present as a generalized dermatitis, an exanthematous eruption, or occasionally, with blistering or purpura. In this contribution, we clarify the issues surrounding the pathogenesis of steroid allergy, cover the importance of cross-reactions, and describe strategies for the investigation and management for patients with suspected steroid allergy.

Table II — best practices for food allergy evaluation in atopic dermatitis emphasizes coordinated AD and food allergy care, advising to "Use shared decision-making for peanut introduction or peanut testing in accordance to guidelines derived from the LEAP study" and that "Before any additional testing, optimal skin care (Table I) should be implemented, including use of topical anti-inflammatory medications". If "the child has failed optimal skin care/medical management, and barriers to adherence have been addressed, perform a risk assessment for food allergy", considering age, AD severity and chronicity, "history of superinfections (suggesting S. aureus colonization)", and whether the child is ingesting the food. When testing is chosen, the plan includes "Detailed discussion of testing interpretation, including NPV, PPV, lack of clear cutoffs, particularly in patients with AD", discussion of "potential need for food challenges", and elimination risks including "anaphylaxis", with continued "shared decision-making". If elimination is implemented, "the child is considered food allergic until proven otherwise" and management should include "prescribing injectable epinephrine, emergency action plans, and nutritional guidance". Follow-up includes "Close follow-up within 2–4 weeks to assess response to food elimination", with guidance to "reintroduce the food" if no improvement and to "consider OFC to confirm the diagnosis of food-triggered eczema" if improved, plus "Regular follow-up as with other food allergy patients" for education, nutrition, and monitoring for natural tolerance.

2.7 Food allergy assessment

Parents were advised to introduce common food allergens including egg, dairy, and peanut early during weaning, as per national guidelines. Suspected cases of food allergy were clinically assessed by the blinded investigator and skin prick testing (SPT) was performed, as indicated. Infants also had SPT to egg, dairy, and peanut if they had not safely consumed these foods by 12 months. Where deemed necessary by the allergy team, those with a positive SPT or a reaction suggestive of food allergy were invited for an oral food challenge (OFC).

2.8 Outcomes

The primary outcome was cumulative incidence of AD at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included AD incidence at 6 months, cumulative incidence of sensitization to food at 12 months, and the evolution of TEWL and NMF between 0 and 12 months.

2.9 Sample size

The target sample size was 242 (n = 121 per group). This would provide 80% power at a 95% confidence level to detect a 50% reduction in cumulative AD at 12 months from 30% to 15%. The expected AD rate of 30% in this high‐risk group was based on data from a previous Irish birth cohort study in the same geographical area.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^be1f4e46]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of including emollient bath additives in the management of eczema in children.

Design

Pragmatic randomised open label superiority trial with two parallel groups.

Setting

96 general practices in Wales and western and southern England.

Participants

483 children aged 1 to 11 years, fulfilling UK diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis. Children with very mild eczema and children who bathed less than once weekly were excluded.

Interventions

Participants in the intervention group were prescribed emollient bath additives by their usual clinical team to be used regularly for 12 months. The control group were asked to use no bath additives for 12 months. Both groups continued with standard eczema management, including leave-on emollients, and caregivers were given standardised advice on how to wash participants.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was eczema control measured by the patient oriented eczema measure (POEM, scores 0–7 mild, 8–16 moderate, 17–28 severe) weekly for 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were eczema severity over one year (monthly POEM score from baseline to 52 weeks), number of eczema exacerbations resulting in primary healthcare consultation, disease specific quality of life (dermatitis family impact), generic quality of life (child health utility-9D), utilisation of resources, and type and quantity of topical corticosteroid or topical calcineurin inhibitors prescribed.

Results

483 children were randomised and one child was withdrawn, leaving 482 children in the trial: 51% were girls (244/482), 84% were of white ethnicity (447/470), and the mean age was 5 years. 96% (461/482) of participants completed at least one post-baseline POEM, so were included in the analysis, and 77% (370/482) completed questionnaires for more than 80% of the time points for the primary outcome (12/16 weekly questionnaires to 16 weeks). The mean baseline POEM score was 9.5 (SD 5.7) in the bath additives group and 10.1 (SD 5.8) in the no bath additives group. The mean POEM score over the 16 week period was 7.5 (SD. 6.0) in the bath additives group and 8.4 (SD 6.0) in the no bath additives group. No statistically significant difference was found in weekly POEM scores between groups over 16 weeks. After controlling for baseline severity and confounders (ethnicity, topical corticosteroid use, soap substitute use) and allowing for clustering of participants within centres and responses within participants over time, POEM scores in the no bath additives group were 0.41 points higher than in the bath additives group (95% confidence interval -0.27 to 1.10), below the published minimal clinically important difference for POEM of 3 points. The groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, economic outcomes, or adverse effects.

Conclusions

This trial found no evidence of clinical benefit from including emollient bath additives in the standard management of eczema in children. Further research is needed into optimal regimens for leave-on emollient and soap substitutes.

Trial Registration

### Evaluation of adrenal suppression of a lipid enhanced, topical emollient cream formulation of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% in treating children with atopic dermatitis [^c4d81ea0]. Pediatric Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are currently the first line of treatment for patients with atopic dermatitis. In the pediatric population however, the potential impact of adrenal suppression is always an important safety concern. Twenty boys and girls, 5–12 years of age, with normal adrenal function and a history of atopic dermatitis were maximally treated three times daily with a lipid-rich, moisturizing formulation of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% for up to 4 weeks. At the conclusion of the 4-week treatment period, cosyntropin injection stimulation testing showed no evidence of adrenal suppression. In addition, the therapy was noted to be highly efficacious, with a clinical success rate of 80% (Physician Global Score of (0) clear or (1) almost clear). No local side effects associated with prolonged use of topical corticosteroids were reported. In summary, this study supports the contention that this lipid-rich, moisturizing formulation of hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% was a well-tolerated and beneficial treatment for atopic dermatitis, demonstrating no adrenal suppression in the pediatric population aged 5–12 years. The relevance of these findings for children below 5 years of age, because of difference in body mass/surface area ratios, remains to be determined.

### Topical tacrolimus versus corticosteroids in childhood moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and the impact on airway inflammation: a long-term randomized open-label study [^e70fa35e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood atopic dermatitis (AD) is often followed by other atopic comorbidities such as asthma.

Aim

To compare the effectiveness of topical tacrolimus (TAC) and topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and their impact on airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients with paediatric AD.

Methods

This was a 3-year randomized open-label comparative follow-up study of 152 1-3-year-old children with moderate-to-severe AD (trial registration: EudraCT2012-002412-95). Frequent study visits including clinical examinations, laboratory investigations (total IgE, specific IgEs, blood eosinophils), skin prick and respiratory function tests to assess airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (exhaled nitric oxide, airway responsiveness to exercise and methacholine) were performed.

Results

Changes in eczema parameters at 36months were similar in the TCS and TAC groups for mean body surface area (BSA) difference 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to 4.19); P = 0.12], mean Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) difference 0.2 (95% CI -1.38 to 1.82; P = 0.2), mean Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) difference, 0.3 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.67; P = 0.12) and mean transepidermal water loss (TEWL) difference at the eczema site, -0.3 (95% CI -4.93 to 4.30; P = 0.96) and at the control site, 1.4 (95% CI -0.96 to 3.60, P = 0.19). The control-site TEWL increased more towards the end of follow-up in the TCS vs. TAC group (mean change difference -4.2, 95% CI -8.14 to -0.29; P = 0.04). No significant impact on development of airway inflammation or bronchial hyperresponsiveness occurred in early effective eczema-treatment responders vs. others ('early' vs. 'other' response was defined as the difference in treatment response to airway outcomes in BSA, EASI or IGA at 3months).

Conclusion

Children with moderate-to-severe AD benefit from long-term treatment with TCS or TAC. There were no significant differences in treatment efficacy. No differences in the impact on airways occurred between early effective treatment responders vs. others.

Atopic dermatitis dietary elimination — testing and screening considerations indicate that routine allergy testing to guide food elimination is discouraged because of false positives and potential harm: The available data "suggest against screening using allergy testing for the purposes of food elimination", noting it is "associated with a high risk of false-positive testing that could promote harm through food removal in a sensitized but unexposed infant and, therefore, increase the risk of developing IgE-mediated food allergy", and "This effect may be magnified in very young infants where such practices are currently frequently used". The systematic review "did not reveal any difference between test-guided and non–test-guided elimination for AD", consistent with "A testing directed strategy was no more efficacious than empirical elimination".

### Which children should we patch test? [^4de67d99]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in childhood was considered rare until recently. However, reports are increasing, which may reflect an increased incidence and/or more frequent patch testing of children. It is also likely that allergen exposure in children has changed with time.

Aims

To determine the most common contact allergens and the rate of positive patch-test reactions among children with suspected contact allergy.

Methods

We carried out a retrospective case study of 114 children (66 girls and 48 boys) aged from 3 to 15 years (median 11.5) patch tested over a 3-year period. Indications for patch testing included uncontrolled or deteriorating atopic dermatitis, localized dermatitis or a history of reacting to a specific allergen.

Results

Of 110 children for whom we had notes, 83 (75%) had a history of atopy. Positive reactions that were of current, past or possible relevance were seen in 61 children (54%); in 58 (52%) of 111 tested with the standard series (SS) and in 6 (10%) of 60 tested with the medicament series. None of the children patch tested to the corticosteroid (n = 47), shoe (n = 15), fragrance (n = 12), cosmetic (n = 10) or rubber (n = 5) series had a positive reaction. However, 11 (10%) reacted to rubber allergens within the SS and one of five to their own shoes. The lowest rate of relevant positive reactions was among those with deteriorating atopic dermatitis (22%) and facial (33%) or perioral dermatitis (40%), and the highest rate amongst those with eyelid (86%) or hand (71%) dermatitis. Nickel was the most common allergen (20%) in line with previous reports (82% female), followed by rubber chemicals (10%), fragrance (7.2%), cobalt (5.4%) and lanolin (wool alcohol) (4.5%).

Conclusions

The reported incidence of ACD among children, in particular nickel and rubber allergy, appears to be increasing, which may relate to changing fashions and hobbies. Contact allergy should be considered in all children with dermatitis, particularly with eyelid or hand dermatitis, and patch testing carried out more frequently.

### Corticosteroids [^83f04d18]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Up to 5% of dermatitis patients are allergic to corticosteroids. Because such allergy may be difficult to suspect due to the anti-inflammatory action of the corticosteroid, markers for corticosteroid allergy should be present in any standard series. Budesonide and tixocortol pivalate are two such markers, and they seem to detect a majority of corticosteroid allergy. The patch test concentration for a given corticosteroid may be crucial. A false-negative reaction may follow despite the patient being allergic, if too high a test concentration is used, because of the anti-inflammatory action of the corticosteroid. Patch test readings must be performed not only on Day 3 or Day 4 but also on a late occasion, i.e. Day 7 after test application, also because the anti-inflammatory action may suppress an allergic reaction at an early reading. Once a patient has reacted to a corticosteroid, an extended corticosteroid series should be tested, so that information may be given on which corticosteroids to use and, above all, which corticosteroids to avoid.

Aeroallergen atopy patch testing (APT) — APT with epicutaneous aeroallergen application on uninvolved atopic skin has been used for testing, with positive reactions observed in 30% to 50% of patients with AD but only rarely in patients with respiratory allergy or healthy volunteers. Some noted APT to have a higher specificity but lower sensitivity than SPT or specific IgE, and positive APT has been reported even when aeroallergen-specific serum IgE is undetectable and SPT results are negative. Some have suggested APT use when there is a high suspicion of aeroallergen-related symptoms or if there is severe and/or persistent AD with unknown triggering factors, but the major disadvantage is variability in methods and interpretation and lack of a commercially available product; standardization has been proposed but is hampered by the lack of a comparator gold standard test.

### Recommendation to update the British society for cutaneous allergy corticosteroid series [^af6ded32]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patch testing is an important investigation when dermatitis is unresponsive to, or worsened by, topical corticosteroid treatment. There is a balance to be struck between testing too many allergens, which is expensive, time consuming and risks causing sensitization, and testing too few, which risks missing the diagnosis. The current British Society for Cutaneous Allergy (BSCA) corticosteroid series comprises eight allergens and was last updated in February 2007.

Aim

To review and update the BSCA corticosteroid series.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed data from 16 patch test centres in the UK and Ireland for all patients who were patch tested to a corticosteroid series between August 2017 and July 2019. We recorded the allergens tested, the number and percentage tested to a corticosteroid series and the number of positive results for each allergen. We identified the allergens that test positive in ≥ 0.1% of selectively tested patients.

Results

Overall, 3531 patients were tested to a corticosteroid series in the 16 centres. The number of allergens tested ranged from 7 to 18 (mean 10). The proportion of patch test patients who were tested to a corticosteroid series ranged from 1% to 99%. Six allergens in the 2017 BSCA series tested positive in ≥ 0.1% of patients. Nine allergens not in the BSCA corticosteroid series tested positive in ≥ 0.1% of patients.

Conclusion

This audit demonstrates the importance of regular review of recommended series and the significant variations in practice. The new BSCA corticosteroid series that we recommend contains 13 haptens, with the addition of the patient's own steroid creams as appropriate.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 4. prevention of disease flares and use of adjunctive therapies and approaches [^1ca0d511]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — food allergy definition, clinical presentation, and testing scope — A true allergy is defined as "an adverse health event that results from stimulation of a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure", and reproducible clinical symptoms or signs after food exposure/ingestion are necessary to diagnose food allergy; broad panel allergy testing independent of a history of a reaction to foods is not recommended. Exposure to allergenic foods may induce eczematous dermatitis as a delayed reaction that typically occurs 6–48 hours later, but more often causes immediate type I reactions usually within 2 hours, which can include local or generalized urticaria, flushing, or itch; food allergy may also present as gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms, and at times, anaphylaxis. Asthma is a stronger risk factor for food allergy than AD.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research — the expert group's priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

Skin test modifiers and selection — Preadministration of drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, misoprostol, prednisone, and azelastine, before application of skin tests partially or completely inhibit the late-phase cutaneous response. The number of skin tests and the allergens selected should be determined based on the patient's age, history, environment and living conditions, occupation, and activities, and routine use of a large number of tests or routine annual tests without a definite clinical indication are clearly not justified.

### Atopic dermatitis and food allergy: best practices and knowledge gaps – A work group report from the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee and leadership institute project [^d866a742]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis — food allergy testing and early peanut introduction guidance: "For children less than 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe eczema, the EP recommended that clinicians consider evaluation for milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy sensitization", when "the child has persistent AD in spite of optimized management and topical therapy" or "the child has a reliable history of an immediate reaction after ingestion of a specific food". "No specific recommendation was made for older children or adults". The guideline cautions that with skin prick tests (SPT) or specific IgE (sIgE), "the potential for false-positive results is high, particularly in patients with AD". For prevention, "For infants with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both, exposure to age-appropriate peanut-containing foods was recommended as early as 4 to 6 months of age (after appropriate evaluation.)", and a joint task force update "adopted similar language… for children with moderate-to-severe AD under the age of 5 years", while advising that "the clinician should only test for relevant allergens".

### Application of topical corticosteroids to sites of positive immediate-type allergy skin tests to relieve itching: results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^82734d2f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In many allergy clinics topical corticosteroid cream is applied to sites of positive skin tests in an attempt to alleviate itching.

Objectives

To determine whether or not this practice is effective.

Methods

Patients with 5 or more positive skin test results were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups after skin test result reading: application of 2.5% hydrocortisone in moisturizing cream, moisturizing cream alone, or no topical application. Immediately after the skin test results were read (baseline) and at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, patients rated their itching on a 100-mm visual analog scale.

Results

Average itch scores for all groups combined were 44, 33, 22, and 12 at 0, 5, 15, and 30 minutes, respectively. No differences were found among the groups at any time point. No correlation was found between the baseline itch scores and age, sex, number of positive skin test results (≥ 3-mm wheals), or number of large positive skin test results (≥ 15-mm wheals).

Conclusions

The application of corticosteroid cream to sites of positive immediate-type allergy skin tests does not provide relief of itching; therefore, this practice should be abandoned. Instead, patients should be informed that any itching they may be experiencing will substantially resolve during the next 30 minutes and that application of such topical treatment will not hasten the relief of itching.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^8048e31f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted.

Objectives

To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short-term measurements (defined as less than three months follow-up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study). Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate-to-severe eczema after short-term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low-quality evidence). When short-term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate-to-severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (mean improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain. All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low-quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long-term control. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low-quality evidence). There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate-to-severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all. Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance.

### Useful tools for the management of atopic dermatitis [^8847c57c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Eczema, frequently named atopic dermatitis, is the most frequent chronic skin disease of early childhood, with a high prevalence in industrialized countries and a relapsing-remitting course that is responsible for a serious burden on affected children and their families. Even though most facets of this disease are nowadays well known and numerous guidelines are available, some confusion still exists regarding certain aspects. First, several names have been proposed for the disorder. We suggest that the name and definition adopted by the World Allergy Organization should be used: 'eczema', divided into 'atopic', when an allergic sensitization can be demonstrated, and 'non-atopic', in the absence of sensitization. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed, but at present the two most reliable are the 2003 revision by the American Academy of Dermatology of the Hanifin-Rajka criteria, and those by Williams revised in 2005. To date, 20 different clinical scores have been published to assess the severity; however, only the EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index), the SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), and the POEM (Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure) seem to have been adequately validated and are recommended for use in clinical practice and trials. The diagnostic tests to identify associated allergy or sensitization include skin-prick tests, determination of the specific IgE in serum using different assays, and atopy patch tests; in the case of suspected food allergy, a food challenge may be necessary to define the diagnosis. To evaluate quality of life, tools exist that allow both the child's and family's impairment to be considered. In addition, several algorithms exist to help decide therapy on a step-wise basis. However, such guidelines and algorithms represent only an aid to the physician and not an obligatory directive, since the ultimate judgment regarding any therapy must be performed by the physician and tailored to individual needs. A clear and validated definition of eczema control would permit better monitoring of the disease, similar to the situation with asthma in recent years. Finally, the review examines the role of special textiles in diminishing Staphylococcus aureus skin superinfection, of house dust-mite avoidance measures, and of educational programs for patients and their families, which may all help improve eczema.

### The evolution of IgE-based allergy testing in atopic dermatitis: where Do we stand? [^426e770d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD) involves cutaneous inflammation, predominantly mediated by innate immunity and T cells, with Immunoglobulin E (IgE) playing a marginal role in most patients. Over previous decades, however, there has been an ongoing debate regarding the relevance of IgE-mediated allergy testing in AD patients. Patients with AD have a defective skin barrier that facilitates a high inflammatory response to environmental antigens, placing them at greater risk for food allergies. Nevertheless, because these patients often produce very high levels of IgE, the positive predictive value of skin prick tests and specific IgE measurements is low; such tests should be performed only when there is a concordant immediate hypersensitivity reaction (i.e. urticaria or angioedema) rather than eczema. In recent years, numerous studies have emphasized the importance of maintaining oral exposure to foods in order to prevent the development or progression of food allergies in atopic patients. While acknowledging that food allergens may contribute to AD in certain cases, it is critical that patients understand the risk of developing IgE-mediated food allergies if they exclude allergenic foods from their diet. Ultimately, controlling AD while retaining these foods in the diet should be the goal for all patients.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^92b39eee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Two pilot studies, Simpson 2014 and Horimukai 2014, were reported as showing significant reductions in eczema risk. Larger, more definitive trials published subsequently found no reduction in eczema, and our meta‐analysis results are consistent with the findings from these larger trials (Chalmers 2020; Skjerven 2020). The reason for the difference in findings between small pilot studies and larger trials is not clear, but differences in adherence to treatment, methods and timing of outcome assessment, and study population may all be relevant.

Finally, a previous Cochrane Review has evaluated emollients as treatment for already established eczema (Van Zuuren 2017). That review concluded that although the evidence was weak, emollients reduce disease severity compared to no treatment ‐ reducing flares, prolonging time between flares, and decreasing the need for topical corticosteroids. Our new review concerns the primary prevention of eczema and does not directly impact the well‐established and well‐accepted intervention of emollients for people who already have eczema.

### Skin emollient and early complementary feeding to prevent infant atopic dermatitis (preventADALL): a factorial, multicentre, cluster-randomised trial [^de806c33]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Skin emollients applied during early infancy could prevent atopic dermatitis, and early complementary food introduction might reduce food allergy in high-risk infants. The study aimed to determine if either regular skin emollients applied from 2 weeks of age, or early complementary feeding introduced between 12 and 16 weeks of age, reduced development of atopic dermatitis by age 12 months in the general infant population.

Methods

This population-based 2×2 factorial, randomised clinical trial was done at Oslo University Hospital and Østfold Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway; and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Infants of women recruited antenatally at the routine ultrasound pregnancy screening at 18 weeks were cluster-randomised at birth from 2015 to 2017 to the following groups: (1) controls with no specific advice on skin care while advised to follow national guidelines on infant nutrition (no intervention group); (2) skin emollients (bath additives and facial cream; skin intervention group); (3) early complementary feeding of peanut, cow's milk, wheat, and egg (food intervention group); or (4) combined skin and food interventions (combined intervention group). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) using computer- generated cluster randomisation based on 92 geographical living area blocks as well as eight 3-month time blocks. Carers were instructed to apply the interventions on at least 4 days per week. Atopic dermatitis by age 12 months was the primary outcome, based on clinical investigations at 3, 6 and 12 months by investigators masked to group allocation. Atopic dermatitis was assessed after completing the 12-month investigations and diagnosed if either of the UK Working Party and Hanifin and Rajka (12 months only) diagnostic criteria were fulfilled. The primary efficacy analyses was done by intention-to-treat analysis on all randomly assigned participants. Food allergy results will be reported once all investigations at age 3 years are completed in 2020. This was a study performed within ORAACLE (the Oslo Research Group of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood; the Lung and Environment). The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02449850.

Findings

2697 women were recruited between Dec 9, 2014, and Oct 31, 2016, from whom 2397 newborn infants were enrolled from April 14, 2015, to April 11, 2017. Atopic dermatitis was observed in 48 (8%) of 596 infants in the no intervention group, 64 (11%) of 575 in the skin intervention group, 58 (9%) of 642 in the food intervention group, and 31 (5%) of 583 in the combined intervention group. Neither skin emollients nor early complementary feeding reduced development of atopic dermatitis, with a risk difference of 3·1% (95% CI -0·3 to 6·5) for skin intervention and 1·0% (-2·1 to 4·1) for food intervention, in favour of control. No safety concerns with the interventions were identified. Reported skin symptoms and signs (including itching, oedema, exanthema, dry skin, and urticaria) were no more frequent in the skin, food, and combined intervention groups than in the no intervention group.

Interpretation

Neither early skin emollients nor early complementary feeding reduced development of atopic dermatitis by age 12 months. Our study does not support the use of these interventions to prevent atopic dermatitis by 12 months of age in infants.

The study was funded by several public and private funding bodies: The Regional Health Board South East, The Norwegian Research Council, Health and Rehabilitation Norway, The Foundation for Healthcare and Allergy Research in Sweden-Vårdalstiftelsen, Swedish Asthma and Allergy Association's Research Foundation, Swedish Research Council-the Initiative for Clinical Therapy Research, The Swedish Heart-Lung Foundation, SFO-V at the Karolinska Institute, Freemason Child House Foundation in Stockholm, Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare-FORTE, Oslo University Hospital, the University of Oslo, and Østfold Hospital Trust.

### Allergy testing in childhood: using allergen-specific IgE tests [^21f4645d]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of triggers can induce common pediatric allergic diseases which include asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and anaphylaxis. Allergy testing serves to confirm an allergic trigger suspected on the basis of history. Tests for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) are performed by in vitro assays or skin tests. The tests are excellent for identifying a sensitized state in which allergen-specific IgE is present, and may identify triggers to be eliminated and help guide immunotherapy treatment. However, a positive test result does not always equate with clinical allergy. Newer enzymatic assays based on anti-IgE antibodies have supplanted the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). This clinical report focuses on allergen-specific IgE testing, emphasizing that the medical history and knowledge of disease characteristics are crucial for rational test selection and interpretation.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance addressing atopic dermatitis (AD) management, last issued in 2012 by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force, requires updating as a result of new treatments and improved guideline and evidence synthesis methodology.

Objective

To produce evidence-based guidelines that support patients, clinicians, and other decision-makers in the optimal treatment of AD.

Methods

A multidisciplinary guideline panel consisting of patients and caregivers, AD experts (dermatology and allergy/immunology), primary care practitioners (family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine), and allied health professionals (psychology, pharmacy, nursing) convened, prioritized equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, and implemented management strategies to minimize influence of conflicts of interest. The Evidence in Allergy Group supported guideline development by performing systematic evidence reviews, facilitating guideline processes, and holding focus groups with patient and family partners. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. Evidence-to-decision frameworks, subjected to public comment, translated evidence to recommendations using trustworthy guideline principles.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations to gain and maintain control of AD for patients with mild, moderate, and severe AD. The eAppendix provides practical information and implementation considerations in 1–2 page patient-friendly handouts.

Conclusion

These evidence-based recommendations address optimal use of (1) topical treatments (barrier moisturization devices, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors [crisaborole], topical JAK inhibitors, occlusive [wet wrap] therapy, adjunctive antimicrobials, application frequency, maintenance therapy), (2) dilute bleach baths, (3) dietary avoidance/elimination, (4) allergen immunotherapy, and (5) systemic treatments (biologics/monoclonal antibodies, small molecule immunosuppressants [cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, JAK inhibitors], and systemic corticosteroids) and UV phototherapy (light therapy).

Early peanut introduction and severe AD criteria for screening: The LEAP study prompted an addendum to the NIAID guidelines for peanut allergy testing, in which the first recommendation focused on infants with severe AD, egg allergy, or both, and for this subgroup measurement of the peanut specific IgE (sIgE) level, skin prick test (SPT), or both is strongly recommended before introducing peanut protein; the second addendum recommends introducing peanut-containing foods to infants with mild or moderate AD at approximately 6 months of age without prior sIgE or SPT screening, and the third recommends freely introducing peanut-containing foods in infants without AD as the family wishes, while criteria used in LEAP to define "severe" AD were either requiring topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors with episodes lasting at least 12 of 30 days on 2 occasions when the participant is < 6 months of age or similarly on 2 occasions in the last 6 months if > 6 months of age, or being graded ≥ 40 on modified SCORAD, and, in general, in children under 12 months of age with severe AD and any documented food reaction, especially to egg, allergy testing at least to peanut should occur before introducing it into the diet.

Allergists are often asked to evaluate children with atopic dermatitis (AD) for allergen triggers to disease. Testing, particularly for food triggers, often leads to elimination diets in an effort to improve AD control. However, the dual exposure hypothesis suggests that oral tolerance to food antigens is promoted through high-dose oral exposure, where sensitization occurs through lower dose cutaneous exposure. This suggests that strict elimination diets may pose some risks in children with AD. In addition, emerging evidence suggests an important role of skin inflammation in further allergic disease and the importance of dietary exposure to maintain oral tolerance. This work group report reviews current guidelines-based management for children with moderate-to-severe AD, the evidence for current recommendations for the evaluation and management of these children, provides a nuanced examination of these studies, and addresses current knowledge gaps in the care of these children.

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician-reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main Results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high-income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty-five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data. Stronger-potency versus weaker-potency topical corticosteroids Sixty-three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician-reported signs of eczema. We pooled four trials that compared moderate- versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate-potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild-potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate-potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate-certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low-certainty evidence). Twice daily or more versus once daily application We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks. Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare-up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher-potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low-certainty evidence. Longer versus shorter-term duration of application for induction of remission No trials were identified. Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare-ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe). Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Local adverse events We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty. Other comparisons Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' Conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare-ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare-ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low- or very low-certainty, short-term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer-term trials, in people with mild eczema.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^05cd9655]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

Both groups saw some reduction in itch measured on an unspecified scale by week 2. In the topical corticosteroid‐first group, median itch was 6.0 (IQR 5.0 to 8.0; 20 participants) at baseline, 6.0 (IQR 3.0 to 8.0; 17 participants) at week 1, and 4.0 (IQR 2.5 to 7.0; 12 participants) at week 2. In the emollient‐first group, median itch was 6.0 (IQR 5.0 to 8.0; 26 participants) at baseline, 4.0 (IQR 3.0 to 6.0; 23 participants) at week 1, and 4.0 (IQR 3.0 to 6.0; 19 participants) at week 2.

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Local site reactions were reported up to week 2 (see Analysis 11.1). The most frequent event was pruritus, reported in 6 of 20 participants in the topical corticosteroid‐first group compared to four of 26 participants in the topical corticosteroid after group. Overall, there was little difference between groups in local site reactions.

Safety: number of relevant systemic adverse events (secondary outcome)

Systemic adverse events were not reported.

Time between application of emollient and steroid

We did not find any trials that involved the use of this strategy.

### Atopic dermatitis and food allergy: best practices and knowledge gaps – A work group report from the AAAAI allergic skin diseases committee and leadership institute project [^39879508]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis and food allergy — work group report scope and key concepts are outlined: Allergists are often asked to evaluate children with atopic dermatitis (AD) for allergen triggers, and testing for food triggers often leads to elimination diets to improve AD control; the report cautions that strict elimination diets may pose some risks in children with AD and notes emerging evidence on the role of skin inflammation and the importance of dietary exposure to maintain oral tolerance; it reviews current guidelines-based management for children with moderate-to-severe AD, examines the evidence for current recommendations for evaluation and management, and addresses knowledge gaps.

### Atopic dermatitis: update on skin-directed management: clinical report [^65648333]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Food allergy and atopic dermatitis (AD) — co-occurrence, testing, and diet guidance. AD has been viewed as the first step in the "atopic march", and although parents may suspect food allergies as a cause of AD, food-induced AD is rare; the conditions tend to co-occur and up to 40% of children with AD develop food allergy. Food allergy testing should only be pursued in children with a history consistent with immediate-type allergy, because more than half of children with AD will have high food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations even without true food allergy; overemphasis on food allergy leads to unnecessary elimination diets and may result in intolerance, and avoidance diets should only be recommended in patients who have failed a diagnostic food challenge, with treatment instead focusing on skin-directed therapies.

### Rational approach to allergy testing [^7985d096]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Allergy testing is commonly used when symptoms of allergic rhinitis are refractory to symptoms and there is potential for treatment with institution of avoidance measures or immunotherapy. Once the decision for testing has been made, the method of testing by either in vivo skin testing by prick/puncture or intradermal testing or in vitro testing of serum-specific IgE is dictated by factors in the clinical history and an informed decision by the patient. Because there is no perfect testing method, understanding the benefits and limitations of each method is important in selecting the best testing option for each patient.

### Consensus-based European guidelines for treatment of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) in adults and children: part I [^9a32f695]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for atopic dermatitis, more specifically with respect to topical corticosteroids, EAACI/EADV/EDF/EFA/ESDaP/ESPD/ETFAD/GA²LEN/UEMS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider offering proactive therapy with twice-weekly application in the long-term follow-up to reduce relapses. Consider continuing proactive therapy with topical corticosteroids for at least 20 weeks.
