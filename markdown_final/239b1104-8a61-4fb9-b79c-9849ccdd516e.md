## Question

diarrhea in 1 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing diarrhea in a 1-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining diarrhea and classifying severity. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, including dehydration and red flags. Next, I will review when to test and when to treat empirically. After that, I need to outline rehydration strategies, nutrition, and adjuncts like zinc and probiotics. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, follow-up, and prevention, and close with a concise management summary anchored to guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and duration categories so I don't misclassify the illness. Diarrhea in children is defined as three or more loose or watery stools in 24 hours, and duration categories matter for management: acute watery or bloody diarrhea less than 7 days, prolonged 7–13 days, persistent 14–29 days, and chronic 30 days or more, which helps frame expectations and testing thresholds [^1125KSJb].

> I need to check severity next, because dehydration risk drives everything in this age group. I should assess for dehydration using clinical signs such as capillary refill, skin turgor, mucous membranes, mental status, and urine output, and classify as none, some, or severe dehydration to guide therapy and disposition; dehydration increases the risk of life-threatening illness, especially in young children, so I must not undercall it [^115Ne5w9] [^1127sU6U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I gather key history. I should confirm duration, stool characteristics, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and exposures including daycare, travel, sick contacts, animal exposures, and recent antibiotics, because these features shape pretest probabilities and public health actions; a careful exposure history is strongly recommended in guidelines and can change management decisions [^111iwEH6] [^11278Z2D].

> Next, I should review red flags that mandate urgent escalation. I will now examine for lethargy or altered mental status, persistent vomiting preventing oral intake, signs of severe dehydration, bloody stools with systemic toxicity, high fever with ill appearance, and any immunocompromise; these features push me toward IV therapy, broader diagnostics, and possible empiric antibiotics depending on context [^116jwv3M] [^117LXtPW].

> Let me consider when testing is actually helpful, because indiscriminate stool testing is low yield and can drive misuse. I should double-check that routine stool cultures are not needed for mild, nonbloody, short-duration illness in immunocompetent children; instead, I should reserve testing for dysentery, moderate-to-severe disease, persistent symptoms beyond about a week, immunocompromise, outbreak settings, or high-risk exposures, and if I do test, I should target likely pathogens rather than broad panels to preserve stewardship [^116CuDrD] [^1148R2pr].

> Wait, I initially thought "test all bloody stools", but I should verify exceptions. For bloody diarrhea, I should avoid empiric antibiotics while awaiting results in immunocompetent hosts unless the child is under 3 months, has classic Shigella dysentery with fever and tenesmus, or has recent international travel with high fever or sepsis; this prevents harm from inappropriate therapy and aligns with IDSA guidance [^115g8TM3] [^117LXtPW].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic indications, and I need to ensure I don't overuse them. For most immunocompetent children with acute watery diarrhea and no recent international travel, empiric antibiotics are not recommended; exceptions include ill-appearing infants under 3 months, immunocompromised hosts with severe illness, and select travel-associated scenarios, in which case azithromycin is a reasonable empiric choice in pediatrics depending on local susceptibility, while avoiding routine antibiotics for persistent watery diarrhea beyond 14 days [^111LYwyM] [^115VatGV].

> But wait, what if someone suggests azithromycin broadly for all young children with diarrhea? I should confirm the evidence. Large randomized trials in low-resource settings did not show a mortality benefit from adding azithromycin to standard WHO case management for acute watery diarrhea in children 2–23 months, supporting adherence to rehydration-focused care without routine antibiotics in this context [^115bcyb3] [^116cM5BE].

> Next, I should review rehydration, because this is the cornerstone. For mild-to-moderate dehydration, reduced-osmolarity ORS at 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours is first-line, with replacement of ongoing losses at roughly 10 mL/kg per stool or emesis; if oral intake fails, nasogastric ORS is acceptable, and for severe dehydration or shock I should use isotonic IV crystalloids with 20 mL/kg boluses until perfusion normalizes, then transition to ORS to complete deficit replacement [^115oX9BJ] [^116jwv3M] [^111KxZ6T].

> I should confirm nutrition guidance, since early refeeding improves outcomes. Breastfeeding should continue throughout the illness, and an age-appropriate regular diet should be resumed within 12 hours of rehydration; routine lactose restriction is not necessary for most children, though a temporary lactose-free option can be considered if persistent diarrhea or malnutrition is present, and restrictive diets like BRAT lack strong evidence and may delay recovery [^112a9xde] [^115BopXz] [^114vDXPN].

> Let me think about adjuncts that can modestly shorten illness. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii can be considered to reduce duration and stool frequency in otherwise healthy children, and zinc supplementation for 10–14 days is recommended for children 6 months to 5 years, particularly in settings with zinc deficiency or malnutrition, recognizing a small increase in vomiting as a trade-off [^116EwJPp] [^112N7wAv].

> I should double-check symptomatic medications because harm can outweigh benefit. Antimotility agents like loperamide are contraindicated in children under 18 years due to serious adverse events, especially in toddlers; conversely, ondansetron can facilitate ORS tolerance in children older than 4 years with persistent vomiting, but routine use warrants caution given cardiac safety concerns and should not replace rehydration [^113DRoeK] [^117S7csM] [^114fuMUB].

> Now, I need to ensure I cover special scenarios that alter management. In infants under 3 months with diarrhea, I should obtain blood cultures and have a low threshold for empiric parenteral antibiotics given sepsis risk; for suspected STEC, I should avoid antibiotics and antidiarrheals and prioritize supportive care and early IV fluids to mitigate HUS risk; for C. difficile in children 1–2 years, testing is not routine and should be reserved for high suspicion after excluding other causes; for travel-associated diarrhea, azithromycin may be considered if invasive features are present, but rehydration remains primary [^116Yy3yK] [^114JmKZm] [^115xFU4f] [^115VatGV].

> Next, I should review follow-up and nonresponse, because persistent symptoms need a new plan. If diarrhea persists beyond 14 days or worsens, I should reassess hydration and nutrition, reconsider the working diagnosis, and evaluate for noninfectious etiologies such as IBD or celiac disease; if antibiotics were used and symptoms flare, I should consider C. difficile testing in the right context and adjust therapy based on identified pathogens or resistance patterns [^113pABJn] [^116CzgJq] [^1168yV1K].

> I will now examine prevention and public health, since families often ask what to do at home and in the community. Hand hygiene and safe food and water practices reduce transmission, symptomatic children should avoid swimming and food handling while ill, and rotavirus vaccination should be offered to all infants without contraindications to reduce severe diarrheal disease burden and hospitalizations [^115XKuYH] [^115uPKwB] [^111ndPHx].

> Let me reconsider the overall approach to ensure internal consistency. The safest, most evidence-based pathway is to classify severity accurately, prioritize oral rehydration with early nutrition, avoid harmful medications like loperamide, reserve antibiotics for well-defined indications, and use probiotics and zinc selectively; this aligns with IDSA, WHO-aligned guidance, and pediatric society recommendations and avoids the pitfalls of unnecessary testing and overtreatment that prolong illness and increase costs [^112uQ4Tf] [^112N7wAv] [^115bEPsb].

> Finally, I should confirm caregiver education elements that reduce return visits and complications. Families should receive clear instructions on ORS preparation and dosing, signs of worsening dehydration, when to seek urgent care, continuation of regular feeding including breastfeeding, and the rationale for avoiding antidiarrheals and routine antibiotics; structured counseling improves adherence and outcomes, and clinicians should anticipate parental interest in diagnostics and explain stewardship to align expectations [^1127sU6U] [^112LiNgZ].

Diarrhea in a 1-year-old is most often due to viral gastroenteritis [^notfound] and is managed with **ORS as first-line therapy** [^111KxZ6T] for rehydration, continued breastfeeding or formula, and early resumption of a regular diet [^111Lqkk8]. Antibiotics are **not routine** [^111LYwyM] and should only be used for specific bacterial or parasitic infections; avoid **loperamide** [^113DRoeK] and other antimotility agents due to serious risks [^111Qhugr]. Seek urgent care for red flags such as persistent vomiting, signs of severe dehydration, bloody stools, high fever, lethargy, or poor intake [^116w2tod].

---

## Common causes of diarrhea in 1-year-old children

- **Viral infections**: Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus are common causes of acute diarrhea in this age group [^notfound].

- **Bacterial infections**: Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli are common bacterial pathogens [^notfound].

- **Parasitic infections**: Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium are common parasitic causes, particularly in children attending daycare or with exposure to contaminated water [^notfound].

- **Non-infectious causes**: Food allergies, lactose intolerance, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea are common non-infectious causes [^notfound].

---

## Clinical assessment and evaluation

### History

History should include the **duration and frequency** of diarrhea; the presence of blood or mucus; associated symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain; recent travel or daycare exposure; antibiotic use; and dietary changes [^notfound].

---

### Physical examination

Assess for **dehydration** (mild, moderate, or severe) using clinical signs such as capillary refill, skin turgor, mucous membranes, and mental status [^115Ne5w9]. Also evaluate growth parameters, abdominal findings, and signs of systemic illness [^notfound].

---

### Laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing is **not indicated** for mild cases [^116CuDrD]. Consider stool culture, ova and parasite examination, or C. difficile testing in moderate-to-severe cases, persistent diarrhea (> 14 days), or when specific pathogens are suspected [^1148R2pr]. Blood tests (CBC, electrolytes, renal function) are indicated in moderate-to-severe dehydration or systemic illness [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Rehydration therapy

Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is **first-line** [^111KxZ6T] for mild-to-moderate dehydration, using reduced-osmolarity ORS (75 mmol/L sodium, 75 mmol/L glucose, osmolarity 245 mOsm/L) [^notfound]. Administer 50–100 mL/kg over 4 hours, plus 10 mL/kg for each diarrheal stool [^115oX9BJ]. Intravenous (IV) fluids are indicated for severe dehydration, shock, or when ORS is not tolerated; use isotonic solutions such as Lactated Ringer's or normal saline [^111yHMLk].

---

### Nutritional management

Continue **breastfeeding** or formula feeding throughout the illness [^112a9xde]. Resume a regular, age-appropriate diet within 4–6 hours after rehydration; avoid restrictive diets such as BRAT, as they are nutritionally inadequate [^115BopXz].

---

### Pharmacological management

- **Antibiotics**: Not routinely recommended; indicated only for specific bacterial or parasitic infections (e.g. Shigella, Giardia, C. difficile) [^111LYwyM].

- **Antidiarrheal agents**: Loperamide and other antimotility agents are contraindicated in children due to risk of serious adverse effects, including respiratory depression and toxic megacolon [^113DRoeK] [^111Qhugr].

- **Probiotics**: May be considered to reduce duration and severity of diarrhea, particularly in viral gastroenteritis. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces boulardii have the most evidence [^116EwJPp].

---

## Indications for hospitalization

- **Severe dehydration**: Altered mental status, shock, or failure of oral rehydration [^116jwv3M].

- **Persistent vomiting**: Inability to retain fluids orally [^1117Tzi7].

- **Severe systemic illness**: High fever, lethargy, or signs of sepsis [^116Yy3yK].

- **Failure of outpatient management**: No improvement after 24–48 hours of appropriate therapy [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing with soap and water [^115XKuYH].

- **Safe drinking water**: Ensure access to clean water [^notfound].

- **Rotavirus vaccination**: Recommended for all infants [^115uPKwB].

- **Breastfeeding**: Continued breastfeeding provides immunological protection [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

- **Dehydration**: Most common complication, can be life-threatening if untreated [^114JmKZm].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis [^112X6f1f].

- **Malnutrition**: Prolonged diarrhea can lead to growth faltering [^116cM5BE].

- **Secondary infections**: Bacterial or parasitic superinfections [^notfound].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent medical attention

- **Persistent vomiting**: Unable to retain fluids [^117S7csM].

- **Signs of severe dehydration**: Lethargy, sunken eyes, very slow capillary refill, minimal urine output [^notfound].

- **Bloody stools**: Indicates possible bacterial infection [^116CuDrD].

- **High fever**: ≥ 39°C (102.2°F) [^notfound].

- **Poor intake**: Refusal to eat or drink for more than 24 hours [^notfound].

---

Diarrhea in a 1-year-old is common and usually self-limited; **ORS and continued feeding** are the cornerstones of management, with antibiotics reserved for specific infections. Hospitalization is indicated for severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, or systemic illness, and preventive measures such as hand hygiene and rotavirus vaccination are essential [^112d1yoU] [^111KxZ6T] [^115BopXz] [^111LYwyM] [^115bEPsb] [^115XKuYH] [^115uPKwB].

### Universal recommendations for the management of acute diarrhea in nonmalnourished children [^112N7wAv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite a substantial consistency in recommendations for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), a high variability in clinical practice and a high rate of inappropriate medical interventions persist in both developing and developed countries. The aim of this study was to develop a set of clinical recommendations for the management of nonseverely malnourished children with AGE to be applied worldwide.

Methods

The Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (FISPGHAN) Working Group (WG) selected care protocols on the management of acute diarrhea in infants and children aged between 1 month and 18 years. The WG used a 3-step approach consisting of: systematic review and comparison of published guidelines, agreement on draft recommendations using Delphi methodology, and external peer-review and validation of recommendations.

Results

A core of recommendations including definition, diagnosis, nutritional management, and active treatment of AGE was developed with an overall agreement of 91% (range 80%-96%). A total of 28 world experts in pediatric gastroenterology and emergency medicine successively validated the set of 23 recommendations with an agreement of 87% (range 83%-95%). Recommendations on the use of antidiarrheal drugs and antiemetics received the lowest level of agreement and need to be tailored at local level. Oral rehydration and probiotics were the only treatments recommended.

Conclusions

Universal recommendations to assist health care practitioners in managing children with AGE may improve practitioners' compliance with guidelines, reduce inappropriate interventions, and significantly impact clinical outcome and health care-associated costs.

Traveler's diarrhea is the most common travel disease in both children and adults. Adult guidelines for traveler's diarrhea have been established, but significant gaps persist in guidance for the evaluation and management of pediatric traveler's diarrhea. Adult guidelines are not necessarily applicable in children, and it is essential for clinicians to account for the differences in pediatric pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and treatment recommendations when evaluating and managing pediatric traveler's diarrhea.

### The applicability and efficacy of guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in outpatient children: a field-randomized trial on primary care pediatricians [^1148Sauo]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the applicability and efficacy of guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) as used by pediatricians.

Study Design

This was a national, open, randomized, controlled intervention trial. The intervention consisted of a 2-hour course based on the guidelines for management of AGE. Seventy-five randomly selected primary care pediatricians underwent training in AGE management (group A), and 75 pediatricians who were not specifically trained served as controls (group B). Each pediatrician enrolled 10 children age 1–36 months with acute-onset diarrhea. Outcome measures were guidelines applicability, duration of diarrhea, and difference in body weight between the first visit and 5–7 days later.

Results

The baseline features of the children were similar in groups A (n = 617) and B (n = 692). A total of 404 of the 617 children in group A (65.5%) were fully treated according to the guidelines, compared with 20 of the 692 children in group B (3%). Most violations involved administration of unnecessary drugs or diets. The duration of diarrhea was shorter in group A (intention-to-treat: 83.3 vs 90.9 hours; P < .001). Weight gain was marginally, but statistically significantly, higher in the children treated according to the guidelines (per-protocol analysis: +16.5 gr vs -13.5 gr; P < .05).

Conclusions

Guidelines for AGE have good applicability and excellent efficacy. Adjunctive medical interventions are associated with a longer duration of diarrhea.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^115bcyb3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the addition of azithromycin to the standard case management of acute watery diarrhea for children aged 2 to 23 months who are dehydrated or undernourished reduce mortality and improve linear growth?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 8266 children was unable to detect a survival benefit for children from the addition of azithromycin to the standard World Health Organization (WHO) case management of acute watery diarrhea in low-resource settings.

Meaning

In low-resource settings, adherence to current WHO case management protocols for watery diarrhea remains appropriate; antibiotic use is not warranted.

Regarding medical management for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (bloody diarrhea), IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to avoid empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for the results of investigations in immunocompetent pediatric and adult patients,
except in the following situations:

- infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of a bacterial etiology

- ill immunocompetent patients with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery, as evidenced by frequent scant bloody stools, fever, abdominal cramps, and tenesmus, presumptively due to Shigella

- patients recently traveled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5 °C and/or signs of sepsis.

### Acute diarrheal disease in children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment [^112d1yoU]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

### Management of diarrhea in young children in sub-saharan Africa: adherence to World Health Organization recommendations during the global enteric multisite study (2007–2011) and the vaccine impact of diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study (2015–2018) [^1127sU6U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea remains a leading cause of mortality and illness among young children, with more than 500 000 deaths estimated to have occurred globally among children aged < 5 years in 2019. After a diarrheal episode, young children are at an increased risk of repeated episodes, malnutrition, and cognitive delays, which can have long-term consequences. In 2019, diarrhea accounted for more than 45 million disability-adjusted life-years lost in children aged < 5 years.

In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce child morbidity and mortality and improve growth and development in children aged < 5 years. The focus of the guidelines for treating diarrheal disease has been the prevention and treatment of dehydration and promotion of optimal nutrition during a diarrheal episode. In the health center, children are categorized by clinical findings as having none, some, or severe dehydration, and treatment is framed accordingly. Children with some dehydration receive low osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) in the health facility, while those who cannot tolerate oral fluids or have severe dehydration receive initial intravenous (IV) fluids. The home management guidlines for children who have diarrhea with no dehydration and those who have already been rehydrated at the health center recommend extra fluids (including increased breastfeeding) and ORS to prevent dehydration. All children with diarrhea should continue feeding and receive a prescription for zinc. As a component of the IMCI, the WHO Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 encourages countries to use community-based health workers to assess diarrheal disease severity using established criteria; for mildly ill children deemed appropriate for home care, their caretakers are educated on providing appropriate home care for diarrhea as described above. Public health messages in the media and routine health visits are other means for communicating this information to families.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

CONCLUSIONS

A large gap exists between diarrheal treatment recommendations and their application by healthcare workers and caregivers in the community. Opportunities exist for improvement in case management for children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in low-resource settings, and these improvements could reduce mortality and malnutrition. Site-specific sensitization interventions may be needed to improve adherence to WHO diarrhea management guidelines. Implementation-based interventions should consider local knowledge, behavior, and infrastructure.

### An evidence and consensus based guideline for acute diarrhoea management [^116w2tod]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop an evidence and consensus based guideline for the management of the child who presents to hospital with diarrhoea (with or without vomiting), a common problem representing 16% of all paediatric medical attenders at an accident and emergency department. Clinical assessment, investigations (biochemistry and stool culture in particular), admission, and treatment are addressed. The guideline aims to aid junior doctors in recognising children who need admission for observation and treatment and those who may safely go home.

Evidence

A systematic review of the literature was performed. Selected articles were appraised, graded, and synthesised qualitatively. Statements on recommendation were generated.

Consensus

An anonymous, postal Delphi consensus process was used. A panel of 39 selected medical and nursing staff were asked to grade their agreement with the generated statements. They were sent the papers, appraisals, and literature review. On the second and third rounds they were asked to re-grade their agreement in the light of other panelists' responses. Consensus was predefined as 83% of panelists agreeing with the statement.

Recommendations

Clinical signs useful in assessment of level of dehydration were agreed. Admission to a paediatric facility is advised for children who show signs of dehydration. For those with mild to moderate dehydration, estimated deficit is replaced over four hours with oral rehydration solution (glucose based, 200–250 mOsm/l) given "little and often". A nasogastric tube should be used if fluid is refused and normal feeds started following rehydration. Children at high risk of dehydration should be observed to ensure at least maintenance fluid is tolerated. Management of more severe dehydration is detailed. Antidiarrhoeal medication is not indicated.

Validation

The guideline has been successfully implemented and evaluated in a paediatric accident and emergency department.

### Acute gastroenteritis in children of the world: what needs to be done? [^116YDP6B]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of gastroenteritis has greatly reduced due to improved hygiene conditions in developing countries and the use of rotavirus vaccine. Still thousands of children, however, die from gastroenteritis, most of them in poor countries. Yet gastroenteritis management is simple, inexpensive, and effective and is largely the same all over the world. Universal guidelines for gastroenteritis guide the management and include simple interventions put forward early in the course of the disease. Treatment includes rehydration, continuing oral feeding, and anti-infective drugs in selected clinical conditions related to the symptoms or to host-related risk, and possible additional drug treatment to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms. There may be minor geographical differences in the treatment applied due to health care organizations that do not substantially change the standard universal recommendations. Prevention is recommended with sanitation interventions and rotavirus universal immunization. Implementation of those interventions through educational initiatives and local programs in target areas are needed. A series of recommendations for interventions, education, and research priorities are included here with the aim of reducing the burden of gastroenteritis, to be pursued by scientists, physicians, policy makers, and stakeholders involved. They include the need of recommendations for the management of gastroenteritis in malnourished children, in those with chronic conditions, in neonates, and in emergency settings. A reference system to score dehydration, the definition of optimal composition of rehydration solution and the indications for anti-infective therapy are also included. Rotavirus immunization should be actively promoted, and evidence-based guidelines should be universally implemented. Research priorities are also indicated.

### Effect of 3 days of oral azithromycin on young children with acute diarrhea in low-resource settings: a randomized clinical trial [^116cM5BE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

The ABCD trial did not detect an improvement in survival from the addition of azithromycin to standard WHO case management of acute watery diarrhea. Although a small reduction in linear growth faltering was seen in the treatment group, this is unlikely to be of clinical or public health significance. These results support rigorous adherence to the current WHO guidelines on the management of diarrhea and do not suggest that a change to global diarrhea management guidelines or policy is merited.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has some limitations. First, the case definition for GEMS and VIDA only includes medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhea; consequently, the results are not representative of case management of individuals with less severe diarrhea, who are less likely to receive ORS while at a health facility. However, moderate-to-severe diarrhea is linked to a higher risk of diarrhea-associated mortality and other sequalae, and thus appropriate management of MSD is a priority. Second, home management was only assessed in children seeking care for MSD, possibly representing a select population who were not given guideline-adherent management in the home. Third, these results are from a research setting with additional funding support and oversight, and so the generalizability to other sites is uncertain. However, we believe the presence of the GEMS and VIDA study at these sites would have a positive impact on case management and not the reverse, and thus it is possible that our study overestimated adherence to treatment guidelines, as suggested by lower estimates of ORS coverage in Bamako published elsewhere.

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^115LwmwG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, only one in six of the children (15.9%) who visited the study hospitals received appropriate diarrhea management. This is a bothersome practice that underscores the critical need for prescribers to adhere to the recommended WHO protocols. This finding is lower than results from studies conducted in Ethiopia (Hawassa City (43.3%), Addis Ababa (45.6%), and Oromia region (79%)), Bangladesh (27%) and Italy (20.6%). The variation in results could be due to differences in study design, study area and the criteria used to assess the appropriateness of diarrhea management.

In a significant number of children, diarrhea was inappropriately classified (with stool characteristics not documented and the duration of diarrhea unspecified), inconsistently diagnosed, and inadequately assessed. These shortcomings in assessment, classification, and diagnosis can lead to treatments that do not adequately address underlying issues, resulting in inappropriate diarrhea management. Such deficiencies highlight challenges in adhering to established guidelines and maintaining comprehensive clinical documentation. To address these issues, it is essential to enhance healthcare professionals' adherence to protocols through improved awareness programs and to ensure meticulous documentation practices.

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^1148QrdU]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is a major global public health concern, accounting for 18% of deaths in children under five. Timely and appropriate management at both household and healthcare levels is crucial for reducing mortality associated with childhood diarrhea. However, adherence to recommended guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea is often suboptimal worldwide. This study aimed to assess the overall appropriateness of diarrhea management and its associated factors in children under five, with or without co-morbid illnesses.

Methods

Hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were collected retrospectively from the medical records of diarrhea cases using a two-stage stratified sampling technique. The appropriateness of diarrhea management was evaluated based on WHO and national guidelines. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were employed using IBM SPSS (V.23).

Results

Out of the 756 children under five, only 15.9% were appropriately managed. The most common factors for inappropriate management were lack of counseling (77.8%) and the failure to prescribe zinc (49.9%). Factors significantly associated with appropriate management included vomiting (AOR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.03–2.62), some dehydration (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08–0.71), and the prescriber qualification being a medical intern (AOR = 3.86, 95% CI: 1.91–7.81) or a degree nurse (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.14–0.72).

Conclusion

This study highlighted a high prevalence of inappropriate diarrhea management in children under five, indicating an urgent need for interventions to reduce associated risks.

### Adherence to guidelines for management of children hospitalized for acute diarrhea [^111Y3Kit]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The major burden of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in childhood is related to its high frequency and the large number of hospitalizations, medical consultations, tests and drug prescriptions. The adherence to evidence-based recommendations for AGE management in European countries is unknown. The purpose of the study was to compare hospital medical interventions for children admitted for AGE with recommendations reported in the European Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and Pediatric Infectious Diseases guidelines.

Methods

A multicenter prospective study was conducted in 31 Italian hospitals. Data on children were collected through an online clinical reporting form and compared with European Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and Pediatric Infectious Diseases guidelines for AGE. The main outcomes were the inappropriate hospital admissions and the percentage of compliance to the guidelines (full > 90%, partial > 80% compliance) based on the number and type of violations to evidence-based recommendations.

Results

Six-hundred and twelve children (53.6% male, mean age 22.8 ± 15.4 months) hospitalized for AGE were enrolled. Many hospital admissions (346/602, 57.5%) were inappropriate. Once admitted, 20.6% (126/612) of children were managed in full compliance with the guidelines and 44.7% (274/612) were managed in partial compliance. The most common violations were requests for microbiologic tests (404; 35.8%), diet changes (310; 27.6%) and the prescription of non-recommended probiotics (161; 14.2%), antibiotics (103; 9.2%) and antidiarrheal drugs (7; 0.6%).

Conclusions

Inappropriate hospital admissions and medical interventions are still common in the management of children with AGE in Italy. Implementation of guidelines recommendations is needed to improve quality of care.

When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count > 10000 cells/μL.

Infectious diarrhea — workup when no pathogen is identified or symptoms worsen: If no pathogen has been identified, it may be reasonable to reevaluate stool and/or blood if there is evidence of systemic symptoms to evaluate for an undetected pathogen; if symptoms worsen after antibiotics, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non–C. difficile) should be considered, and if hospitalized or with healthcare exposure, C. difficile becomes an additional consideration, particularly if there is fever or leukocytosis > 20000 cells/µL, and stool should be assessed for C. difficile toxin or a toxigenic C. difficile strain (eg, NAAT); stool also should be submitted for culture and susceptibility, and if a bacterial etiology is confirmed and antibiotics are indicated or have been used, susceptibility testing may reveal antimicrobial resistance.

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^112LiNgZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Advances in diagnostics have enabled the detection of more gastrointestinal pathogens, but misuse of diagnostics can lead to inappropriate antibiotic use and excess financial burdens. Ensuring appropriate use of diagnostics is crucial for optimizing patient care and promoting stewardship of health care resources.

Objective

To elicit parents' and clinicians' perspectives on expectations for care of pediatric diarrhea with a focus on diagnostic testing and to evaluate the potential for an electronic clinical decision support tool (ECDST) to improve appropriate use of diagnostics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this qualitative study, purposeful sampling was used to recruit parents of children who had sought care for diarrhea and clinicians who care for children with diarrhea from 5 urgent care sites and 1 emergency department in Utah. Recruitment ended after achievement of inductive thematic saturation. Participants were interviewed between June 15, 2023, and January 24, 2025.

Main Outcome and Measures

Key themes on expectations for management of pediatric diarrhea and perceptions of an ECDST. Interviews elicited expectations for diagnostic testing and treatment of pediatric diarrhea as well as the perceived utility of an ECDST. Analysis followed an applied thematic analysis framework.

Results

Forty-four parents (40 [91%] female; median age, 34 years [range, 21–47 years]) and 16 clinicians (11 [69%] female; median age, 42 years [range, 29–59 years]) were interviewed. Three motivators were identified for parents to seek clinical care for a child with diarrhea: (1) reassurance, (2) understanding the cause of symptoms, and (3) appropriate treatment. Parents viewed diagnostic testing as a tool for meeting these expectations. Clinicians expressed skepticism for the value of diagnostics in informing etiology or treatment but reported that they may order diagnostics to reassure parents. Many clinicians acknowledged the benefits of an ECDST to assist with evidence-based decision-making for diagnostics and facilitate communication with families.

Conclusions and Relevance

This qualitative study identified both similarities and tensions between parents and clinicians in expectations for pediatric diarrhea care, especially pertaining to the role of diagnostics. The findings suggest that strategies such as the use of ECDSTs are needed to resolve tension in care expectations, facilitate diagnostic stewardship, and optimize care for pediatric diarrhea.

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^115gp5J7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

One in five caregivers of the children with diarrhea received counseling on diarrhea management, which contradicts WHO guidelines. The WHO recommends counseling on providing extra fluids, continuing feeding, and scheduling follow-up appointments (particularly for children with dysentery and other danger signs) as integral component of diarrhea management. This finding is inconsistent with studies from Hawassa city, Ethiopia, where most mothers (96%) were advised to provide ORS and Addis Ababa where over half caretakers received advice on extra fluids and continued feeding, and immediate return if the child was unable to drink/breastfeed or if the child's condition worsened. To further improve counseling practices, targeted awareness-raising programs for prescribers should be enhanced.

ORS was prescribed to 84.7% of the children with diarrhea in this study. However, ORS was not prescribed for 12.3% of children who needed it, and its use was incorrect in one case. WHO guidelines endorse ORS therapy as the gold standard for clinically efficacious and cost-effective management of diarrhea. Unless a patient is comatose or severely dehydrated, ORS is recommended regardless of the causative agent or patient age as it is less expensive, often equally effective, and more practical than intravenous fluid. The prescription of ORS in the current study is higher than reported in Iraq (15%), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (66.7%), Northern Tanzania (68.4%), Ujjain, India (80%), and a multicenter study in Indian hospitals (82%). However, it lower than studies conducted in Lebanon (92.4%), Bahrain (89.3%), India (86.9%), and Kenya (90%).

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^1159tZyG]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The study has several limitations that warrant caution when interpreting its findings. As the results were derived from a secondary data, patient medical records may have been incomplete or contained unreadable information, potentially leading to an underestimation or overestimation of certain findings. Specifically, most diagnoses and conclusions regarding signs of infection were based solely on physician documentation rather than objective interpretation, which could introduce bias. Furthermore, the lack of documentation for any criteria used in the assessment of appropriateness was considered to indicate inappropriate diarrhea management. This methodological approach may have resulted in an overestimation of inadequate diarrhea management, even in cases where treatment was performed correctly. Furthermore, data on the outcomes of diarrhea management were not collected. The findings of this study may also lack generalizability to the entire country, as it was conducted only in national and regional referral hospitals. Therefore, the authors recommend broader future studies that include lower health facilities, utilize primary sources, and employ qualitative methods, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject, including outcomes in diarrheal cases.

Conclusions and recommendations

Inappropriate diarrhea management was prevalent among children under five years of age. Key determinants of management appropriateness included the presence of vomiting, dehydration status, and prescriber qualifications. Identified issues included inadequate documentation, lack of proper counseling, underutilization of zinc supplementation, and excessive use of intravenous fluids. It is crucial to strengthen awareness programs for healthcare professionals and ensure strict adherence to guidelines and protocols by relevant authorities to improve diarrhea management in this age group.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116EwJPp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — probiotics and zinc recommendations — Probiotic preparations may be offered to reduce the symptom severity and duration in immunocompetent adults and children with infectious or antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (weak, moderate), and specific recommendations regarding selection of organism(s), route, and dosage may be found through literature and manufacturer guidance. Oral zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years of age who reside in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or who have signs of malnutrition (strong, moderate). Meta-analyses report probiotics reduced mean duration of diarrhea by 25 hours (95% confidence interval, 16–34 hours), reduced the risk of diarrhea with a duration > 4 days, and reduced stool frequency on the second day of symptoms, with overall greater efficacy when a viral etiology is identified; most trials report decreased duration and stool frequency, and no adverse events have been directly attributable in healthy recipients, though bacteremia or fungemia has occurred in critically ill or immunocompromised people. For zinc, a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found oral zinc shortened acute diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years by 10 hours, with 27 hours reduction among children with signs of malnutrition; the effect on hospitalization and death could not be measured, treatment of persistent diarrhea was shortened by about 16 hours, vomiting was noted to be more common with zinc, and an RCT evaluating a 14-day course in US outpatients and inpatients aged 6 months to 6 years is ongoing.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for acute gastroenteritis in children with the AGREE instrument [^112ZY95U]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of the study was to assess the quality of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument, a validated international tool.

Materials and Methods

CPGs were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966-January 2009) and Embase (1988-January 2009), CPG databases, and relevant Web sites of agencies and organizations that produce and/or endorse guidelines. Included in the study were CPGs in English that addressed the management of acute gastroenteritis in children. Retrieved CPGs were evaluated with the AGREE instrument for quality assessment by 6 independent reviewers. AGREE consists of 6 domains for a total of 23 items.

Results

Nine CPGs were identified. Four were evidence based (EB) and 2 of these included tables of evidence. Eight CPGs (88%) scored < 50% for "applicability", 7 (77%) for "stakeholder involvement", and 6 (66%) for "editorial independence". Compared with non-EB CPGs, EB CPGs had higher quality scores for all AGREE domains, with a better score for "rigor of development" (P < 0.001), "stakeholder involvement" and "clarity of presentation" (P < 0.01), and applicability (P < 0.05). Over time, the quality of guidelines tended to improve. The main recommendations of CPGs were similar. However, there were differences in the treatment of diarrhea, namely based on the settings and circumstances in which CPGs were produced.

Conclusions

The overall quality of CPGs on acute gastroenteritis management in children is fair. Aims, target population, synthesis of evidence, formulation of recommendations, and clarity of presentation are points of strength. Weak issues are applicability, including identification of organizational barriers and adherence parameters, and cost/efficacy analysis.

### Toddler diarrhoea: is it a useful diagnostic label? [^117HYu8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Toddler diarrhoea is a term coined many years ago to describe a young child who passes several loose stools a day but who is otherwise healthy with excellent growth and normal examination. It could be argued that it is not an appropriate diagnostic term as it potentially stops the clinician from thinking about the possible causes of loose stools in this clinical situation. This article, which follows a debate between the authors on the topic at the 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual meeting, discusses the differential diagnoses of a young child presenting with the so-called toddler diarrhoea.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^112dsTUp]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

A search of published literature and publically available guidelines for definitions of pediatric acute diarrhea in infants and children under 5 in high-burden settings in low- and middle- income countries was performed between June and August 2015. To summarize current definitions of pediatric diarrhea, we identified clinical practice recommendations and guidelines for pediatric diarrhea management focused primarily on low-resource settings. To summarize definitions used in research, we abstracted the definitions used in 2 recent diarrhea etiology studies and from individual studies included in 3 recently published systematic reviews related to diarrhea burden, the association between diarrhea and subsequent malnutrition, and the relationship between breastfeeding practices and diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality. Current programmatic definitions used in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) were obtained from the DHS and MICS tools and interview guides available on program websites. Definitions were entered into a standardized summary table and organized according to category of intended use (clinical practice guidelines, programmatic, research).

To identify publications that compared and evaluated the validity and performance of different definitions, we searched MEDLINE to identify English language articles using combinations of search terms for "diarrhea", "definition", "case- definition", "pediatric", "acute", and "classification", with no date restriction. Reference lists from frequently cited publications were scanned to identify additionally relevant papers. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer (G. A.L.) to identify articles relevant to the review objectives, and full text of select publications was subsequently reviewed in full by 2 reviewers (G. A.L. and P.B.P.).

To explore the origins and empiric basis of diarrhea definitions, we reviewed cited definition sources in the peer-reviewed literature, and in programmatic and clinical practice guidelines, tracing references to previously published sources until an original source without a previously published reference was identified. We excluded sources focused primarily on adult populations, well resourced settings, or noninfectious sources of diarrheal illness. Duration of diarrhea, diarrhea severity, and defining episodes of diarrhea were not the focus of this review.

### Parental management of childhood diarrhea [^116r2rmi]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to determine the prevalence of therapies used by parents to manage acute diarrhea in their children and determine extent of parental adherence to current management guidelines and utilization of functional foods. Parents (N = 623) of children with diarrhea were surveyed in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department. Most (53%) treated their child's diarrhea with appropriate fluids, including oral rehydration solution (52%), but 14% used treatments not recommended in current guidelines (antidiarrheals, 8%; fluids high in simple sugars, 6%). In addition, 13% used functional foods (yogurt, 11%; probiotics, 4%). Children whose parents did not adhere to guidelines were older (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01–1.02 years) and Hispanic (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1–3.9). Although most parents use appropriate fluids to treat their children's diarrhea, functional foods and antidiarrheal medications were also frequently administered. Further data on effectiveness of functional foods and education regarding avoidance of potentially harmful medications are needed.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^115JmLgr]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Differences in definitions of acute pediatric diarrhea result in variable estimates of morbidity and mortality, treatment coverage, and associations with risk factors and outcomes. We reviewed published literature and guidelines focused on acute pediatric diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries. Clinical guidelines most commonly defined diarrhea in terms of quantity of loose or watery stool with consideration of normal stool patterns, whereas research studies often relied exclusively on a quantitative definition. The most commonly used quantitative definition, ≥ 3 loose or watery stools in a 24-hour period, has been compared to gold standards of caregiver perception and visual inspection of stool, with variable agreement. Age, breast-feeding status, and setting (facility vs household-based) influence the performance of quantitative diarrhea definitions in children. Universal adoption of a set of valid gold standard definitions specifically aligned with various programmatic and research goals will lead to more accurate coverage estimates and better-informed resource prioritization.

### European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition / European society for pediatric infectious diseases evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in children in Europe: update 2014 [^115bEPsb]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

These guidelines update and extend evidence-based indications for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis in Europe.

Methods

The guideline development group formulated questions, identified data, and formulated recommendations. The latter were graded with the Muir Gray system and, in parallel, with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations system.

Results

Gastroenteritis severity is linked to etiology, and rotavirus is the most severe infectious agent and is frequently associated with dehydration. Dehydration reflects severity and should be monitored by established score systems. Investigations are generally not needed. Oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution is the major treatment and should start as soon as possible. Breast-feeding should not be interrupted. Regular feeding should continue with no dietary changes including milk. Data suggest that in the hospital setting, in non-breast-fed infants and young children, lactose-free feeds can be considered in the management of gastroenteritis. Active therapy may reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea. Effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as Lactobacillus GG or Saccharomyces boulardii, diosmectite or racecadotril. Anti-infectious drugs should be given in exceptional cases. Ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires safety clearance given the warning about severe cardiac effects. Hospitalization should generally be reserved for children requiring enteral/parenteral rehydration; most cases may be managed in an outpatients setting. Enteral rehydration is superior to intravenous rehydration. Ultrarapid schemes of intravenous rehydration are not superior to standard schemes and may be associated with higher readmission rates.

Conclusions

Acute gastroenteritis is best managed using a few simple, well-defined medical interventions.

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^112xX84A]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Assessment of overall diarrhea management appropriateness

Prescribers in the referral hospitals were expected to adhere to the WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children (2013) and the MOH IMNCI Chart Booklet (2015) for managing childhood illnesses. These resources served as guidelines for the senior pediatricians and the investigator (GT) to evaluate the appropriateness of diarrhea management. The approach used to judge the overall diarrhea management was very strict. It comprehensively considered the whole patients' assessment and drug management approach. This included the entire process, from history taking to the conclusion of drug management and the counseling provided to the care giver. A child was considered appropriately managed if their condition (diarrhea and any co-morbidities) was accurately assessed, classified, and treated according to the established guidelines.

A child was deemed appropriately managed if their condition (diarrhea and any co-morbidities) was accurately assessed, classified, and treated according to established guidelines. Specifically, for diarrhea with dehydration appropriate management meant accurate assessment, classification, and prescription of the recommended rehydration therapy based on dehydration severity, along with zinc and appropriate antimicrobial therapy when necessary. Conversely, if a child diagnosed with diarrhea had some dehydration but lacked documented signs of dehydration during the physical examination, this was considered inappropriate, even if the rehydration plan was correct. According to the WHO Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children (2013), there are three dehydration management plans (Plans A, B, and C) corresponding to the classification of severity: No Dehydration, Some Dehydration, and Severe Dehydration, respectively. Not following these plans when treating diarrhea is considered an inappropriate approach to dehydration management.

Similarly, for a child diagnosed with pneumonia as a co-morbid condition, appropriate management required documented signs and symptoms of pneumonia; failure to document these rendered the prescribed antibiotic treatment inappropriate. Consistency between the diagnosis and both subjective and objective evidence was crucial, alongside the evaluation of pharmaceutical interventions. Thus, diarrhea management was deemed appropriate only when diarrhea and any co-morbid conditions were correctly assessed, classified, and managed according to established standards. Counseling was also a critical component in assessing the appropriateness of diarrhea management. Medical records were screened for documentation of any counseling provided. Medical records with no documented counseling were considered to indicate that no counseling was provided.

### Management of diarrhea in young children in sub-saharan Africa: adherence to World Health Organization recommendations during the global enteric multisite study (2007–2011) and the vaccine impact of diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study (2015–2018) [^112EiRn8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

While IMCI recommendations have been adopted by more than 100 countries, adherence has historically been low, particularly in countries with the highest childhood mortality rates. Based on aggregated data from 1985 to 2012, between 35% and 50% of children with diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries received care in accordance with case management guidelines. Greater adherence to diarrhea management guidelines has the potential to improve health outcomes and avert diarrheal deaths. Quantifying adherence to facility and home diarrhea management guidelines for children aged < 5 years with diarrhea on a local level will inform the need for further improvements that could reduce childhood mortality.

We analyzed data from the Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study (2015–2018) to quantify adherence to recommendations for rehydration during healthcare center visits for moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and while at home before seeking care. To determine if home practices and current levels of adherence to guidelines had improved over the last decade, we compared these results with adherence during the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS; 2007–2011), a study that used similar methodology and definitions.

Symptomatic relief — Ancillary treatment with antimotility, antinausea, or antiemetic agents can be considered once the patient is adequately hydrated, but their use is not a substitute for fluid and electrolyte therapy (weak, low). Antimotility drugs (eg, loperamide) should not be given to children < 18 years of age with acute diarrhea (strong, moderate). Loperamide may be given to immunocompetent adults with acute watery diarrhea (weak, moderate), but should be avoided at any age in suspected or proven cases where toxic megacolon may result in inflammatory diarrhea or diarrhea with fever (strong, low). Antinausea and antiemetic (eg, ondansetron) may be given to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in children > 4 years of age and in adolescents with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting (weak, moderate).

### Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy [^117LJA7t]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis remains a common illness among infants and children throughout the world. Among children in the United States, acute diarrhea accounts for > 1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000 hospitalizations, and approximately 300 deaths/year. In developing countries, diarrhea is a common cause of mortality among children aged < 5 years, with an estimated 2 million deaths annually. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) includes rehydration and maintenance fluids with oral rehydration solutions (ORS), combined with continued age-appropriate nutrition. Although ORT has been instrumental in improving health outcomes among children in developing countries, its use has lagged behind in the United States. This report provides a review of the historical background and physiologic basis for using ORT and provides recommendations for assessing and managing children with acute diarrhea, including those who have become dehydrated. Recent developments in the science of gastroenteritis management have substantially altered case management. Physicians now recognize that zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease, and an ORS of reduced osmolarity (i.e., proportionally reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose) has been developed for global use. The combination of oral rehydration and early nutritional support has proven effective throughout the world in treating acute diarrhea. In 1992, CDC prepared the first national guidelines for managing childhood diarrhea (CDC. The management of acute diarrhea in children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy. MMWR 1992;41[No. RR-16]), and this report updates those recommendations. This report reviews the historical background and scientific basis of ORT and provides a framework for assessing and treating infants and children who have acute diarrhea. The discussion focuses on common clinical scenarios and traditional practices, especially regarding continued feeding. Limitations of ORT, ongoing research in the areas of micronutrient supplements, and functional foods are reviewed as well. These updated recommendations were developed by specialists in managing gastroenteritis, in consultation with CDC and external consultants. Relevant literature was identified through an extensive MEDLINE search by using related terms. Articles were then reviewed for their relevance to pediatric practice, with emphasis on U.S. populations. Unpublished references were sought from the external consultants and other researchers. In the United States, adoption of these updated recommendations could substantially reduce medical costs and childhood hospitalizations and deaths caused by diarrhea.

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^116e2ucz]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, in the current study, the dose, route, frequency, and duration of antibiotics, zinc, and other medicines were often incorrect and/or undocumented in a substantial number of children. The low prescription rate of zinc and incorrect prescriptions in this study may indicate that prescribers' low awareness on its importance or inadequate documentation of treatments, necessitating intervention from the policy makers and program managers.

Notably, there was no documented use of anti-diarrheal and anti-emetic medicines in this study which is in line with the WHO recommendations. These medicines are not recommended for management of acute diarrhea as they can reduce intestinal motility, prolong the disease course, extend pathogen contact with the intestinal mucosa, and potentially worsen systemic symptoms. Such medicines offer no benefit in diarrhea management and may pose serious, even life-threatening side effects in children. This finding differs from a study in Iraq where anti-diarrheal and anti-emetics medicines were used in 12.8% and 33.2% of the cases, respectively. Similar studies reported prescription rates for anti-diarrheal and anti-emetics in diarrhea management as 0% and 7%, and 0% and 3.4%, respectively.

The presence of vomiting, some dehydration, and prescriber qualification were identified as determinants of appropriate diarrhea management. This finding contrasts with studies conducted in Ethiopia, where diarrhea management appropriateness was significantly associated with children's age and stool characteristics.

The odds of treating diarrhea cases according to guidelines were about four times higher among the medical intern than among GPs. This finding, however, requires careful interpretation. One plausible explanation is that medical interns, operating under the close supervision of senior pediatric physicians, are held to a higher standard of meticulous documentation. This structured environment ensures that all aspects of guideline adherence are meticulously recorded, which may not always be the case for GPs facing high patient volumes and time constraints in a less supervised setting. Consequently, the observed difference may, in part, reflect a disparity in documentation practices rather than a fundamental difference in clinical competence. This is supported by the non-significant findings for "correct dose/route/frequency/duration of treatment" and "correct antibiotic prescription". Conversely, degree nurse prescribers were 68% less likely to adhere to guidelines for appropriate diarrhea management compared to GPs, which could be due to differences in knowledge among the prescribers.

### A comparison of diarrheal severity scores in the MAL-ED multisite community-based cohort study [^114AJ9ZU]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

What Is Known
There is a lack of consensus on how to define severity in community-based studies of childhood diarrhea in the low- and middle-income countries.
This lack of consensus limits comparability between studies.
Existing severity scores were developed around rotavirus, and their reliability and validity in relation to non-rotavirus diarrhea is unknown.

What Is New
Severity scores built using maternally reported symptoms predicted hospitalization and other negative child health outcomes across geographically diverse communities.
Validated clinical severity criteria can be used to quantify estimates of severe diarrhea in the absence of outpatient confirmation.
The global health research community should adopt standardized methods of measuring diarrheal severity

The lack of validated and widely adopted definitions for severity is a methodological hindrance to community-based and outpatient studies of pediatric diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries. A recent review highlighted heterogeneity in measurement approaches; among 138 randomized clinical trials involving primary outcomes of acute diarrhea, 46 definitions were used, and in 32 trials using diarrheal severity instruments, 8 used the original or modified Vesikari score, whereas the remainder used other instruments. This review also noted that there are no published reports of reliability and validity for any diarrheal severity instrument.

The Vesikari score was designed for use in rotavirus vaccine trials, and although useful in that context, it may be less so in community-based studies due to multiple etiologies. This is because it includes clinical management in its scoring, making it impractical in contexts in which diarrhea referral and treatment varies, weighs vomiting relatively heavily compared with other symptoms, and does not include dysentery. The original Vesikari score assessed children at hospital presentation, but subsequent studies have calculated severity after episode resolution. Other scores have been proposed, but only 1 designed for nonetiologically specific diarrhea in HIV-negative children.

Conceptually, diarrheal severity relates to acute morbidity, represented by the presence of clinical signs and symptoms such as fever or vomiting; the risk of acute progression, including severe dehydration, and, in the worst case, mortality; and the risk of later morbidity (eg, nutritional status). Although these domains overlap, there may be differences in which should be targeted during the clinical assessment of severity in an outpatient context, versus during community surveillance where the majority of episodes may be mild-to-moderate. Although different scores may serve for different purposes, the agreement between them should nevertheless be characterized.

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^112BTPsv]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Reports indicate that the application of guidelines for childhood diarrhea management is suboptimal worldwide. This often leads to inappropriate management, unnecessary costs, side effects, delayed recovery, increased care expenses, and even death. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has assessed the extent of inappropriate diarrhea management in children under five in Eritrea. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the overall appropriateness of diarrhea management, with or without co-morbid illnesses, in children under five at regional referral hospitals and Orotta National Pediatric Referral Hospital (Orotta NPRH) in Eritrea.

### A 9-day-old with weight loss and diarrhea [^112S8PBk]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 9-day-old infant girl presented with diarrhea and weight loss of 19% since birth. She was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks' gestation to a mother positive for group B Streptococcus who received adequate intrapartum prophylaxis. The infant was formula-fed every 2 to 3 hours with no reported issues with feeding or swallowing. The infant had nonmucoid watery stools ∼5 to 15 times per day. Her family history was significant for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in several of her family members. Her initial vital signs and physical examination were normal. Laboratory data on hospital admission showed a normal complete blood cell count, but her chemistry analysis revealed significant hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Her hypernatremia was resistant to fluid management. In this article, we discuss the infant's hospital course, our clinical thought process, and how we arrived at our final diagnosis.

Appropriateness of diarrhea management

In the assessment of diarrhea management, only 15.9% of all children were appropriately managed. Diarrhea management was found to be more appropriate in out-patients (17.3%) than in-patients (10.5%) (Fig. 1).

The most common types of inappropriate practices of diarrhea management were lack of counseling (77.8%), not prescribing zinc (49.9%), unnecessary antibiotic prescription (30.3%), incorrect dose/route/frequency and duration of treatment (22.2%), and ORS not prescribed (12.3%). Moreover, Diarrhea classification error (Stool not characterized 8.7%, and Duration of diarrhea not stated 2.5%), inconsistent diagnosis (6.5%), and incomplete physical assessment (1.2%) were also spotted in a significant number of patients (Table 4).

ORS Oral Dehydration Salts

Only 21.2% (n = 160) of the children's caregivers received documented counseling on diarrhea management. The main advices provided included 'Advice when to return' (46.9%), 'Give extra fluid' (45.0%) and 'Continue feeding' (31.9%). Follow-up appointments were for only eight caregivers, all of whom attended. Among these, two children improved, three showed no change, and three worsened. For the112 documented cases of bloody diarrhea (99 out-patient and 13 in-patient), no follow-up appointments were given to outpatient children, with one exception. ORS was prescribed to 84.7% of the children with diarrhea. Moreover, ORS was not prescribed in 12.3% of the cases, and its use was in one instance.

Clostridium difficile testing — testing may be considered for C. difficile in people > 2 years of age who have a history of diarrhea following antimicrobial use and in people with healthcare-associated diarrhea (weak, high). Testing for C. difficile may be considered in people who have persistent diarrhea without an etiology and without recognized risk factors (weak, low).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to management of nonresponse to treatment, IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend to take into account noninfectious conditions, including IBD and IBS, as underlying etiologies in patients with symptoms lasting ≥ 14 days and unidentified sources.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.
