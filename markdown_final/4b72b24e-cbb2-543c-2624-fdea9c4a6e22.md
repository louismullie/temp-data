## Question

Cause of drops of urine after urination

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of drops of urine after urination, also known as post-micturition dribble or post-void dribbling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and how post-micturition dribble differs from terminal dribbling. Then, I should verify the core pathophysiology, especially urethral pooling and sphincter/bulbocavernosus mechanics. Next, I will examine sex-specific mechanisms in men versus women, followed by common risk factors and associated conditions. After that, I should review the evidence hierarchy and appraise study quality. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented summary and note limitations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Post-micturition dribble is the involuntary loss of urine immediately after finishing voiding, typically after leaving the toilet in men or after rising in women, whereas terminal dribbling refers to a prolonged final trickle during the act of voiding itself; this distinction matters for mechanism and evaluation, and the ICS terminology supports this framing [^113ony71] [^115RuVCQ].

> Now, I need to check the core pathophysiology. The most consistently described mechanism is failure to evacuate urine that pools in the bulbar urethra after voiding, often due to weakness or discoordination of the bulbocavernosus muscle and inefficient urethral milking; this leaves a small residual that leaks when the patient moves or dresses, and it can be compounded by impaired sphincteric closure or urethral compliance issues [^113LLtZy] [^111z9YUk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I should verify sex-specific contributors. In men, anatomical factors such as prostate enlargement or intravesical prostatic protrusion can distort the urethra and impair complete emptying, and urethral stricture disease or prior urethral/prostatic surgery can disrupt normal milking and sphincter function, all of which predispose to post-void dribble; indeed, preoperative post-micturition incontinence is common in urethral stricture cohorts and often improves after urethroplasty, though de novo dribble can occur in a minority [^115RuVCQ] [^111BRXyJ] [^115A5RBE].

> Wait, let me verify the female mechanisms because they differ. In women, vaginal urine entrapment with urethrovaginal reflux is a recognized cause of immediate post-void leakage, particularly in prepubertal and adolescent girls; behavioral strategies and positional modifications can resolve this when identified. Additionally, pelvic floor dysfunction and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia can impair urethral emptying, and urethral diverticula can trap urine and present with the classic triad of dysuria, dyspareunia, and post-void dribbling, reinforcing the need to consider structural causes in persistent cases [^111bwxJP] [^1145fxLs] [^115F2VzZ].

> I should double-check risk factors that cut across sexes. Lower voided volumes and voiding with weak or ambiguous desire to void increase the likelihood of post-micturition dribble in healthy men, suggesting that incomplete bladder emptying and suboptimal voiding dynamics contribute. Age-related changes in sphincter and pelvic floor function, obesity, and constipation can worsen outlet mechanics and residual urine, while prior pelvic surgery or radiation may injure sphincteric innervation or urethral integrity, all of which can promote dribbling [^116U4uJE] [^113Woczq] [^111z9YUk].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy and appraise quality. High-quality guidance from the AUA/SUFU and EAU consistently classify post-void dribble within LUTS frameworks and emphasize measuring post-void residual when voiding dysfunction is suspected, which indirectly supports the role of incomplete emptying in pathogenesis. Population-based studies show post-micturition dribble is common and often bothersome in men, while treatment studies, though limited, suggest pelvic floor muscle training and, in select contexts, PDE5 inhibitors can reduce dribble volume and bother, albeit with heterogeneity and small samples [^112ZMfza] [^115kUDwv] [^116JzoMT] [^112Nu9mZ].

> But wait, what if the symptom reflects a different entity entirely? I need to ensure I distinguish post-micturition dribble from terminal dribbling during voiding, which is more tied to outlet obstruction or detrusor contractility issues, and from continuous leakage, which should prompt evaluation for ectopic ureter or fistula. Accurate history and, when indicated, uroflowmetry with post-void residual help avoid misclassification and guide therapy [^115RuVCQ] [^116FmzTx].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful summary. Post-micturition dribble arises from failure to clear pooled urethral urine after voiding, driven by weak or discoordinated bulbocavernosus milking, impaired sphincteric closure, and incomplete bladder emptying; in men, prostate-related outlet distortion and urethral surgery effects are common, whereas in women, vaginal entrapment, pelvic floor dysfunction, and urethral diverticula predominate. Modifiable contributors include low voided volumes, constipation, obesity, and poor pelvic floor recruitment, which explains why behavioral and pelvic floor strategies often help [^113LLtZy] [^117AzJAp] [^111bwxJP] [^116U4uJE].

> I should confirm practical implications. For patients, optimizing voiding posture, ensuring adequate bladder fullness before voiding, and performing pelvic floor muscle training with urethral milking can reduce episodes; in selected men with persistent bothersome dribble, PDE5 inhibitors may modestly improve symptoms, though evidence is limited. Clinicians should measure post-void residual when voiding dysfunction is suspected and consider structural evaluation if symptoms persist despite conservative measures, especially to exclude stricture, diverticulum, or ectopic ureter [^112Nu9mZ] [^112ZMfza] [^115kUDwv] [^116FmzTx].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations so we don't overstate certainty. Much of the mechanistic literature is observational and low quality, and treatment trials are small with heterogeneous outcomes; moreover, patient-reported symptom labels often mismatch physician assessment, so careful history and, when needed, objective testing remain essential to avoid anchoring bias and to tailor therapy appropriately [^115xX2Ao] [^112Nu9mZ].

---

Post-void dribbling is most often due to **incomplete bladder emptying** from weak detrusor contraction or outlet obstruction (e.g. BPH, urethral stricture) [^117AzJAp], and **urethral pooling** from weak bulbocavernosus muscle or poor urethral milking [^113LLtZy]. Other causes include **pelvic floor dysfunction** [^112tc95v], **urethral stricture** [^111BRXyJ], and **urethral diverticulum** [^115F2VzZ]. Risk factors include age, obesity, constipation, and prior pelvic surgery [^113Woczq] [^111BRXyJ]. Evaluation includes history, exam, uroflowmetry, and post-void residual; management targets the cause with pelvic floor therapy, medications, or surgery [^112ZMfza] [^112Nu9mZ].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

Several **physiological mechanisms** contribute to post-void dribbling:

- **Incomplete bladder emptying**: Weak detrusor contractions or outlet obstruction (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117AzJAp], urethral stricture) can leave residual urine that leaks after voiding [^112ZMfza].

- **Urethral pooling**: Urine trapped in the bulbar urethra [^113LLtZy] due to weak bulbocavernosus muscle or poor urethral milking can leak after voiding [^111z9YUk].

- **Pelvic floor dysfunction**: Weak or uncoordinated pelvic floor muscles [^112tc95v] can impair urethral closure and emptying, causing dribbling [^notfound].

---

## Common causes and risk factors

| **Category** | **Specific causes and risk factors** |
|-|-|
| Anatomical | - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^117AzJAp] <br/> - Urethral stricture [^111BRXyJ] <br/> - Urethral diverticulum [^115F2VzZ] <br/> - Pelvic organ prolapse [^116FCMjy] |
| Functional | - Weak detrusor muscle [^116j7uGr] <br/> - Pelvic floor dysfunction [^112tc95v] <br/> - Inefficient urethral milking [^111z9YUk] |
| Lifestyle | - Obesity [^113Woczq] <br/> - Constipation [^notfound] <br/> - Poor hydration <br/> - Sedentary lifestyle |
| Medical | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis) <br/> - Prior pelvic surgery (e.g. prostatectomy, hysterectomy) [^111BRXyJ] |

---

## Gender-specific considerations

### Men

In men, **benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)** is a leading cause of post-void dribbling due to outlet obstruction and incomplete emptying [^117AzJAp]. Urethral stricture disease and prior urethral or prostatic surgery also contribute [^111BRXyJ]. Pelvic floor dysfunction and weak urethral sphincter tone are additional factors [^111z9YUk].

---

### Women

In women, **pelvic floor dysfunction** and **urethral diverticulum** are common causes [^115F2VzZ]. Pelvic organ prolapse and prior pelvic surgery (e.g. hysterectomy) can also contribute [^116FCMjy]. Hormonal changes, particularly post-menopause, may affect urethral tone and contribute to dribbling [^116FCMjy].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **History and physical examination**: Assess urinary symptoms, medical history, and perform a focused exam (including digital rectal exam in men and pelvic exam in women) [^115RuVCQ].

- **Uroflowmetry**: Measures urinary flow rate and pattern, helping identify obstruction or weak detrusor function [^113ony71].

- **Post-void residual (PVR) measurement**: Assesses incomplete bladder emptying; ultrasound is preferred over catheterization [^1136D8ju].

- **Urodynamic studies**: Evaluate bladder and urethral function, particularly in complex cases or prior to surgery [^112ZMfza].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause and symptom severity**:

- **Behavioral modifications**: Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) [^112tc95v], bladder retraining, and lifestyle changes (weight loss, constipation management) [^116WrfbM].

- **Pharmacological therapy**: Alpha-blockers (e.g. tamsulosin, doxazosin) for BPH [^117AzJAp], antimuscarinics or beta-3 agonists for overactive bladder [^114mRfjQ], and PDE5 inhibitors in select cases [^112Nu9mZ].

- **Surgical interventions**: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for BPH [^notfound], urethroplasty for strictures [^11196rzN], and diverticulectomy for urethral diverticulum [^114Uv5H2].

---

## Conclusion

Post-void dribbling is a common symptom with multifactorial causes, including anatomical, functional, and lifestyle factors. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management — including behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical options — can significantly improve symptoms and quality of life [^116WrfbM].

### Voiding with less strength of desire to void is a risk factor for post micturition dribble [^116U4uJE]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To clarify what urinary condition causes post micturition dribble (PMD) in non-elderly healthy men. We focused on men with PMD who do not have PMD every time they void. We clarified what urinary condition was associated with PMD in individuals to prevent PMD.

Materials and Methods

Twenty healthy volunteer men who had experienced PMD were included in the study between 2018 and 2021 using a portable uroflowmeter for 48 hours. They recorded symptoms of PMD and strength of desire to void (none, weak, normal, or strong) for each void. We investigated the risk factors of PMD and the correlation between strength of desire to void and PMD or parameters measured by uroflowmeter.

Results

The mean age of the volunteer men was 35.9 ± 6.9 years. During the study, 20 volunteers experienced a total of 208 episodes of voiding. Of them, 57 (27%) were associated with PMD. Lower voided volume than usual was a significant risk factor for PMD in univariate analysis (P < .01). There was a statistically significant correlation between the strength of the desire to void and the voided volume (P < .01). The voiding with none or weak desire to void significantly caused PMD compared to voiding with normal or strong desire to void (36% vs 21%, P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Lower voided volume than usual and voiding with less strength of desire to void are risk factors for PMD. Instructing male patients with PMD to refrain from voiding when the desire to do so is ambiguous can contribute to preventing PMD.

### Post void dribbling: incidence and risk factors [^116FCMjy]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of post void dribbling (PVD) in women being evaluated for pelvic floor dysfunction. The secondary aim was to identify other conditions present in women with symptoms of PVD.

Materials and Methods

163 consecutive women with complaints of PVD who underwent urodynamic testing were studied. Testing was performed to evaluate women scheduled for surgery for incontinence, irritative bladder, urinary retention and pelvic organ prolapse. Subjects completed a medical history and voiding diary. A complete pelvic exam was performed. Patients were questioned regarding symptoms of PVD, stress incontinence, urge incontinence and insensible urine loss. Menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy status, age, body mass index, residual urine volume, genital hiatus length, and evidence of pelvic organ prolapse were recorded. Maximal urethral closure pressure, urethral length, pressure transmission ratio, and documentation of detrusor overactivity or urodynamic stress incontinence were determined by urodynamic testing.

Results

42% of patients had symptoms of PVD. The incidence of PVD decreased with age. In pre- and peri-menopausal women, there was an association between PVD and urge incontinence. In post-menopausal women, there was an association between age, body mass index, and genital hiatus length.

Conclusions

There was a significant correlation between PVD and urge incontinence in pre-menopausal patients. The overall incidence and causes of PVD relative to age require further study. Body mass index and genital hiatus length may play an important role in PVD, especially in post-menopausal women.

### Terminal dribbling in male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: relationship with international prostate symptom score and with intravesical prostatic protrusion [^113LLtZy]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

One of the difficulties encountered in earlier studies regarding TD was the lack of a clear definition ensuring that patients could discriminate it from post-void dribbling. The current concept of TD was first addressed on the ICS male questionnaire and has been defined by ICS recommendations in 2002. Before this definition, the studies performed in 1990s used various definitions of TD. Moreover, several reports have regarded TD as an initial or mild form of post-void dribbling. Post-void dribbling was recently determined to be one of post-micturition symptoms that is distinct from TD. The pathogenesis of post-micturition dribbling involves weakness of the bulbocavernosus muscle, which results in failure to evacuate urine that has pooled and trapped in the bulbar area of the urethra after voiding. Additionally, the ICS previously removed the term "terminal dribbling" because of its similarity with post-void dribbling, which could be the main reason why there have been few studies on this issue. To achieve the consistency, we conducted face-to-face interview by a single investigator using standardized definition of TD. Clinical studies on this topic should describe the demographic characteristics of the subjects, the prevalence of TD, the questionnaire used, and the definition of TD. Table 4 summarizing the previous studies related with TD indicates that the prevalence of TD is much greater in the LUTS patients than in the community people.

### Fundamentals of terminology in lower urinary tract function [^113ony71]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To summarize basic definitions in the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardization of Terminology in lower urinary tract (LUT) function and their application.

Methods

Fundamental terminology in the ICS Standardization of Terminology LUT Function was identified and summarized.

Results

Evaluation of LUT requires appreciation of symptoms, signs and urodynamic observations. Symptoms are categorized according to their occurrence during the micturition cycle into storage symptoms (eg, increased daytime frequency [IDF], urgency, nocturia, or incontinence) or voiding and post-voiding symptoms (eg, slow stream or post micturition dribbling). Several problems may be present, giving rise to symptom syndromes, notably overactive bladder (during the storage phase) or underactive bladder (during the voiding phase). Signs may be derived from a bladder diary or may be elicited on physical examination. Urodynamic observations may be made by assessing flow rate, and this is combined with pressure measurement when undertaking filling cystometry and pressure flow studies. Key elements of flow and pressure measurement are described.

Conclusions

The review provides a succinct summary of symptoms, signs, and urodynamic observations as set out in the ICS Standard on LUT Function.

### Diagnosis and treatment of voiding symptoms [^115RuVCQ]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Symptoms are the subjective indicator of a disease or change in condition as perceived by the patient, caregiver, or partner and may lead the individual to seek help from health care professionals. LUTS are usually qualitative and, therefore, cannot usually be used to make a definitive diagnosis. LUTS also can indicate pathologies other than lower urinary tract dysfunction, such as urinary infection. LUTS are divided into 7 groups: storage, voiding (obstructive), postmicturition symptoms and 4 others. Voiding symptoms, which are caused by lower urinary tract obstruction, include slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittency, hesitancy, straining, and terminal dribble. Postmicturition symptoms, which are experienced immediately after micturition, consist of the feeling of incomplete emptying and postmicturition dribble. Postmicturition dribble describes the involuntary loss of urine immediately after the individual has finished passing urine; in men, usually after leaving the toilet and in women, after rising from the toilet. Hence, postmicturition dribble is elicited by different situations or is considered as having different implications. For example, although postmicturition dribble usually implies incomplete emptying (voiding symptoms) in elderly men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, postmicturition dribble is often considered as urinary incontinence (a storage symptom) in many patients, even with bladder outlet obstruction. In such cases, detailed history taking and further evaluation, such as urinary flowmetry, postvoid residual volume, and comprehensive urodynamic evaluation, should be performed as appropriate. If no urodynamic abnormalities of either the detrusor or the outlet can be detected despite significant LUTS, factors unrelated to the lower urinary tract may be responsible for the voiding symptoms.

### Prevalence of three lower urinary tract symptoms in men-a population-based study [^115YuRyJ]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms are a common and costly public health issue. In earlier studies, the prevalence of urinary symptoms can be seen to fluctuate because there is no consensus about how to define and categorize the severity of the symptoms.

Objectives

The study was undertaken in order to investigate the prevalence of three common lower urinary tract symptoms (urgency, stress incontinence and post-micturition dribbling) and analyse health care-seeking behaviour.

Methods

A self-administered questionnaire was developed to investigate all men aged 40–80 years residing in the community of Surahammar, Sweden. The questionnaire included items on three specific urinary symptoms: urgency, stress incontinence and post-micturition dribbling, and one question about health care-seeking behaviour.

Results

A response rate of 86% was obtained in the questionnaire study. The overall prevalence of the lower urinary tract symptoms was 24%. The prevalence increased from 20% in the group aged 40–49 years to 28% in the group aged 70–80 years (P < 0.01). Post-micturition dribbling (21%) was the most frequent symptom, and stress incontinence (2.4%) was the least frequent symptom. The number of participants who sought health care was low (4%) and increased significantly with age (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The present study showed that 24% of the Swedish cohort of men of 40–80 years of age reported at least one of the following symptoms: urgency, stress incontinence or post-micturition dribbling. This study is consistent with other research regarding the low consultation frequency for these symptoms. Moreover, the study is also in accord with those findings indicating that for the majority of men with urinary symptoms, their health care providers are not aware of their problem.

### Prevalence of post-micturition incontinence before and after anterior urethroplasty [^111BRXyJ]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

In this study we aimed to define the prevalence of preoperative and postoperative post-micturition incontinence or post-void dribbling after anterior urethroplasty for urethral stricture disease. We also sought to determine risk factors for its presence.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively maintained, multi-institutional urethral stricture database to evaluate post-micturition incontinence using a single question from a validated questionnaire, "How often have you had a slight wetting of your pants a few minutes after you had finished urinating and had dressed yourself?" Possible answers were never-0 to all the time-3. The presence of post-micturition incontinence was defined as any answer greater than 0. Comparisons were made to stricture type and location, repair type and patient medical comorbidities.

Results

Preoperative and postoperative post-micturition incontinence questionnaires were completed by 614 and 331 patients, respectively. Patients without complete data available were excluded from study. Preoperative post-micturition incontinence was present in 73% of patients, of whom 44% stated that this symptom was present most of the time. Overall postoperative post-micturition incontinence was present in 40% of patients and again it was not predicted by stricture location or urethroplasty type. Of the 331 patients with followup questionnaires 60% reported improvement, 32% reported no change and 8% reported worsening symptoms. The overall rate of de novo post-micturition incontinence was low at 6.3%.

Conclusions

The prevalence of preoperative post-micturition incontinence is high and likely under reported. In most patients post-micturition incontinence improves after urethroplasty and the prevalence of de novo post-micturition incontinence is low. The presence of post-micturition incontinence was not predicted by stricture length or location, or urethroplasty repair type.

### Non-neurogenic elimination disorders in children [^115cUncd]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Non-neurogenic elimination disorders cover a wide spectrum of lower urinary tract and bowel dysfunctions, observed in the absence of a neurological background or lower urinary tract malformation. We reviewed conditions responsible for incontinence during bladder filling with normal voiding patterns (such as overactive bladder, giggle incontinence, post-void dribbling), and dysfunctional voiding syndromes. Dysfunctional elimination syndrome usually includes detrusor-sphincter dyscoordination, small-capacity overactive bladder or decompensated large poorly contractile bladder, and large-volume post-micturition residuals, occasionally associated with bowel dysfunction. At the most severe end of the spectrum lies the non-neurogenic neurogenic bladder syndrome, characterized by the association of a severe impairment of the upper urinary tract with a dysfunctional elimination syndrome. It must be emphasized that if the term 'non-neurogenic' relates to the absence of a neurological lesion, it is however conceivable that these conditions actually do have an underlying neurological cause that remains to be identified.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^115pQyTH]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

4.2 Comparison with other studies

We conducted a PubMed search for English-language articles (published as of December 18, 2013) focused on bothersomeness of LUTS (for further details, see Table 3). Although numerous articles have been published on LUTS, much fewer have also directly measured the bother from individual urinary symptoms, and only a few of these studies were population based. In contrast to the present study, these earlier population-based studies (Table 3) that assessed bother from individual urinary symptoms have typically only reported on a limited number of LUTSor included a limited age range. Most importantly, none of the earlier studies included both genders. Finally, most of the studies, did not aim to establish the most bothersome symptom at either the population or individual level but provided data enabling us to calculate the estimates reported in Table 3. However, the heterogeneity in sampling methods and outcome assessments from previous population-based studies likely explain the variability in results. Different symptoms have been identified as most bothersome including urgency, nocturia, and terminal dribbling (Table 3). Among female sufferers, storage symptoms (including incontinence) were most likely to cause problems, whereas among male sufferers, both storage and postmicturition symptoms were most likely to cause problems in the international Epidemiology of LUTS (EpiLUTS) study that evaluated prevalence and bother of numerous LUTS. As many as 88 150 individuals were contacted mainly from consumer panels (self-selected volunteers and cannot be regarded as population based), and a final sample of 30 000 was evaluated. The comparison of the relative adverse impact (individual perspective) of LUTS was similar between (EpiLUTS) and our study. Overall, in our study, urgency was the symptom most frequently found bothersome at the population level. Of those who were symptomatic, individuals reporting UUI most frequently found the symptom at least moderately bothersome.

### Terminal dribbling in male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: relationship with international prostate symptom score and with intravesical prostatic protrusion [^1113QRFW]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

The study comprised 635 consecutive male LUTS patients aged 40 years and older attending as new patients at the outpatient clinic between January 2008 and July 2013. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments; appropriate ethical review boards (Korea University Medical Center Ansan Hospital IRB No. AS 14156) approved this retrospective study. The patients with LUTS mean that the patients who have storage symptoms, voiding symptoms or post micturition symptoms as described in the previous study. Fifty seven of these men were excluded from our study due to biopsy proven prostate cancer, other malignancies, previous medication for LUTS, past history of surgery for BPH or other pelvic diseases, neurologic abnormalities, or missing data. IPSS, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, prostate transitional zone volume and IPP on transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), and the answer to the TD item on the ICS male questionnaire were recorded for each subject.

Terminal dribbling definition and confirmation

TD was defined in the ICS guidelines as "when an individual describes a prolonged final part of micturition when the flow has slowed to a trickle/dribble". The questionnaire item regarding TD was stated as follows: "Do you have a prolonged final part of micturition when the flow has slowed to a trickle/dribble?" Answer choices for this question included yes and no. Uroflowmetry-confirmed TD means that TD confirmed by the uroflowmetry when the typical finding of slowly decreasing flow with trickling/dribbling at the end of the void was observed.

Features measured using transrectal ultrasonography

The prostate was measured in three dimensions on TRUS, and its volume and transitional volume were estimated using a modification of the prolate ellipsoid formula and expressed in cm³ (0.523 [length (cm) × width (cm) × height (cm)]). IPP was measured as the vertical distance from the tip of the protruding prostate to the base of the urinary bladder in the sagittal plane, and it was graded as mild (less than 5 mm), moderate (from 5 to less than 10 mm), severe (10 mm or more). Urology residents performed this procedure under the supervision of attendings. We divided patients into two groups based on the presence of IPP when performing logistic regression analysis.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^1147WmVs]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

4.3 Implications of the findings

From the population perspective, this study identifies urgency as the most pressing public health priority across both genders, a situation reflected in the current major interest in so-called overactive bladder syndrome. For women, SUI is and should be a major priority, with a high prevalence of bothersome symptoms (12% of women). Notably, 7.5% of all women reported UUI with moderate or major bother, and 6% reported nocturia with moderate or major bother. In contrast, for men most current interest focuses on storage symptoms, and although both bothersome urgency and nocturia were highly prevalent (6.8% and 6.0% of men, respectively), these data suggest that postmicturition dribble (7.7% of men) may be an overlooked area for investigation and funding.

Among symptomatic individuals in both genders, we found that UUI was the symptom most likely to cause moderate or major bother. This is consistent with previous studies that suggest substantial impacts of UUI on quality of life and strong associations with anxiety and depression. Clinicians should be aware of the differing impacts of each subtype of incontinence for women, and question patients carefully regarding the extent of bother, managing patients according to their responses.

Overall treatment compliance with many medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia is suboptimal and especially poor for medications for overactive bladder syndrome, even in comparison with long-term medications for hypercholesterolemia or osteoporosis. We found that only a minority of men or women who reported any symptom had substantial bother. The high prevalence of these symptoms, therefore, does not imply large unmet demand for therapy. Our results suggest that most LUTS are well tolerated across ages and genders, partly probably due to their fluctuating nature, and therefore they highlight the importance of bother assessment in clinical practice, especially before invasive diagnostics or initiation of therapy.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^112ZMfza]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) description — LUTS is a term utilized to represent a multifactorial constellation of nonspecific symptoms that affects both bladder filling and urine storage. Filling LUTS include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and nocturia, and voiding LUTS include slow stream, hesitancy, intermittency, incomplete bladder emptying and post-void or terminal dribbling. For the purposes of this document, LUTS is applicable to both men and women, and irritative LUTS may co-exist with obstructive LUTS and may cloud the assessment, thereby making diagnosis important.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117AzJAp]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a common diagnosis among the ageing male population with increasing prevalence. Many risks factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, can increase the risk of development and progression of BPH and LUTS. The symptoms can be obstructive (resulting in urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining or prolonged voiding) or irritative (resulting in increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence and reduced voiding volumes), or can affect the patient after micturition (for example, postvoid dribble or incomplete emptying). BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes that are thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.

### Treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men in primary care using a conservative intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial [^116WrfbM]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) relate to the storage and voiding of urine (box 1). The severity and prevalence of LUTS in men increases with age (as much as 30% in men older than 65 years), with greater numbers likely to be affected as the population ages. LUTS can have a substantial impact on quality of life, with problematic LUTS referred to as bothersome. Men usually present with a range of LUTS that can relate to storage, voiding, or post-voiding urinary symptoms, and most men are initially assessed and managed by their general practitioner. LUTS in men can be caused by obstruction of the prostate or bladder dysfunction, or both, but symptoms can also be influenced by lifestyle factors. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the European Association of Urology recommend assessments to exclude serious medical conditions and to categorise and assess the impact of precise symptoms. Assessment of LUTS is time consuming, however, and the level undertaken in general practice varies.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men can be caused by structural or functional abnormalities of the bladder, prostate gland, or urethra
Voiding LUTS are problems passing urine, such as hesitancy, slow urinary stream, and dribbling
Storage LUTS include urgency, increased urinary frequency, and nocturia. Storage LUTS can be due to increased urine volumes from high fluid intake or systemic conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, or endocrine)
Patients may experience one or more LUTS, and the severity of each symptom may not correlate with how much patients consider the symptoms to be bothersome
LUTS can be measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), with scores of 0–7 categorised as mild overall severity, 8–19 as moderate, and 20–35 as severe

### Prevalence of distress and symptom severity from the lower urinary tract in men: a population-based study with the DAN-PSS questionnaire [^113rqokU]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a common and costly public health issue. The prevalence varies greatly in published reports. The distress caused by each symptom is important to assess the primary care required before therapeutic decisions or a referral to an urologist are made.

Objectives

LUTS are highly prevalent in men, but less is known regarding the distress caused by each symptom. The aim of this study was to examine symptom severity and different levels of distress using the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS) questionnaire in men affected by symptoms from the lower urinary tract.

Methods

The study included all men aged 41–81 years (n = 504) that, 12 months earlier in a population-based survey, had reported stress incontinence, urgency or post-micturition dribbling in a postal questionnaire. The DAN-PSS questionnaire was used to measure severity and distress from LUTS.

Results

In total, 311 (80%) of the 387 responders who reported at least one symptom experienced some level of distress. The most distressing symptom overall was urinary incontinence. Nine of 10 men with storage symptoms (stress, urge and 'other' urinary incontinence) reported distress even if the symptom occurred only seldom. Moreover, two-thirds of the men with the most frequent symptom, post-micturition dribbling, characterized their symptom as moderate or severe; the most distressing voiding symptom was weak stream. In general, LUTS were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Urge incontinence was the most distressing LUTS even when occurring only seldom. The DAN-PSS questionnaire may be a potentially useful tool for health professionals to identify patients with pronounced distress from LUTS to offer therapeutic and nursing care on the relevant level.

### Can patients independently identify their urinary incontinence symptoms? [^115xX2Ao]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The objective of our study is to compare patient self-reported urinary incontinence symptoms based on the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire- Short Form (ICIQ-SF) question number 6 (When does urine leak?) with physician-assessed interpretation of the patient's urinary incontinence symptoms.

Methods

This trial is a cross-sectional study of patients who presented to a tertiary urogynecology center with symptoms of urinary incontinence between January 2014 and August 2016. We compared patient-reported symptoms on the ICIQ-SF with physician interpretation of urinary complaints during their initial visit. The urinary incontinence symptoms included stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), insensible urine loss, nocturnal enuresis, and post-micturition dribbling.

Results

A total of 432 patients with a mean age of 61 were included in this evaluation. The most common urinary incontinence symptoms according to the physician were UUI (n = 357, 83%), followed by SUI (n = 308, 71%). Of the patients who were diagnosed by a physician with the symptom of UUI, only 61% self-identified as having this symptom based on the ICIQ-SF, and for SUI, only 66% self-identified as having SUI symptoms based on the ICIQ-SF. Overall UUI (κ = 0.30) appears to have poor agreement, as does nocturnal enuresis (κ = 0.39), when compared with physician historical assessment.

Conclusion

There is a discrepancy between patient-reported urinary incontinence symptoms on the ICIQ-SF and physician-assessed symptoms. Symptomatology entered into electronic medical records by patients is often inaccurate. Physician validation is essential in understanding the underlying the precise symptomatology.

### Exploring dysfunctional voiding in girls: a comprehensive literature review of assessment and management strategies [^113W5Tsp]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A comprehensive history is essential in the diagnostic assessment of DV. The history should be adapted to the patient's age and the stage of bladder control development. The history should include the following aspects:
(I) The voiding schedule should include information on the voiding frequency and the frequency of incontinence episodes [in toilet-trained children]. If possible, the voided volume should be estimated because patients with large-capacity bladders may present with large volumes of voided urine, indicating an underactive bladder or polyuria. Voided volume estimation can help determine if the bladder is functioning properly or if there are issues with underactivity or polyuria, both of which are commonly associated with DV.
(II) Bladder dysfunction symptoms such as urgency, hesitancy, painful urination, dribbling, holding maneuvers, straining, daytime incontinence, enuresis, and an intermittent or weak urinary stream should be noted. Table 1 defines these symptoms. Understanding these symptoms is critical, as they provide clues to the underlying cause of DV, helping clinicians narrow down the diagnosis.
(III) A completed standard questionnaire assessing daytime incontinence, voiding habits, urgency, bowel habits, dysuria, quality of life, and urine stream deflection. For example, anterior deflected urinary stream [ADUS], known as wetting the toilet rim during voiding while sitting in an upright position and the upper legs are apart. Another example is vaginal voiding caused by urine remaining in the vestibule after voiding, resulting in immediate post-urination incontinence. ADUS can be a key symptom in diagnosing structural abnormalities, which may contribute to DV and post-urination incontinence.
(IV) Family history should be screened for any renal or urological disorders, including DV, and the age at which family members achieved bladder control. This can help assess familial maturation delays, which can provide important genetic or developmental clues to the presence of dysfunctional voiding or other urological disorders within the family.
(V) Perinatal and neonatal history should be reviewed to investigate any perinatal or neonatal insults, such as perinatal anoxia or congenital infections. These insults could potentially affect the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as normal bladder function. Early developmental insults have the potential to impact bladder innervation or neural control, which can predispose individuals to lifelong voiding difficulties.
(VI) Dietary intake including details on the type and amount of fluid consumed, should be noted. Excessive urine production, especially during the night, may be a sign of diabetes mellitus, polyuria due to impaired urine concentration, or primary polydipsia.
(VII) Hydration and urine production patterns are important as they can indicate underlying conditions like diabetes mellitus or renal issues like nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which can lead to polyuria.
(VIII) Neurodevelopmental delays and psychological disorders, such as ADHD, depression, or anxiety, may contribute to delayed voluntary bladder control. Although children with DV may not universally present with behavioral issues, the association with psychological disorders should be explored. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders often have delayed or impaired bladder control due to difficulties in establishing voluntary bladder coordination.
(IX) Functional causes of DV may stem from behavioral issues following toilet training or personal stress, particularly conflicts between caregivers and children, which can often be linked to stressors or negative experiences during toilet training. This connection can lead to developmental variances even when anatomical abnormalities are absent.
(X) Toilet training history is important to consider, particularly if it was delayed, prolonged, or stressful or if there was a period of dryness following toilet training. If a period of complete dryness was never achieved after toilet training, structural abnormalities that can cause urine incontinence, such as the ectopic ureter, hypospadias with or without a meatal web, and meatal web alone, should be taken into account. Identifying whether dryness was ever achieved after toilet training is critical in distinguishing between structural and functional causes of incontinence.

### Managing lower urinary tract symptoms in men [^111UUtrM]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Over one-quarter of men aged 40 years or over in the UK have lower urinary tract symptoms. These symptoms, which may seriously disrupt day-to-day activity, include frequency, urgency, hesitancy, reduced flow, dribbling, nocturia, incontinence and incomplete emptying of the bladder. Here, we review non-surgical measures that may help men with such symptoms.

### Prevalence of nocturia among community-dwelling adults: a population-based study in Malaysia [^114Zoh2q]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

LUTS can be classified according to voiding or obstructive symptoms (such as hesitancy, poor stream, straining, prolonged micturition, feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, post-micturition dribble) and storage or irritative symptoms (such as frequency, urgency, urge incontinence and nocturia). In the present study, the disease pattern of nocturia was not sex-specific, except for post-micturition dribble. This interpretation is supported by the fact that post-micturition dribble is more common in men. Studies also showed that prevalence of LUTS was comparable between men and women. In addition, with advancing age, the prevalence and severity of LUTS increase regardless of sex. This is supported by the finding of this study where elderly respondents are more likely to exhibit almost all the LUTS compared to the younger population.

Nocturia has been regarded as not only 'bothersome', but also negatively affects sleep and quality of life. This study also revealed that nocturia was regarded as moderately bothersome for Malaysians, particularly those with two or more nocturnal voids. This alluded to the clinical relevance of at least 2 voids being the threshold to patient-reported impaired health-related quality of life. Furthermore, more than one-third of respondents in this study claimed to have disturbed sleep about half the time or more after nocturnal awakening. The sleep disturbance was proportionately increased with the frequency of nocturnal voids and age. This finding is consistent with previous studies. As a result of sleep disturbance, nocturia has also been associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (7–18%), increased sick leaves (27–27%), insomnia (43%), psychiatric disorders (28–35%) and poorer health status (15–40%) In addition, people with nocturia have a lower productivity at work and decreased activity levels. Consistently, the respondents with nocturia in this study also reported to experience fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, lacking of motivation to work, bad mood, forgetfulness and depression as consequences of disturbed sleep. Hence, it is obvious that nocturia should not be overlooked or underestimated due to its serious repercussions on sleep quality, work productivity and quality of life.

### Urodynamics criteria of detrusor underactivity in women underwent middle urethral sling for stress urinary incontinence: what is the clinical role? [^112xPnnD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the role of detrusor underactivity (DUA), diagnosed by different urodynamic criteria, on outcomes of women underwent middle urethral sling (MUS) for stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

Methods

In this prospective study, DUA criteria of women with SUI, naïve for SUI surgery, candidates to MUS were: I Pdet@Qmax ≤ 10cm H₂O and Qmax ≤ 12mL/s (Jeong et al.) ii Pdet@Qmax < 30cm H₂O and Qmax < 10mL/s (Abarbanel and Marcus) iii Pdet@Qmax < 20cm H₂O and Qmax < 15mL/s and BVE < 90% (BVE criteria) iv Pdet@Qmax < 20cm H₂O+Qmax (PIP1 Griffiths) Control group (CG) comprised non-DUA patients. Preoperative and at 2-years follow-up evaluation included physical examination, uroflowmetry, post void residual urine (PVR), ICIQ-FLUTS.

Results

102 patients fulfilled 2-years controls. DUA rate range was 16.7% (BVE) - 53.9% (PIP1-Griffith). The POUR rate varied: 20% (PIP1-Griffith) - 35.3% (BVE), 10% in CG. Tape incision rate for POUR was 3.4% in DUA, 4.5% in CG. No patients had urinary retention at 2-years follow-up. In DUA groups, Qmax did not change significantly after surgery and PVR was low. SUI recurrence rate was 2.8% in DUA, 4.5% in CG. Preoperatively, urgency and post-micturition dribble were the most (82.4%) and the less (26.7%) reported symptoms, respectively. At follow-up, frequency was the most prevalent (56.1%), reduced sensation/bladder pain the less usual (23.1%). ICIQ-FLUTS scores were higher in DUA groups.

Conclusions

DUA did not have a negative impact on MUS outcomes in a mid-term follow-up. Early postoperative voiding complication rates changed according to the type of DUA urodynamic criteria.

### Treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men in primary care using a conservative intervention: cluster randomised controlled trial [^117Pqq9b]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This large, pragmatic randomised controlled trial in primary care showed that a range of bothersome LUTS improved over 12 months in men with mean IPSS scores regarded as reflecting moderate severity LUTS, using a standardised booklet and manualised approach to symptom management. The mean patient reported primary outcome (IPSS) was 1.81 points lower in the intervention arm than usual care arm. The secondary outcomes measured using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire and IPSS quality of life also showed improvement against usual care, demonstrating the overall impact on LUTS through incontinence, post-void dribble, and quality of life. In addition, participants' perception of their LUTS improved over 12 months in the intervention arm (measured using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire). Referral rates to urology did not differ greatly between the arms. Adverse events also did not differ greatly between the arms.

The response rate of patients invited to participate in the study was 48%, which could be because those men who were historically coded as having LUTS in primary care in the previous five years were no longer experiencing bothersome symptoms, or that inaccuracies were present in the coding. In addition, only a single invitation was sent, with no reminder. Of those who responded, 73% were interested in taking part. Response rates were unrelated to acceptability of the intervention as men were blinded to their randomisation group until they had consented to the study, and without sight of the intervention booklet.

The mean IPSS at baseline was 13.6/14.6 in the two randomised groups, which is moderate by the accepted symptom severity categories (scores 8–19). The TRIUMPH study accepted men who were still experiencing any bothersome LUTS despite having consulted their doctor in the previous five years. This included storage or voiding LUTS, post-void dribble, and monosymptomatic nocturia (a symptom that can be caused by a wide range of medical conditions unrelated to the lower urinary tract). Achieving improvement of symptoms in such a mixed population, using assessments and guidance in the form of a booklet provided by nurses or healthcare assistants, is challenging. The mean reduction in IPSS was 1.81 points greater than that obtained with usual care and was sustained for at least nine months beyond the final healthcare professional input into the intervention. Hence a considerable number of men saw improvement in symptoms at low risk and with low requirement for doctor's input.

### Cost-effectiveness of a fixed-dose combination of solifenacin and oral controlled adsorption system formulation of tamsulosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112d899T]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The term 'lower urinary tract symptoms' (LUTS) is used to describe a condition that encompasses storage, voiding and post-micturition symptoms. The aetiology of LUTS can be multifactorial, but BPH is a common cause in men. Storage symptoms (e.g. urgency, frequency, urgency incontinence and nocturia) and voiding symptoms (e.g. weak or intermittent urinary stream, straining, hesitancy, terminal dribbling and incomplete emptying) are common and frequently co-exist in men with LUTS. Storage symptoms represent the most troublesome LUTS, reported in up to 42% of men aged ≥ 75 years. Storage symptoms are also reported to be the most bothersome LUTS.

Overall, the recommended treatment options for men with moderate-to-severe LUTS include α-blockers, 5α-reductase inhibitors (in those with a large prostate, 30 g or 40 mL) and antimuscarinic (in those with predominant storage symptoms). In addition, α-blocker plus antimuscarinic combination treatment should be considered for patients not adequately responding to monotherapy of either drug. However, the majority of men with moderate-to-severe LUTS associated with BPH receive α-blocker monotherapy only, whilst less than 25% are reported to receive an antimuscarinic. Additionally, α-blocker monotherapy is reported to improve voiding and storage symptoms in men with LUTS/BPH. However, storage symptoms may persist in some men after receiving α-blocker monotherapy, epitomised by data from Lee et al. that reported only 35% of men with storage symptoms were sufficiently controlled by this treatment strategy.

### Postmicturition dribble in men with no previous urogenital surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis of treatment modalities [^112Nu9mZ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postmicturition dribble (PMD) is common in males. Little is known about PMD etiology, but it is either secondary to urethral/prostatic surgery or primary (no previous surgery). Despite PMD's high prevalence, the effectiveness of its treatment modalities remains lacking.

Objective

To undertake a systematic review of the available treatments for primary PMD in adult males and meta-analysis of their effectiveness.

Materials and Methods

We searched four electronic databases from inception to 2023 for original articles that evaluated PMD treatments in male adults without previous urethral/prostatic surgery (PROSPERO protocol CRD42023444591). Study quality and risk of bias were evaluated using established tools. We extracted a range of variables including treatment modality used and its effectiveness on PMD volume and patient complaint. Meta-analysis was undertaken where feasible, and where this was not feasible, narrative synthesis was conducted.

Results

Out of 335 studies, four were included (four clinical trials, n = 344 patients). Two trials used physical/behavioral therapy (pelvic floor muscle exercises [PFMEs], urethral milking); the other two employed phosphodiesterase (PDE5) inhibitors (tadalafil, Udenafil). All studies were of good quality, but physical/behavioral therapy studies had some risk of bias. As the two physical/behavioral therapy studies used heterogenous outcome measures, narrative synthesis showed PMD volume improvement with PFMEs more than with urethral milking, both modalities were more effective than counseling, and in one study, PFMEs were effective in reducing PMD self-reported complaint than counseling. Meta-analyses of the two PDE5 inhibitors studies showed a large effect size with high heterogeneity for decreased PMD volume favoring PDE5 inhibitors over placebo (g = -0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.75; 0.02, p = 0.05; I² = 88%); and a significant improvement equivalent to -1.06 points on the Hallym PMD Questionnaire score with no discernable heterogeneity (95% CI -1.65; -0.47, p = 0.0004; I² = 0%), favoring PDE5 inhibitors compared to controls.

Conclusions

Physical/behavioral therapy and PDE5 inhibitors are effective primary PMD treatments. PMD management studies in males with no previous urethral/prostatic surgery are very scarce and lack the use of consistent/comparable outcome measures. Further studies addressing these deficiencies would benefit this very thin evidence base.

### Metabolic syndrome is associated with prostate enlargement: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression on patients with lower urinary tract symptom factors [^113Woczq]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined by at least three of the following five criteria: blood pressure (BP) ⩾130/85 mmHg, fasting blood glucose (FBG) ⩾5.6 mmol/l, triglycerides (TG) concentration ⩾1.7, waist circumference (WC) ⩾102 cm for men and ⩾89 cm for women, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration < 1.03 mmol/l for men and < 1.4 mmol/l for women. One of the major contributing factors to MetS is obesity; the prevalence of those with obesity has almost since 1975. In England, it affects 28% of adults and it was directly associated with 1117 hospital admissions in 2018/2019.

Body mass index (BMI) ⩾35 kg/m² has been positively correlated with moderate–severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17–1.63]; WC ⩾42 inches (106.7 cm) was also a significant factor. In addition, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration > 7.4 mmol/l caused a fourfold increased risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; OR = 4.00, 95% CI = 1.27–12.63, p = 0.02).LUTS encompass a variety of bladder conditions: BPH, urinary tract infection (UTI), overactive bladder (OAB), nocturia, interstitial cystitis (IC), and bladder pain syndrome (BPS). LUTS consist of storage symptoms (urinary incontinence, urgency, frequency, and nocturia), voiding symptoms (intermittency, slow stream, hesitancy, straining to void, terminal dribble, and splitting of stream), and post-micturition symptoms (incomplete bladder emptying). Obesity and more specifically patients with a BMI ⩾35 kg/m² have been positively correlated with moderate–severe LUTS (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.17–1.63). LUTS leads to worsening quality of life, sleep, and mental health in men and women.LUTS severity may be quantified by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) that looks mild, moderate, and severe symptoms.

### Tolterodine extended release in the treatment of male OAB / storage LUTS: a systematic review [^114mRfjQ]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) have a high prevalence affecting up to 90% of men over 80 years. The term LUTS comprises a large group of symptoms usually divided into storage LUTS (daytime urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency, urinary incontinence), voiding LUTS (slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittency, hesitancy, straining, terminal dribble), and post micturition LUTS (sensation of incomplete emptying, post-micturition dribble).

In men, LUTS may be associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) typically resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). Approximately half of men with histological BPH develop BPE but only 25–50% of these men have LUTS.

OAB and storage LUTS are defined as the presence of urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence, in absence of urinary tract infection or other urethro-vesical dysfunctions. Storage LUTS are generally a chronic condition, with a prevalence ranging from 10% to 26%. Male storage symptoms could be caused by bladder dysfunction (like detrusor overactivity or detrusor impaired contractility), BPO (often caused by BPE) or by a combination of both bladder dysfunction and BPO. In that scenario, the role of targeted therapies appears crucial. In order to obtain clinical relief of storage LUTS, an extensive counseling of patients is mandatory to evaluate all the possible treatments and their expected results since the lack of efficacy and the presence of bothering adverse events (AEs) can reduce compliance.

### Prevalence and bother of postvoid dribbling and urine spraying or splitting: survey of a general gynecology population [^1127VNyu]. Urogynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Importance

Postvoid dribbling is described well for men in urologic literature but is poorly defined for women, especially in those not presenting for urogynecologic care.

Objective

The objective was to assess prevalence and bother of postvoid dribbling, urine spraying (ie, deviation of the urine stream), and other bothersome voiding/storage symptoms in a general gynecology population.

Study Design

This was an anonymous cross-sectional survey study of women presenting to academic general gynecology practices for benign gynecologic care or well-woman visits; patients were not presenting for urinary incontinence or voiding dysfunction. A questionnaire was used to assess the presence and perceptions of voiding behavior and urinary symptoms with an emphasis on postvoid dribbling and urine spraying. The questionnaire included both the validated Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis and nonvalidated questions.

Results

Nonpregnant adult women (N = 355) were surveyed. The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33–51 years). The sample was 45% White, 23% Black, 3% Asian, and 13% other. Furthermore, 39% were Latina; 68%, parous; and 28%, postmenopausal. The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of immediate postvoid dribbling was 186 of 327 or 57% (51–62%), and of these, it was at least somewhat bothersome in 37% but moderately-to-quite-a-bit bothersome in 8%. Urine spraying occurred in 222 of 333 or 67% (61–72%), and of these, it was at least somewhat bothersome in 53% but moderately-to-quite-a-bit bothersome in 17%. Approximately 20% reported stress and/or urgency urinary incontinence; both postvoid dribbling and urine spraying were highly associated with these symptoms.

Conclusions

This study of women seeking benign gynecologic care shows a high prevalence of postvoid dribbling and urine spraying symptoms. However, moderate-or-greater bother was relatively uncommon.

### Impact of early pelvic floor rehabilitation after transurethral resection of the prostate [^113fN2JJ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2001). Low credibility.

We examined the results of teaching pelvic floor muscle exercises (PME) on micturition parameters, urinary incontinence, post-micturition dribbling, and quality of life in patients after transurethral prostatectomy (TURP). Fifty-eight consecutive patients who were selected to undergo TURP for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were admitted into the study: 28 were randomly assigned to a control group (A), 30 formed the investigational group (B) during an initial visit conducted before surgery. In group B patients, perineal exercises were demonstrated in detail, and tested for their correct use via simultaneous rectal and abdominal examination. After the removal of the urethral catheter, these patients were instructed to perform pelvic floor muscle exercises at home and were evaluated before the exercises and at weekly intervals postoperatively. The American Urological Association Symptom Score improved significantly after TURP in both groups. The average quality of life score improved more significantly in group B after TURP, from 5.5 to 1.5 (P < 0.001). The grade of muscle contraction strength after 4 weeks of PME increased from 2.8 to 3.8 in group B (P < 0.01); it was unchanged in the group A. The number of patients with incontinence episodes and post-micturition dribbling was significantly lower in the group B at weeks 1, 2, and 3 (P < 0.01). Our results show that pelvic floor muscle re-education produces a quicker improvement of urinary symptoms and of quality of life in patients after TURP. Its early practice reduces urinary incontinence and post-micturition dribbling in the first postoperative weeks. The exercises are simple and easy to perform in the clinical setting and at home, and therefore should be recommended to all cooperative patients after TURP.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^113qK1cu]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are divided into three groups: storage symptoms (daytime urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence), voiding symptoms (slow stream, splitting or spraying, intermittent stream, hesitancy, straining, and terminal dribble), and postmicturition symptoms (feeling of incomplete emptying and postmicturition dribble). These symptoms have a major impact on health-related quality of lifeand are associated with substantial personal and societal expenditures. Because LUTS are associated both with age and obesity, the population burden of these conditions is likely to increase with future demographic shifts.

Symptom bother increases as the number of symptoms increases and as symptoms become more severe. However, the symptom impact is not well defined by their frequency alone. Assessment of the bother of symptoms is of key clinical relevance because it relates to both quality-of-life impairment and treatment seeking. Consequently, clinical practice guidelines suggest that only those reporting bothersome symptoms should be targeted for intervention, and watchful waiting is appropriate for those with minimal symptoms.

Investigators have often described their LUTS of interest as the "most bothersome" or "one of the most bothersome". Despite these claims, very few studies have evaluated the relative degree of bother across all LUTS, and none have attempted to establish the most bothersome LUTS in a population-based study of both genders and all adult ages. From the population perspective, the symptom with the greatest burden is the most prevalent bothersome symptom. From the individual perspective, the symptom with the greatest burden is simply the symptom most likely to be rated as bothersome among the affected. Thus the purpose of this analysis is to compare the degree of bother of major LUTS in both men and women 18–79 yr of age from both the population and individual perspectives.

### Effect of bulbospongiosus muscle injection with botulinum – A toxin for treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation; a randomized controlled trial [^111dCfke]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Li et al. observed adverse effects in 6 cases (17.6%) including 4 cases of decreased erectile hardness (11.76%) and 2 of incomplete urination (5.88%). Adverse effects in the current series were reported only in 3 cases (5.3%) of the study population; 2 patients in the treatment group suffered from loss of rigidity during erection and post-micturition dribbling and one patient in the placebo group had mild bleeding per urethra which stopped spontaneously. Of note, all patients reported normal ejaculation; no dribbling of ejaculate was encountered in any of them.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the second study in the literature investigating the effect of botulinum-A toxin injection into BS for treatment of lifelong PE and the first to deny its clinical efficacy. However, it has some limitations. We used the non-validated Arabic version of PEP questionnaire because of unavailability of Arabic validated form. Another important point is that we chose to inject the drug into the BS muscle in a single site on both sides and infiltrate the drug in a fanning technique under ultrasound guidance. This may explain the differences in our results compared to Li et al. Whether or not injection into multiple points would change the outcome is a point that should be investigated in further studies.

### A pilot single center study in children with enuresis; exploring frequency and charecteristics of monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis [^114mkBoQ]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the NMNE group, girls exhibited significantly higher rates of daytime incontinence (61.2% vs. 40.8%, p = 0.001), urgency (44.7% vs. 31.1%, p = 0.008), and holding maneuvers (24.1% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.017) compared to boys. These findings suggest that girls with NMNE are more likely to present with daytime lower urinary tract symptoms. Other symptoms, such as increased or decreased voiding frequency, post-micturition dribbling, and constipation showed no significant gender differences (Table 2).

Table 2
Description of symptoms in NMNE group and its distribution according to the gender

LUTS, Lower Urinary Tract Symptom *Pearson chi-square test

In the 5–7 age group, a significant difference in MNE prevalence was observed, with 45% of males and 24% of females affected (p < 0.001). MNE rates were similar for ages 8–10, with 55.2% for males and 42% for females, showing no significant difference (p < 0.063). In the 11–13 age group, MNE prevalence increased to 61.3% for males, while females had a higher NMNE rate of 66.7%, indicating a significant difference (p = 0.003). In the 14–17 age group, MNE rates were 44.4% for males and 28.6% for females, with no significant differences found (p = 0.432)(Table 3). While 51% of all males were monosymptomatic, 68% of all females were non-monosymptomatic.

### Pediatric urethrovaginal reflux: an underestimated cause of urinary incontinence and its successful management [^111bwxJP]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Urethrovaginal reflux (UVR) secondary to vaginal urine entrapment is an unnoticed cause of daytime urinary leakage in toilet-trained girls. Our aim is to emphasize the diagnosis of UVR as a cause of urinary incontinence, its predisposing factors, early detection, and treatment.

Methods

A total of 25 girls aged between 9 and 14 years presented with mixed daytime urinary incontinence from 2019 to 2021. They were evaluated by detailed history, vaginal examination, focused neurological examination, bladder diaries, urine analysis, uroflowmetry, and residual urine assessment. Micturating cystourethrography was also performed in those girls who did not show improvement with a conservative line of management.

Results

The parents of these girls were educated about the cause of leakage. They were treated with behavioral modifications, urotherapy, correcting toilet postures, and reverse sitting on the commode. Urethrovaginal reflux was found in 6 of the 25 girls (24%). Their ages were 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, and 14 years respectively. Two girls (10 and 14 years old) had a body mass index more than 25. They all had a typical history of a small quantity of urine leakage 5–10 min (post-micturition dribble) after every void. At follow-up after 12 months, all of them were free from urinary incontinence.

Conclusions

Urethrovaginal reflux should be considered in the differential diagnoses of girls with day-time incontinence. The key to diagnosis is an appropriate and detailed history as it is common for parents or girls to ignore symptoms or fail to report them. Proper voiding instructions and behavioral therapy often resolve the problem.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^115mkbfV]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

3 Results

Of the 6000 men and women approached, 3727 (62.4%) participated. Of them, 130 were excluded, resulting in 3597 respondents included in the analyses (1709 men and 1888 women) (Fig. 1). The median percentage of participants who provided information on both occurrence and bother for each of the 12 symptoms was 95.5% (range: 91.1–97.7%) for men and 94.3% (range: 87.9–97.5%) for women. For more characteristics of the respondents, see Table 1.

Fig. 1
Study flowchart.

Table 1
Age distribution and demographic characteristics among the 1709 men and 1888 women included

From the population perspective, after age standardization, the most frequent at least moderately bothersome LUTS was urgency (7.9%), followed by SUI (6.5%), nocturia (6.0%), postmicturition dribble (5.8%), and UUI (5.0%) (Table 2). The population prevalence of bothersome SUI was higher in women (12.0%; 95% CI, 10.0–13.9) than in men (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.3–1.3) (Fig. 2; Supplemental Table 2). Furthermore, the population burden of both UUI and other incontinence was greater in women than in men. There was, however, a higher population-level prevalence of bother in men than women from voiding symptoms (hesitancy, weak stream, and straining) and postmicturition dribble (Fig. 2; Supplemental Table 2).

### Urinary retention in female OAB after intravesical botox injection: who is really at risk? [^1169HQt2]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The average age of women with OAB who completed the study (n = 208) was 61.2 ± 13.4 years and 68.2% (n = 142) were postmenopausal. Before treatment, women with OAB reported: 11.2 (± 1.7) micturitions/24 h, 1.75 (± 0.74) UUI/24 h and 220.7 (± 28.9) mL voided volume. The mean value of the body mass index (BMI) was 29.5 ± 5.0 (kg/m²) and the mean value for parity was 2.48 ± 1.26. Thirty-six participants (17.3%) had undergone hysterectomy (30 abdominal and 6 vaginal) in the past. Women in our study group had pelvic organ prolapse (POP) stage 0 (n = 78, 37.5%) and stage 1 (n = 130, 62.5%). All patients, after three or more vaginal deliveries, had POP stage 1. However, the statistical analyses did not show the significant influence of POP stage on the PVR after treatment in our group. We performed uroflowmetry at the baseline and checked PVR to identify patients with bladder outlet obstruction and/or hypoactive bladder. The mean value of the maximum flow in our study was 26.2 ml/s (± 8.9). We observed a moderate but statistically significant negative correlation between age and maximum flow (r = −0.39; p < 0.001).

Common comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and asthma were observed in 58.6, 15.3 and 7.7% of participants respectively. PVR volumes are summarised in Table 2. Patients were instructed how to perform CISC before the procedure; however, all women with urinary retention were re-instructed, if needed, before starting CISC. In the CISC group 2 patients demonstrated clinically significant voiding dysfunction (5 and 10 days after Botox injection) and they were unable to void spontaneously; PVRs in these patients were 250 and 290 mL respectively. Moreover, 11 patients in the CISC group demonstrated PVR greater than 350 mL at week 2. Ten of them reported noticeable voiding symptoms (splitting, hesitancy, terminal dribbling) during spontaneous micturition and/or post-micturition feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, and 1 patient demonstrated PVR > 500 mL without significant voiding symptoms.

### Characterizing the spectrum of bladder health and lower urinary tract symptoms among men: results from the CARDIA study [^117EVpYS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To operationalize a new definition for bladder health, we examined the distribution and impact of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), along with risk factors, among men in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.

Methods

LUTS were defined by American Urologic Association Symptom Index (AUASI) scores and impact on quality of life (QoL). Separate questions assessed urinary incontinence (UI) and postvoid dribbling. We performed cluster analyses using AUASI scores, with and without urine incontinence and postvoid dribbling, and impact collected in 2010–11. We performed analyses to evaluate sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors between clusters.

Results

Among CARDIA men (mean age: 50.0, SD = 3.6; range: 42–56 years) with complete LUTS data (n = 929), we identified and compared four clusters: men who reported no or very mild symptoms and no impact on well-being (bladder health, n = 696, 75%), men with moderate symptoms and moderate impact on well-being (moderate symptoms/impact, n = 84, 9%), men with high symptoms and high impact on well-being (severe symptoms/impact, n = 117, 13%), and a separate group that reported moderate symptoms and UI with a high impact on well-being (UI+moderate symptoms/severe impact, n = 32, 3%). Exploration of the groupings showed a large percentage of postvoid dribbling across groups (overall 69%). Sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with symptom/impact groups.

Conclusions

Bladder health clustered into four categories. A majority of middle-aged men in the community showed no or mild bladder symptoms without impact on QoL. Postvoid dribbling is pervasive but did not cluster with a specific LUTS or impact category.

### Impact of LUTS on treatment-related behaviors and quality of life: a population-based study in Brazil [^117KTniF]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Using definition 1 for the presence of LUTS, 24.8% (n = 390) of respondents sought treatment (Table 2), and 18.6% of these (n = 292) actually received treatment. Of those who received treatment, 25.9% (n = 76) reported dissatisfaction with treatment and 8.3% (n = 26) reported treatment discontinuation. Using definition 2 for LUTS, 30.6% (n = 267) of respondents sought treatment; 22.3% (n = 195) of whom received treatment. Of these, 30.5% (n = 59) reported dissatisfaction with treatment and 9.8% (n = 21) reported treatment discontinuation. The significant results of the logistic regression models in men and women are summarized in heat maps, including adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) (Tables 3 and 4 and Tables S2 and S3), and are presented in detail below.

3.1 QoL due to LUTS

In men, slow stream with or without bother, and bother associated with splitting, urgency, incomplete emptying, and post‐micturition dribble were associated with more chance of classifying QoL due to LUTS as "terrible" than those without these symptoms (Figure S1). Depression/anxiety were also associated with a higher chance, while moderate or high physical activity were associated with a lower chance.

In women, slow stream, and bother associated with the terminal dribble, with perceived frequency, with urgency with fear of leaking, with UUI, SUI, nocturia, and with post‐micturition dribble were associated with more chance of classifying QoL due to LUTS as "terrible" than those without these symptoms. Depression/anxiety and cardiac diseases were also associated with a higher chance of reporting a terrible QoL (Figure S1).

### Population-level and individual-level bother of lower urinary tract symptoms among 30-to 80-year-old men [^1116GXMy]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the bother using both population- and individual-level bother of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) across a wide age range among men.

Materials and Methods

A total of 7470 men aged 30–80 years were approached using a postal questionnaire in 2004. The overall response was 58.7% (4384 respondents). The Danish Prostatic Symptom Score was used to evaluate bother of 12 LUTS. In the population-level analysis, prevalence of bother was calculated by relating the number of men with bother to the population size (instead of only affected men). To evaluate the bother at individual level, its prevalence among the men experiencing the symptom was assessed.

Results

In the population-level analysis, postmicturition dribble was the most common cause of bother among 30- and 40-year-old men, as 25% of the men experienced small bother and 4.5% had moderate to major bother. Men aged 70–80 years experienced the most bother from urgency followed closely by nocturia, with about 40% reporting small bother and roughly 20% moderate or major bother. When only symptomatic men were evaluated, incontinence symptoms, especially urge incontinence, were the most bothersome as more than 80% of the men with incontinence reported bother.

Conclusion

At population level, the most bothersome symptom varied by age. Men aged 30–40 years experienced bother most commonly from postmicturition dribble. With increasing age, urgency and nocturia became the most bothersome symptoms by age 70–80 years. At individual level, incontinence symptoms were the most bothersome LUTS, with less influence by age.

### Grading severity and bother using the international prostate symptom score and international consultation on incontinence questionnaire male lower urinary tract symptoms score in men seeking lower urinary tract symptoms therapy [^115HyKRG]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We established severity banding ranges, bother assessment and key item content in principal patient reported outcomes measures in men seeking therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms.

Materials and Methods

Data for International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-MLUTS) were derived from a study evaluating 820 men at 26 United Kingdom hospitals. ROC curves were used to establish severity bandings.

Results

Classification tree showed that thresholds between mild-moderate and moderate-severe severity bands were 15 and 27 for I-PSS, 16 and 26 for ICIQ-MLUTS/severity, and 22 and 81 for ICIQ-MLUTS/bother, respectively. Highest area under the ROC curve and lowest Akaike's information criteria of univariate logistic regression indicated that ICIQ-MLUTS/bother was more related to global quality of life than were I-PSS and ICIQ-MLUTS/severity. The symptoms affecting I-PSS-quality of life (QoL) were only fully identified by ICIQ-MLUTS, because 2 key symptoms (urinary incontinence and post-micturition dribble) are not measured by I-PSS. ICIQ-MLUTS demonstrated that bother of some lower urinary tract symptoms is disproportionate to severity, and that persisting high bother levels following surgery are more likely due to storage (18% to 25%) and post-voiding (18% to 28%) lower urinary tract symptoms than voiding lower urinary tract symptoms (5% to 13%). Symptom improvement after surgery was uncertain if baseline I-PSS-QoL score was less than 3.

Conclusions

The severity threshold scores were measured for the 2 key lower urinary tract symptoms patient reported outcomes measures, and the results indicate suitable categories of symptom severity for use in men referred for urological care. The ICIQ-MLUTS measures all the lower urinary tract symptoms affecting quality of life and includes individual symptom bother scores.

### Symptom based clustering of men in the LURN observational cohort study [^111hcTsT]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Conventional classification of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms into diagnostic categories based on a predefined symptom complex or predominant symptom appears inadequate. This is due to the frequent presentation of patients with multiple urinary symptoms which could not be perfectly categorized into traditional diagnostic groups. We used a novel clustering method to identify subtypes of male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms based on detailed multisymptom information.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed baseline data on 503 care seeking men in the LURN (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network) Observational Cohort Study. Symptoms and symptom severity were assessed using the LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms) Tool and the AUA SI (American Urological Association Symptom Index), which include a total of 52 questions. We used a resampling based consensus clustering algorithm to identify patient subtypes with distinct symptom signatures.

Results

Four distinct symptom clusters were identified. The 166 patients in cluster M1 had predominant symptoms of frequency, nocturia, hesitancy, straining, weak stream, intermittency and incomplete bladder emptying suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction. The 93 patients in cluster M2 mainly endorsed post-micturition symptoms (eg post-void dribbling and post-void leakage) with some weak stream. The 114 patients in cluster M3 reported mostly urinary frequency without incontinence. The 130 patients in cluster M4 reported severe frequency, urgency and urgency incontinence. Most other urinary symptoms statistically differed between cluster pairs. Patient reported outcomes of bowel symptoms, mental health, sleep dysfunction, erectile function and urological pain significantly differed across the clusters.

Conclusions

We identified 4 data derived clusters among men seeking care for lower urinary tract symptoms. The clusters differed from traditional diagnostic categories. Further subtype refinement will be done to incorporate clinical data and nonurinary patient reported outcomes.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^116JzoMT]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

No study has compared the bothersomeness of all lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) using a population-based sample of adults. Despite this lack of evidence, investigators have often cited their LUTS of interest as the "most bothersome" or "one of the most bothersome".

Objective

To compare the population- and individual-level burden of LUTS in men and women.

Design, setting, and participants

In this population-based cross-sectional study, questionnaires were mailed to 6000 individuals (18–79 yr of age) randomly identified from the Finnish Population Register.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis

The validated Danish Prostatic Symptom Score questionnaire was used for assessment of bother of 12 different LUTS. The age-standardized prevalence of at least moderate bother was calculated for each symptom (population-level burden). Among symptomatic individuals, the proportion of affected individuals with at least moderate bother was calculated for each symptom (individual-level bother).

Results and limitations

A total of 3727 individuals (62.4%) participated (53.7% female). The LUTS with the greatest population-level burden were urgency (7.9% with at least moderate bother), stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (6.5%), nocturia (6.0%), postmicturition dribble (5.8%), and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) (5.0%). Burden from incontinence symptoms was higher in women than men, and the opposite was true for voiding and postmicturition symptoms. At the individual level, UUI was the most bothersome for both genders. Although the response proportion was high, approximately a third did not participate.

Conclusions

Both men and women with UUI report moderate or major bother more frequently than individuals with other LUTS. At the population level, the most prevalent bothersome symptoms are urgency, SUI, and nocturia.

Patient summary

Urinary urgency was the most common troubling symptom in a large population-based study; however, for individuals, urgency incontinence was the most likely to be rated as bothersome.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^113TB3tv]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 The Finnish National Nocturia and Overactive Bladder Study

The Finnish National Nocturia and Overactive Bladder Study cohort comprises a population-based sample of men and women 18–79 yr of age in Finland. Its aim is to assess the prevalence, natural history, impact, and risk factors of urinary symptoms at the population level. Detailed study procedures have been published. Briefly, in 2003–2004, questionnaires were mailed to individuals randomly identified from the Population Register Centre of Finland. Stratification by age was used in individual selection with oversampling of younger age groups to ensure an adequate number of individuals with urinary storage symptoms in each age group. The questionnaire gathered information on frequency and bother of LUTS, quality of life, numerous conditions and medications, as well as information on sociodemographic, anthropometric, and reproductive factors. Exemption from ethical review was granted by the ethics committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital District (Tampere, Finland), as permitted by the Finnish regulations on surveys. The reporting of this analysis conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement.

2.2 Measures

The frequency and bother of LUTS were assessed using the questions from the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS; Supplemental Table 1), which are consistent with the International Continence Society definitions. The DAN-PSS includes assessment of 12 LUTS: hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete emptying, straining, daytime frequency, nocturia, urgency, urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), pain/burning, postmicturition dribble, stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and other incontinence. Occurrence of most LUTS was measured on a 4-point scale consisting of never, rarely, often, and always (Supplemental Table 1). Bother of all LUTS was reported on a 4-point scale: none, small, moderate, or major (Supplemental Table 1). Among symptomatic individuals (those who reported a symptom occurring at least rarely or equivalent were considered symptomatic; see response options in Supplemental Table 1), the age-standardized proportion of individuals with moderate or major bother for each LUTS was calculated to determine the individual level of bother of each symptom. To determine the most prevalent bother at the population level, the age-standardized prevalence of respondents with moderate or major bother was calculated for each symptom.

### Prevalence of nocturia among community-dwelling adults: a population-based study in Malaysia [^113p1whT]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

From the sub analyses, the frequency of nocturnal voids among respondents with nocturia and among different age groups has been depicted in Fig. 4. Those who were more than 60 years old were more likely to experience more than one nocturnal void as compared to their younger counterparts (Fig. 4). The mean age for those with once, twice and three or more times of nocturnal voids was 35.51 ± 14.03, 43.41 ± 14.49 and 46.55 ± 14.97, respectively. The association was significant, which indicated that frequency of nocturnal void is higher in older age groups (p < 0.001).

Fig. 4
Frequency of nocturia a among respondents with nocturia, b in different age groups. n = 2646

The disease pattern of nocturia encountered by the respondents with nocturia has been summarised in Table 4. Post urination dribble was the only symptom that differed significantly in male respondents with nocturia compared to female (p < 0.001). Those with higher age (> 50 years old) were more likely to present with almost all the symptoms (p < 0.05).

### Impact of LUTS on treatment-related behaviors and quality of life: a population-based study in Brazil [^112vcoPa]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Percentages of individuals with LUTS seeking treatment were low, in accordance with previous studies, in which 14% to 33% of individuals sought treatment. 3, 8, 12, 13, 14 Even though LUTS were frequently reported as bothersome and with significant impact on QoL in the Brazil LUTS study, 4 treatment seeking may be impacted by other factors, such as patients' embarrassment about LUTS, and a wrong perception about LUTS being a "natural" consequence of the aging process and not amenable to treatment. 7, 15, 16 Among Brazilian men, the prominent symptoms associated with worse QoL were splitting, slow stream, urgency, feeling of incomplete emptying, and post‐micturition dribble. For women, storage symptoms (perceived frequency and nocturia) and those related to UI (urgency with fear of leaking, UUI, SUI, and post‐micturition dribble) were associated with worse QoL, as were slow stream and terminal dribble.

For men, bother related to symptoms of distinct categories, including voiding (slow stream), storage (perceived frequency), and post‐micturition (incomplete emptying), was associated with a higher chance of treatment seeking. This emphasizes the importance of a broader evaluation of men with LUTS, to assess LUTS subtypes and associated bother. This is an important aspect, which enables individualized treatment. Although LUTS in women are often associated with storage symptoms, symptom‐specific bother associated with a higher chance of seeking treatment included voiding (slow stream, splitting, intermittency) as well as storage symptoms (perceived frequency, urgency).

Not all patients seeking medical advice for LUTS actually receive treatment; additionally, most guidelines do not recommend treatment for mild and nonbothersome LUTS. 17, 18 For men, straining and feeling of incomplete emptying were associated with a higher chance of receiving treatment. Since these symptoms are commonly associated with benign prostatic obstruction by physicians, it is possible that they are more comfortable prescribing treatment for symptoms commonly associated with men. As bother with perceived frequency was associated with treatment seeking, this may represent an unmet need. A higher chance of treatment for women was associated with intermittency and bother with splitting, and with urgency with fear of leaking. Therefore, it appears that both storage and voiding are considered in the treatment decision for women.

### A pilot single center study in children with enuresis; exploring frequency and charecteristics of monosymptomatic and non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis [^115ftdAf]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and evaluation tool

The definitions of enuresis and subtypes are based on the Terminology Standardization published by the International Children's Continence Society. During the examination of all children visiting the clinic, the Rome IV questionnaire and the Dysfunctional Voiding and Incontinence Scoring System (DVISS) questionnaire were administered in the presence of their families. Children with a Rome IV score of 2 or higher are classified as having constipation. Each patient completed a bladder diary lasting at least 2 days, along with records, according to ICCS recommendations. Urinalysis, urine culture and urinary ultrasonography were performed for all children. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined by urinary system symptoms, a positive culture result, and pyuria in a properly collected urine sample documented in the patient's previous medical records. Post Micturition Residual (PMR) volume was assessed by urinary ultrasonography. Normal PMR is defined as < 20 mL or < 10% of bladder capacity. Abnormal PMR is defined as > 20 mL or > 10% of bladder capacity (on repeated measurements). Bladder capacity was calculated using the formula EBC = (age + 1) × 30 mL. A bladder capacity of less than 65% of the expected value was considered reduced according to ICCS criteria.

The records of the children included in the study were reviewed for patient age at presentation, gender, family history of enuresis, PMR volume, bladder capacity, DVISS scores, history of urinary system infection, nocturnal polyuria and daytime lower urinary system symptoms (constipation, decreased-increased voiding frequency, daytime incontinence, urgency, intermittent voiding, post-micturition dribbling, holding maneuvers, straining, interrupted flow, feeling of incomplete emptying).

At the individual level, UUI was the most bothersome for both genders. Although the response proportion was high, approximately a third did not participate.

Conclusions

Both men and women with UUI report moderate or major bother more frequently than individuals with other LUTS. At the population level, the most prevalent bothersome symptoms are urgency, SUI, and nocturia.

Patient Summary

Urinary urgency was the most common troubling symptom in a large population-based study; however, for individuals, urgency incontinence was the most likely to be rated as bothersome.

### Effect of bulbospongiosus muscle injection with botulinum – A toxin for treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation; a randomized controlled trial [^1123z596]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In group II, there were insignificant changes in the mean PEP at 1- (P = 0.06), 3-(P = 0.1) and 6-month (P = 0.6). Similarly, insignificant changes had been noted in the IELT (P = 0.06, 0.09 and 0.3) and female partner's satisfaction (P = 0.08, 0.8 and 0.1) throughout the study duration after 1, 3 and 6 months respectively.

When comparing both groups, there were insignificant differences in the changes of the mean PEP score at 1-,3- and 6-months (P = 0.7, 0.6 and 0.4, respectively) (Fig. 3 A). Also, no statistically significant differences were found regarding the changes in the mean IELT (P = 0.6, 0.6 and 0.5) (Fig. 3B) and female partner's satisfaction score (P = 0.5, 0.7 and 0.3) throughout the study period (Fig. 3C).

Efficacy outcome.

Changes of PEP (A), IELT (B) and female satisfaction (C) in both groups. P1 illustrates the differences in mean changes between baseline and 1-month, P2 illustrates the differences in mean changes between baseline and 3- months and P3 illustrates the differences in mean changes between baseline and 6- months values (Repeated measure ANNOVA test).

Adverse events were observed only in 3 cases (5.3%); 2 in group I and a single case in group II (P = 0.5). One patient in group I suffered from mild erectile dysfunction which lasted for 1 month, where there was a reduction in his rigidity, but he was still able to have penetrative sex. Another patient in the same group reported post-micturition dribbling which occurred from day 4 after injection and lasted for 2 months. A patient in the control group developed mild urethral bleeding post-injection which stopped spontaneously after 2 days.

### Impact of LUTS on treatment-related behaviors and quality of life: a population-based study in Brazil [^114ZproK]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2 Treatment seeking

Men bothered by slow stream, perceived frequency, and incomplete emptying had more chance of seeking treatment than those without these symptoms (Figure S2). Men reporting high physical activity had more chance of seeking treatment than sedentary men. There was an increase of 6% in the chance of seeking treatment for LUTS with each increased year of age. Women with bother associated with the slow stream, splitting, intermittency, perceived frequency, and urgency had more chance of seeking treatment than those without symptoms (Figure S2). For each additional year of age, there was a 2% increase in seeking treatment for LUTS.

3.3 Treatment

Men with straining, those bothered by incomplete emptying, and those reporting depression/anxiety had more chance of receiving treatment than those without symptoms (Figure S3). A 7% increased chance of receiving treatment occurred with each additional year of age. Women with intermittency, with bothersome splitting, and with urgency with fear of leaking had more chance of receiving treatment than those without symptoms (Figure S3). A 2% increase in the chance of receiving treatment occurred with each additional year of age.

3.4 Treatment dissatisfaction

Men bothered by perceived frequency and by UUI, and women bothered by perceived frequency, by UUI, and by incomplete emptying had an increased chance of dissatisfaction with treatment for LUTS vs those not reporting these symptoms (Figure S4). In women only, there was a 4% reduction in the chance of dissatisfaction with treatment for each additional year of age.

3.5 Treatment discontinuation

Men with hesitancy and with bothersome post‐micturition dribble had a lower chance of discontinuing treatment than those without these symptoms (Figure S5). Men with incomplete emptying (with or without bother) had a higher chance of discontinuing treatment, as did overweight and obese men vs those with normal body mass index. Men undergoing moderate‐to‐high physical activity had less chance of discontinuing treatment compared with sedentary men.

Women reporting bother associated with nocturnal enuresis and with the leak for no reason, and those reporting cardiac diseases had more chance of discontinuing treatment vs women without these conditions (Figure S5). Women who were unemployed and who had stopped smoking had less chance of treatment discontinuation.

### Impact of LUTS on treatment-related behaviors and quality of life: a population-based study in Brazil [^1111ciY9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Bother with perceived frequency and with UUI were associated with a higher chance of dissatisfaction among treated men. It is possible that this is due to ineffective/inadequate treatment, or storage LUTS not being recognized in men. An α1‐blocker with or without 5ARI is usually first‐line therapy for moderate‐to‐severe LUTS in men 18; however, symptom control may be unsatisfactory, especially if there are concomitant OAB symptoms. Antimuscarinics or β3‐adrenoreceptor agonists are first‐line pharmacologic therapy for storage symptoms associated with OAB, 19 but there may be reluctance to use antimuscarinics due to misguided perceptions that they are associated with urinary retention. 20 According to EAU guidelines, combination of an α1‐blocker with an antimuscarinic is recommended in patients with moderate‐to‐severe LUTS without risk factors for benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) progression (eg, prostate volume < 40 cm³) if relief of storage symptoms is insufficient with α1‐blocker monotherapy. 21

In women, bother with perceived frequency, with UUI, and with a feeling of incomplete emptying were associated with a higher chance of treatment dissatisfaction. As storage symptoms are more readily associated with women by physicians, one explanation may be that symptoms are not adequately controlled. In this situation, and/or if unacceptable adverse events occur, AUA guidelines recommend dose modification or a trial with another antimuscarinic, or a β3‐adrenoreceptor agonist such as mirabegron. 19 Recent studies have shown increased persistence rates with mirabegron vs antimuscarinics in the UK, Canada, and Japan, suggesting an improved efficacy/tolerability balance for mirabegron vs antimuscarinics. 22, 23, 24

It is recognized that treatment for LUTS has a high rate of discontinuation. 22, 25, 26 Among men, feeling of incomplete emptying (with or without bother) was associated with a higher chance of treatment discontinuation, while hesitancy and bother with post‐micturition dribble were associated with a lower chance. Among women, bother with the leak for no reason and with nocturnal enuresis were associated with a higher chance of discontinuation. These symptoms associated with a higher chance of treatment discontinuation are generally complex and with no specific targeted treatment, which may explain this observation.

### Functional effects of bulbospongiosus muscle sparing on ejaculatory function and post-void dribbling after bulbar urethroplasty [^111K1ngA]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Bulbar urethroplasty outcomes studies have shown low but significant rates of post-void dribbling and ejaculatory dysfunction. The bulbospongiosus muscle is involved with the expulsion of seminal fluid and urine from the bulbar urethra and, thus, we hypothesized that performing urethroplasty using a technique that does not split the muscle may result in better postoperative patient reported ejaculatory function and less post-void dribbling.

Materials and Methods

We performed a multi-institutional matched, case-control analysis comparing men treated with a bulbospongiosus sparing technique to men treated with the traditional nonbulbospongiosus sparing technique. Preoperative and postoperative (3 to 12 months) ejaculatory function was assessed using the 4 ejaculatory questions of the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire short form as well as a patient perception questionnaire. Post-void dribbling was assessed using a validated urethroplasty questionnaire.

Results

A total of 25 patients who underwent bulbospongiosus sparing urethroplasty and 25 who underwent nonbulbospongiosus sparing urethroplasty were matched by total preoperative Male Sexual Health Questionnaire score, age, and performance of excision and primary anastomosis. The bulbospongiosus sparing and nonbulbospongiosus sparing groups had similar postoperative total Male Sexual Health Questionnaire scores (15.24 vs 15.40, respectively, p = 0.90) and there were no significant postoperative questionnaire score changes in either group (bulbospongiosus sparing 14.56 to 15.24, p = 0.4; nonbulbospongiosus sparing 14.64 vs 15.40, p = 0.44). Individual responses to the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire were analyzed and no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. Rates of postoperative post-void dribbling and perception of ejaculatory function were similar between the groups.

Conclusions

Sparing the bulbospongiosus muscle during urethroplasty does not seem to have a significant impact on patient reported ejaculatory function or post-void dribbling compared with nonbulbospongiosus sparing urethroplasty at early followup.

### Constant urinary dribbling due to an ectopic ureter and delays in diagnosis [^116FmzTx]. Clinical Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

We present 2 patients who had a solitary kidney visualized on ultrasound imaging and experienced constant urinary dribbling. Further imaging modalities defined the anatomy and visualized the contralateral kidney and ectopic ureter causing the dribbling. Both patients went on to have curative surgical procedures. These cases reinforce the point that in a toilet-trained girl with normal voiding at normal intervals experiencing constant urinary dribbling, the diagnosis of an ectopic ureter must be considered early and referral made for appropriate imaging. Because of the abnormal anatomy, ultrasound imaging is particularly limited in such cases, but if used, one should take account of antenatal and postnatal scans. Referral is advocated, based on history alone, for appropriate imaging and investigation.

### Effect of bulbospongiosus muscle injection with botulinum – A toxin for treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation; a randomized controlled trial [^112h9KYe]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

This study aimed at assessing a new line of treatment for lifelong premature ejaculation which is botulinum-A toxin injection into the bulbospongiosus muscle. Sixty patients with lifelong premature ejaculation were independently randomized into 2 groups; group I, 100 U botulinum-A toxin at 10 U/ml saline was injected with ultrasound guidance into the bulbospongiosus muscle and group II which was injected with similar volume of saline. The primary outcome was to compare both groups for changes in the Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP), Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time (IELT) and partner's satisfaction at 1, 3 and 6 months after intervention. The second outcome was to compare the adverse events in both groups. Fifty-seven patients completed the study. In group I, the mean PEP increased significantly at 1- (P = 0.02) and 3- months (P = 0.04) with insignificant increase at 6-month (P = 0.6) of follow-up. Also, no significant changes had been noted in IELT or partner's satisfaction scores throughout the study duration (P > 0.05). In group II, no significant changes had been noted in the PEP, IELT and partner's satisfaction scores throughout the study duration (P > 0.05). There were insignificant differences in the changes in the mean PEP (P = 0.7, 0.6 and 0.4), IELT (P = 0.6,0.6 and 0.5) and partner's satisfaction scores (P = 0.5,0.7 and 0.3) in comparison to the baseline values at 1-, 3- and 6- months, respectively between both groups. Adverse events were observed in only 3 patients (5.3%). In group I, mild erectile dysfunction and post micturition dribbling were reported in one patient each. Where in group II, one patient reported bleeding per urethra (P = 0.5). To conclude, injection of botulinum-A toxin into bulbospongiosus seems to be safe but failed to prove clinical efficacy for treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation when compared to placebo.

### Baseline lower urinary tract symptoms in patients enrolled in LURN: a prospective, observational cohort study [^112E7irA]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

We described and compared the frequency and type of lower urinary tract symptoms reported by men and women at the time that they were recruited from urology and urogynecology clinics into the Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study.

Materials and Methods

At 6 research sites treatment seeking men and women were enrolled who reported any lower urinary tract symptoms at a frequency more than rarely during the last month on the LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms) Tool. At baseline the study participants underwent a standardized clinical evaluation and completed validated questionnaires. Urological tests were performed, including pelvic/rectal examination, post-void residual urine measurement and urinalysis.

Results

A total of 545 women and 519 men were enrolled in the study. Mean ± SD age was 58.8 ± 14.1 years. At baseline nocturia, frequency and a sensation of incomplete emptying were similar in men and women but men experienced more voiding symptoms (90% vs 85%, p = 0.007) and women reported more urgency (85% vs 66%, p < 0.001). Women also reported more of any type of urinary incontinence than men (82% vs 51% p < 0.001), which was mixed incontinence in 57%. Only 1% of men reported stress incontinence but they had other urinary incontinence, including post-void dribbling in 44% and urgency incontinence in 46%. Older participants had higher odds of reporting symptoms of nocturia and urgency.

Conclusions

In this large, treatment seeking cohort of men and women lower urinary tract symptoms varied widely by gender and age. Men reported more voiding symptoms and nonstress or urgency urinary incontinence while women reported more incontinence overall and urgency. Older participants had greater odds of urgency and nocturia.

### Impact of sex reassignment surgery on lower urinary tract function [^1118TTic]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effects of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) on lower urinary tract function.

Methods

A questionnaire concerning voiding habits and lower urinary tract symptoms after sex reassignment surgery, was given to 24 female-to-male transsexuals (FTM) and 31 male-to-female transsexuals (MTF), who respectively underwent phalloplasty and vaginoplasty. For this study only Dutch speaking patients were selected. Also, uro-flowmetry data from 92 FTM transsexuals were reviewed.

Results

In general, no change in voiding patterns was observed. Post-void dribbling was reported by 79% of the FTM transsexuals, and 16% of the MTF group reported some form of incontinence. The uro-flowmetry examination showed a mean, non-significant decrease of 2 ml/s in Q(max) in FTM patients.

Conclusion

SRS can cause minor changes in urinary habits. Even if they do not result in patients seeking medical help, transsexuals should be warned about these eventual discomforts pre-operatively.

### Prevalence and characteristics of urinary incontinence in a treatment seeking male prospective cohort: results from the LURN study [^113B9HSa]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Male urinary incontinence is thought to be infrequent. We sought to describe the prevalence of urinary incontinence in a male treatment seeking cohort enrolled in the LURN (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network).

Materials and Methods

Study inclusion and exclusion criteria, including men with prostate cancer or neurogenic bladder, were previously reported. LURN participants prospectively completed questionnaires regarding lower urinary tract symptoms and other clinical variables. Men were grouped based on incontinence type, including 1) no urinary incontinence, 2) post-void dribbling only and 3) urinary incontinence. Comparisons were made using ANOVA and multivariable regression.

Results

Of the 477 men 24% reported no urinary incontinence, 44% reported post-void dribbling only and 32% reported urinary incontinence. African American men and those with sleep apnea were more likely to be in the urinary incontinence group than in the no urinary incontinence group (OR 3.2, p = 0.02 and OR 2.73, p = 0.003, respectively). Urinary incontinence was associated with significantly higher bother compared to men without leakage (p < 0.001). Compared to men without urinary incontinence and men with only post-void dribbling those with urinary incontinence were significantly more likely to report higher scores (more severe symptoms) on the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) questionnaires regarding bowel issues, depression and anxiety than men without urinary incontinence (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Urinary incontinence is common among treatment seeking men. This is concerning because the guideline recommended questionnaires to assess male lower urinary tract symptoms do not query for urinary incontinence. Thus, clinicians may be missing an opportunity to intervene and improve patient care. This provides a substantial rationale for a new or updated symptom questionnaire which provides a more comprehensive symptom assessment.

### Systematic review exploring the relationship between sexual abuse and lower urinary tract symptoms [^11749zzA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms were variably assessed and urinary storage problems such as urinary incontinence, frequency and nocturia were reported most often. Some patients were reporting incontinence in the context of holding the urine too long until it became painful. Urodynamics testing was not performed in any of the studies. The cause of urinary incontinence was unclear and inclusion of validated questionnaires and possibly urodynamics in future studies would help to understand whether incontinence was due to overactive bladder, stress incontinence or mixed. Establishing dysfunction such as bladder hypersensitivity and/or detrusor overactivity would be critical when tailoring therapeutic strategies for managing these symptoms. Voiding difficulties were less often reported and symptoms reported were pain with urination, hesitancy, slow stream, dribbling, holding urine until painful, incomplete bladder emptying, weak urinary stream and straining to begin urination. Questionnaires such as the UDI-6 do specifically enquire about voiding difficulties; however, only the total score was reported in studies. Urinary retention was not reported and post-void residual volumes were not measured in any of the studies; therefore, the extent of incomplete bladder emptying could not be assessed. Although trauma features in the history of patients presenting with idiopathic urinary retention in men and women, none of the studies in this review specifically explored urinary retention related to sexual trauma.

### Vesicovaginal reflux: recognition and diagnosis using ultrasound [^1145fxLs]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vaginal reflux is a functional voiding disorder seen in prepubertal girls without anatomical or neurological abnormality. When not associated with urinary tract infections (UTI), asymptomatic bacteriuria, post-void dribbling or daytime enuresis it may be considered a normal finding.

Objective

To review the radiographic features of vesicovaginal reflux based on multiple imaging modalities.

Materials and Methods

Three girls aged 11, 13 and 5 years were referred for pelvic US for daytime incontinence, post-void dribbling, frequency and urgency. One girl also had recurrent UTIs treated with antibiotics and was investigated for vesicoureteric reflux with US and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). All three were examined with MRI.

Results

Imaging appearance common to all three girls was a fluid-filled mass posterior to the bladder that disappeared after voiding. A previous VCUG in one girl had shown contrast medium refluxing into the vagina which disappeared after bladder emptying. Pelvic MRI confirmed the findings in all three girls.

Conclusion

US examination of a distended bladder followed by a post-void study easily provides the correct diagnosis of vesicovaginal reflux by identifying the vagina as the fluid-filled mass. Treatment involves behavioural modifications. Though well known to urologists, this may be a perplexing pathology for the inexperienced trainee radiologist.

### Symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction research network (LURN II) urinary urgency phenotyping study: methods and baseline urinary symptoms by age and sex [^116UwCny]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We present the methods and baseline data from the multicenter, prospective Urgency Phenotyping Protocol cohort, which focused on care‐seeking men and women with URG or UUI. We find significant gender and age differences in the constellation of LUTS found in this URG/UUI population. Among women, isolated UUI is rare; in this cohort, 75% of care‐seeking women with UUI also had concomitant SUI. Male patients in this cohort rarely suffered from isolated SUI, however, reported more traditional voiding symptoms of intermittency, splitting/spraying and hesitancy as well as nocturia again. Both genders suffered equally from post void dribbling and hesitancy and feelings of incomplete bladder emptying.

These findings parallel our prior cohort of LUTS participants in LURN I where mixed UI affected 75% of all women with UUI. URG alone was infrequent in women (15%) in comparison to men, where URG alone without UUI was common at 42%, a trend that has been previously reported in other large population studies. The paucity of SUI among men in our cohort was not surprising since radical prostatectomy and pelvic radiation, the primary causes of SUI in men, were exclusion criteria. The constellation of symptoms seen among male participants was consistent with population data on LUTS among men. While older participants had greater odds of nocturia and UUI like other reports of LUTS stratified by age, several domains that are traditionally considered as age‐dependent (weak stream, straining) had no age‐associations.

### Complex extensive urethral diverticulum on pelvic floor ultrasound and MRI [^115F2VzZ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A urethral diverticulum most commonly presents with recurrent urinary tract infection (51%), stress incontinence (45.5%), a vaginal lump (45%), urethral discharge (21%), and "the 3Ds" (dysuria, dyspareunia, post-void dribbling; 9%). Diverticula are on average 26 mm in diameter (range 8–45 mm), and are U-shaped or circumferential in 84%.

### Outcome reporting in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the pharmacological management of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) in women; a systematic review for the development of core outcome sets (COS) [^113xp3PN]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the 38 RCTs analysed in this review, 25 studies clearly stated the primary outcome in the methods section (65.8%), whilst 23 studies declared the secondary outcomes (60.5%). Of studies that listed primary outcomes, five (13.2%) included more than one outcome. Three studies stated primary but not secondary outcomes (7.9%).

Quality of life was also assessed in over half of the studies (23 studies [60.5%]), either as a primary or a secondary outcome. Examples of QoL assessments included patient satisfaction, improvement in work productivity, change in quantity and quality of sleep and patient perspective on impact of the disease. However, in most trials the outcomes were outlined as changes from baseline to end-of-treatment in symptom-bother scores. Validated questionnaires were used in 29 studies (78.4%); the most commonly used were OAB-q and PPBC (assessed in 10 studies [26.3%]). Other questionnaires used included KHQ, the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI), Nocturia Quality of Life questionnaire (N-QoL), Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-QoL) and others. QoL related outcomes were identified as primary outcomes in 2 studies (5.3%).

Safety was assessed in 28 studies (73.7%) and was stated as a primary outcome in one study; this was primarily assessed as incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse effects (TEAEs). Other safety parameters were also assessed including side effects of antimuscarinics such as dry mouth and constipation, hypersensitivity reactions, hyponatraemia, cardiac effects, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, headaches, cognitive effects and death among others. Discontinuation rates were also documented in 13 studies (34.2%). Safety of the drugs used was monitored objectively and subjectively, through patients reporting side effects at clinic appointments, as well as through laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations and urinalyses among others.

Other outcomes assessed include changes to maximum flow rate, post-void residual volume, post-void dribbling, voiding efficiency, change from baseline to week 12 in transvaginal ultrasound bladder wall thickness and difference in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT-R) scores from baseline to week 4.

3.3 Urologic Symptoms and Health Status

Baseline LUTS for cases, using the LUTS Tool, is displayed in Figure 2. Females had higher proportions reporting often or almost always having URG (severity and bother), URG with fear of leaking (severity and bother), any UI (severity) and UUI (severity), compared to men. Men had higher proportions of often or almost always reporting nocturia (severity).

Figure 2
Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Tool eligibility responses.

The Venn diagram display rates of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and UUI versus URG alone among men and women. Among cases, 48% of men and 25% of women reported UUI alone; higher proportion of men reported URG alone (43% vs. 19%). Mixed incontinence was prevalent among women but rare among men (49% vs. 8%), Figure 3a, b.

Figure 3
Venn diagram of urinary incontinence and urgency among case participants in the Urinary Urgency Phenotyping study.

On logistic regression models evaluating symptoms by gender and adjusting for age (Figure 4, Table S1), women had higher odds of reporting UI with and without stress maneuvers, UUI, and pain with urination compared to men. Men had higher odds of reporting nocturia, and voiding symptoms including intermittency, splitting/spraying and hesitancy. There was no difference between men and women in terms of odds of reporting daytime urgency, frequency, sensation of incomplete emptying, postvoid dribbling and straining with urination.

Figure 4
Logistic Regression Model (female vs. male) of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms by sex (adjusted for age).

Logistic regression models (Figure 5, Table S2) evaluating symptoms by age (per 10‐year increase in age) found that participants leaking while rushing to the bathroom, nocturia, general UI, and URG with fear of leakage were associated with higher odds of being older age. However, hesitancy, daytime frequency, post‐void leakage, splitting/spraying, incomplete emptying, straining to urinate and pain with urination were associated with higher odds of being younger age. Several domains were independent of age associations, including dysuria, frequency, urgency, stress incontinence, intermittent stream, weak stream, and leakage with no reason.

### Inefficient urethral milking secondary to urethral dysfunction as an additional risk factor for incontinence after radical prostatectomy [^111z9YUk]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Continence after radical prostatectomy is thought to depend completely on the striated urethral sphincter. However, some patients complain only of occasional post-void dribbling. Therefore, we determined whether urethral dysfunction may be another cause of incontinence.

Materials and Methods

The sensory threshold of electric stimulation was measured by double ring electrodes in the membranous urethra and 2.5 cm. distal in 29 men before and in 29 after radical retropubic prostatectomy. In addition, voiding cystourethrography was performed in 66 patients before and in 49 after surgery to determine complete post-void urethral emptying or milking.

Results

The mean sensory threshold of the membranous urethra was 15 ± 3 mA. preoperatively versus 38 ± 17 postoperatively (p < 0.0001). The sensory threshold 2.5 cm. further distal was 12 ± 5 mA. before and 10 ± 4 after radical prostatectomy, which was not statistically significant. Postoperatively in completely continent patients and in those with dribbling the mean threshold was 32 ± 12 and 43 ± 18 mA. in the membranous urethra (p = 0.09), and 11 ± 4 and 9 ± 4 mA. in the bulbar urethra, respectively, which was not statistically significant. Of the 66 patients 36 (55%) showed post-void urethral milking before surgery but only 8 of 49 (16%) showed it postoperatively (chi-square test p < 0.0001), including 7 who were completely continent and 1 who complained of occasional post-void dribbling.

Conclusions

After radical prostatectomy sensitivity of the membranous but not of the bulbar urethra is affected, correlating with postoperative continence. In addition, post-void dribbling seems to be associated with the loss of urethral milking. We conclude that preserving urethral function is another important continence factor after radical prostatectomy.

### EAU guidelines on management of non-neurogenic female lower urinary tract symptoms [^115kUDwv]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for underactive bladder, more specifically with respect to post-void residual volume, EAU/EAUN 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor post-void residual volume in patients receiving treatment that may cause or worsen voiding dysfunction.

### Impact of LUTS on treatment-related behaviors and quality of life: a population-based study in Brazil [^115wUpRf]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Previously published methods 4 are presented briefly here. Data were from a computer‐assisted telephone survey conducted in Brazil between 1 September and 31 December 2015. Ten thousand telephone numbers were randomly selected via systematic randomization for each of the municipalities of São Paulo, Porto Alegre, Recife, Belém, and Goiânia. The randomized selection was stratified by zip code to ensure equal representation by the city. Following identification of households, a trained interviewer made up to ten call attempts between 8:00and 9:00on any day of the week. The interviewer explained the purpose of the research and its characteristics and requested a verbal informed consent based on a random, computer‐assisted selection of any individuals aged 40 years and older who were resident in the home. The interview consisted of a standardized questionnaire, which in addition to gathering participants' demographic data included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and overactive bladder (OAB)‐V8 questionnaires validated in Portuguese. Participants (n = 5814) were adults greater than or equal to 40 years with landlines living in major cities from five geographical regions in Brazil: South East (São Paulo), South (Porto Alegre), North East (Recife), North (Belém), and Central West (Goiânia). Exclusions were pregnancy and current/past urinary tract infection (within 1 month). The study was approved by an ethics committee, and was performed in compliance with good clinical practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. 1 LUTS was defined as suggested by International Continence Society (ICS) 9 and included: slow stream, splitting, intermittency, hesitancy, straining, terminal dribble, perceived frequency, urgency, urgency with fear of leaking, urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), stress urinary incontinence (SUI), leak for no reason, nocturnal enuresis, leak during sexual activity, incomplete emptying, and post‐micturition dribble. 8 IPSS 10 and OAB‐V8 questionnaires, 11 validated in Portuguese, were included in the questionnaire. Participants rated how often they experienced individual LUTS during the previous month (≥ 1 voiding, storage, or post‐micturition symptom [≥ 2 episodes for nocturia]), using a Likert scale: none (score 0), less than 1 in 5 times (score 1), less than half the time (score 2), about half the time (score 3), more than half the time (score 4), or almost always (score 5). The bother associated with LUTS was also assessed (Likert scale: not at all [score 0], a little bit [score 1], somewhat [score 2], quite a bit [score 3], a great deal [score 4], or a very great deal [score 5]). Questions asked during the telephone survey regarding the impact of LUTS on QoL (IPSS question 8), treatment seeking, treatment, treatment satisfaction, and treatment discontinuation are shown in Table 1. Similarly to the EpiLUTS study, two definitions were used for the presence of LUTS: definition 1 (symptoms occurring less than half the time or more) and definition 2 (symptoms occurring half the time or more) (Table S1). 9 As with the EpiLUTS study, the results presented here focused on the primary LUTS subgroup definition 2, unless otherwise specified.

### Seminal vesicle urinary reflux after TURP mimicking vesicular invasion from prostate cancer on 18F-choline PET / CT [^116Hypu1]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Seminal vesicles are paired secretory glands located posterior to the bladder in men that produce seminal fluid to maintain sperm. Seminal vesicle reflux into the prostatic ducts may be associated with prostatitis in older patients or may represent a very rare complication of transurethral prostate resection in patients with prostatic cancer. This condition is frequently accidentally diagnosed on excretory urography and/or retrograde urethrogram. Clinical presentation includes pain, fever, recurrent epididymitis-prostatitis, and post void dribbling.

### Do women with urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse receive optimal first-line treatment? [^114EDo8x]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Of the 11 (10.8%) who had previously been operated for either UI or POP, six had not been taught PFMT with a physiotherapist. Two were not able to stop the dribbling and one did not know if she was able to stop the dribble.

Table 3 presents reasons for not having done PFMT before the current visit to the hospital (n = 25, 24.5%). The most frequent responses were not knowing how to perform PFMT and not being motivated.

Table 3
Reasons for not doing PFMT*. N = 25

Numbers and percentages (%)

* Multiple responses allowed

On the question of frequency of PFMT (including both evaluation, individual and group training) by health personnel 7.8% reported one time, 12.7% 2–3 times, 10.8% 4–5 times, 4.9% 6–8 times, and 15.6% 8–12 times or more. Duration of the PFMT period varied from one week (5.9%) to > 6 months (7.8%). Contractions per set varied between 1–2 (4.9%) and > 20 (7.8%). Forty-two percent reported to have done 8–12 contractions per set. Number of sets per day varied between one set per day (44.1%) and > 3 sets per day (2.9%). Mean holding time of each PFM contraction was 8.8 s (SD 6.7).

There was no statistically significant difference in age, BMI, level of education, parity, time since last birth, and type of PDF between women who had been or not been treated conservatively before the present investigation at the tertiary hospital.

### Comparison of lower urinary tract symptoms between women with detrusor overactivity and impaired contractility, and detrusor overactivity and preserved contractility [^116j7uGr]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared symptoms in women with detrusor overactivity with impaired contractility and women with detrusor overactivity who had preserved contractility.

Materials and Methods

The study included 359 consecutive women with detrusor overactivity who underwent multichannel urodynamics at our department between 2009 and 2011. The women were divided into 2 groups, including 151 (42%) with detrusor overactivity and impaired contractility, and 208 (58%) with detrusor overactivity and preserved contractility. We compared the 2 groups.

Results

Women with detrusor overactivity and impaired contractility were older (mean ± SD age 73.2 ± 17.3 vs 54.1 ± 20.7 years) with a higher frequency of diabetes mellitus (49% vs 31%, each p < 0.001). The prevalence of previous urinary retention and recurrent cystitis was significantly higher in women with impaired contractility (7% vs 1%, p < 0.01 and 22% vs 7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Mean post-void residual urine was greater in the group with impaired contractility (89 ± 42 vs 21 ± 18 ml) and the mean maximal flow rate was lower (11 ± 6 vs 23 ± 5 mL per second, each p < 0.001). The frequency of storage symptoms was similar in the 2 groups. However, voiding symptoms were more common in women with impaired contractility, including a slow stream in 69% vs 42%, an intermittent stream in 72% vs 26%, hesitancy in 35% vs 22%, straining in 84% vs 26%, terminal dribbling in 73% vs 42% and incomplete emptying in 71% vs 49% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Women with detrusor overactivity and impaired contractility are older than women with detrusor overactivity and preserved detrusor contractility.

### Long-term urethral function measured by uroflowmetry after hypospadias surgery: comparison with an age matched control [^116jTQvU]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Long-term outcomes of hypospadias surgery, particularly urinary function, have not been examined thoroughly. Uroflowmetry can be used to evaluate long-term functional outcomes by assessing flow shape and the rate of micturition. We assessed urethral function using uroflowmetry in adolescents after undergoing hypospadias repair in infancy and compared this with age matched controls.

Materials and Methods

After human research ethics committee approval (HREC 28111A), 17 boys 13 to 15 years old with no history of urological or neurological disorders underwent uroflowmetry (65 separate voids) to determine standard values for boys of this age. Then 60 boys age 13 to 15 years who had undergone treatment for hypospadias in early infancy were seen for long-term followup and underwent uroflow assessment.

Results

Standard urinary flow rates were established in the 13 to 15-year-old control group and represented on a nomogram. In the boys who underwent hypospadias surgery the urine flow rates were significantly lower compared to the control nomogram (p < 0.0001), with half the patients having uroflow rates below 1 SD from the control mean but without symptoms. Boys with significant preoperative chordee were more likely to have poorer urinary flow (p < 0.04). A poor urinary flow rate also was significantly associated with post-void residual bladder volume (p < 0.03). There was no correlation with original meatal location, number of operations, presence of postoperative complications, current anatomy and lower urinary tract symptoms (eg post-void dribble, hesitancy, incontinence).

Conclusions

At long-term followup after hypospadias surgery urinary flow rates were significantly lower compared to age matched controls but still fell within the normal range. In the hypospadias cohort there was no significant association with lower urinary tract symptoms and poor urinary flow. Detection of poor urinary flow may indicate incomplete bladder emptying. The presence of severe chordee preoperatively is a significant risk factor for poor urinary flow rates on long-term followup.

### Terminal dribbling in male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: relationship with international prostate symptom score and with intravesical prostatic protrusion [^116dxZcA]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Terminal dribbling is one of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that has not been widely studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between terminal dribbling (TD) and other parameters such as International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP).

Methods

Medical records of male patients with LUTS aged 40 years and older were prospectively collected. Data regarding TD defined by the International Continence Society standardization subcommittee, IPSS, prostate-specific antigen, total prostate volume, and IPP on transrectal ultrasonography were obtained. TD was confirmed by the subsequent uroflowmetry (uroflowmetry-confirmed TD). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the parameters affecting TD and uroflowmetry-confirmed TD.

Results

Among the 578 men, 226 patients (39.1%) complained of TD and 157 patients (27.2%) had objective findings of TD on uroflowmetry. In the logistic regression analysis, IPSS voiding subscore were correlated with TD (Odds ratio 1.06). In addition, IPP was the only significant risk factor for uroflowmetry-confirmed TD (Odds ratio 2.83). Each question of IPSS is not correlated with TD or uroflowmetry-confirmed TD.

Conclusions

While the symptom of TD is well correlated with IPSS voiding subscore, objective evidence of TD on uroflowmetry had strong correlation with IPP. TD should be investigated further to reveal its clinical impact and guide a proper management.

* Pearson chi-square test

The DVISS score in the NMNE group was 15 (7–24), while in the MNE group it was found to be 7 (2–12). A statistically significant difference was detected in DVISS values between the MNE and NMNE groups (p < 0.001). In the NMNE group, there was no significant difference between genders for DVISS values. There were 10 patients who were MNE with a DVISS score of ≥ 9. Among them, 8 patients had a DVISS score of 9, 1 patient had a DVISS score of 11, and only 1 patient had a DVISS score of 12. None of the patients exhibited lower urinary symptom findings. However, the patients were children who experienced incontinence every night (5 points) and wet the bed (4 points). The quality of life score was 3 points, indicating serious adverse effects on the patients (Online Appendix A).

In the NMNE group, the median number of, lower urinary tract symptoms was 2 (1–6), with the most common symptom being daytime urinary incontinence, occurring in 316 (87.1%) of the cases. Other daytime symptoms included post-void dribbling (47.9%), urgency (38.6%), increased voiding frequency (36.9%), constipation (24.5%), holding maneuvers (16.2%), and decreased voiding frequency (9.9%). Symptoms such as straining (n = 6%1.6), interrupted flow (n = 8%2.2), and sensation of incomplete emptying(n = 20%5.5) were rarer among the patients queried. In the monosymptomatic group, the rate of constipation was observed to be 7.9%, while in the NMNE group it was 24.5% (p < 0.001).

A statistically significant difference was observed between the MNE and NMNE groups in terms of bladder capacity and post-void residual volume. The NMNE group had a significantly lower bladder capacity and higher PMR values compared to the MNE group (p = 0.006).(Table 1).

Nocturnal polyuria was detected in 9.8% of MNE patients and none of NMNE patients.

The efficacy of CARDURA was evaluated extensively in over 900 patients with BPH in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. CARDURA treatment was superior to placebo in improving patient symptoms and urinary flow rate. Significant relief with CARDURA was seen as early as one week into the treatment regimen, with CARDURA-treated patients (N = 173) showing a significant (p < 0.01) increase in maximum flow rate of 0.8 mL/sec compared to a decrease of 0.5 mL/sec in the placebo group (N = 41). In long-term studies, improvement was maintained for up to 2 years of treatment. In 66–71% of patients, improvements above baseline were seen in both symptoms and maximum urinary flow rate.

In three placebo-controlled studies of 14–16 weeks' duration, obstructive symptoms (hesitation, intermittency, dribbling, weak urinary stream, incomplete emptying of the bladder) and irritative symptoms (nocturia, daytime frequency, urgency, burning) of BPH were evaluated at each visit by patient-assessed symptom questionnaires. The bothersomeness of symptoms was measured with a modified Boyarsky questionnaire. Symptom severity/frequency was assessed using a modified Boyarsky questionnaire or an AUA-based questionnaire. Uroflowmetric evaluations were performed at times of peak (2–6 hours post-dose) and/or trough (24 hours post-dose) plasma concentrations of CARDURA.

### Nontransecting anastomotic repair in urethral reconstruction: surgical and functional outcomes [^115A5RBE]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the surgical and functional outcomes, and the effect of the learning curve of nontransecting anastomotic repair for short bulbar and posterior urethral strictures.

Materials and Methods

A total of 75 patients were treated with nontransecting anastomotic repair for short bulbar strictures in 55 and for posterior strictures in 20. Surgical morbidity was scored using the Clavien-Dindo classification at 3 months. Sexual function was measured using SHIM (Sexual Health Inventory for Men) scoring preoperatively and postoperatively. Post-void dribbling before and after nontransecting anastomotic repair was also determined. To evaluate the learning curve outcomes were evaluated in patients 1 to 25, 26 to 50 and 51 to 75.

Results

Median followup was 30 months. Stricture recurred in 6 patients (8%), all diagnosed within 7 months after nontransecting anastomotic repair. Median operative time was 95 minutes and median hospital stay was 2 days. In 61 patients (81.3%) no surgical morbidity was recorded. Five (6.7%), 6 (8%) and 3 patients (4%) experienced a grade 1, 2 and 3b complication, respectively. Seven of 32 (21.9%) and 2 of 42 evaluable patients (4.7%) reported de novo erectile dysfunction and post-void dribbling, respectively, 3 months after nontransecting anastomotic repair. No difference in outcomes was observed among the 3 patient groups.

Conclusions

Nontransecting anastomotic repair appears to be safe without a substantial learning curve effect. Patient counseling about possible surgical complications and transient erectile dysfunction is important.

### Botulinum toxin urethral sphincter injection to restore bladder emptying in men and women with voiding dysfunction [^111DSFTh]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Botulinum toxin injection into the external urinary sphincter in spinal cord injured men with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia has been reported. We expand the clinical use of botulinum toxin for a variety of bladder outlet obstructions and to decrease outlet resistance in patients with acontractile detrusor but who wish to void by the Valsalva maneuver.

Materials and Methods

Prospective treatment was performed for voiding dysfunction in 8 men and 13 women 34 to 74 years old. The reasons for voiding dysfunction included neurogenic detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 12 cases, pelvic floor spasticity in 8 and acontractile detrusor in 1 patient with multiple sclerosis who wished to void by the Valsalva maneuver. Using a rigid cystoscope and a collagen injection needle, a total of 80 to 100 units of botulinum A toxin (Botox) were injected into the external sphincter at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 o'clock positions.

Results

Preoperatively 19 of 21 patients were on indwelling or intermittent catheterization. After botulinum A injection all but 1 patient were able to void without catheterization. No acute complications, such as general paralysis or respiratory depression, occurred and none of the patients had dribbling or stress urinary incontinence. Postoperative post-void residual decreased by 71% and voiding pressures decreased on average 38%. Of the 21 patients 14 (67%) reported significant subjective improvement in voiding. Followup ranges from 3 to 16 months, with a maximum of 3 botulinum A injections in some patients.

Conclusions

Urethral sphincter botulinum injection should be considered for complex voiding dysfunction. Encouraging improvement without complications were seen in most of our patients. We have expanded the use of botulinum toxin to treat pelvic floor spasticity and also women.

### A single-center retrospective cohort study comparing complex and simple female urethral diverticulum classified based on magnetic resonance imaging features [^117EToQr]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To explore a more reasonable classification method for the evaluation and surgical planning for the management of female urethral diverticulum (UD).

Methods

This retrospective study included 45 female patients who underwent urethral diverticular excision between January 2018 and December 2023. Patient details and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected. The diverticula were classified as complex (cUD) if MRI demonstrated > 75% circumferential involvement of the urethra on axial imaging. All other UD were classified as simple (sUD). We performed complete diverticulectomy for sUD and partial excision for cUD. The presenting symptoms, physical examination findings, radiologic studies, operative findings, and post-operative results were compared between the complex and simple cohorts.

Results

The mean age was 45.1 years (range: 25–82 years). The cUD and sUD groups contained 25 (56%) and 20 (44%) patients, respectively. Patients with cUD were more likely to demonstrate voiding symptoms (76% vs 40%, P = 0.031) and post-voiding dribbling (52% vs 15%, P = 0.013) than patients with sUD. The largest vertical diameters in the cUD and sUD groups were 2.52 ± 0.89 and 1.89 ± 0.89 cm, respectively (P = 0.061). The post-operative outcomes were similar between the sUD and cUD groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of post-operative complications between the two groups.

Conclusion

Classification based on the angle of the diverticulum encircling the urethra on MRI can be used for the evaluation and surgical planning of female UD. The selection of an appropriate surgical approach is safe and efficacious for treating female UD and may reduce surgery-associated difficulties and complications.

### Urethral stricture disease guideline amendment (2023) [^11196rzN]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Urethral stricture disease — graft choice for urethroplasty: Surgeons should use oral mucosa as the first choice when using grafts for urethroplasty. (Expert Opinion) Surgeons may use either buccal or lingual mucosal grafts as equivalent alternatives. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Oral mucosa is the preferred graft for substitution urethroplasty, and patient satisfaction is higher for oral mucosa due to less post-void dribbling and penile skin problems. Oral mucosa may be harvested from the inner cheeks (buccal), which provide the largest graft area, the undersurface of the tongue (lingual), or the inner lower lip (labial). Lingual mucosa is thinner than buccal mucosa, and thus may provide an advantage in reconstructive procedures of the distal urethra and meatus by causing less restriction of the urethral lumen, and harvest of buccal mucosa from the inner cheek results in fewer complications and better outcomes as compared to a lower lip donor site.

### Pathological post-obstructive diuresis following obstructive uropathy due to constipation in the post-partum period: a case report [^115ZgQbZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The terms postnatal period and postpartum period are interchangeably used to refer to the first 6 weeks (42 days) following childbirth and is further subdivided as immediate (first 24 h), early (day 2 – day 7) and late (day 8 – day 42) phases of the postpartum period. During this time, physiological changes of pregnancy are slowly reverting to the pre-pregnancy state. This period is riddled with a myriad of maternal illnesses. While most of these conditions may present during the first 1–2 weeks, among the scores of postpartum morbidities such as postpartum infection, anemia, perineal tears, urinary tract infection, and depression, are numerous and complex pathologies with onset, severity and duration of illness varying vastly.

Early detection and adequate and timely management are crucial in these conditions to reduce the risk of developing acute life-threatening conditions that may fall into obstetric near-miss category as well as serious long term sequalae which may lead to lifelong co-morbidities.

Constipation during the postpartum period is not an uncommon disorder. It is defined as low frequency and difficulty in passing stools which can be diagnosed following the criteria of less than 3 bowel movements a week, hard stools and/or difficulty in passing stools. Causing symptoms such as pain or discomfort on defecation, straining, hard lumpy stools, and a sense of incomplete bowel evacuation, constipation can be severe and may affect the quality of life of the woman significantly while also diverging her attention from the newborn who needs constant care.

While obstructive uropathy has been described as a complication of chronic constipation across literature, it is rare to find constipation leading to obstructive uropathy outside of the extremes of age. However, constipation following delivery, leading to obstructive uropathy and severe post obstructive diuresis during the postpartum period is an extremely rare set of sequalae. It's rarity if such that there are no cases of development of pathological POD upon relieving the constipation during pregnancy or in the postpartum period reported in the literature. This unreported consequence of constipation in pregnancy warrants the attention of the obstetrician not only to enlighten him/her regarding this interesting and complex phenomenon in the context of pregnancy but also to warn him/her to have a high degree of suspicion to diagnose and to take careful measures and precautions when dealing with such clinical situations such as lowering threshold for intervention considering the altered physiology of post-partum period and early involvement of the nephrology team.

### Repeatability of post-void residual urine ≥ 100 mL in urogynaecologic patients [^113AFYD6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Post-void residual urine (PVR) is a key variable in the assessment of the emptying function of the lower urinary tract and is often used as an outcome measure after treatment. Increased PVR can lead to further investigation and treatment, or cancellation of planned incontinence surgery. In a prospective study, we aimed to assess the repeatability of the finding of PVR ≥ 100 mL in urogynaecologic patients.

Methods

Of 396 women with urogynaecologic complaints visiting our outpatient clinic, 297 had PVR measured after a micturition in full privacy preceded by normal desire to void. Women with PVR ≥ 100 mL were offered a second and eventually a third PVR measurement after a subsequent micturition. A Verathon Bladder Scanner BV 9400 was used to measure PVR immediately after micturition.

Results

The prevalence of PVR ≥ 100 was 14%, which declined to 1.3% on repeated measurements. Voided volumes did not vary between voids.

Conclusions

One PVR measurement ≥ 100 mL is unreliable and needs repetition to confirm consistency.
