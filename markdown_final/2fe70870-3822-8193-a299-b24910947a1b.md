## Question

There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many pieces of oranges will be sold given 10 bags with 30 oranges each, 50 rotten oranges, and 30 oranges reserved for juice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of oranges. Then, I should subtract the rotten ones. Next, I will subtract the oranges reserved for juice. Finally, I will verify the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the total number of oranges. 10 bags times 30 oranges per bag equals 300 oranges total, so the starting inventory is 300 pieces.

> Wait, let me verify the subtraction of rotten fruit. 50 oranges are rotten, so the number of sellable oranges before any reservations is 300 minus 50, which equals 250 oranges.

> I need to check the next subtraction carefully. Thirty oranges are being kept for making orange juice, so I should subtract those from the 250 sellable oranges, giving 250 minus 30 equals 220 oranges available for sale.

> Hold on, I should verify the final figure. Total oranges 300, minus 50 rotten, minus 30 for juice, leaves 220 oranges to be sold, which aligns with the stepwise calculation above.

> Final answer: 220 pieces of oranges will be sold.

---

The total number of oranges is 10 bags × 30 oranges = **300 oranges**. After removing 50 rotten oranges, **250 good oranges remain**. Of these, 30 are reserved for juice, so **220 oranges will be sold**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Total oranges | 10 bags × 30 oranges | 300 oranges |
| 2 | Subtract rotten oranges | 300 − 50 | 250 good oranges |
| 3 | Subtract oranges for juice | 250 − 30 | 220 oranges for sale |

---

Therefore, **220 oranges will be sold**.

### Exactly which synephrine alkaloids does citrus aurantium (bitter orange) contain? [^113ZT47G]. International Journal of Obesity (2005). Low credibility.

Following the withdrawal of ephedrine from the dietary supplement marketplace sales of products containing Citrus aurantium (CA) (bitter orange) for weight loss are believed to have increased dramatically. CA contains a number of constituents speculated to lead to weight loss, of which the most frequently cited constituent is synephrine. Concerns have been raised about the safety of products containing synephrine. To develop an adequate basis for clinical and public health recommendations, it is necessary to understand the nature of the synephrine alkaloids in CA. There are six possible isomers of synephrine (para, meta, ortho; and for each a d or l form). Some authors have stated that CA contains only p-synephrine, whereas other authors have stated that CA contains m-synephrine. This is an important distinction because the two molecules have different pharmacologic properties, which may differentially affect safety and efficacy. We are unable to identify published data that explicitly show whether CA contains p-synephrine, m-synephrine, or both. In this brief report, we show that at least one product purportedly containing synephrine alkaloids from CA contains both p-synephrine and m-synephrine. We believe this justifies further investigation into which synephrine alkaloids are present in CA and products purportedly containing synephrine alkaloids from CA and the relative quantities of each of the different isomers.

### The extent and patterns of usage of agent orange and other herbicides in Vietnam [^116Xmzxa]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Herbicides including Agent Orange were sprayed by United States forces for military purposes during the Vietnam War (1961–1971) at a rate more than an order of magnitude greater than for similar domestic weed control. In 1974, the US National Academy of Sciences published estimates of the extent and distribution of herbicides sprayed. Here we present revised estimates, developed using more-complete data. The spray inventory is expanded by more than seven million litres, in particular with heavily dioxin-contaminated herbicides. Estimates for the amount of dioxin sprayed are almost doubled. Hamlet census data reveal that millions of Vietnamese were likely to have been sprayed upon directly. Our identification of specific military herbicide targets has led to a more coherent understanding of spraying. Common errors in earlier interpretations of the spray data are also discussed.

### High orange juice consumption with or in-between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects [^116WEBwy]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Thirteen women and thirteen men aged 20–33 years (24.7 ± 3.2 years) and with a BMI between 19.1–33.3 kg/m² (23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m²) participated in this trial. According to WHO criteria five subjects were overweight and one participant was obese. The REE and therefore the intake of orange juice did not differ between both interventions (REE WM: 1662 ± 270 kcal/d vs. BM: 1663 ± 275 kcal/d; orange juice WM: 1277 ± 221 mL/d vs. BM: 1278 ± 224 mL/d; all p > 0.05). The amount of sugars provided by the orange juice was 112.3 ± 19.4 g/d in WM-intervention and 112.5 ± 19.7 g/d in BM-intervention (difference not significant). During the entire BM-intervention, participants consumed 7697 ± 1349 kcal from orange juice which is equivalent to a theoretical gain in FM of 855 ± 150 g assuming an energy content of 9000 kcal/kg FM. Physical activity did not differ between both interventions (10,118 ± 3128 steps/d in WM vs. 10,528 ± 3438 steps/d in BM).

### Modeling resource consumption in the US air transportation system via minimum-cost percolation [^114GQEXR]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Validation of the framework

We first use available data concerning the actual tickets sold by airline companies in the second quarter of year 2023 as the input demand for the MCP model, see Methods for details. This type of data represents supply but has been used before as a proxy for demand. Figure 2 summarizes the results for the MCP model given this "supplied" demand where the cost function is taken to be the length of the itineraries. It appears that the infrastructure is able to supply nearly all demanded itineraries up to a point, but after that, a sharp transition occurs, both in the fraction of supplied demand (Fig. 2 a]) and in the fraction of remaining seats (Fig. 2 b). Further, this result is insensitive to the level of cooperation enabled in the FCN; this holds also for other cost functions (Figs. S7 and S8), and for FCNs representing different daily schedules (Figs. S9 and S10).

Fig. 2
Validation of the minimum-cost-percolation (MCP) model.

We consider all flights operated between pairs of airports in the contiguous United States on April 18, 2023 and estimate demand using data about sold tickets in the second quarter of April 2023. Results are valid for the MCP model where the cost of an itinerary is given by its length. We consider flight-connection networks under the scenarios of no cooperation (blue solid line), partial cooperation (orange dashed line) and full cooperation (purple dotted line). The minimum gap between connecting flights is δ = 30 min if the flights are operated by the same carrier/alliance, and ϵ = 60 min if operated by different carriers/alliances. Whenever possible, we compare results of the MCP model with real data (black dashed-dotted line). a Fraction of supplied itineraries and b fraction of remaining seats as functions of the raw number of demanded itineraries. The vertical lines denote the estimated number of daily served passengers in April 2023. c Fraction of supplied itineraries composed of flights with given number of operating carriers. The inset displays the fraction of supplied itineraries composed by a given number of connecting flights. d Distribution of the length (measured in km) of the supplied itineraries.

### Exposure to agent orange and hepatocellular carcinoma among US military personnel [^112rYKd8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLAHCS) with a waiver of informed consent because of the retrospective design.

Data Source

The US VHA is comprised of 168 Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Centers across the US and its territories and is the largest integrated, nationwide health care system in the US. The VHA contains an integrated network of electronic health data that can be accessed by approved researchers. For this study, we used the VA Informatics and Computer Infrastructure (VINCI) platform to extract demographics, clinical laboratory tests, medical comorbidities, alcohol use questionnaires and clinical outcomes data from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), which is the national data repository for VA electronic health records.

Study Cohort

To capture veterans who primarily obtained their care within the VHA, we selected veterans who had at least 2 outpatient visits that were separated by at least 6 months within a window of 3 years. From this group, we identified Vietnam veterans using their combat service location with the combat start date between the years January 1, 1966, and December 31, 1975. We excluded women (more than 99% of veterans deployed to Vietnam were males) and those who were younger than age 18 years at the time of deployment. Veterans were then followed up with from 2000 to 2019. The year 2000 was selected as the starting window because October 1999 was the earliest time when CDW data became available (eFigure in Supplement 1).

### Exposure to agent orange and hepatocellular carcinoma among US military personnel [^111Eb1i8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

We found that self-reported race and ethnicity were significantly associated with incident HCC. Specifically, patients who self-identified as Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black were more likely to develop HCC, compared with White individuals, even after adjusting for key clinical confounders. These findings suggest that other nonmeasured variables could contribute to these disparities. Several studies have described that Black individuals are at higher risk for HCC-related death, independently of tumor stage. However, few studies have addressed this in the VHA. Our findings support that even within the VHA, where patients have access to health care, racial and ethnic disparities persist. Small studies have proposed that mental health and substance use may drive these disparities; however, larger studies are needed to understand these observations.

We found that a minority of veterans underwent LT. While LT is a life-saving measure for patients with advanced liver disease, it remains limited resource due to the scarcity of organs and a complex evaluation process that affects candidates every level of the evaluation, including referral, eligibility and listing, especially in veterans who have been shown to disproportionally receive fewer LTs. Therefore, HCC risk modification of clinical factors is even more imperative in veterans to prevent HCC.

### High orange juice consumption with or in-between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects [^115iNm4Y]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Intervention with orange juice

The orange juice was 100% juice with pulp, containing 43 kcal/100 mL and 8.9 g sugar (3.2 g sucrose, 2.7 g glucose and 3.0 g fructose)/100 mL according to the manufacturer and as verified by own analyses. The amount of orange juice provided was defined as 20% of individual energy requirement. Energy requirement was assessed by multiplying resting energy expenditure (REE, predicted according to) by physical activity level (PAL). Subjects were interviewed about their habitual daily activity and an individual PAL between 1.4 (low active) and 1.8 (active) was estimated. The individual amount of orange juice was calculated at the beginning of each intervention phase to meet 20% of daily energy requirement. The amount of orange juice per serving was weighted in bottles and the filling line was marked. For each serving, subjects refilled the bottles up to the marking. All orange juice was provided by the Institute of Nutritional Medicine.

### High orange juice consumption with or in-between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects [^112BtNqA]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In line with our hypothesis, the present study demonstrates that the impact of orange juice consumption on energy balance and metabolic risk depends on timing of juice intake in relation to meals. When compared with in-between meal consumption, intake of orange juice together with breakfast, lunch and dinner prevented a positive energy balance and even lead to a loss of body fat mass when no snacks were consumed in-between meals (Table 1). The effect of orange juice consumption on risk of overweight and obesity is controversial with some studies showing a higher risk. whereas others reported no effect – or even found a lower body weight in regular fruit juice consumers compared to people with no fruit juice intake. Associations between beverage intake and weight status observed in epidemiological studies are, however, not necessarily causal. Lifestyle behavior may differ between different types of beverage consumers and therefore act as an important confounder. Accordingly, 100% orange juice consumption was found to be associated with better diet quality, improved nutrient adequacy, and improved biomarkers of health in adults. In contrast, intake of SSB was associated with a less healthy dietand high soft drink consumers also engaged in less physical activity than low soft drink consumers.

Similar to the above mentioned controversial findings of cross-sectional and observational data, evidence from intervention studies on orange juice and weight gain is inconclusive. A previous study has shown that consumption of 250 mL orange juice per day for a period of 12 weeks did not adversely affect body weight or insulin sensitivity. This was however also true for the control group who consumed an energy and sugars-matched orange-flavored drink. In another dietary intervention trial, body weight and leptin levels decreased in overweight and obese subjects after consumption of 2 × 250 mL orange juice per day for a period of 12 weeks. However, participants received nutritional advice to aid them in balancing out the additional calories that they were ingesting from orange juice intake. Unfortunately, it was not reported whether the subjects drank the orange juice with or in-between meals. One important difference between SSB and fruit juices is that juice is usually not consumed as a thirst quencher. Timing of consumption, i.e. with or in-between meals may therefore also be different (e.g. drinking orange juice as part of a breakfast). Unlike numerous other studies, one observational study in Canadian children specifically asked for SSB consumption in-between meals and found that this intake pattern more than doubles the odds of being overweight.

Overall Mortality

Eight studies on overall mortality were identified. Highest mortality risk was linked to warzone stress and probable PTSD. Agent Orange exposure increased risk of mortality from respiratory diseases and malignancies, and Operation Ranch Hand Veterans with Agent Orange exposure had increased mortality from cardiovascular causes. Vietnam Veterans consuming > 14 drinks per week faced increased mortality risk. Trauma-related mortality rates were higher in women Vietnam Veterans than non-Vietnam women Veterans, while religious and social engagement were protective factors.

Sunday Start

When taking AVERI, the first orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first orange "active" tablet is taken on that day. If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product. Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One orange "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one blue "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and an orange "active" tablet is taken the next day (Sunday). When initiating a Sunday start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.

The use of AVERI for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers.) If the patient starts on AVERI postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until an orange "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) orange "active" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the orange "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) orange "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) orange "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) orange "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) orange "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) orange "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more orange "active" tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one orange "active" tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

### Acute methamphetamine and alcohol usage alters gaze behaviour during driving: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112rq3TC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Biological sampling

Venous whole blood (5 mL) was drawn using a vacuum tube from a cannula placed in the cubital fossa vein or via venepuncture technique of the non-dominant arm at 30 min, 1 h, and finally at ~3 h post-treatment. Where cannulation was used, the line was first flushed with 10 mL 0.9% NaCl to avoid specimen contamination. Discard blood volume (5 mL) was drawn before each collection to prevent contamination with 0.9% NaCl solution. Once the sample was taken, the line was again flushed with 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Whole blood samples were immediately stored at −80°C.

Treatments

Methamphetamine

The active treatment was 0.42 mg/kg methamphetamine (purity 99.8 ± 1.3%). Weighted doses were rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g. weight of 74 kg × 0.42 mg = 31.08 mg, provided 30 mg). An upper weight limit of 100 kg was applied to ensure that concentrations of methamphetamine and alcohol did not exceed 40 mg (rounded methamphetamine dose). Australian Measurement Institute provided raw product (batch numbers 14-D-12 and 19-D-01) and compounded into 5, 10 and 20 mg size #00 opaque capsules with microcrystalline cellulose filler. Identical matched placebo capsules comprised microcrystalline cellulose only.

Alcohol

The beverage was vodka (40% alcohol, Absolut brand) measured according to each participant's body weight for a target blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.04% (0.38 g alcohol/kg body weight) mixed with 300 mL orange juice. The unit of measure used in this study is grams of alcohol per 210 L of breath (g/210 L) which is equivalent to 0.04% BAC at g/100 mL of blood, measured to a precision of 0.001%. The maximum weight of participants enrolled was capped at 100 kg (~90.25 mL of Vodka per 300 mL beverage) to (a) mask the presence of Vodka and (b) not exceed three standard drinks in any one beverage. The placebo condition consisted of orange juice with ~3 mL of vodka floated on top for masking. Breathalyser readings were taken using a Lion Alcolmeter SD400PA that was calibrated quarterly by the Road Policing Division, Victoria Police.

Before study commencement, orange juice (supplied by the Florida Department of Citrus) and hesperidin supplement (a kind gift from Miguel Aragüés, Alicante, Spain) were analyzed for hesperidin, narirutin, and vitamin C content by using HPLC-diode array detection (typical chromatograms are shown in Supplemental Figure 1). A dose of 320 mg hesperidin, chosen on the basis of vascular efficacy and achievable dietary intakes, was provided by 767 mL orange juice (Table 1) that was sourced from a single batch and stored at −20°C. The hesperidin supplement intervention was matched in hesperidin content, whereas all interventions (i.e. orange juice, hesperidin supplement, and control) were matched for vitamin C, sugars, and fluid volume by using a low-nitrate/nitrite bottled water, given the potential vasoactive properties of nitrate/nitrite-containing products (Table 1). At each experimental period, intervention drinks (orange juice or control) were prepared by independent scientists (following a computer-generated, random-sequence allocation, held by an independent scientist) and served in opaque drinking vessels. Scientists conducting the research and analyzing the data remained blinded throughout the study, whereas participants were blinded to the hesperidin supplement but not the orange juice intervention because of unavoidable differences in taste. Flavanone contents of the orange juice and hesperidin supplement were stable over the course of the study (pre- and poststudy CV = 5.0%).

### High orange juice consumption with or in-between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects [^111CUxjF]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Contrary to previous interventions, we used a very high amount of orange juice (about 1.28 L/d) in order to achieve a measureable impact on energy balance within the short time frame. Compared with SSB, orange juice is usually consumed in smaller amounts of only 7.8 L per capita per year (equivalent to 21 mL per day,) in Germany. This may partly explain the lack of association between orange juice consumption and body weight in some studies. We have chosen an amount of orange juice that closely resembles the habitual intake of soft drinks in young German adults. The highest amounts are consumed by young 18–29 year old men with about 900 mL of SSB and fruit juices per day. This equals a habitual intake of sugar of about 96 g/d from SSB and fruit juice, being comparable to the consumed amount of sugar from orange juice in the present study. During BM-intervention, participants in the present study consumed a total of 7697 ± 1349 kcal from orange juice. Without compensation during the following meals, this would lead to a positive energy balance and equals a theoretical gain in FM of 855 ± 150 g. Noteworthy; participants of the present study were not instructed to adapt their meals to compensate for the additionally consumed orange juice. The actual gain in FM of 1.02 ± 1.81 kg during BM-intervention confirmed this lack of caloric compensation during subsequent meals when orange juice is consumed as a snack in-between meals.

In-between meals, insulin levels decrease, and activate lipolysis that may also be important for metabolic regulation. This is supported by protocols comparing low and high meal frequencies at the same energy intake. A lower meal frequency was associated with lower liver fat during hypocaloricas well as hypercaloric diets. In line with metabolic improvement and a suspected loss in liver fat, serum GGT decreased with loss in FM after WM-intervention (Table 1). GGT is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors and shows a dose-response relationship with incident diabetes, even within its normal range.

Contrary to the finding of Meng et al. 2017, in the present study the incremental glucose area under the curve did not differ and MAGE-Index was higher with WM-intervention compared to BM-intervention. Hence we may deduce that postprandial glycemia is not attenuated by a concurrent meal when sugar is consumed in a liquid form that quickly passes the stomach into the intestine. This is in line with no significant differences in fructosamine levels between the interventions (Table 1).

### Acute glycaemic response of orange juice consumption with breakfast in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a randomized cross-over trial [^115foX4v]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and show clear differential metabolic responses compared with 100% fruit juice, which is unsweetened by law. This study investigated whether the postprandial glycaemic response following a standardized breakfast differed when accompanied by 100% orange juice, equivalent whole orange, or a sugar-sweetened control beverage in individuals with well-controlled T2DM.

Subjects/Methods

Fifteen individuals with T2DM (60 ± 6y; BMI 28.7 ± 5.0kg/m², HbA1C 49 ± 3mmol/mol (6.6 ± 0.3%)) participated in this randomized cross-over trial. They consumed a standardized breakfast served with either 250mL of 100% orange juice, a sugar-sweetened orange-flavoured beverage or whole orange pieces with identical total sugar content. Postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were checked during 4h.

Results

Following a single intake, no significant differences were found in acute glucose or insulin responses (expressed as total or incremental area under the curve or peak values; p treatment > 0.05, respectively) when either whole orange pieces, orange juice or a sugar-sweetened control beverage were consumed with a standard high carbohydrate meal. Capillary glucose responses did not differ between conditions (p treatment > 0.05).

Conclusion

Acute glycaemic control in individuals with well-controlled T2DM is not significantly influenced by serving orange juice, whole orange pieces or a sugar-sweetened beverage with a standard high-carbohydrate meal.

### Fruit juice in infants, children, and adolescents: current recommendations [^11268Y3Q]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Dietary Guidelines for Americans — fruit and juice intake targets state that children consuming approximately 1000 kcal/day (depending on size, 1–4 years old) should have ~1 cup of fruit per day, whereas those consuming approximately 2000 kcal/day (depending on size, 10–18 years old) should consume ~2 cups of fruit per day. Although whole fruit is to be encouraged, up to half of the servings can be provided in the form of 100% fruit juice (not fruit drinks). A 6-ounce glass of fruit juice equals 1 fruit serving. Fruit juice offers no nutritional advantage over whole fruit, lacks the fiber of whole fruit, can be consumed more quickly kilocalorie for kilocalorie, and reliance on fruit juice instead of whole fruit to provide the recommended daily intake of fruit does not promote eating behaviors associated with the consumption of whole fruit. Although recent studies suggest that pure orange juice consumption has health benefits in adults, further research is needed to determine whether children and adolescents may derive similar benefits.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Juleber) [^112wgkd3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

SUNDAY START

When taking JULEBERTM, the first orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first orange "active" tablet is taken on that day. If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product. Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One orange "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one white "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and an orange "active" tablet is taken the next day (Sunday). When initiating a Sunday start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.

The use of JULEBERTMfor contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS Nursing Mothers .) If the patient starts on JULEBERTMpostpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until an orange "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) orange active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the orange "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) orange "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) orange "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) orange "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) orange "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) orange "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more orange "active" tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one orange "active" tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

### Fortification of orange juice with vitamin D (2) or vitamin D (3) is as effective as an oral supplement in maintaining vitamin D status in adults [^111p7Rrj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D has been added to calcium-fortified orange juice. It is unknown whether vitamin D is as bioavailable from orange juice as it is from supplements.

Objectives

The objective was to compare the bioavailability of vitamin D(2) and vitamin D(3) from orange juice with that from vitamin D(2) and vitamin D(3) supplements. A secondary aim was to determine which form of vitamin D is more bioavailable in orange juice.

Design

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in healthy adults aged 18–84 y (15–20/group) who received 1000 IU vitamin D(3), 1000 IU vitamin D(2), or placebo in orange juice or capsule for 11 wk at the end of winter.

Results

A total of 64% of subjects began the study deficient in vitamin D (ie, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) concentrations < 20 ng/mL). Analysis of the area under the curve showed no significant difference in serum 25(OH)D between subjects who consumed vitamin D-fortified orange juice and those who consumed vitamin D supplements (P = 0.084). No significant difference in serum 25(OH)D(3) was observed between subjects who consumed vitamin D(3)-fortified orange juice and vitamin D(3) capsules (P > 0.1). Similarly, no significant difference in serum 25(OH)D(2) was observed between subjects who consumed vitamin D(2)-fortified orange juice and vitamin D(2) capsules (P > 0.1). No significant overall difference in parathyroid hormone concentrations was observed between the groups (P = 0.82).

Conclusion

Vitamin D(2) and vitamin D(3) are equally bioavailable in orange juice and capsules.

### Assessment of incorporation of lessons from tobacco control in city and county laws regulating legal marijuana in California [^111TzcyZ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Restrictions on Allowable Marijuana Product Types for Sale

Among jurisdictions allowing retail sale, only 8 imposed restrictions on types of marijuana products for sale, beyond state regulations. One jurisdiction, Contra Costa County, pioneered the prohibition of sale of flavored products for combustion or inhalation, 3 jurisdictions (Pasadena, Mono County, and Chula Vista) prohibited the sale of marijuana-infused beverages resembling "alcopops"(such as marijuana orange soda or iced tea), 5 jurisdictions restricted products appealing to youths, and 5 jurisdictions imposed restrictions on edible marijuana products beyond state regulations. No jurisdictions limited the potency of products sold, although 1 jurisdiction established a potency-linked tax. The state did not limit or tax potency, except for establishing a maximum 10-mg THC dose for edible marijuana products (100 mg total per package), nor did they limit manufacturing or sale of flavored products, such as flavored vaping liquids or prerolled cigarettes, although state regulations did create restrictions on products resembling existing foods or with characteristics that were particularly attractive to children.

Health Warnings and Claims

Although the state required only a limited health warning in hard-to-read 6-point font on packages, whose text was defined in the ballot initiative, 23 jurisdictions required additional health warnings in stores and 4 jurisdictions required additional health warnings on packages. No jurisdiction required warnings on advertising. Although the state prohibited only misleading or unsubstantiated health claims, 1 county, Mono, prohibited all health-related claims on marijuana labels, any advertising or marketing, and in retailer names.

### Estimation of potential savings through therapeutic substitution [^117B5QvM]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Therapeutic substitution offers potential to decrease pharmaceutical expenditures and potentially improve the efficiency of the health care system.

Objective

To estimate potential savings through therapeutic substitution in terms of both overall and out-of-pocket expenditures of branded drugs when a generic in the same class with the same indication was available.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Repeated cross-sectional study using the 107 132 individuals included in the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2010–2012) along with their reported prescribed medicine use. The Orange Book, company financial statements, US Food and Drug Administration records, and published research were used for adjunctive information.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Estimated excess expenditure due to branded drug overuse when a lower-cost generic in the same class with the same indication was available.

Results

The study included 107 132 individuals between 2010 and 2012, of whom 62.1% (95% CI, 61.4%-62.8%) reported use of any prescribed medicine. A total of 31.5% (95% CI, 30.7%-32.2%) used a medication from an included drug class, whereas 16.6% (95% CI, 16.0%-17.1%) of the population used a branded drug from the included classes compared with 24.0% (95% CI, 23.4%-24.7%) who used a generic and 9.1% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.4%) who used both. In the included drug classes, the majority of the drugs were generics, with a total of 93.5 billion standardized doses compared with 47.4 billion standardized doses of branded drugs. Total expenditure of the branded drugs accounted for $147 (95% CI, $137-$156) billion compared with $62.7 (95% CI, $58.9-$66.5) billion for the generics. Between 2010 and 2012, an estimated $73.0 (95% CI, $67.6-$78.5) billion in total excess expenditure and $24.6 (95% CI, $22.6-$26.5) billion in out-of-pocket excess expenditure was attributable to branded drug overuse. The excess was present across numerous drug classes throughout many aspects of medicine and equates to 9.6% of total and 14.1% of out-of-pocket prescribed medicine expenses. The drug classes with the highest excess expenditure included statins ($10.9 [SE, $0.41] billion), atypical antipsychotics ($9.99 [SE, $1.03] billion), proton pump inhibitors ($6.12 [SE, $0.38] billion), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ($6.08 [SE, $0.49] billion), and angiotensin receptor blockers ($5.53 [SE, $0.35] billion).

Conclusions and Relevance

Although therapeutic substitution is controversial, it offers a potential mechanism to significantly decrease drug costs if it can be implemented in a way that does not negatively affect quality of care.

### High orange juice consumption with or in-between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects [^116RBHoV]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Study protocol

A cross-over free-living nutrition intervention was conducted at the Institute of Nutritional Medicine, University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany. An outline of the study protocol is given in Fig. 1. The primary outcome was insulin sensitivity and the secondary outcome body fat mass. Prior to the intervention, subjects kept a nutrition diary to assess normal nutrition habits and were asked to maintain their habitual choice of foods throughout the study. During a 1 week run-in period and the subsequent entire intervention, subjects were instructed to avoid the consumption of citrus fruits, additional orange juice and SSB in order to obtain equal baseline conditions and avoid confounders. A minimum of 1 week washout period was used between the 2-week consumption of each intervention period. Participants in the first group recruited in April began with the with meal (WM)-intervention, while participants in the second group recruited in September began with the in-between meal (BM)-intervention. Throughout intervention periods, participants were asked to consume only three meals a day and drink orange juice three times a day either with meals (WM) or in-between meals (BM) for two weeks. During the BM-intervention, participants were instructed to drink the orange juice not less than 2 h after meals. Participants came to the institute for visits at the beginning (day 1) and end (day 15) of each intervention phase. On these four visiting days (T1–T4) body composition was measured and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed. Subjects were asked to go to bed before midnight and to abstain from vigorous activity and alcohol consumption prior to visiting days to avoid potential bias on glucose tolerance.

BRFSS is an ongoing state-based random-digit–dialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized, civilian adults aged ≥ 18 years residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health risk behaviors and conditions, chronic diseases and conditions, access to health care, and use of preventive health services and practices related to the leading causes of death and disabilities in the United States. BRFSS asks respondents how many times per day, week, or month they consumed 100% fruit juice, whole fruit, dried beans, dark green vegetables, orange vegetables, and other vegetables over the previous month as part of the rotating core questionnaire administered every other year. For these analyses, respondents were excluded if they did not reside in the 50 states or DC, were missing responses to one or more questions, or had implausible reports of fruit or vegetable intake (reported eating fruit > 16 times per day or vegetables > 23 times per day); after excluding these 118,193 (24%) respondents, the resulting analytic sample size was 373,580. The 2013 median American Association of Public Opinion Research response rate across the 50 states and DC was 45.9%.

### Exposure to agent orange and hepatocellular carcinoma among US military personnel [^111WhvE2]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Age at deployment was inversely associated with incident HCC in veterans with cirrhosis (aHR, 0.96; 95% CI 0.95–0.98; P < .001). To explore this further, we assessed the association between smoking and alcohol with age for veterans with and without cirrhosis and stratified age by decades. For both alcohol and smoking, we found that early exposure during ages 20 to 30 years were significantly associated with incident HCC, independent of cirrhosis status (eTables 6 to 8 in Supplement 1). While we found an association between incident HCC and age at deployment in veterans without cirrhosis (aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00–1.04; P = 0.047), this was not reproduced using the age-independent APRI score (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).

### Exposure to agent orange and risk of bladder cancer among US veterans [^1165yAaG]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Study Cohort

A total of 25 144 713 veterans enrolled in the VA nationwide from 2001 to 2019 were identified. This cohort study included 3 520 249 veterans who met the following criteria: active users of the VA system (defined as ≥ 2 medical office visits within 5 years); served in the Vietnam conflict; served in the military branch of Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Navy, or Marine Corps; not transgender; 18 to 75 years of age at enlistment; and not deceased prior to January 1, 2001. To create a more homogeneous cohort that had opportunity for Agent Orange exposure, we then limited the study to men (as very few female veterans among those enrolled in the VA nationwide were exposed to Agent Orange) and excluded veterans missing pertinent data for matching, including race and ethnicity, date of birth, and military branch. After inclusions and exclusions were applied, the cohort consisted of 868 912 veterans exposed to Agent Orange and 2 427 677 controls. Next, we matched each veteran exposed to Agent Orange to 3 controls on factors associated with Agent Orange exposure using a stepwise algorithm, broadening the matching criteria at each stage. In the first step, we matched 67% of the controls to veterans exposed to Agent Orange on age at service entry (18–20, 21–22, or ≥ 23 years), military branch (Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Navy, or Marine Corps), race and ethnicity (Black, White, or other [American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and biracial]), and exact year of service entry. Subsequently, we matched 11% more controls to veterans exposed to Agent Orange following the same criteria but loosening year of service entry by ± 1 year (1%), ± 2 years (2%), ± 3 years (4%), and ± 4 years (4%) in iterative steps, for a total of 1 900 331 controls or 78% of the initial pool. In the end, 633 483 veterans exposed to Agent Orange (73%) were matched; among those matched, 99% had 3 matched controls and less than 1% had just 2 or 1 controls (Figure; eTable 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

### Blood pressure and heart rate effects following a single dose of bitter orange [^115tpE7z]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The ingredients of numerous "ephedra-free" dietary supplements used for weight loss include bitter orange, which contains sympathomimetic alkaloids such as synephrine. Due to the similarity in chemical structure to ephedrine and the potential sympathomimetic effects of synephrine, it is hypothesized that bitter orange may increase blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR).

Objective

To determine the effects on BP and HR after a single dose of bitter orange in healthy adults.

Methods

In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 15 young, healthy, adult subjects received either a single dose of Nature's Way Bitter Orange — a 900 mg dietary supplement extract standardized to 6% synephrine — or matching placebo, with a one week washout period. Systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and HR were measured at baseline and every hour for 6 hours after administration.

Results

SBP after bitter orange was significantly increased versus placebo at hours 1–5 (p < 0.0001); the peak difference was 7.3 ± 4.6 mm Hg. Although the baseline DBP was higher than after administration of both placebo and bitter orange, DBP after bitter orange was significantly increased versus placebo at hours 4 and 5 (p ≤ 0.02); the peak difference was 2.6 ± 3.8 mm Hg. HR was significantly increased after bitter orange versus placebo for hours 2–5 (p < 0.01); the peak difference was 4.2 ± 4.5 beats/min.

Conclusions

SBP, DBP, and HR were higher for up to 5 hours after a single dose of bitter orange versus placebo in young, healthy adults.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^113Nw9SP]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Healthy People 2020 objectives — Nutrition and weight status (NWS) among children and adolescents outline school and dietary targets: increase the proportion of schools that offer nutritious foods and beverages outside of school meals, increase the proportion of schools that do not sell or offer calorically sweetened beverages to students, and increase the proportion of school districts that require schools to make fruits or vegetables available whenever other food is offered or sold. Weight-related objectives include to reduce the proportion of children and adolescents who are considered obese and to prevent inappropriate weight gain in youths and adults. For the population aged ≥ 2 years, objectives are to increase the contribution of fruits and increase the variety and contribution of vegetables, including increasing the contribution of dark green vegetables, orange vegetables, and legumes, and to increase the contribution of whole grains. Additional dietary goals for those aged ≥ 2 years are to reduce consumption of calories from solid fats and added sugars, reduce consumption of saturated fat, reduce consumption of sodium, increase consumption of calcium, and reduce iron deficiency among young children and females of childbearing age.

Eligible patients with T2DM were randomised to a varied chronology of exposure conditions by sealed envelope, determined by an independent researcher not involved in the intervention or assessments. Participants were able to choose between two energy/carbohydrate-matched standard breakfast options: (a) ham version: 526 kCal, 79.5 g carbohydrates, 5.6 g fibres, 13.1 g fat and 10.1 g protein per serving (respectively); or (b) cheese version: 489 kCal, 81.2 g carbohydrates, 5.6 g fibres, 7.9 g fat and 3.9 g protein per serving (respectively). The breakfast of choice was served with either 250 mL of 100% orange juice (OJ-H), 250 mL sugar-sweetened orange-flavoured beverage (SOB) or whole orange pieces with peel removed (WOP), supplying circa 21.5–22 g total sugar. Due to natural variability, the sugar content of the fruit pieces was monitored by 16 separate analyses during the study. The total sugar content varied from 16.8 to 27.8 g total sugar per 250 g portion of fruit pieces. Similarly, the hesperidin dose fed via fruit pieces varied from 38.5 to 294.8 mg/250 g (mean 160 mg/250 g). The OJ-H was sourced from a single batch of concentrate, as described previously, having a highly uniform composition throughout the study. The OJ-H contained 134.3 mg hesperidin per 250 mL (537 mg/L), thus being at the higher end of the reference range under the orange juice Code of Practice (European Fruit Juice Association, May 13th 2024). The detailed composition of the test foods is described in Table 2. The development of the SOB has also been described previously. Each of the breakfast conditions provided ~20% of the daily reference energy intake (8 372 kJ or 2000 kcal), followed by a standard snack (30 g of salted potato chips) 3 h later. Ad libitum water intake was permitted during the visits. Compositional details of the different orange conditions are provided in Table 2. No side effects related to the interventions were reported throughout the study period. The study was performed in accordance with the standards set by the latest revision (2013) of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee (Hasselt University, Belgium). All participants gave written informed consent after careful explanation about the nature and risks of the experimental procedures of the study (NCT04412798).

### Exposure to agent orange and hepatocellular carcinoma among US military personnel [^111Zsshf]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its mortality are on the rise. Viral hepatitis and alcohol are leading risk factors; however, other risk factors among veterans are less defined, including Agent Orange (AO), an herbicide linked to several cancers.

Objective

To assess the association of AO exposure and HCC in a national cohort of Vietnam veterans.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included Vietnam veterans who served between 1966 and 1975, were male, were older than 18 years at the time of deployment, and had established follow-up in the Veterans Affairs (VA) between 2000 and 2019. Veterans with AO exposure were identified in the disability data via validated clinical surveys. Relevant clinical risk factors for cirrhosis and HCC were collected. Patients were stratified based on cirrhosis status, as defined by consecutive diagnosis found by documented International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision scores or calculated Fibrosis-4 scores. Data were collected from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020, and analyzed from December 2020 to October 2023.

Main Outcome and Measures

Incident HCC was the primary outcome. AO and HCC association was estimated using a multivariable Cox regression analysis, with death and liver transplant as competing events.

Results

Of the 296 505 eligible veterans (222 545 [75.1%] White individuals and 44 342 [15.0%] Black individuals), 170 090 (57%) had AO exposure (mean [SD] age, 21.62 [3.49] years; 131 552 White individuals [83.2%] and 22 767 Black individuals [14.4%]) and 35 877 (12.1%) had cirrhosis. Veterans who were not exposed to AO were more likely to smoke (109 689 of 126 413 [86.8%] vs 146 061 of 170 090 [85.9%]); use alcohol (54 147 of 126 413 [42.8%] vs 71 951 of 170 090 [42.3%]) and have viral hepatitis (47 722 of 126 413 [37.8%] vs 58 942 of 170 090 [34.7%]). In a multivariable competing risk model, AO exposure was not associated with HCC. Among veterans with cirrhosis, self-identification as Hispanic individuals (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30–1.75; P < .001) or Black individuals (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05–1.32; P = 0.004), and having a diagnosis of viral hepatitis (aHR, 3.71; 95% CI, 3.26–4.24; P < .001), alcohol-associated liver disease (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19–1.46; P < .001), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (aHR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.72–2.15; P < .001) were associated with HCC. Among veterans without cirrhosis, hypertension (aHR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.23–2.15; P < .001) and diabetes (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13–2.05; P = 0.005) were also associated with HCC. Early smoking and alcohol use were significant risk factors for HCC.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large nationwide cohort study of Vietnam veterans, AO exposure was not associated with HCC. Smoking, alcohol, viral hepatitis, and NAFLD were the most important clinical risk factors for HCC.

### High orange juice consumption with or in-between three meals a day differently affects energy balance in healthy subjects [^116piKii]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Sugar-containing beverages like orange juice can be a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes although the underlying mechanisms are less clear. We aimed to investigate if intake of orange juice with or in-between meals differently affects energy balance or metabolic risk. Twenty-six healthy adults (24.7 ± 3.2 y; BMI 23.2 ± 3.2 kg/m²) participated in a 4-week cross-over intervention and consumed orange juice (20% of energy requirement) either together with 3 meals/d (WM) or in-between 3 meals/d (BM) at ad libitum energy intake. Basal and postprandial insulin sensitivity (primary outcome), daylong glycaemia, glucose variability and insulin secretion were assessed. Body fat mass was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. After BM-intervention, fat mass increased (+1.0 ± 1.8kg; p < 0.05) and postprandial insulin sensitivity tended to decrease (ΔMatsuda ISI: -0.89 ± 2.3; p = 0.06). By contrast, after WM-intervention fat mass and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased (-0.30 ± 0.65kg; -2.50 ± 3.94; both p < 0.05), whereas glucose variability was higher (ΔMAGE: +0.45 ± 0.59, p < 0.05). Daylong glycaemia, insulin secretion, changes in basal insulin sensitivity, and triglycerides did not differ between WM- and BM-interventions (all p > 0.05). In young healthy adults, a conventional 3-meal structure with orange juice consumed together with meals had a favorable impact on energy balance, whereas juice consumption in-between meals may contribute to a gain in body fat and adverse metabolic effects.

### Fruit and vegetable consumption among adults – United States, 2005 [^114LNj6W]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

A diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk for chronic diseases. In addition, because fruits and vegetables have low energy density (i.e., few calories relative to volume), eating them as part of a reduced-calorie diet can be beneficial for weight management. Healthy People 2010 health objectives include increasing to 75% the percentage of persons aged ≥ 2 years who eat at least two daily servings of fruit (objective 19–5) and increasing to 50% the proportion of persons aged ≥ 2 years who eat at least three daily servings of vegetables, with at least one third being dark green or orange vegetables (objective 19–6). To assess the level of fruit and vegetable consumption among adults by state and demographic characteristics, data from the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were analyzed. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that 32.6% of adults consumed fruit two or more times per day and 27.2% ate vegetables three or more times per day. The results underscore the need for continued interventions that encourage greater fruit and vegetable consumption among U.S. adults.

### One rotten apple infects all in the basket [^111V1HxW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

As urbanization spread, many farmers turned to market gardening to satisfy expanding demand for vegetables. This interaction of urban and agricultural sectors, an integral part of society, was reflected in art, both in the selection of topics and the style of execution. Vegetables played a big role in Dutch diet. They were brought into towns by barges and small boats from outlying farm areas to be sold at city markets. They were also shipped from France, Italy, and Germany. Even more than fishermen and livestock farmers, horticulture farmers were focused on the market, with the prices depending on the ease of cultivation and seasonal availability.

Hardy fruits and vegetables were available year-round at low prices and made up the diet of the urban poor. These were also popular in still life paintings: apples, onions, squashes, turnips, artichokes, cabbages, and orange Horn carrots―which represented Dutch innovation in breeding new varieties. For the affluent, having pictures of these vegetables, or even eating them from time to time, served as reminder of the virtues of modest life. More elaborate and exotic vegetables, such as asparagus, also were featured, even if rarely eaten. Only the affluent could afford difficult crops and imports; yet images of opulent tables and extravagant fare, as in the works of, and many others, also appealed to those with little access to such feasts.

Open air markets in major cities were gathering places. "Every morning, the wives of farmers and fishermen, though occasionally the men as well, would enter the cities to sell their goods… People had incentives to form personal relationships, vendors wanting to maintain regular customers and buyers hoping for discounts". Urban markets were guided by city regulations that dictated hours of operation and vendor behavior. Separate markets existed for vegetables and fruits, fish, saltwater fish, and poultry, though not all municipalities could afford appropriate space and facilities or standards of cleanliness. In general, damaged vegetables were not allowed, and fish markets operated only in the morning before the sun could rot the fish. Some vendors, bakers for instance, had a clear advantage. Demand for their product was so high that they were prosperous enough to commission portraits.

### Healthfulness of the U.S. food supply: little improvement despite decades of dietary guidance [^1143wMyR]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Every 5 years for the past several decades, the USDHHS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have issued and updated the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which form the basis of federal nutrition policy and have shown remarkable consistency across various editions among the major themes.

Purpose

This paper examines whether the U.S. food supply is sufficiently balanced to provide the recommended proportions of various foods and nutrients per the amount of energy, whether this balance has shifted over time, and which areas of the food supply may have changed more than others.

Methods

The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) was used to measure the dietary quality of the U.S. food supply, from 1970 to 2007. Sources of data were the USDA's food availability data, loss-adjusted food availability data, and nutrient availability data, and the U.S. Salt Institute's data on salt sold for human consumption.

Results

Total HEI-2005 scores improved by about 10 points between 1970 and 2007, but they never achieved even 60 points on a scale from 0 to 100. Although meats and total grains were supplied generally in recommended proportions, total vegetables, total fruit, whole fruit, and milk were supplied in suboptimal proportions that changed very little over time. Saturated fat, sodium, and calories from solid fat, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars were supplied in varying degrees of unhealthy abundance over the years. Supplies of dark-green/orange vegetables and legumes and whole grains were entirely insufficient relative to recommendations, with virtually no change over time.

Conclusions

Deliberate efforts on the part of policymakers, the agriculture sector, and the food industry are necessary to provide a supply of foods consistent with nutrition recommendations and to make healthy choices available to all.

### Exposure to agent orange and hepatocellular carcinoma among US military personnel [^113PE8dN]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Limitations

While we present the largest cohort of US Vietnam veterans with AO exposure with long-term follow, our study has notable limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, residual confounders between exposure and outcomes may be present. While we used robust methods to identify AO exposure, veterans who may not claim an AO-associated disability may not have been captured accordingly. Others have used similar methods to ours to identify AO exposed cases; however, we recognize that since AO cannot be directly measured, there is a potential for misclassification of cases. Using the age at deployment allowed us to determine if there was a potential dose-response given the length of exposure; however, this was not identified. The long follow-up period of our cohort allowed us to identify HCC cases, which can take 20 to 40 yearsto occur and thus may not be captured in shorter studies. However, given the limitation of data availability within the VHA only starting in the years 1999 and 2000, events prior these dates would not have been available for our review. Therefore, our cohort may be biased to a potentially healthier veteran population. Although sex differences have been described in HCC, this could not be addressed in our cohort given that less than 1% of all Vietnam veterans were female. Rare etiologies of liver disease, such as Wilson disease (84 veterans), could not be robustly evaluated in our study. Finally, since our interest was to capture veterans who primarily received their care within the VHA, we could not capture events that occurred outside of the VHA, including for those associated with liver transplantation.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Enskyce) [^114db5EQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Sunday Start

When taking Enskyce, the first light orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first light orange "active" tablet is taken on that day. If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first light orange "active" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product. Tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One light orange "active" tablet daily for 21 days, then one green "reminder" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started and a light orange "active" tablet is taken the next day (Sunday). When initiating a Sunday start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.

The use of Enskyce for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also (PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers). If the patient starts on Enskyce postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a light orange "active" tablet has been taken daily for 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. If the patient misses one (1) light orange active tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the light orange "active" tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) light orange "active" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) light orange "active" tablets the day she remembers and two (2) light orange "active" tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) light orange "active" tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) light orange "active" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more light orange "active" tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one light orange "active" tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills.

### Enzyme-treated orange pomace alters acute glycemic response to orange juice [^112vs8NJ]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

The goal of the present study was to determine the impact of the addition of enzyme-treated orange pomace to orange juice on postprandial glycemic response. Ten healthy subjects (aged 27.9 ± 7.7 years, body mass index 22.1 ± 1.1 kg/m²) participated in a randomized, 2-arm, cross-over clinical trial to test the glycemic response to 100% orange juice (OJ) or 100% orange juice with 5g of enzyme-treated orange pomace fiber (OPF). Blood samples were collected and glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at fasting (0min) and every 15min for 2h after consuming the study juice products. Analysis of the 2h incremental area under the curve (iAUC 0-2h) indicated a significant reduction in blood glucose after ingesting the OPF juice compared to the OJ, p = 0.02. Peak glucose concentrations were also lowered after the OPF juice compared to the OJ, p < 0.05. No significant difference was observed in insulin responses between treatments, p > 0.05. Overall, this study demonstrated that adding 5g of fiber from orange pomace into a serving of OJ attenuated the postprandial glucose response.

### The effect of flavoring oral rehydration solution on its composition and palatability [^115N9SHn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

As a number of mild to moderately dehydrated children refuse to drink oral rehydration solution (ORS) because of its strong salty taste, many parents and health workers flavor ORS with the childs favorite juice. The effects of flavoring ORS on electrolyte content and osmolality were assessed and the palatability of various solutions were compared with commercially flavored ORS.

Methods

Osmolality, sodium, potassium, chloride and glucose content after flavoring with varying concentrations of apple juice, orange juice or orangeade was determined. Two of the solutions were offered to 30 children and adults to assess palatability.

Results

All additions to ORS (apple juice, orange juice or orangeade) caused a decrease of sodium (-30 to -53 mmol/L) and chloride (-27 to -47 mmol/L) content, whereas osmolality increased to greater than 311 mOsm/kg. These homemade oral rehydration solutions did not fulfill ESPGAN criteria for ORS, and rehydration will therefore be less effective. The majority of subjects also preferred the commercially flavored ORS.

Conclusion

Only very small amounts of apple juice or orange juice can be added to the ORS without significantly altering electrolyte composition and osmolality. Palatability, however, does not improve compared with commercially flavored ORS. We therefore recommend using commercially flavored ORS, the composition of which fulfills ESPGAN criteria.

### Apalutamide (Erleada) [^112HAutD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Alternate Methods of Administration

Disperse Tablet(s) in Water and Administer with Orange Juice, Applesauce, or Additional Water

For patients who cannot swallow tablets whole, the recommended dose of ERLEADA tablet(s) can be dispersed in non-carbonated water and then administered with either orange juice, applesauce, or additional water as follows:

Place the entire prescribed dose of ERLEADA tablet(s) in a cup. Do not crush or split the tablet(s).
For one 240 mg tablet: Add about 2 teaspoons (10 mL) of non-carbonated water to make sure that the tablet is completely immersed in water. For 60 mg tablets (prescribed dose of 240 mg, 180 mg, or 120 mg): Add about 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of non-carbonated water to make sure that the tablets are completely immersed in water.
Wait 2 minutes until the tablet(s) are broken up and spread out, then stir the mixture.
Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of either orange juice, applesauce, or additional water and stir the mixture.
Swallow the mixture immediately.
Rinse the cup with enough water to make sure the whole dose is taken and drink it immediately.

Do not store ERLEADA that is mixed with non-carbonated water, orange juice, or applesauce for later use.

Administer Tablet(s) Through a Feeding Tube

ERLEADA tablet(s) can be administered through a feeding tube 8 French or greater as follows:

For one 240 mg tablet: Place the tablet in the barrel of the syringe (use at least a 20 mL syringe) and draw up 10 mL of non-carbonated water into the syringe. For 60 mg tablets (prescribed dose of 240 mg, 180 mg, or 120 mg): Place the entire prescribed dose of ERLEADA tablets in the barrel of the syringe (use at least a 50 mL syringe) and draw up 20 mL of non-carbonated water into the syringe.
Wait 10 minutes and then shake vigorously to disperse contents completely.
Administer immediately through the feeding tube.
Refill the syringe with non-carbonated water and administer. Repeat until no tablet residue is left in the syringe or feeding tube.

### Are allergenic disperse dyes used for dyeing textiles? [^114UNHq3]. Contact Dermatitis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There are no data showing that disperse dyes, used to patch test patients, are currently being used for dyeing synthetic garments. It is unknown whether disperse dyes, which are currently routinely patch tested, are in fact present in synthetic textiles on the market.

Objectives

To determine whether eight disperse dyes, hitherto most widely cited as allergenic, are still used in textiles that are sold in various countries.

Methods

Textiles from 13 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States were analysed. The procedure used for dye identification was thin-layer chromatography. When there were matching spots from the textile extract and reference dye, high-performance liquid chromatography was performed.

Results

Of 121 analysed items, three showed positive results for some of the investigated disperse dyes. Four dyes in these items could be detected and confirmed by the use of high-performance liquid chromatography. A pair of light brown ladies' tights manufactured and purchased in Italy contained Disperse Yellow 3, Disperse Blue 124, and Disperse Blue 106, and a set of black bra and panties purchased in India contained Disperse Orange 1.

Conclusions

The eight disperse dyes that are most frequently incriminated in textile dye dermatitis are very rarely used in textiles nowadays.

### Spectrofluorometric method for measuring tobacco smoke particulate matter on cigarette filters and cambridge pads [^115Y8GJT]. Tobacco Control (2008). Low credibility.

Almost all cigarettes sold have a filter (United States, > 98%; worldwide, > 95%). In the last 25 years cigarette manufacturers have introduced diverse filters designed to reduce components in tobacco smoke. Today, there exists a need to establish assays to assess the efficacy of cigarette filters to retain total particulate matter (TPM), particularly unique filters of cigarettes that are being marketed as potential reduced exposure products (PREPs). We report the results of studies that were undertaken to test the hypothesis that a technique could be established for dissolving cigarette filters, and that the TPM in the fluid could be quantified by spectrofluorometry. Described here are procedures for assaying TPM on both Cambridge filter pads (glass fibres) of smoking machines and on cigarette filters (cellulose acetate fibres). The principle of the assays is based upon the observation that there exists a direct correlation between the amount of tobacco product emission TPM and fluorescence. In the absence of a tobacco tar or TPM standard, the fluorescent dye acridine orange was confirmed as a useful surrogate. Filters assayed included those of Kentucky reference cigarettes 2R4F and popular US brand cigarettes. The proposed assays are inexpensive, expedient, reproducible and amendable for large-scale studies.

### Intake of high-fructose corn syrup sweetened soft drinks, fruit drinks and apple juice is associated with prevalent arthritis in US adults, aged 20–30 years [^114Q3nUf]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

According to the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (NDB) release 26 per 100 g, the amount of total sugars in AJ and orange juice are comparable; AJ contains 9.6 g and orange juice contains 8.8 g of total sugars. Similarly, the total fructose amounts in AJ and orange juice are comparable; per 100 g, AJ contains 6.4 g and orange juice contains 4.5 g of fructose. Whereas analysis of their EFF content indicates that these juices are quite different from one another. Specifically, the excess free fructose content in an 8 oz cup of AJ is 7.7 g (NDB no. 09400) and in orange juice it is 0.4 g (NDB no. 09207). Per (8 oz.) cup, AJ contains 19 times more EFF than orange juice. Therefore, AJ is a high EFF beverage, whereas orange juice is not.

Although AJ is a higher EFF beverage than HFCS sweetened soft drinks, and contributes to total excess free fructose load, in the US, HFCS sweetened soft drinks are the most significant source of EFF in adult diets, even though many other foods are sweetened with HFCS. Present estimates indicate that the US average per capita consumption of HFCS is just under a lb. per week, or 65 grams per day, which is the same amount of HFCS in a 20 ounce bottle of non-diet cola. When sweetened with the 60/40 variant of HFCS, a 20 ounce bottle of cola contains 13 g of EFF. Therefore, EFF intakes may exceed dosages associated with adult FM in subsets of the population, as FM research indicates that 30% of healthy adults are FM positive after a 25 g EFF dose, and 10% are FM positive after a 12 g EFF dose, but not after consuming sucrose or equal amounts of fructose and glucose monomers.

### Origin and de novo domestication of sweet orange [^11345xFt]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Compared with previous studies on the origin of sweet orange, our study inferred a reasonable model with the extant germplasm of both parents of sweet orange in the NYW region of southern China. A previous study proposed that sweet orange originated from (pummelo × mandarin) × mandarin. Another previous study proposed that sweet orange had undergone multiple pummelo introgression eventsand proposed that sour orange was not related to sweet orange. Our study inferred a simple model for the origin of sweet orange. We propose that sweet orange is hybrid between sour orange and Ponkan-like mandarin based on a high-resolution haplotype-resolved genome analysis that we confirmed with artificial hybridization experiments. As sweet orange and sour orange both are interspecies hybrids with high levels of heterozygosity, a previous genomic analysis that utilized only one haploid genome may lack sufficient allele information. In this study, we clarified the genetic composition of phased haplotypes for both sweet orange and sour orange, allowing for a thorough consideration of the genetic characteristics of sweet oranges. The debate on the different models for the origin of sweet orange has focused on the 1.8–5.8 Mb homozygous pummelo/pummelo (P/P) segment on chromosome 2 of sweet orange. We defined the distribution of the P/P segment in all accessions and cross-referenced them with the phenotypes of the hybrids of sour orange and Ponkan mandarin. Our data revealed that both the sour orange and Ponkan mandarin possess one allele of the pummelo segment and thus, provide a reasonable explanation for the debated P/P segment of sweet oranges (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 22). We also observed sweet orange-like phenotype among the hybrids with homozygous pummelo haplotypes in this region (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 23). We further designed hybridization experiment by using sour orange and Ponkan mandarin as parents and created artificial sweet oranges that are very close to commercial sweet oranges, which provides strong evidence for our origin model of sweet orange. The existence of all parental species in the same sympatric region in the NYW region of southern China provides more support for our model for the origin of sweet orange.

### Origin and de novo domestication of sweet orange [^1134hXSS]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Sweet orange is cultivated worldwide but suffers from various devastating diseases because of its monogenetic background. The elucidation of the origin of a crop facilitates the domestication of new crops that may better cope with new challenges. Here we collected and sequenced 226 citrus accessions and assembled telomere-to-telomere phased diploid genomes of sweet orange and sour orange. On the basis of a high-resolution haplotype-resolved genome analysis, we inferred that sweet orange originated from a sour orange×mandarin cross and confirmed this model using artificial hybridization experiments. We identified defense-related metabolites that potently inhibited the growth of multiple industrially important pathogenic bacteria. We introduced diversity to sweet orange, which showed wide segregation in fruit flavor and disease resistance and produced canker-resistant sweet orange by selecting defense-related metabolites. Our findings elucidate the origin of sweet orange and de novo domesticated disease-resistant sweet oranges, illuminating a strategy for the rapid domestication of perennial crops.

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^113mcYHz]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Customer Purchase Assessments and Surveys

We also collected purchases at the individual level so we could examine all beverages and snacks purchased per customer trip to determine whether there was behavioral substitution (eg, messaging may have reduced beverage calories sold but increased snack calories sold). Additionally, we wanted to examine education as a moderating variable. However, the study began on February 1, 2019, and was cut short in March 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic, so we were unable to reach our target sample size (n = 3312), which would have enabled us to detect a 7- to 17-calorie difference across conditions by education level (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2). To obtain the customer data, research assistants obtained verbal consent from adult customers and asked them to orally complete a brief survey after their purchase (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2), indicating what they purchased, their vending machine habits, and perceptions of the food and beverage messaging intervention (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2). Self-reported race and ethnicity information were collected to describe the demographics of the sample.

Outcomes

We conducted 3 sets of analyses: 2 sets with the sales data and 1 with the customer purchase assessment data. First, at the transaction level, we assessed whether there were differences by condition in the average healthfulness of the products sold per transaction. These outcomes were preregistered: calories sold per transaction and the health status of the item sold (healthy [green], moderately healthy [yellow], or unhealthy [red]). Second, at the machine level, our preregistered outcome was the monthly number of products sold per machine. We also explored the following machine-level outcomes: total calories and number of green, yellow, and red items sold per month. We examined monthly machine revenue as a secondary outcome. Third, the primary customer purchase assessment outcome was the combined number of calories sold per trip based on the nutrition facts labels.

### Comparative value of orange juice versus lemonade in reducing stone-forming risk [^117CKumc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Foods that are high in citrate content generally are assumed to deliver alkali load when consumed irrespective of the accompanying cation. The object of this randomized, crossover study was to compare the effects of orange juice with those of lemonade on acid-base profile and urinary stone risks under controlled metabolic conditions. Thirteen volunteers (nine healthy subjects and four stone formers) sequentially received distilled water, orange juice, or lemonade while on constant metabolic diet. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected for acid-base parameters and stone risk analysis. Orange juice but not lemonade provided alkali as evidenced by higher net gastrointestinal alkali absorption and higher urinary pH and citrate compared with control. Urinary calcium was not significantly different, but urinary oxalate was higher during the orange juice phase. The calculated supersaturation of calcium oxalate was lower in the orange juice phase compared with control. Calculated undissociated uric acid was lower in the orange juice phase compared with both control and lemonade phases. The calculated supersaturation of brushite was significantly higher in the orange juice phase compared with both control and lemonade phases. Despite comparable citrate content, this study showed that orange juice has greater alkalinizing and citraturic effects than lemonade. Consumption of orange juice was associated with lower calculated calcium oxalate supersaturation and lower calculated undissociated uric acid. This short-term study suggests that orange juice consumption could result in biochemical modification of stone risk factors; however, additional studies are needed to evaluate its role in long-term prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis.

### Variety and content of commercial infant and toddler vegetable products manufactured and sold in the United States [^1137r5jh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Exposure to vegetable flavors during infancy and toddlerhood is hypothesized to enhance vegetable acceptance when children transition to table foods.

Objective

We sought to examine the vegetable types, ingredients, and nutrient contents of vegetable-containing infant and toddler foods (ITFs) manufactured and sold in the United States.

Design

A database of ITFs that contain vegetables (n = 548) was compiled from websites of companies based in the United States (n = 24). Product information was recorded, including intended age or stage, ingredient lists, and selected nutrients from the Nutrition Facts label. Ingredient lists were used to categorize vegetables using the USDA vegetable categories: dark green (e.g., spinach), red and orange (e.g., carrots), starchy (e.g., green peas, corn), beans and peas (e.g., black beans), and other (e.g., green beans, beets). Furthermore, products were categorized as single-vegetable, multi-vegetable, vegetable and fruit, vegetable and meat, or vegetable and other combinations (e.g., grains and or dairy). Nutrients were examined, including energy (kilocalories), carbohydrates, fiber, and total sugars [per serving, per 100 g, per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC), and percentage of kilocalories from sugars].

Results

Of the 548 vegetable products, only 52 single-vegetable products (9.5%) were identified, none of which contained dark green vegetables or beans and peas. Red and orange vegetables most often appeared as the first ingredient (23.7%) compared to other vegetable types, such as dark green vegetables, which were rarely listed first (1.1%). Fruits were listed as the first ingredient more commonly than all vegetables (37.8%). One-way ANOVA revealed that vegetable and fruit products contained more sugars on average than did vegetable products with other ingredients, such as dairy and/or grains (all P values < 0.001).

Conclusions

Current available products do not provide caregivers with a sufficient variety of single-vegetable products or products containing dark green vegetables to facilitate children's subsequent acceptance of these vegetables. Guidance should include making caregivers aware of the limitations of commercial ITFs manufactured and sold in the US market.

### Selumetinib (Koselugo) [^114FKhUn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

The recommended dosage of KOSELUGO capsules (see Table 1) and KOSELUGO oral granules (see Table 2) for pediatric patients 1 year of age and older, based on body surface area, is 25 mg/m² orally twice daily, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

2.2 Administration

KOSELUGO is available in two dosage forms: KOSELUGO capsules and KOSELUGO oral granules. Prescribe KOSELUGO oral granules for patients who have difficulty swallowing whole capsules.

KOSELUGO Capsules

Administer KOSELUGO capsules to patients who can swallow a whole capsule.
Swallow KOSELUGO capsules whole. Do not open, chew or crush KOSELUGO capsules.
KOSELUGO capsules may be administered with or without food.

KOSELUGO Oral Granules

Administer KOSELUGO oral granules to patients who have difficulty swallowing a whole capsule.
Sprinkle KOSELUGO oral granules on or mix with a small amount (about 1 to 3 teaspoons) of smooth yogurt, or fruit puree containing the following fruits: apple, banana, pear, or strawberry and consume within 30 minutes of preparation. If not consumed within 30 minutes of preparation, discard and prepare a new dose. If a dose has been partially consumed within 30 minutes of preparation, discard remainder of the dose and do not prepare a new dose, aim to complete dosing within 30 minutes next time.
The KOSELUGO oral granules should be free-flowing. Do NOT use if the oral granules are clumped or stuck inside the capsule shell. Instruct the patient or caregiver to contact their pharmacy if this happens.

### The importance of the global health strategy from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [^113r5XBz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2012). Low credibility.

The world in which we live is more interconnected today than ever before. In an era when we can get anywhere on the planet in less than a day, and when the flow of persons and goods stretches worldwide, we must ensure that the systems for preventing, detecting, and containing disease stretch equally far. Likewise, we need to remain just as vigilant when it comes to safeguarding the food and drug products that go into our bodies.

For an illustration, let us look at Dulles Airport, a port of entry to the Washington, DC metropolitan region. In 2010, more than 6.4 million international passengers came through Dulles, and that is just one of three major airports in the area. Each day upward of one million persons drive across our borders, arrive at U.S. airports, or dock in our ports. What is more, we import half of the fruit and more than three-fourths of the seafood we consume, often from countries with far fewer safety controls than we enjoy here at home.

### Fruit juice in infants, children, and adolescents: current recommendations [^1111fwzJ]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Fruit juice consumption trends — between 2008 and 2013, sales of juice and juice drinks have declined, yet children and adolescents continue to be the highest consumers, and data reveal that children 2 to 18 years of age consume nearly half of their fruit intake as juice, which lacks dietary fiber and predisposes to excessive calorie intake, although this proportion has decreased in recent years.

### Enzyme-treated orange pomace alters acute glycemic response to orange juice [^1128F9fQ]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on our preliminary data, 10 subjects would have 80% power (α = 0.05) to detect a 30.9% difference between group glucose 2h AUC means. Twelve healthy subjects between the ages of 20 and 45 years were recruited to ensure 10 subjects were available for the final analysis. During the screening visit, inclusion criteria were assessed, including body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 24.9 kg/m², weight ≥ 50 kg and being a nonsmoker. Subjects were excluded from the study if they had fasting blood glucose > 5.6 mmol L⁻¹, had an eating disorder or were taking medications or who had gastic diseases/gastric bypass or dietary supplements that would interfere with study outcomes.

Qualified subjects were randomized to receive a control or test drink on two separate study visits (3–7 days apart). After evaluating subject's general health, fasting status (10–12 h) and compliance, a catheter was placed in subjects' non-dominant arm for multiple blood sampling. After baseline sample collection, subjects consumed their assigned study juice drink based on a randomization sequence provided by the study statistician. Drinks were finished within 10 min. The study treatments included a scale-weighed serving of OJ without pulp or OJ with 5 g of pomace fiber. OPF (250 g) and OJ (252 g) were ingested, which is ~250 mL. The study treatments were matched for total available carbohydrate, but differed by the content of dietary fiber, which mostly was accounted for by the addition of the orange pomace in the test drink (Table 1). Enzymatic colorimetric method (Randox, UK) and immunoturbidimetric (Kamiya Bimedicals, USA) methods were used to analyze plasma glucose and insulin, respectively, using automated clinical analyzer (Randox Daytona, UK). Intra-assay % coefficient variation for glucose and insulin was 1.17% and 3.02%, respectively.

### Origin and de novo domestication of sweet orange [^113UMb6J]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Notably, all sweet orange accessions coalesced into a single point on the PCA plot, closer to the sour orange group collected from the NYW region than to the other groups (Fig. 1c). These data provide evidence that sour oranges and sweet oranges are closely related. To explore the genetic constituents of sour oranges and sweet oranges, we analyzed the whole genome with species-specific SNPsto evaluate the genomic patterns of sweet oranges, sour oranges, mandarins and pummelos. We confirmed that sweet orange accessions shared a nearly identical genetic background differing(Supplementary Fig. 4), which is consistent with most sweet orange accessions arising from somatic mutations. We found that the genome of sour oranges is almost exclusively heterozygous with one allele from mandarin and the other allele from pummelo, which is consistent with the idea that sour oranges are F₁ hybrids derived from a cross between mandarin and pummelo (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Notably, most of the genomes from sour oranges and sweet oranges shared the same large heterozygous segments derived from mandarin and pummelo. However, sweet oranges differed from sour oranges in that they contain more homozygous segments from mandarin (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). We have identified one unknown orange accession from Hunan Province ('TJH2') that produces fruit that is similar to the fruit produced by sweet oranges in terms of fruit size, color and qualities (Extended Data Fig. 3). The genomic landscape of 'TJH2' was similar to that of sweet oranges, although not identical (Extended Data Fig. 3). These results indicate that sweet oranges are abundant and that similar accessions of sweet orange are present in the NYW region.

### Etravirine (Intelence) [^112b8vgr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients

The recommended oral dosage of INTELENCE for adult patients is 200 mg (one 200 mg tablet or two 100 mg tablets) taken twice daily following a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to INTELENCE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage During Pregnancy

The recommended oral dosage of INTELENCE for pregnant individuals is 200 mg (one 200 mg tablet or two 100 mg tablets) taken twice daily following a meal [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

2.3 Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients (2 Years to Less Than 18 Years of Age)

The recommended dosage of INTELENCE for pediatric patients 2 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg is based on body weight (see Table 1) not exceeding the recommended adult dosage. INTELENCE should be taken orally, following a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to INTELENCE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Method of Administration

Instruct patients to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole with liquid such as water. Patients who are unable to swallow the INTELENCE tablet(s) whole may disperse the tablet(s) in water. Instruct the patient to do the following:

place the tablet(s) in 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of water, or at least enough liquid to cover the medication,
stir well until the water looks milky,
add approximately 15 mL (1 tablespoon) of liquid. Water may be used but other liquids, such as orange juice or milk, may improve taste. Patients should not place the tablets in orange juice or milk without first adding water. The use of warm (temperature greater than 104°F [greater than 40°C]) or carbonated beverages should be avoided.
drink the mixture immediately,
rinse the glass several times with orange juice, milk or water and completely swallow the rinse each time to make sure the patient takes the entire dose.

### Flavour chemicals in a sample of non-cigarette tobacco products without explicit flavour names sold in New York city in 2015 [^117FtRva]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Banned in the ordinance

§17–715 Sale of flavored tobacco products prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale any flavored tobacco product except in a tobacco bar.

Enforcement of the NYC law began in November 2010, and citations for violations have been based on use of explicit flavour names and/or images on the packages. Some NYC retailers, however, are now selling colourfully packaged tobacco products that, although not carrying explicit flavour indicators, smell distinctly of flavour variations other than tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen. Although cigarillos labelled 'Blueberry' and 'Strawberry' have largely disappeared from store shelves, noticeably flavoured 'Blue' and 'Pink' cigarillos are increasingly common in NYC. Cigarillos under the brand name Show, labelled 'Ba Boom', are sold in green/black/orange packages. Bluntville branded 'Piff' cigarillos are sold in purple packages, 'blunt' and 'piff' having cannabis connotations. Although NYC rules pertaining to the flavour prohibition allow for sensory testing to identify flavoured products, this enforcement mechanism has not been used to date. Nationally, Viola et al note that ' the cigar industry may be pre-emptively steering away from overt flavour descriptors, instead relying on more generic names on their packaging in anticipation of a [federal] ban on flavoured cigars '. Manufacturers may also be anticipating a proliferation of local sales restrictions on flavoured products, taking advantage of the commercial convenience of selecting names that can be used in any jurisdiction. Also, it cannot be excluded that some manufacturers may simply believe that there is consumer demand for products with colourful or catchy names that do not explicitly reference flavours, though for cigarettes, Lempert and Glantzpresent arguments that tobacco companies do use colour on packaging and labelling as a replacement for now-prohibited descriptive words such as 'light' and 'mild'.

### Bedaquiline fumarate (Sirturo) [^1168dTuL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients that the following serious side effects can occur with SIRTURO: heart rhythm abnormalities, death and/or hepatitis. In addition, advise patients about other potential side effects: nausea, vomiting, joint pain, increased transaminases, dizziness, headache, myalgia, diarrhea, increased blood amylase, hemoptysis, chest pain, anorexia, rash, and/or abdominal pain. Additional testing may be needed to monitor or reduce the likelihood of adverse effects.

Compliance with Treatment

Advise patients to take SIRTURO in combination with other antimycobacterial drugs as prescribed. Emphasize compliance with the full course of therapy. Advise patients that skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that their mycobacterium may develop resistance and the disease will not be treatable by SIRTURO or other antimycobacterial drugs in the future.

If a dose is missed during the first 2 weeks of treatment, advise patients not to make up the missed dose but to continue the usual dosing schedule. From Week 3 onwards, if a dose is missed, advise patients to take the missed dose as soon as possible, and then resume the 3 times a week regimen.

Ensure that the total dose of SIRTURO during a 7-day period does not exceed the recommended weekly dose (with at least 24 hours between each intake).

Administration Instructions

Advise patients to take SIRTURO with food.

Advise patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets that SIRTURO 20 mg tablet can be administered by the following methods:

Dispersed in water and the mixture administered immediately. To aid with administration, the dispersed mixture in water can be further mixed with a beverage (e.g., water, milk products, apple juice, orange juice, cranberry juice or carbonated beverage) or soft food (e.g., yogurt, apple sauce, mashed banana or porridge) and then administered immediately,
Crushed and mixed with soft food and the mixture administered immediately,
Administered through a feeding tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Use with Alcohol and other Medications

Instruct patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products.

Advise patients to discuss with their physician the other medications they are taking and other medical conditions before starting treatment with SIRTURO.

### The color of skin: orange diseases of the skin, nails, and mucosa [^115KYSte]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous disease can present with lesions of all colors of the visible spectrum. Lesions of the skin, nail, and mucous membranes with an orange color can be due to a variety of etiologies. The conditions may appear as purely orange, yellow-orange, red-orange, tan, or brown with an orange hue. The orange color may also present as a transient phase of a disease process. As with all dermatologic pathology, a key way to distinguish orange-colored lesions is by distribution and morphology. The sclera, palate, lips, gingiva, and nails may also be involved. A literature review using PubMed with keywords, including orange, skin, mucosa, cutaneous, xanthoderma, and granuloma, was conducted to gather all dermatologic conditions that can present with an orange color. The relevant diseases were categorized by etiology and include inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and exogenous causes.

### Exposure to agent orange and risk of bladder cancer among US veterans [^1144f3V3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

To date, limited data exist regarding the association between Agent Orange and bladder cancer, and the Institute of Medicine concluded that the association between exposure to Agent Orange and bladder cancer outcomes is an area of needed research.

Objective

To examine the association between bladder cancer risk and exposure to Agent Orange among male Vietnam veterans.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This nationwide Veterans Affairs (VA) retrospective cohort study assesses the association between exposure to Agent Orange and bladder cancer risk among 2 517 926 male Vietnam veterans treated in the VA Health System nationwide from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from December 14, 2021, to May 3, 2023.

Exposure

Agent Orange.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Veterans exposed to Agent Orange were matched in a 1:3 ratio to unexposed veterans on age, race and ethnicity, military branch, and year of service entry. Risk of bladder cancer was measured by incidence. Aggressiveness of bladder cancer was measured by muscle-invasion status using natural language processing.

Results

Among the 2 517 926 male veterans (median age at VA entry, 60.0 years [IQR, 56.0–64.0 years]) who met inclusion criteria, there were 629 907 veterans (25.0%) with Agent Orange exposure and 1 888 019 matched veterans (75.0%) without Agent Orange exposure. Agent Orange exposure was associated with a significantly increased risk of bladder cancer, although the association was very slight (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02–1.06). When stratified by median age at VA entry, Agent Orange was not associated with bladder cancer risk among veterans older than the median age but was associated with increased bladder cancer risk among veterans younger than the median age (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04–1.10). Among veterans with a diagnosis of bladder cancer, Agent Orange was associated with lower odds of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85–0.98).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study among male Vietnam veterans, there was a modestly increased risk of bladder cancer-but not aggressiveness of bladder cancer-among those exposed to Agent Orange. These findings suggest an association between Agent Orange exposure and bladder cancer, although the clinical relevance of this was unclear.

### Exposure to agent orange and hepatocellular carcinoma among US military personnel [^117PAKwP]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Study Population

We identified 296 505 male veterans during the Vietnam War who were 18 years or older at the time of deployment (222 545 White individuals [75.1%] and 44 342 Black individuals [15.0%]). Of these veterans, 170 090 (57%) had AO exposure (mean [SD] age, 21.62 [3.49] years; 131 552 White individuals [83.2%] and 22 767 Black individuals [14.4%]) (Table 1). ALD was the most prevalent cause of chronic liver disease (126 098 [42.5%]), followed by viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV) (106 664 [36.0%]), and NAFLD or NASH (36 761 [12.4%]). The metabolic syndrome was also prevalent with 160 190 patients (54.0%) being diagnosed with diabetes, 260 484 (87.9%) with dyslipidemia, and 258 973 (87.3%) with hypertension. While statistically significant because of the large sample size, there did not appear to be a clinical difference in active smoking status (109 689 of 126 413 [86.8%] vs 146 061 of 170 090 [85.8%]; P < .001) nor alcohol use (54 147 of 126 413 [42.8%] vs 71 951 of 170 090 [42.3%]; P = 0.004) among veterans based on AO exposure (Table 1). Cirrhosis was more commonly found in patients who were not exposed to AO, compared with patients who were exposed to AO (16 611 of 126 413 [13.1%] vs 19 266 of 170 090 [11.3%]; P < .001). Most veterans who were exposed to AO had been deployed for 1 year or less (175 796 veterans; [60.9%]; cumulative percent, 60.9%), 91 014 veterans (31.5%; cumulative percent, 92.4%) had been deployed for 1 to 2 years, 13 510 veterans (4.7%; cumulative percent, 97.1%) had been deployed 2 to 3 years, 5031 veterans (1.7%; cumulative percent, 98.8%) had been deployed 3 to 4 years, and 3428 veterans (1.2%; cumulative percent, 100%) had been deployed 4 or more years. Mean (SD) deployment time was 1.11 (0.66) years.

### Effects of red orange juice intake on endothelial function and inflammatory markers in adult subjects with increased cardiovascular risk [^111gwMz9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Oxidative and inflammatory stresses are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with improved health and reduced cardiovascular risk. Red oranges have a high content of antioxidant and antiinflammatory substances, but there is a paucity of data concerning their effects on cardiovascular biomarkers in subjects with increased cardiovascular risk.

Objective

We investigated the effect of red orange juice intake on endothelial function, oxidative stress, and markers of inflammation in subjects with increased cardiovascular risk.

Design

Nineteen nondiabetic subjects with increased cardiovascular risk (aged 27–56 y) were included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind crossover study and compared with 12 healthy, nonobese control subjects. In 2 periods of 7 d each with a 3-d interval, each participant alternatively received 500 mL red orange juice/d and 500 mL placebo/d in a random sequence. All measurements were performed in the morning after overnight fasting.

Results

Endothelial function, which was measured as flow-mediated dilation, significantly improved and was normalized (5.7% compared with 7.9%; P < 0.005) after 1 wk of red orange juice consumption. Similarly, concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-α significantly decreased (P < 0.001). Red orange juice had no significant effect on nitric oxide plasma concentrations.

Conclusion

A 7-d consumption of red orange juice ameliorates endothelial function and reduces inflammation in nondiabetic subjects with increased cardiovascular risk. This trial was registered at biomedcentral.com as ISRCTN39987296.

### Orange juice substantially reduces the bioavailability of the β-adrenergic-blocking agent celiprolol [^114AxqBP]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Grapefruit juice was recently found to decrease plasma concentrations of the beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent celiprolol. Our objective was to investigate the effect of orange juice on the pharmacokinetics of celiprolol in healthy subjects.

Methods

In a randomized crossover study with 2 phases and a washout of 2 weeks, 10 healthy volunteers ingested either 200 mL normal-strength orange juice or water 3 times a day for 2 days. On the morning of day 3, 1 hour after ingestion of 200 mL orange juice or water, each subject ingested 100 mg celiprolol with either 200 mL orange juice or water. In addition, 200 mL orange juice or water was ingested at 4, 10, 22, and 27 hours after celiprolol intake. The concentrations of celiprolol in plasma and its excretion into urine were measured up to 33 hours after its dosing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were recorded up to 10 hours.

Results

Orange juice reduced the mean peak plasma concentration of celiprolol by 89% (P < .01) and the mean area under the plasma celiprolol concentration-time curve by 83% (P < .01). The time to peak concentration of celiprolol increased from 4 to 6 hours (P < .05), and the half-life was prolonged from 4.6 to 10.8 hours (P = 0.05) after ingestion of orange juice. Orange juice reduced the urinary excretion of celiprolol by 77% (P < .01). No significant differences were observed in the hemodynamic variables between the phases.

Conclusions

Orange juice substantially reduces the bioavailability of celiprolol, but the mechanism of this interaction remains to be resolved. For example, modulation of intestinal pH and of function of transporters implicated in the absorption of celiprolol may be involved. Because of the great extent of the orange juice-celiprolol interaction and a wide use of orange juice, this interaction is likely to have clinical importance in some patients, although hemodynamic consequences were not seen in young healthy subjects.

### Agent orange exposure and dementia diagnosis in US veterans of the Vietnam era [^114TRVvN]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Agent Orange is a powerful herbicide that contains dioxin and was used during the Vietnam War. Although prior studies have found that Agent Orange exposure is associated with increased risk of a wide range of conditions, including neurologic disorders (eg, Parkinson disease), metabolic disorders (eg, type 2 diabetes), and systemic amyloidosis, the association between Agent Orange and dementia remains unclear.

Objective

To examine the association between Agent Orange exposure and incident dementia diagnosis in US veterans of the Vietnam era.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included Veterans Health Administration data from October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2015, with up to 14 years of follow-up. Analyses were performed from July 2018 to October 2020. A 2% random sample of US veterans of the Vietnam era who received inpatient or outpatient Veterans Health Administration care, excluding those with dementia at baseline, those without follow-up visits, and those with unclear Agent Orange exposure status.

Exposures

Presumed Agent Orange exposure documented in electronic health record.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Fine-Gray competing risk models were used to compare the time to dementia diagnosis (with age as the time scale) for veterans with vs without presumed Agent Orange exposure (as per medical records), adjusting for demographic variables and medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

Results

The total sample was 511 189 individuals; after exclusions, 316 351 were included in analyses. Veterans were mostly male (n = 309 889 [98.0%]) and had a mean (SD) age of 62 (6.6) years; 38 121 (12.1%) had presumed Agent Orange exposure. Prevalence of most conditions, including Parkinson disease, diabetes, and amyloidosis, was similar at baseline among veterans with and without Agent Orange exposure. After adjusting for demographic variables and comorbidities, veterans exposed to Agent Orange were nearly twice as likely as those not exposed to receive a dementia diagnosis over a mean (SD) of 5.5 (3.8) years of follow-up (1918 of 38 121 [5.0%] vs 6886 of 278 230 [2.5%]; adjusted hazard ratio: 1.68 [95% CI, 1.59–1.77]). Veterans with Agent Orange exposure developed dementia at a mean of 1.25 years earlier (at a mean [SD] age of 67.5 [7.0] vs 68.8 [8.0] years).

Conclusions and Relevance

Veterans with Agent Orange exposure were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia, even after adjusting for the competing risk of death, demographic variables, and medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Additional studies are needed to examine potential mechanisms underlying the association between Agent Orange exposure and dementia.

All-terrain vehicle (ATV) youth — alcohol and drugs as risk factors — Alcohol plays a significant role in many ATV crashes involving adults and increases the likelihood of injury; although much less common in pediatric crashes overall, one-fifth of the deaths among victims 16 and 17 years of age who were drivers of the ATV involved alcohol. Recreational drugs and some prescription and over-the-counter medications are also likely to increase the risk for ATV crash but are poorly studied.

### Psychoactive substance use by truck drivers: a systematic review [^111sDjEF]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Alcohol intake is legal in the countries where the studies were conducted. However, legislation normally forbids alcohol intake prior to or while driving motor vehicles. The Worldwide Brewing Alliance reports that the maximum blood ethanol concentration for professional drivers in the countries where the studies were carried out is as follows: Italy 0.5 g/L, the USA 0.4 g/L, Japan 0.3 g/L, and Australia, Brazil, France and Norway 0.2 g/L. These limits, which are related to cultural and oversight issues, partly explain differences in alcohol intake and driving behaviours.

The prevalence of other important psychoactive substances (amphetamines, cocaine and marijuana) also varied. The study carried out by Mongkolsirichaikul et al in Thailand stands out for identifying an intake of amphetamines in urine samples (82.5%) well above the average compared with other studies using biological samples. According to these authors, the excessive work hours (around 20–22 h) and possible addiction may be the reasons for these high levels.

Self-reporting was a method less frequently used to measure the intake of substances such as amphetamines, marijuana and cocaine given the difficulty in obtaining such information through interviews, especially since these are illicit drugs. Development and validation of questionnaires for obtaining such information anonymously may help further studies that attempt to determine the intake of illicit psychoactive substances in a more reliable way, in addition to representing a simpler and less costly methodology.

Since surveys show a higher prevalence of the intake of psychoactive substances, they are probably more reliable for identifying factors associated with the intake of these substances. These factors included less resting time and working night shifts, possibly because the workers need to resort to strategies to keep awake, among which the intake of psychoactive substances stands out. Lower incomes and productivity-based earningswere also associated with the use of these substances, which could be explained by the possible motivation of the drivers to increase their income. In fact, a study conducted in Brazil found that truck drivers with higher incomes and engaged in longer trips were more prone to use amphetamines, probably to remain awake to face their unfavourable working conditions. The authors also highlight the higher vulnerability of these individuals to other diseases and the lack of policies that address improvements in their health and working conditions. The association between the use of amphetamines and the involvement in accidentsconfirms the risks of using these substances while driving a vehicle.

### High-fiber orange juice as a nutrition supplement in women: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of tolerance and effectiveness [^112ALuM4]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The daily consumption of dietary fiber is frequently below suggested recommendations. Using a double-blind, controlled, randomized study, we assessed the efficiency and tolerance of a fiber-enriched orange juice to supplement fiber intake in women.

Materials and Methods

After 1 week of noninterventional observation, 192 healthy adult women ingested 400 mL of orange juice for 21 days, which either was not (placebo group) or was enriched with fiber (fiber group). Orange juice ingestion was registered daily and controlled for each week during the study period. Macronutrient, fiber, and energy intake were determined using a 3-day food record, validated food chemical composition databases, and the "Pro Diet" software. Gastrointestinal symptoms were self-evaluated daily by scoring 4 grades of symptom intensity and using a visual analog scale to grade pain severity.

Results

No changes were observed for macronutrient and energy ingestion. For the placebo group (n = 97), the total fiber intake record was under the daily recommended value. In contrast, the fiber group (n = 95) displayed higher comparative values of total and soluble fiber consumption (P ≤ .001), achieving the daily recommended values of fiber intake. Both groups reported an increased frequency of slight bloating and rumbles over time (P ≤ .05). The fiber group also experienced a higher frequency of slight flatulence over time (P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Consumption of fiber-enriched orange juice was efficient to achieve the daily fiber intake recommendation for women, was not accompanied by intense adverse events, and may represent a suitable method to supplement fiber intake in woman.

Nutrition and diet — fruit juice intake in infants and children — Two longitudinal WIC studies reported that the increased risk of obesity with increased juice intake was strongest among children who were already overweight, and the AAP recommends that a serving of natural, unsweetened fruit juice be limited to 4–6 fluid ounces, with infants able to receive 1 serving per day after age 6 months as part of a meal or snack; after infancy, children ages 1–6 years should receive no more than 1 serving of unsweetened fruit juice per day, and children ages 7–18 years should limit juice consumption to no more than 2 servings per day. This evidence review identified no additional studies in this subject area for these age groups.

### Polygenic risk, agent orange exposure, and lymphoid neoplasms in the veterans affairs million veteran program [^117LzCgu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Agent Orange (AO), a toxic herbicide mixture contaminated with carcinogenic dioxin, was widely used during the Vietnam War. Although epidemiologic evidence suggests AO exposure is associated with increased lymphoid malignant neoplasm risk, the details of this association and its potential interaction with genetic factors remain unclear.

Objective

To evaluate (1) whether AO exposure was associated with increased risk of lymphoid malignant neoplasms, (2) associations of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in specific lymphoid malignant neoplasms, and (3) whether there was a genetic component × exposure interaction associated with increased risk of developing lymphoid malignant neoplasms.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A case-control study of 255 155 US veterans enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program was conducted with available genotype, AO exposure information, and lymphoid malignant neoplasm diagnosis from January 1, 1965, through June 11, 2024.

Exposures

AO exposure status (based on self-reported survey) and PRS derived from genome-wide association studies of lymphoid malignant neoplasms.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Risk of developing lymphoid malignant neoplasm subtypes: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

Results

A total of 255 155 non-Hispanic White veterans (median [IQR] age, 67 [61–74] years; 235 895 [92.5%] male) with both PRS and AO data were included in this study. AO exposure was associated with an increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.40–1.84), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03–1.53), follicular lymphoma (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.39–2.11), and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.35–1.86). Similarly, PRS was associated with all subtypes: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.70–1.93), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.21), follicular lymphoma (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.21–1.47), marginal zone lymphoma (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04–1.32), and multiple myeloma (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31–1.52). No significant PRS×AO interactions were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

To date, this is the largest case-control study of AO exposure and risk of lymphoid malignant neoplasm subtypes and the only study to investigate an AO×gene association with risk. The study found independent associations of both genetic predisposition and AO exposure on several lymphoid malignant neoplasm subtypes.

### Cryptosporidiosis associated with ozonated apple cider [^116pGuz5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

No employees from the orchard or the separate cider pressing facility reported diarrhea from September 1 to November 7, 2003 (date of interview). The water supply for both was negative for Cryptosporidium; employees used "few" dropped apples for cider production. During production, an ozonating apparatus (Golden Buffalo Company, Orange, CA, USA) was used to treat the cider, which was then stored in refrigerated tanks. Most cider was ozonated a second time, then sold in plastic jugs on-site and at nearby grocery stores. Remaining cider was sold through a tap in the orchard's store. In contrast to jugged cider, this cider was not reozonated.

We performed a Cryptosporidium PCR on all 14 available samples from the laboratory-confirmed case-patients. Twelve (85.7%) of these were PCR positive; 11 of these 12 samples were identified as Cryptosporidium parvum and 1 as the cervine Cryptosporidium genotype (W4). Subtype identification of stool samples yielded 2 closely related C. parvum subtypes (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA17G2R1).

The remaining contents of a jug of cider A that a laboratory-confirmed case-patient had partially drunk were also positive by PCR for C. parvum subtype IIaA17G2R1. This case-patient's stool sample yielded the same subtype of C. parvum, as did 4 other case-patients' stool samples; all of these persons drank cider A in the 2 weeks before illness onset.

### Polygenic risk, agent orange exposure, and lymphoid neoplasms in the veterans affairs million veteran program [^116vsZqN]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are the most common hematologic malignant neoplasms (2.9%) diagnosed in US veterans using the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Male US Army and Marine Corps Vietnam veterans have increased mortality (proportional mortality ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.17–3.79) from NHLs compared with non-Vietnam veterans. Exposures, including Agent Orange (AO), during the Vietnam War could put military personnel at higher risk of death from certain cancers. AO was a toxic herbicide mixture that was contaminated by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a carcinogenic byproduct. The World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that there is sufficient evidence that TCDD is associated with increased risk of NHLs and other cancers based on human nested case-control and cohort studies as well as animal carcinogenicity data.TCDD exposure induces proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as immune suppression, possibly leading to increased risk of lymphoid malignant neoplasms. Although the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a comprehensive analysis of epidemiologic studies that suggest there are sufficient data to support an association between AO and lymphoid malignant neoplasm risk, supportive studies related to AO exposure are small without analysis of specific subtypes.

In addition to environmental agents, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed a genetic predisposition in the development of lymphoid malignant neoplasms. Most loci are concentrated in pathways related to immune regulation, apoptosis, and regulation of oncogene expression. For instance, human leukocyte antigen genes, vital in immune response and autoimmune disease, are associated with lymphoid malignant neoplasms. In addition, BCL2 is a firmly established risk locus in multiple lymphomas and involved in apoptosis of lymphocytes. The genetic risk factors can be summed into a score that measures the degree of risk based on the number of individual risk variants that a person has. This score is called the polygenic risk score (PRS), with the higher scores indicating higher risk of disease. Although GWASs have identified common and unique susceptibility loci in subtypes of lymphoid malignant neoplasms, none are associated with all lymphoid malignant neoplasm subtypes, which highlights the heterogeneity of lymphomagenesis. Moreover, a limitation is that previous GWASs did not take environmental and other nongenetic exposures into account. Lymphomagenesis is likely due to a combination of several types of effectors.

### Flavour capsule heat-sticks for heated tobacco products [^1163qPe4]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs), or 'heat-not-burn tobacco products', are battery-powered devices that deliver nicotine to the user by heating a tobacco stick, instead of combusting tobacco like conventional cigarettes or heating liquids like electronic cigarettes. Philip Morris International (PMI) launched its HTP, I Quit Ordinary Smoking (IQOS), in Japan in November 2014. Since then, PMI has rapidly expanded the IQOS market. PMI's CEO has publicly expressed a belief in HTPs' commercial success in upcoming years. As of July 2018, IQOS is sold in 37 countries, with evidence of rapidly increasing sales. To help ensure that potentially reduced harm products like HTPs benefit public health, the tobacco control community must monitor industry behaviour around HTPs.

In November 2017, KT&G, the largest Korean tobacco company, introduced the product innovation of tobacco sticks with flavour capsules for HTPs (hereafter capsule heat-sticks) into the Korean market. The filters for capsule heat-sticks include a small case that contains flavouring agents, and consumers are to crush the capsule at any time during a smoking session to flavour the aerosol. Flavour capsules for conventional cigarettes work the same way and were first introduced in Japan in 2007, followed by their rapid introduction and growth in cigarette market share around the world. Capsule cigarette flavours originally included only menthol, but flavours have expanded to include fruits (eg, mango, cherry, grape, lemon, strawberry and orange) and drinks (mojito). Some capsule cigarettes even include two capsules with different flavours in the filter, and some brand varieties include multiple capsule flavours for different cigarette sticks inside a single pack. In Korea, there are at least 35 flavour capsule cigarette brand varieties available.

### Origin and de novo domestication of sweet orange [^111K3Laz]. Nature Genetics (2025). High credibility.

Elucidating the origin of sweet orange

We used the haplotype variations identified from the whole-genome resequencing data for 305 citrus accessions to assess the extent of their relatedness to sweet orange. We determined that sour oranges are divided into three groups ('SSO1', 'SSO2' and 'SSO3') based on clustering and kinship (Supplementary Table 12). The kinship matrix indicates that Ponkan/Jiankan mandarins are the most closely associated with sweet oranges with the exception of sweet orange-derived cultivars, as indicated by the number of genomic fragments shared between these accessions (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, a group of sour orange accessions belonging to the 'SSO2' cluster was closely related to sweet orange (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Tables 12 and 13). Jiankan mandarin is a landrace that is currently rarely cultivated and is genetically similar to the widely cultivated Ponkan mandarin (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). Both Ponkan and Jiankan mandarins are distributed in the NYW region. Identity by state (IBS) and identity by descent (IBD) analyses based on whole-genome SNP data indicated that sour oranges, Ponkan mandarin and cultivars derived from sweet orange were more closely related to sweet orange than pummelos and other mandarins. Indeed, the IBS values among sweet oranges were the highest (> 0.9). The IBS values of sour oranges, Ponkan mandarin and sweet orange-derived cultivars (> 0.8) were greater than those of other mandarins and pummelos (< 0.8; Fig. 3b). IBD analysis estimates the likelihood that two alleles from two different species were inherited from the same parent. The probability of several sour oranges originating from the NYW region sharing a set of chromosomes with sweet oranges is close to 100%. These data are consistent with a parental relationship between sour oranges and sweet oranges (Fig. 3c). We also calculated allele sharing among accessions, using proportions from SNP data. A pair of accessions that shares 0, 1 or 2 alleles based on an IBS analysis were classified as P0, P1 and P2, respectively. The P0 value of sweet orange and 'TJH1' (a sour orange from the NYW region) was only 0.02%; the P0 value of sweet orange and Ponkan mandarins was 0.18% (Supplementary Fig. 17). These data indicate that sour oranges, Ponkan mandarin, and sweet oranges are highly related. For comparison, we used clementine mandarin, a hybrid between sweet orange and willow-leaf mandarin, with a P0 value of 0.04% as a reference for the parentage analysis. On the basis of these data, we hypothesize that sweet orange originated from hybridization between an ancient sour orange accession and a Ponkan-like mandarin in the NYW region. An analysis of the chloroplast genomes of the Citrus species revealed that sweet orange is more closely related to sour oranges and provides evidence that sour oranges are probably the maternal parent of sweet orange (Supplementary Fig. 18).

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with VYVANSE, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating VYVANSE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

2.2 General Administration Information

Take VYVANSE orally in the morning with or without food; avoid afternoon doses because of the potential for insomnia. VYVANSE may be administered in one of the following ways:

Information for VYVANSE capsules:

Swallow VYVANSE capsules whole, or
Open capsules, empty and mix the entire contents with yogurt, water, or orange juice. If the contents of the capsule include any compacted powder, a spoon may be used to break apart the powder. The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. Consume the entire mixture immediately. It should not be stored. The active ingredient dissolves completely once dispersed; however, a film containing the inactive ingredients may remain in the glass or container once the mixture is consumed.

Information for VYVANSE chewable tablets:

VYVANSE chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.

VYVANSE capsules can be substituted with VYVANSE chewable tablets on a unit per unit/mg per mg basis (for example, 30 mg capsules for 30 mg chewable tablet) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not take anything less than one capsule or chewable tablet per day. A single dose should not be divided.

2.3 Dosage for Treatment of ADHD

The recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older is 30 mg once daily in the morning. Dosage may be adjusted in increments of 10 mg or 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals up to maximum recommended dosage of 70 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.4 Dosage for Treatment of Moderate to Severe BED in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults is 30 mg once daily to be titrated in increments of 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended target dose of 50 mg to 70 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 70 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Discontinue VYVANSE if binge eating does not improve.

### Relation of different fruit and vegetable sources with incident cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^116fuqXD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Review Manager version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Denmark) and STATA version 13.0 (StataCorp, TX) were used to conduct all analyses. We prespecified in our analysis plan the use of the generic inverse variance method with DerSimonian and Laird random effects models to pool the natural log‐transformed RRs of extreme quantiles, comparing the highest versus the lowest (reference) exposures. 20 On the basis of a deviation from our prespecified analysis plan requested by the statistical reviewer, we present the generic inverse variance with fixed effects models as the primary analysis and the DerSimonian and Laird random effects models as a secondary analysis in the Supplemental Material. Hazard ratios and odds ratios (as cumulative incidence < 10%) were considered equivalent to RR. 21 Studies that provided RR on a continuous scale (ie, per dose increment) were scaled to the highest quantile reported for the exposure in the respective cohort as necessary. Test for differences between fruit and vegetable categories were conducted in RevMan, with a test for subgroup differences, with P < 0.05 indicating a significant difference between fruit categories or vegetable categories on a given outcome. We also conducted a dose‐response analysis. A random‐effects linear dose‐response was modeled using a generalized least square trend (glst) for estimation of summarized dose‐response data, as per Greenland and Longnecker 22 and Orsini. 23 A 2‐stage multivariate random‐effects method was used to model a nonlinear association using restricted cubic splines with 3 knots. 23 A Wald test was used to evaluate linear and nonlinear dose‐response trends. The median dose of each quantile was used, and when not provided we chose the midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries for each quantile as the assigned dose. For open‐ended lower and upper quantiles, we defined lowest and highest boundary as the same as the adjacent category cutoff. Servings per day were calculated, with one serving defined as 80 g of fruits and/or vegetables and their categories, with the exception of citrus fruit (122 g), fruit juice (125 g), and green leafy vegetables (88 g), or unless otherwise specified. 24 Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by the I² statistic. An I² ≥ 50% and P Q < 0.1 was considered evidence of substantial heterogeneity. 26, 27 Sensitivity analyses and a priori subgroup analyses were used to explore sources of heterogeneity. We performed sensitivity analyses by systematically removing each study with recalculation of the summary estimates. A priori subgroup analyses were conducted for all comparisons with ≥ 10 observations. Subgroup analyses included age (less than median versus median or greater), sex (males, females, and mixed), follow‐up years (less than median versus median or greater), number of covariates in extracted model (< 8 versus ≥ 8 covariates), exposure assessment tool (validated Food Frequency Questionnaire [FFQ], unvalidated FFQ, and food record), risk of bias score (< 6 versus ≥ 6), and country of data collection. Wald test in metaregression was used to assess differences within each subgroup. Because of the exploratory intent of our subgroup analyses, we did not prespecify adjustment for the false discovery rate in our prespecified analysis plan. On the basis of a deviation from our prespecified analysis plan requested by the statistical reviewer, we adjust for the false discovery rate in our subgroup analyses using the Holm‐Bonferroni procedure. If ≥ 10 cohort comparisons were available, then publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots for asymmetry and formal testing with the Begg and Egger tests. If publication bias was suspected (P < 0.10), the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method imputed missing study data in attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry. 27
