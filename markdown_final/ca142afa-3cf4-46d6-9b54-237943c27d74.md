## Question

what is best treatment for canker sores

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatment for canker sores (recurrent aphthous stomatitis), including severity stratification, evidence hierarchy, and a practical algorithm with safety and follow-up considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the diagnosis and distinguishing it from herpetic lesions. Then, I should verify the severity categories and how they guide therapy. Next, I will review first-line topical options and their evidence base, followed by second-line systemic therapies for refractory disease. After that, I need to check supportive care and triggers, and finally synthesize a stepwise algorithm with monitoring and counseling points, ensuring I anchor each step to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its natural history so I don't jump to conclusions. Canker sores are recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), idiopathic, noninfectious, painful oral ulcers that typically heal spontaneously in 7–10 days and are not caused by herpes simplex virus, which is a different condition with vesicles and keratinized mucosa involvement; I should double-check that distinction to avoid misdirected antiviral therapy [^113EaGwu] [^112QZDKw]. I need to ensure I classify severity correctly: minor ulcers are less than 10 mm and usually nonscarring, major ulcers are larger than 10 mm and may scar, and herpetiform ulcers are numerous pinpoint lesions that coalesce; this classification will shape the treatment ladder and expectations for healing time [^112QZDKw] [^115AZoga].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy so I prioritize interventions with the strongest support. High-quality evidence supports topical corticosteroids for pain reduction and faster healing, while moderate-quality evidence supports tetracycline mouth rinses and amlexanox; systemic agents have weaker or insufficient evidence and should be reserved for refractory cases, so I need to be cautious not to overstate their benefits [^115AZoga] [^112c8dvn] [^117GEAaG]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this hierarchy; contemporary reviews and primary care guidance consistently place topical corticosteroids first-line, which reinforces the approach I'm considering [^112c8dvn].

> For minor, uncomplicated RAS, I will now examine first-line therapy. Topical corticosteroids such as triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% paste or gel applied two to four times daily reduce pain and accelerate healing; I should confirm the indication and usage, and yes, Kourzeq (triamcinolone) is FDA-indicated for adjunctive treatment and temporary relief of symptoms of oral inflammatory and ulcerative lesions, which fits here [^114AwVAD]. Wait, let me verify alternatives if corticosteroids are not available or tolerated; tetracycline mouth rinses (e.g., doxycycline 100 mg dissolved in 10 mL water, rinse for 2 minutes and spit) have supportive evidence for pain and duration reduction, and amlexanox 5% paste is another option with anti-inflammatory effects, though access may vary by region [^115AZoga] [^112c8dvn]. I should also consider local anesthetics like lidocaine for short-term pain relief during meals, but I need to ensure patients understand these are symptomatic and do not hasten healing [^117D6T9F] [^111y9dJy].

> For major or persistent RAS, I need to ensure I escalate thoughtfully. High-potency topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol 0.05% gel applied two to three times daily can be more effective for larger, deeper ulcers; I should confirm that this is consistent with guideline-based escalation and it is, noting that dexamethasone elixir or augmented betamethasone gel are also used in practice for severe mucosal disease [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU]. But wait, what if topical therapy fails or disease is frequent and debilitating? Then I should consider systemic therapy with shared decision-making about risks and benefits, recognizing the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous [^117GEAaG].

> Now, I will review systemic options for refractory disease, but I should double-check the strength of evidence before recommending anything. Short-course systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 20–40 mg/day for 5–7 days with taper) can be used for severe outbreaks, acknowledging that recurrence is common when therapy stops and long-term use carries significant risks; this is consistent with expert reviews and aligns with the principle of using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^112c8dvn] [^112tn29V]. Colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily and dapsone 50–100 mg/day are immunomodulatory options supported by case series and expert opinion for complex aphthosis, but I need to monitor for adverse effects and ensure baseline labs and counseling are in place before prescribing [^113rGB9D] [^112c8dvn]. Thalidomide is effective but teratogenic and neuropathic; I should reserve it for severe, refractory cases with strict REMS and contraception counseling, and I must confirm that this caution is emphasized in the literature, which it is [^112c8dvn] [^113rGB9D]. Hold on, I should verify the Cochrane conclusion on systemic therapies; indeed, no single systemic intervention has definitive high-quality evidence, so expectations must be tempered and individualized [^117GEAaG].

> I need to ensure supportive care and trigger management are addressed because they can meaningfully reduce recurrence and symptom burden. Nonirritating oral hygiene with SLS-free toothpaste, avoidance of acidic, spicy, and rough foods, and stress reduction are reasonable strategies; I should confirm that SLS has been associated with RAS in patient-facing summaries, which it has, though high-quality causality data are limited [^112QZDKw]. Nutritional deficiencies such as iron, vitamin B12, and folate should be screened and corrected when clinically suspected, particularly in recurrent or atypical cases; this is consistent with primary care guidance and pathophysiologic plausibility [^112QZDKw]. Let me reconsider adjuncts; laser therapy may reduce pain and promote healing in selected patients, but access and evidence vary, so I should frame it as optional and context-dependent [^112QZDKw].

> Next, I should review the treatment algorithm and make sure it is coherent and actionable. For minor RAS, start with topical corticosteroids and add a tetracycline rinse or amlexanox if needed; for major or persistent RAS, escalate to high-potency topical corticosteroids; for refractory or frequent disease, consider short-course systemic corticosteroids for flares and, if inadequate, discuss colchicine or dapsone with appropriate monitoring; reserve thalidomide for severe, refractory cases with full risk counseling and contraception plans, documenting shared decision-making throughout [^112c8dvn] [^1129nbRU] [^113rGB9D]. I should double-check that each step aligns with the evidence strength previously outlined, and it does, with topical corticosteroids having the most consistent support and systemic options supported by lower-quality or indirect evidence [^115AZoga] [^117GEAaG].

> I will now examine safety, contraindications, and monitoring so I don't overlook harm. Topical corticosteroids can cause local mucosal thinning and secondary candidiasis; if white plaques or burning develop, I should pause steroids and treat candidiasis, then resume cautiously, which is consistent with general mucosal steroid precautions [^113EaGwu]. Systemic corticosteroids carry risks of hypertension, hyperglycemia, mood changes, and immunosuppression, so I should limit duration, screen for comorbidities, and avoid live vaccines during therapy, applying general principles of risk–benefit and lowest effective dose [^notfound]. For dapsone, I need baseline and periodic CBC to monitor for hemolysis and methemoglobinemia, and for thalidomide, I must enforce REMS, pregnancy testing, and reliable contraception given teratogenicity and neuropathy risks, which are well described in therapeutic ladders for complex aphthosis [^113rGB9D] [^112c8dvn].

> But wait, what if the ulcers are atypical, nonhealing, or accompanied by systemic features? I should confirm that I've considered mimics and associated conditions. Atypical features, extraoral involvement, ocular symptoms, or genital ulcers should prompt evaluation for Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus, or HIV, and RAS has recognized associations with immune regulatory pathways and systemic inflammatory diseases, so I need to ensure appropriate referrals and workup when red flags are present [^112QZDKw] [^117W79cM]. Hold on, I should verify that this emphasis on systemic screening is consistent with primary care and specialty guidance, and it is, particularly for complex or refractory presentations [^112c8dvn].

> Finally, I should synthesize the bottom line and ensure it matches the evidence. The best-supported treatment for typical minor canker sores is a topical corticosteroid such as triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% paste or gel applied two to four times daily, with tetracycline mouth rinses or amlexanox as reasonable alternatives when corticosteroids are not suitable; for major or persistent ulcers, escalate to high-potency topical corticosteroids; for refractory or frequent disease, consider short-course systemic corticosteroids and, if needed, colchicine or dapsone with appropriate monitoring, reserving thalidomide for severe, refractory cases with strict safety protocols, all while optimizing supportive care and addressing triggers and comorbidities through shared decision-making [^114AwVAD] [^115AZoga] [^112c8dvn] [^117GEAaG] [^112QZDKw].

---

The best treatment for canker sores is **topical corticosteroids** (e.g. triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% paste or dexamethasone 0.1% rinse) applied 2–4 times daily to reduce pain and speed healing [^115AZoga] [^112c8dvn]. For additional relief, use **topical anesthetics** (e.g. benzocaine or lidocaine) before meals and maintain good oral hygiene with SLS-free toothpaste [^112QZDKw]. Avoid spicy, acidic, or rough foods, and manage triggers such as stress or trauma [^112QZDKw] [^115AZoga]. For severe or recurrent cases, consider systemic corticosteroids or immunomodulators (e.g. colchicine, dapsone, or thalidomide) under specialist supervision [^112c8dvn] [^113rGB9D]. Most ulcers heal in 7–10 days; seek care if they persist beyond 2 weeks, are unusually large, or are accompanied by fever or systemic symptoms [^112QZDKw].

---

## Topical corticosteroids (first-line therapy)

Topical corticosteroids are the **cornerstone of canker sore management**, effectively reducing inflammation, pain, and healing time [^1129nbRU]. Commonly used formulations include:

- **Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% paste**: Apply 2–4 times daily directly to the ulcer [^notfound].

- **Dexamethasone 0.1% rinse**: Rinse for 2 minutes and spit; do not swallow [^notfound].

- **Fluocinonide 0.05% gel**: Apply 2–4 times daily for persistent ulcers [^notfound].

These agents are most effective when applied early in the course of the ulcer and are generally well tolerated with minimal systemic absorption [^notfound].

---

## Topical anesthetics (adjunctive therapy)

Topical anesthetics provide temporary pain relief, particularly before meals or during activities that may irritate the ulcer. Commonly used agents include **benzocaine 20% gel or ointment** applied 10–15 minutes before meals and **lidocaine 2% viscous solution** applied as needed for pain control [^117DeahA]. These agents do not promote healing but significantly improve comfort during the healing process [^117DeahA].

---

## Supportive care and lifestyle modifications

Supportive care and lifestyle modifications play a crucial role in managing canker sores and preventing recurrence. Recommended measures include:

- **Oral hygiene**: Use soft-bristled toothbrushes and SLS-free toothpaste to minimize irritation [^112QZDKw].

- **Dietary modifications**: Avoid spicy, acidic, and rough foods that can exacerbate ulcers [^notfound].

- **Stress management**: Stress reduction techniques may help prevent recurrence [^notfound].

- **Nutritional supplementation**: Address deficiencies in vitamin B12, folate, iron, or zinc if identified [^112QZDKw].

---

## Systemic therapies (for severe or recurrent cases)

For patients with severe, recurrent, or refractory canker sores, systemic therapies may be considered. These include **short-course systemic corticosteroids** (e.g. prednisone) for severe outbreaks and immunomodulatory agents such as colchicine, dapsone, or thalidomide for persistent cases [^117GEAaG] [^113rGB9D]. Given potential adverse effects, these therapies require careful monitoring and specialist supervision [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent research has explored novel therapeutic options, including **low-level laser therapy** for pain reduction and accelerated healing and **biologic agents** such as TNF-alpha inhibitors for severe, refractory cases. These therapies show promise but require further validation through clinical trials [^112QZDKw].

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction

Topical corticosteroids and adjunctive therapies significantly improve clinical outcomes, reducing pain, shortening healing time, and improving patient satisfaction. Most ulcers heal within 7–10 days, although recurrence is common [^115AZoga] [^112QZDKw].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek medical attention if:

- Ulcers persist beyond two weeks [^113mabew].

- Ulcers are unusually large or painful [^notfound].

- Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) are present [^notfound].

- Recurrence is frequent or severe [^112QZDKw].

---

The best treatment for canker sores involves topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy, with adjunctive topical anesthetics and supportive care. Systemic therapies are reserved for severe or recurrent cases, and emerging therapies show promise but require further research.

### Current thoughts for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers: using the evidence to determine fact or fiction [^115iY6tH]. Annals of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To use an evidenced-based approach to better understand the management and treatment of pressure ulcers.

Background

Pressure sores are a cause of significant morbidity in the medical community. Although there are a multitude of preventative and treatment options, there remains some degree of uncertainty in the literature in defining the best way to treat and manage pressure sores.

Methods

An exhaustive literature search was performed using several electronic databases. The search revealed several identified modalities for treatment and/or prevention of pressure ulcers. We then assessed each modality individually for the level of evidence that exists in the most current literature, with preference given to more recent studies (2005 to present).

Results

We reviewed the most relevant, high-level evidence that exists for the following modalities for understanding, preventing, and treating pressure ulcers: wound cleansers, repositioning, negative pressure therapy, debridement, enteral and parenteral feeding, vitamin and mineral supplementation, specialized mattresses, ultrasound therapy, honey, cellular therapy, musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flap closure, and other miscellaneous therapies.

Conclusions

Although many of these modalities are used, we encourage clinicians and health care providers to consider the evidence-based data when deciding how to most appropriately manage their patients' pressure sores.

Uncertainties for future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines include:

Are there any severe adverse effects of using one-dose of steroids for treating sore throat?
What are the effects of corticosteroids, in addition to standard care, in patients with recurrent episodes of acute sore throat?

### Self-reported cannabidiol (CBD) use for conditions with proven therapies [^112rCphp]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Posts to r/CBD increased from 1973 posts in 2016 to 6234 in 2017, 13 752 in 2018, and 11 602 during January through August 2019 (Figure). Using the random sample of r/CBD posts, we estimated that 12.1% (95% CI, 11.0%-13.4%) of all r/CBD posts were authored by individuals who provided testimonials of their use of CBD. Of the 376 posts labeled as testimonials, 90.0% (95% CI, 86.8%-92.8%) of testimonials included at least 1 claim that CBD could treat a diagnosable condition, whereas 29.5% (95% CI, 24.8%-34.2%) included at least 1 claim of a wellness benefit.

Psychiatric conditions were the most commonly cited diagnosable condition, mentioned in 63.9% (95% CI, 59.0%-69.1%) of testimonials (Table 2), including "after using CBD for 2 months, my autism symptoms have improved". The second most commonly cited subcategory of diagnosable conditions was orthopedic conditions (26.4%; 95% CI, 21.8%-31.1%), followed by sleep (14.6%; 95% CI, 11.3%-18.5%), neurological (6.9%; 95% CI, 4.4%-9.6%), and gastroenterological (3.9%; 95% CI, 1.9%-6.1%) conditions. Addiction (including opioid withdrawal), cardiology (including arrhythmias), dermatology (including acne), oral health (including canker sores), ophthalmology (including vividness of color perception), and sexual health (including erectile dysfunction) were cited in fewer than 2.0% of all testimonials.

### Evidence-based medicine: pressure sores [^115dHzeY]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Cite risk factors for pressure sore development. 2. Detail the pathophysiology of pressure sores. 3. List the types and classification of pressure sores. 4. Consider the various nonsurgical conservative wound management strategies. 5. Describe the appropriate surgical interventions for each pressure sore type. 6. Understand the causes of recurrent pressure sores and methods of avoiding recurrence.

Summary

Pressure sores are the result of unrelieved pressure, usually over a bony prominence. With an estimated 2.5 million pressure ulcers treated annually in the United States at a cost of $11 billion, pressure sores represent a costly and labor-intensive challenge to the health care system. A comprehensive team approach can address both prevention and treatment of these recalcitrant wounds. Consideration must be given to the patient's medical and socioeconomic condition, as these factors are significantly related to outcomes. Mechanical prophylaxis, nutritional optimization, treatment of underlying infection, and spasm control are essential in management. A variety of pressure sore patterns exist, with surgical approaches directed to maximize future coverage options. A comprehensive approach is detailed in this article to provide the reader with the range of treatment options available.

Stomatitis

Stomatitis, or oral mucositis, refers specifically to inflammatory diseases of the mouth, including mucosa, dentition, periapical abscesses, and periodontium. Such ailments can impair a patient's ability to eat, swallow, and talk and can cause significant pain. Stomatitis is characterized by ulceration in the oroesophageal mucosa, resulting in pain, erythema, dysphagia, and occasionally bleeding. Onset typically occurs early (≤ 1 month after treatment initiation) and is transient. The condition is also a common toxicity associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, occurring as nonspecific ulcerations for which localized palliative treatments and systemic analgesics are generally applied. In contrast to stomatitis associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, stomatitis associated with mTOR therapy has an inflammatory component often clinically mimicking aphthous stomatitis (commonly known as canker sores) and is differentiated from lesions of viral etiology by their localization to the nonkeratinized movable oral and oropharynx mucosa, as opposed to the mucosa of the palate, gingiva, or dorsal tongue surface. These differences also suggest that the aphthous-like lesions observed with mTOR inhibitors differ from the lesions observed with cytotoxic agents, so management strategies to prevent or treat mTOR inhibitor associated stomatitis also must be distinguished.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TWuXQ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^112zVjz2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

### Sore throat: is it such a big deal anymore? [^117UqnmX]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.

### Thalidomide as an effective treatment in sideroblastic anemia, immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and developmental delay (SIFD) [^113ay4AK]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Prompt and efficacious treatment was another factor affecting the prognosis of SIFD. BMT can be used to treat high-risk patients to relieve symptoms and prolong life. In 2018, Giannelou and colleagues were the first to report that TNF inhibitors could be used to treat SIFD, and no deaths were reported since then. Those results indicate that effective treatment can improve the prognosis of patients with SIFD. In addition, two patients were sibling with the same compound heterozygous mutation. One died of septic shock due to Staphylococcus aureus infection at the age of 9 years, and the other survived to adulthood, which suggests the importance of preventing and treating infection through IVIG supplementation and antimicrobial therapy. Eleven patients with SIFD survived to adulthood with the eldest patient being 49 years of age. Furthermore, some features of SIFD could resolve spontaneously at the age of 4–9 years, including height, development, anemia, immunoglobulin levels, fever, canker sores, and rashes. The prognosis of SIFD requires further investigation.

### MOC-PSSM CME article: pressure sores [^113uLexu]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand and describe the physiology of pressure sore development. 2. Understand and describe population risk factors. 3. Understand and describe examination and classification. 4. Understand and describe common surgical treatment algorithms. 5. Understand and describe strategies for prevention and postoperative recurrence.

Summary

Pressure sores are ischemic damage to soft tissues resulting from unrelieved pressure, usually over a bony prominence. In both acute and chronic circumstances, a careful, structured multidisciplinary strategy is required from initial diagnosis to resolution. Mechanical issues, such as the relief of pressure, adequate surgical debridement, and flap coverage, are of little value if educational, nutritional, social, and resource-based issues are not in place. The authors discuss a range of topics, including etiology, physiology, classification, operative options, and strategies to prevent recurrence.

### Long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of apomorphine sublingual film in patients with Parkinson's disease complicated by OFF episodes: a phase 3, open-label study [^1149McZP]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study population

Male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years were included as de novo patients in the study if they had a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD (consistent with United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria), a clinically meaningful response to levodopa (as determined by the investigator), stage 1‒3 on the modified Hoehn and Yahr scale when in ON state, and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of > 25. They were also required to be receiving stable doses of levodopa/carbidopa and adjunctive PD medications for ≥ 4 weeks (≥ 8 weeks for monoamine oxidase B inhibitors) before the first screening visit, and to be experiencing at least one OFF episode per day with a total daily OFF time of ≥ 2 h. Rollover patients were included if they had completed a prior SL-APO study and if there were no major changes in concomitant PD medications from the prior study. De novo patients were excluded from participation if they had atypical or secondary parkinsonism, a major psychiatric disorder, mouth cankers/sores ≤ 30 days before the first screening visit, a history of clinically significant hallucinations in the past 6 months, or a history of clinically significant impulse control disorder(s). De novo patients were also not included if they had received previous treatment with a neurosurgical procedure for PD, intraduodenal levodopa, continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion, or subcutaneous apomorphine ≤ 7 days before the second screening visit, or if they were currently receiving 5-hydroxy tryptophan (serotonin) receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor antagonists (excluding quetiapine and clozapine), or dopamine-depleting agents. Rollover patients were excluded if they developed mouth cankers/sores ≤ 14 days after completing their previous SL-APO study. Additional eligibility criteria are presented in the Supplementary Information.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117W79cM]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral ulceration is the most common ulcerative condition in humans, affecting up to 25% of young adultsand a higher proportion of children. Depending on context, ulcers in the mouth are described as mouth ulcers or canker sores, both of which are descriptive terms rather than clinical diagnoses. In this article, mouth ulcers is used as an umbrella term describing the spectrum of clinical presentation.

To date, many causes of mouth ulcers are recognised including mucosal trauma and a range of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. For example, mouth ulcers are common in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and are considered a diagnostic feature of Behçet's disease, an inflammatory disorder of blood vessels that causes ulceration of the mouth, eyes and genitals.

Many people experience recurrent mouth ulcers which cannot be attributed to systemic disease or obvious oral trauma. Here, the clinical diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is used, referring to a group of closely related conditions of uncertain aetiology, whose defining feature is the presence of clinically characteristic oral ulcers, which are painful and associated with impaired quality of life –. First line management strategies for RAS reduce the severity of ulceration without preventing recurrence. Second line management strategies involve topical or systemic use of potent and non-specific immunomodulatory drugs including thalidomide and dapsone, exposing patients to a range of side effects. Thus, there is unmet need for a wider range of therapeutic options in the management of RAS.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Urvcy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Interventions for prevention of herpes simplex labialis (cold sores on the lips) [^114ZNDVm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex labialis (HSL), also known as cold sores, is a common disease of the lips caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is found throughout the world. It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion.

Main Results

This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. The evidence for short-term (≤ 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short-term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short-term use of famciclovir. Long-term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long-term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long-term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long-term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) -0.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.05; n = 120). These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence to show that short-term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). The efficacy of long-term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research-diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant-reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5-pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events. There were very few data suggesting that thymopentin, low-level laser therapy, and hypnotherapy are effective in preventing recurrent HSL, with one to two RCTs for each intervention. We failed to find any evidence of efficacy for lysine, LongoVital® supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I subunit vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine in preventing HSL. There were no consistent data supporting the efficacy of levamisole and interferon, which were also associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as fever.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence demonstrates that long-term use of oral antiviral agents can prevent HSL, but the clinical benefit is small. We did not find evidence of an increased risk of adverse events. On the other hand, the evidence on topical antiviral agents and other interventions either showed no efficacy or could not confirm their efficacy in preventing HSL.

### An evidence-based approach to the surgical management of pressure ulcers [^112MqYX1]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to use the evidenced-based approach to better understand the surgical management and treatment of pressure ulcers.

Summary Of Background Data

Pressure sores are a cause of significant morbidity in the medical community. Although there are a multitude of preventative and treatment options, there remains some degree of uncertainty in the literature in defining the best way to treat and manage pressure sores.

Methods

An exhaustive literature search was performed using several electronic databases. The search revealed several identified modalities for treatment of pressure ulcers. We then assessed each modality individually for the level of evidence that exists in the most current literature, with preference given to more recent studies (2005-present).

Results

Here, we reviewed the most relevant, high-level evidence that exists for the following modalities for managing pressure ulcers from a surgical perspective: wound cleansers, repositioning, negative pressure therapy, enteral and parenteral feeding, vitamin and mineral supplementation, specialized mattresses, ultrasound therapy, honey, cellular therapy, debridement, ostectomy, and musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flap closure.

Conclusions

Although many of the previously mentioned modalities are used, we encourage clinicians and health care providers to consider the evidence-based data when deciding how to most appropriately manage their patient's pressure sores.

### Common oral lesions [^113EaGwu]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Familiarity with common oral conditions allows clinicians to observe and treat patients in the primary care setting or refer to a dentist, oral surgeon, otolaryngologist, or other specialist. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (canker sores) is the most common ulcerative condition of the oral cavity. Recurrent herpes simplex labialis and stomatitis also commonly cause oral ulcers. Corticosteroids, immunocompromise, antibiotics, and dentures can predispose patients to oral candidiasis. Benign migratory glossitis (geographic tongue) occurs in up to 3% of the population but generally lacks symptoms, although some people experience food sensitivity or a burning sensation. Hairy tongue is associated with a low fiber diet, tobacco and alcohol use, and poor oral hygiene in older male patients. Generally, hairy tongue is asymptomatic except for an unattractive appearance or halitosis. Tobacco and alcohol use can cause mucosal changes resulting in leukoplakia and erythroplakia. These can represent precancerous changes and increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma. Mandibular and maxillary tori are common bony cortical outgrowths that require no treatment in the absence of repeat trauma from chewing or interference with dentures. Oral lichen planus occurs in up to 2% of individuals and can present as lacy reticulations or oral erosions and ulcerations. Traumatic buccal mucosal fibromas and labial mucoceles from biting can be excised.

### Aphthous ulcers (recurrent) [^115AZoga]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most people with recurrent aphthous ulcers develop a few ulcers less than 10 mm in diameter that heal after 7 to 10 days without scarring. The causes are unknown but local physical trauma may trigger ulcers in susceptible people. In 10% of sufferers, lesions are more than 10 mm in diameter and can cause scarring.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected topical treatments for recurrent idiopathic aphthous ulcers? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics (local), corticosteroids (topical), tetracycline antibiotic mouthwash, and topical antiseptic agents (chlorhexidine and similar agents).

### Differences in the effectiveness of different physical therapy modalities in the treatment of delayed-onset muscle soreness: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^112PzapB]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is characterized by transient muscular injury resulting from high-intensity eccentric contractions or unfamiliar exercise modalities. Symptoms typically manifest 6–12 hours post-exercise, peak between 24 and 72 hours, and gradually resolve within 5–7 days. Common symptoms of DOMS include muscle pain, reduced strength, stiffness, and swelling. The associated decrease in muscle strength and joint range of motion can negatively affect athletic performance during training or competition. This may lead to athletes requiring additional medical intervention, such as physical therapy, massage, and cold and hot therapy. However, these treatments are expensive, and thus, DOMS increases economic burdens. For instance, massage is believed to accelerate recovery and reduce the duration of interruptions to training. However, its cost may pose a financial burden on individuals or teams. DOMS may prevent athletes from participating in training or competitions on time, thereby affecting the overall performance and event results of the team. Such interruptions may require additional compensation or fines, further increasing the economic burden. In high-intensity sports, such as rugby, DOMS may cause long-term muscle injuries and inflammation, requiring a longer period of rehabilitation. Studies have shown that even after adequate rest, DOMS may persist, which increases the cost of long-term treatment.DOMS reduces athletes' strength, flexibility, and endurance, thereby limiting their training intensity and frequency. This limitation may prevent athletes from reaching their best competitive state, thereby affecting the length of their careers. Long-term DOMS can trigger psychological stress and burnout in athletes, particularly in high-intensity competitive environments, which may accelerate the end of their careers.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113PdqbD]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^116zqris]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequent adverse reactions seen in controlled trials were supine and sitting hypertension; paresthesia and pruritus, mainly of the scalp; goosebumps; chills; urinary urge; urinary retention and urinary frequency.

The frequency of these events in a 3-week placebo-controlled trial is shown in the following table:

Less frequent adverse reactions were headache; feeling of pressure/fullness in the head; vasodilation/flushing face; confusion/thinking abnormality; dry mouth; nervousness/anxiety and rash. Other adverse reactions that occurred rarely were visual field defect; dizziness; skin hyperesthesia; insomnia; somnolence; erythema multiforme; canker sore; dry skin; dysuria; impaired urination; asthenia; backache; pyrosis; nausea; gastrointestinal distress; flatulence and leg cramps.

The most potentially serious adverse reaction associated with Midodrine hydrochloride therapy is supine hypertension. The feelings of paresthesia, pruritus, piloerection and chills are pilomotor reactions associated with the action of midodrine on the alpha-adrenergic receptors of the hair follicles. Feelings of urinary urgency, retention and frequency are associated with the action of midodrine on the alpha-receptors of the bladder neck.

### Aphthous ulcers (recurrent) [^115zppZ3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most people with recurrent aphthous ulcers develop a few ulcers less than 1 cm in diameter, that heal after 5–14 days without scarring. The causes are unknown, but risks of recurrence may decrease if the person gives up smoking. Local physical trauma may trigger ulcers in susceptible people. In 10% of sufferers, lesions are more than 1 cm in diameter, and can cause scarring.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent aphthous ulcers? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 18 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics (local), carbenoxolone mouthwash, chlorhexidine (and similar agents), corticosteroids (topical), and tetracycline antibiotic mouthwash.

### Cardiac surgery compared with antibiotics only in patients developing infective endocarditis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114Yp4yu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

No randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of CS in PVE have been performed. Therefore, treatment recommendations are only based on the conflicting results of the above mentioned studies. 11, 12 Subgroup analyses show that surgery was beneficial in patients with the greatest need for surgery, including those with valve regurgitation, vegetation, and dehiscence or paravalvular abscess/fistula, 9 reflecting the indications for CS in current guidelines. 9 In our matched analysis, the need for CS according to current guidelines was equally distributed. Despite this, there was no strong signal for an improvement in 1‐year mortality.

In IE after TAVR, which is still a relatively new treatment option for patient with severe aortic stenosis, data about treatment options and predictors of mortality are still rare. In our analysis, prognosis was not determined by the choice of treatment (eg, CS versus ABx), but by disease characteristics (eg, sepsis on admission or a formal indication for CS). We interpret the latter one as a sign of disease severity rather than a factor implicating a certain therapy. The overall complication rate during IE treatment was significantly higher in IE‐CS, which may, in part, be explained by the necessity to perform an extensive surgical procedure. Hypothetically, this higher complication rate may have outweighed the potential benefit of cankerous tissue removal.

### Complex aphthosis: a large case series with evaluation algorithm and therapeutic ladder from topicals to thalidomide [^113rGB9D]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is a common problem with 20% to 50% of the population having experienced simple aphthous lesions (ie, canker sores). Complex aphthosis is the diagnosis given to patients with almost constant > 3 oral aphthae or recurrent oral and genital aphthae in the absence of Behcet's disease.

Methods

Eighty-one patients were referred to the Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology from 1995 to 2001 with the diagnosis of presumptive Behcet's disease. After exclusion of patients with simple recurrent aphthous stomatitis or non-aphthous oral disease, 64 patients remained. Ten of the patients met criteria for Behcet's disease. The remaining 54 patients were evaluated and treated as patients with the diagnosis of complex aphthosis.

Results

The 54 patients with complex aphthosis became the subject of this study. Twelve patients had secondary complex aphthosis with 10/12 having inflammatory bowel disease. The remaining 42 patients had primary (ie, idiopathic) complex aphthosis. The therapeutic ladder for these patients ranged from topical therapy through oral colchicine and combination oral colchicine and oral dapsone therapy to oral thalidomide therapy.

Conclusion

Complex aphthosis is an important condition to distinguish from Behcet's disease. Appropriate patient evaluation algorithms and treatment therapeutic ladders are proposed.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^114UkFCK]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is among the most common presenting complaints in both emergency departments and outpatient care settings. It is the cause of about 5% of medical visits in children and about 2% of all outpatient visits in adults. The most common cause of sore throat is acute pharyngitis caused by self limiting viral infections. Pain management with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therefore represents the mainstay of care. These drugs provide limited pain relief but also sometimes cause serious harm.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics also provides modest benefit in reduction of symptoms and fever when the infection is bacterial, but their use could contribute to antibiotic resistance. Although most cases of sore throat have a viral aetiology, and the risk of secondary complications is low, clinicians commonly prescribe antibiotics. Though this could be because clinicians think that patients seeking care expect a course of antibiotics, in reality pain relief might be more important to them.

Corticosteroids represent an additional therapeutic option for symptom relief. Randomised control trials suggest that a short course of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids probably provides symptomatic benefit to patients with sore throat. Despite this evidence, clinicians do not commonly use steroids. Reasons might include uncertain applicability of the evidence to patients with less severe disease, as the initial studies enrolled only patients with severe sore throat presenting to emergency departments, almost all of whom received antibiotics.

This systematic review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC research and innovation programme and BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new potentially practice changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner. In this case, the stimulus was the recent TOAST (Treatment Options without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial, which randomised over 500 patients with sore throat presenting to their primary care clinician who were not initially prescribed antibiotics; the TOAST authors reported beneficial effects of corticosteroids. In the light of this new potentially practice changing evidence, we updated the latest Cochrane reviewdealing with the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat in addition to standard care compared with standard care alone. This systematic review informed the parallel guideline published in a multi-layered electronic format on bmj.com and MAGICapp.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

How should I use ZOVIRAX Cream?

Use ZOVIRAX Cream exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it.
Use ZOVIRAX Cream as soon as you have the first symptoms of a cold sore such as itching, redness, burning or tingling, or when the cold sore appears.
Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying ZOVIRAX Cream.
The affected area should be clean and dry before applying ZOVIRAX Cream.
Apply ZOVIRAX Cream to the affected area 5 times each day for 4 days, including the outer edge.
You should not apply other skin products to the affected area during treatment with ZOVIRAX Cream.
Avoid unnecessary rubbing of the cold sore because this may cause the cold sore to spread to other areas around your mouth or make your cold sore worse.

What are the possible side effects of ZOVIRAX Cream?

The most common side effects of ZOVIRAX Cream are skin reactions at the treatment site and may include: dry or cracked lips, peeling, flaking or dryness of the skin, a burning or stinging feeling, and itching.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^112eL32g]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion: This study highlights the wide phenotypic variability of HA20 syndrome, even among siblings carrying the same mutation. Our study revealed that oral and genital ulcers may be absent, both at disease onset and throughout its course. Additionally, we highlight key distinctions between HA20 and pediatric Behçet's disease, notably the median age of onset(4 years vs 11years), the predominance of GI involvement, which may be severe, and the peculiar aspect of mucosal ulcerations which are deeper and distinct from common cankers sores. Despite providing new insights, the limited sample size precludes definitive conclusions regarding phenotype-genotype correlations. Further studies involving larger cohorts are essential to clarify the phenotype-genotype correlation as well as to achieve a deeper understanding of the factors influencing clinical expression and disease progression of paediatric HA20.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^115v9w1w]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharyngitis, more commonly known as sore throat, is associated with pharyngeal inflammation and is usually caused by an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) such as the common cold.–Although painful, acute sore throat is self-limiting and most cases resolve within 3–7 days, even in the absence of treatment. However, the discomfort caused by sore throat can significantly impact quality of life and daily activities, and sore throat remains one of the most common reasons for primary care consultations.–

Only a small proportion (~10%) of sore throat cases are caused by bacterial infection, such as group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep A). Although less common, group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep C) can also cause sore throat. The vast majority of sore throats are caused by viral infection, but many patients seek – and are inappropriately prescribed – antibiotics.–Antibiotics can be useful in certain circumstances, but their effectiveness is limited in most cases of acute sore throat and they do not always lead to faster symptom resolution even when bacterial infection is involved. Inappropriate use of antibiotics also contributes to the growing problem of antibacterial resistance. Furthermore, it has been suggested that patients who hope for antibiotic treatment may actually be seeking a treatment to relieve pain. Together, these factors show that a need remains for treatments that can provide rapid and effective pain relief for acute sore throat, even in those cases where antibiotics are warranted.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^112kqeQJ]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

14.1 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years old) with a history of recurrent cold sores. Patients self-initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms and prior to any signs of a cold sore. The majority of patients initiated treatment within 2 hours of onset of symptoms. Patients were randomized to valacyclovir hydrochloride 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, valacyclovir hydrochloride 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on Days 1 and 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in treated subjects as compared with placebo. The 2 day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen.

No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir hydrochloride or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

### Lindane [^115Ghemk]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

What is Lindane Shampoo?

Lindane Shampoo is a medicine that is used to treat lice. It kills lice and their eggs. Lice are very small bugs that attach to the skin on your head or pubic (crotch) area and lay eggs called nits in your hair. Some people call crotch lice "crabs". Lice can cause severe itching. Lindane Shampoo gets into the lice and the nits and kills them. It also goes through your skin. Lindane Shampoo is used only after safer medicines have not made your lice go away. The only time Lindane Shampoo is used first is when someone cannot use safer medicines, which may include permethrin and crotamiton.

Lindane Shampoo is mainly for adults and children who weigh at least 110 pounds. If you weigh less than 110 pounds use Lindane Shampoo only if your doctor thinks it is really needed. People who weigh less than 110 pounds and the elderly have higher chances for side effects because more Lindane may go through their skin.

Who should not use Lindane Shampoo?

Do not use Lindane Shampoo:

if you do not have lice. Lindane Shampoo does not stop you from getting lice. Lindane Shampoo only kills the lice you already have.
if you have or have ever had seizures, also called convulsions, "fits" or epilepsy, especially if they have been hard to control.
if you have used Lindane Shampoo in the past few months. You should see your doctor if you think that you need another treatment.
unless it is the only medicine you can use for lice.
if you had a bad reaction to Lindane Shampoo before. Do not use Lindane Shampoo again.
if you have open sores or crusted (scabby) sores on the skin around your head and neck, or lots of broken skin.
if you need to treat a premature or young baby. More of the applied Lindane can go through the skin of babies and go to their brains where it can harm them.
if you have scabies. These need a different medicine that you use in a different way.
if you are allergic to Lindane Shampoo or any of its ingredients. The active ingredient is lindane. See the end of this Medication Guide for a list of all the ingredients in Lindane Shampoo.
while you are breast-feeding. Lindane Shampoo can get in your milk and may be fed to your baby. Your baby may get sick. Ask your doctor for a safer medicine. If you use Lindane Shampoo, pump your breast milk and throw the milk away for at least 24 hours after using the medicine. During this time, feed your baby formula or breast milk that you stored from before you used Lindane Shampoo.

urination; asthenia; backache; pyrosis; nausea; gastrointestinal distress;
flatulence and leg cramps.

The most potentially serious adverse reaction associated with ProAmatine therapy is supine
hypertension. The feelings of paresthesia, pruritus, piloerection and chills are
pilomotor reactions associated with the action of midodrine on the
alpha-adrenergic receptors of the hair follicles. Feelings of urinary urgency,
retention and frequency are associated with the action of midodrine on the
alpha-receptors of the bladder neck.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^113qrGFA]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Values and preferences

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, and a substantial and important increase in the chance of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.

The panel, including the patient representatives, felt that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly across patients, which justifies a weak recommendation. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas it may be very important to patients whose ability to go to school or to perform at work are compromised, care givers wishing to reduce their children's pain, or patients experiencing their pain as severe.

The panel believes that there is great variability in how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete pain resolution each patient would consider important. However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typical patients would place high value on those outcomes. Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept receiving corticosteroids.

The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also reflects the concerns that the panel had with acceptability. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condition that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stakeholders know is almost always used for more severe diseases.

The systematic search for empirical data on patients' values and preferences related to sore throat identified 4149 references that were screened at the title and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full text articles, from which only two provided relevant information on patients' values and preferences (see appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided additional data that had not been raised by the panel members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-important outcomes and considered the variability in patient values and preferences regarding sore throat management.

The evidence

The linked systematic review reports the effects of corticosteroids when added to standard care in patients with acute sore throat.

Figure 1gives an overview of the number and types of patients included, the study funding, and patient involvement, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.

Fig 1 Characteristics of patients and trials included in systematic review of effects of corticosteroids on acute sore throat

The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolution of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean time to onset of pain relief.

Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the studies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not apply to younger ages.

Since the randomised controlled trials focused on patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability of the evidence to such patients, and the recommendation therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.

### The practical evaluation and management of patients with symptoms of a sore burning mouth [^111VMYwW]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

There are many etiologic factors to consider in a patient who presents with symptoms or sensations of a sore burning mouth. These range from local causes within the oral cavity to underlying systemic disease, including psychologic factors. This paper aims to describe the different clinical presentations and to outline a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of such patients. The clinician will be directed to the relevant diagnosis by following the traditional medical model of taking a focused history, performing a thorough clinical examination, considering the potential differential diagnoses, and requesting pertinent and appropriate investigations. The various differential diagnoses and broad treatment options will also be discussed and outlined. This paper will not, however, discuss burning mouth syndrome (oral dysesthesia), which is a diagnosis of exclusion, whereby the oral mucosa is clinically normal and there are no identifiable medical or dental causes to account for the patient's symptoms.

### Electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of pressure sores [^111LHvix]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Electromagnetic therapy is used with the aim of improving the healing of chronic wounds such as pressure sores and venous leg ulcers

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic therapy in the treatment of pressure sores

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Wounds Group search strategy was used (see Scope) to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of electromagnetic therapy for the treatment of pressure sores

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing electromagnetic therapy with sham electromagnetic therapy, or other (standard) treatment

Data Collection and Analysis

Results of searches were scrutinised by one reviewer (and checked by a second) to identify possible RCTs and full reports of these were obtained. Details of eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction sheet. Attempts were made to obtain missing data by contacting authors. Data extraction was checked by a second reviewer.

Main Results

A total of two eligible RCTs were identified for inclusion in this review. The first of these studies (Comorosan 1993) was a three armed study comparing electromagnetic therapy, electromagnetic therapy in combination with standard therapy, and standard therapy alone. The second study (Salzburg 1995) was a comparison between electromagnetic therapy and sham therapy on 30 male patients with a spinal cord injury and a grade two or grade three pressure sore. Neither study found a statistically significant difference between the healing rates of electromagnetic therapy treated and control group patients.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The results suggest no evidence of a benefit in using electromagnetic therapy to treat pressure sores. However the possibility of a beneficial or harmful effect cannot be ruled out due to the fact there were only two trials with methodological limitations and small numbers of patients.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^1174zw4c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3–4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0–2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3–4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.

### Early treatment of cold sores with topical ME-609 decreases the frequency of ulcerative lesions: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated clinical trial [^111FDGPm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prior pilot studies support the use of antiviral medications with topical corticosteroids for herpes simplex labialis (HSL). ME-609 (Xerese, Xerclear) is a combination of 5% acyclovir and 1% hydrocortisone developed for the topical treatment of HSL.

Objectives

The primary study end point was the prevention of ulcerative HSL lesions.

Methods

In all, 2437 patients with a history of HSL were randomized to self-initiate treatment with ME-609, 5% acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle, or ME-609 vehicle (placebo) at the earliest sign of a cold sore recurrence. Cream was applied 5 times/d for 5 days. A total of 1443 patients experienced a recurrence and initiated treatment with ME-609 (n = 601), acyclovir (n = 610), or placebo (n = 232).

Results

Of patients receiving ME-609, 42% did not develop an ulcerative lesion compared with 35% of patients receiving acyclovir in ME-609 vehicle (P = 0.014) and 26% of patients receiving placebo (P < .0001). In patients with ulcerative lesions, healing times were reduced in the ME-609 and acyclovir groups compared with placebo (P < .01 for both). The cumulative lesion area for all lesions was reduced 50% in patients receiving ME-609 compared with the placebo group (P < .0001). There were no differences among groups in the number of patients with positive herpes simplex virus cultures. The side-effect profile was similar among treatments.

Limitations

The study did not contain a group treated with a topical corticosteroid alone.

Conclusions

ME-609 prevented progression of cold sores to ulcerative lesions and significantly reduced the cumulative lesion area compared with acyclovir and placebo. ME-609 treatment offers additional therapeutic benefit compared with therapy with topical acyclovir alone.

### Famciclovir [^1117HwzL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Herpes Labialis (Cold Sores)

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 701 immunocompetent adults with recurrent herpes labialis. Patients self-initiated therapy within 1 hour of first onset of signs or symptoms of a recurrent herpes labialis episode with famciclovir 1500 mg as a single dose (n = 227), famciclovir 750 mg twice daily (n = 220) or placebo (n = 254) for 1 day. The median time to healing among patients with non-aborted lesions (progressing beyond the papule stage) was 4.4 days in the famciclovir 1500 mg single-dose group (n = 152) as compared to 6.2 days in the placebo group (n = 168). The median difference in time to healing between the placebo and famciclovir 1500 mg treated groups was 1.3 days (95% CI: 0.6–2.0). No differences in proportion of patients with aborted lesions (not progressing beyond the papule stage) were observed between patients receiving famciclovir or placebo: 33% for famciclovir 1500 mg single dose and 34% for placebo. The median time to loss of pain and tenderness was 1.7 days in famciclovir 1500 mg single dose-treated patients vs. 2.9 days in placebo-treated patients.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^116mcnWw]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Valacyclovir tablets may be given without regard to meals.

2.1 Adult Dosing Recommendations

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis): The recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for treatment of cold sores is 2 grams twice daily for 1 day taken 12 hours apart. Therapy should be initiated at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning).

Genital Herpes: Initial Episode: The recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for treatment of initial genital herpes is 1 gram twice daily for 10 days. Therapy was most effective when administered within 48 hours of the onset of signs and symptoms. Recurrent Episodes: The recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for treatment of recurrent genital herpes is 500 mg twice daily for 3 days. Initiate treatment at the first sign or symptom of an episode. Suppressive Therapy: The recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for chronic suppressive therapy of recurrent genital herpes is 1 gram once daily in patients with normal immune function. In patients with a history of 9 or fewer recurrences per year, an alternative dose is 500 mg once daily.

In HIV-infected patients with a CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells/mm3, the recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for chronic suppressive therapy of recurrent genital herpes is 500 mg twice daily. Reduction of Transmission: The recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for reduction of transmission of genital herpes in patients with a history of 9 or fewer recurrences per year is 500 mg once daily for the source partner.

Herpes Zoster: The recommended dosage of valacyclovir tablets for treatment of herpes zoster is 1 gram 3 times daily for 7 days. Therapy should be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom of herpes zoster and is most effective when started within 48 hours of the onset of rash.

### Systemic interventions for recurrent aphthous stomatitis (mouth ulcers) [^117GEAaG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the most frequent form of oral ulceration, characterised by recurrent oral mucosal ulceration in an otherwise healthy individual. At its worst RAS can cause significant difficulties in eating and drinking. Treatment is primarily aimed at pain relief and the promotion of healing to reduce the duration of the disease or reduce the rate of recurrence. A variety of topical and systemic therapies have been utilised.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effect of systemic interventions in the reduction of pain associated with RAS, a reduction in episode duration or frequency.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches of: Cochrane Oral Health Group and PaPaS Trials Registers (to 6 June 2012); CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library (to Issue 4, 2012); MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 6 June 2012); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 6 June 2012); CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 6 June 2012); and AMED via PubMed (1950 to 6 June 2012). We searched reference lists from relevant articles and contacted the authors of eligible trials to identify further trials and obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the primary outcome measures assess a reduction of pain associated with RAS, a reduction in episode duration or a reduction in episode frequency. Trials were not restricted by outcome alone. We also included RCTs of a cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data in duplicate. We contacted trial authors for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. We carried out risk of bias assessment on six domains. We followed The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines and risk ratio (RR) values were to be calculated using fixed-effect models (if two or three trials in each meta-analysis) or random-effects models (if four or more trials in each meta-analysis).

Main Results

A total of 25 trials were included, 22 of which were placebo controlled and eight made head-to-head comparisons (five trials had more than two treatment arms). Twenty-one different interventions were assessed. The interventions were grouped into two categories: immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory and uncertain. Only one study was assessed as being at low risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

No single treatment was found to be effective and therefore the results remain inconclusive in regard to the best systemic intervention for RAS. This is likely to reflect the poor methodological rigour of trials, and lack of studies for certain drugs, rather than the true effect of the intervention. It is also recognised that in clinical practice, individual drugs appear to work for individual patients and so the interventions are likely to be complex in nature. In addition, it is acknowledged that systemic interventions are often reserved for those patients who have been unresponsive to topical treatments, and therefore may represent a select group of patients.

### Implantable baclofen pump as an adjuvant in treatment of pressure sores [^115TkpJa]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, the success of ulcer treatment is limited by the high recurrence and complication rates. Spasticity is an important contributing factor to ulcer recurrence, and intrathecal baclofen is an effective method to reduce spasticity. Spasticity creates friction, shear, and mobility impairment resulting in wound dehiscence, flap loss, infection, and hematoma. Spasticity can be managed pharmacologically and surgically; baclofen is the drug of choice. Baclofen inhibits spasticity by blocking excitatory neurotransmitters in the spinal dorsal horn. Intrathecal baclofen maximizes the dose delivered to spinal receptors and minimizes the side effects associated with oral baclofen. Case reports of intrathecal baclofen used in patients with pressure sores demonstrate the use of intrathecal baclofen to improve reconstructive outcomes in spastic patients.

### The new biologic drugs: which children with asthma should get what? [^116cenGp]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

10 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Aside from some specific rare reactions, the most common side effects for all four biologics include pyrexia, headaches, soreness at injection sites, abdominal pain, sore throat and sinus pain. With such a good safety profile, it raises the question of why the current guidelines necessitate that doctors should wait for 3–4 attacks to occur within a year before biologics are considered, when it is known that the biggest risk factor for an asthma attack is a previous attack. If after an asthma attack a second one follows, despite best efforts to optimize basic management by standard means, then perhaps a new approach with a biological is firmly indicated.

With the present state of knowledge, choosing the right biologic for each child is constrained by the limited availability of suitable predictive biomarkers in children and a lack of head‐to‐head studies comparing different biologics in children with severe uncontrolled asthma. Current areas most in need of further research include (1) comparison studies between available biologics, especially in terms of efficacy in patients under 12 years old, (2) identifying stable noninvasive biomarkers that determine the appropriate cohort for each treatment, and which can be measured longitudinally to assess success of treatment, and (3) identifying suitable end points for treatment, and how to maintain control following successful treatment, and when (if ever) treatment can be weaned.

Is there a role for the use of biologics in severe preschool wheeze, in children under the age of 6 years old? The emergence of new data shows that only approximately a quarter of preschool children who wheeze, have the atopic, eosinophilic, Type 2 phenotype, and this cohort (1) show a better response to inhaled corticosteroids, which is currently the first line of treatment according to the GINA guidelineand (2) are at risk of progressing to school aged asthma. The PARK study, which is currently ongoing, is a double‐blinded, randomized controlled trial of omalizumab in preschool children who have been deemed high‐risk for developing asthma, and this will provide invaluable evidence as to the role of novel biologics as a secondary preventative therapy, in an attempt to halt subsequent progression to school aged asthma.

What are the possible side effects of Veregen Ointment?

The most common side effects with Veregen Ointment are local skin and application site reactions including:

redness
swelling
sores or blisters
burning
itching
pain

Many patients experience itching, reddening or swelling on or around the application site during the course of treatment. Some of these side effects could be a sign of an allergic reaction. If you experience open sores or other severe reactions at the locations you applied Veregen Ointment, stop treatment and call your doctor right away.

You may experience other side effects of Veregen Ointment which are not mentioned here. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Patients should be aware that new warts may develop during treatment as Veregen Ointment is not a cure.

How should I store Veregen Ointment?

Store Veregen Ointment refrigerated or up to 77°F (25°C).
Do not freeze.
Make sure the cap on the tube is tightly closed.
Safely throw away Veregen Ointment tubes that are out of date or are empty.

Keep Veregen Ointment and all medicines out of the reach of children.

General advice about prescription medicines

Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in patient information leaflets. Do not use Veregen Ointment for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give Veregen Ointment to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

### Topical recombinant human acidic fibroblast growth factor: an effective therapeutic agent for facemask wearing-induced pressure sores [^115MXuMC]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Protecting health care workers is crucial during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and facemask wearing is considered an effective measure to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. However, long-time use of a facemask can cause pressure sores on the ears and nose bridge and increase the risk of infection. The topical recombinant human acidic fibroblast growth factor (rh-aFGF) was used to cure pressure sores for health care workers at Zhongfaxincheng campus of Tongji Hospital. The results from a small sample size survey conducted in Zhongfaxincheng campuses of Tongji Hospital showed that treatment with topical rh-aFGF could significantly inhibit the progression of pressure sores and accelerate the wound healing with no apparent ill-effects. Therefore, we propose that topical rh-aFGF is an effective therapeutic agent for facemask wearing-induced pressure sores and worth of popularizing and applying.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^112wso9o]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the fact that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses, and therefore inappropriate for up to 80% of pharyngitis cases, antibiotic prescribing for this condition remains commonplace in primary care. Current treatment guidelines advocate symptomatic relief of sore throat as first-line treatment; even in bacterial sore throat, antibiotics do not provide immediate or useful relief of symptoms, with half of patients still experiencing pain after 3 days. Moreover, physicians face considerable challenges in the accurate diagnosis of bacterial sore throat, with misdiagnosis potentially leading to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and antibiotic resistance. Shephard et al highlighted the unreliability of strep A diagnosis based on clinical findings, with an 86.9% false positive result for strep A based on diagnosis by clinical features alone. Even using a rapid strep test, the study suggested that 23.9% of patients would have received antibiotics unnecessarily. Given its proven efficacy at providing fast and long-lasting relief from sore throat, particularly in the first few days when symptoms are worst, flurbiprofen offers a useful first-line treatment option for symptomatic relief in patients with "uncomplicated" acute sore throat, thus helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Studies confirm the efficacy of flurbiprofen in patients both with and without strep sore throat, although the analyses included in this review are limited by the relatively low incidence of strep A/C positive patients. As most strep sore throats will resolve naturally over time, flurbiprofen can be considered prior to a definitive diagnosis of strep A/C; with the single-dose effects lasting for 3–4 h in these patients, it is reassuring that more persistent, severe or worsening symptoms associated with strep throat are unlikely to be "masked", allowing patients to seek further advice and potentially antibiotics if required. Even when the symptoms and course of sore throat suggest that antibiotics may be warranted, flurbiprofen can be safely combined with antibiotic therapy to effectively relieve pain and other symptoms that antibiotics will not immediately alleviate.

### Genome wide analysis for mouth ulcers identifies associations at immune regulatory loci [^117S8XV7]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

23andMe Inc. is a personal genomics company that provides genotype and health-related information to customers. Individuals included in the analyses provided informed consent and answered surveys online in accordance with the 23andMe human subjects protocol, which was reviewed and approved by Ethical and Independent Review Services, a private institutional review board. Mouth ulcer cases were defined as those who answered yes to the question: Have you ever had a canker sore (an open sore on the soft tissue inside the mouth)? Those who answered no were considered controls, and those who responded don't know were not included in the analysis.

The ALSPAC longitudinal birth cohort recruited pregnant women living near Bristol, UK with an estimated delivery date between 1991 and 1992. There were 15,247 pregnancies resulting in 14,973 live births. Follow up has included clinical assessment and questionnaires and is ongoing. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was obtained from participants following the recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time. Study children were asked to complete questionnaires about oral health at age 23.9 years. Participants were asked if they had ever had mouth ulcers (no/yes, but only once or twice/yes, on several occasions). An ever ulcers phenotype was generated with any answer of Yes,… used to define case status and No to define controls. Those who did not answer the question were set to missing. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^114NUu9s]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple Dose

Eight of the papers have provided clinical evidence that multiple-dose flurbiprofen, taken every 3–6 h as needed (up to 5 or 8 doses in 24 h), provide continued relief from sore throat pain and soreness;. six for flurbiprofen lozenges, one for spray, and one for microgranules. Several of the papers evaluated pain relief during the first 24 h of treatment, when throat symptoms are most prominent and often require repeated treatment. All of these papers reported significant reductions in sore throat pain (up to 80% greater compared to placebo; measured on the STPIS) over this treatment period. Five papers explored the efficacy of repeated self-dosing of flurbiprofen beyond the first 24 h. Schachtel et alobserved that multiple-dose flurbiprofen lozenge over days 2–7 continued to provide significant reductions in sore throat pain intensity from before to 2 h after each dose, and that flurbiprofen provided 74% greater reduction in sore throat pain intensity vs placebo over days 2–7 (p < 0.01). Likewise, de Looze et alreported that multiple-dose flurbiprofen spray provided a greater reduction in severity of throat soreness and pain intensity, and significantly greater sore throat relief compared with placebo, up to the end of the 3-day study period (p < 0.05).

Blagden et aldemonstrated the superiority of flurbiprofen vs placebo in relieving sore throat over days 1–4 overall (TOTPAR at the end of days 1–4; p = 0.0113). However, in a subgroup of patients not prescribed concomitant antibiotics in this study, significance was reached on days 2 and 3 (p < 0.05), but not on day 1 (p = 0.06) and day 4 (p = 0.09). In terms of change from baseline in sore throat relief, significance was achieved with multiple-dose flurbiprofen microgranules vs placebo at the end of day 1 (p = 0.026), but not at the end of day 2 (p = 0.101) and day 3 (p = 0.078).

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^115YuUem]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a lozenge or spray provides relief for the pain associated with sore throat due to URTI, giving patients two different treatment formats to choose from according to their own preferences. Patients may, for example, prefer the demulcent effects of a lozenge or the convenience of a spray. Advantages of a spray include delivery of a full dose immediately at the site of pain and inflammation, whereas lozenges take time to dissolve in the mouth (~3–5 minutes) in order to deliver a full dose. A patient's choice of treatment format may also depend on the time of day they require relief.

Throat swab culture results from our study showed that only a small proportion of patients had beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C), indicating that antibiotics would have been inappropriate for the majority of participants. Many patients who hope or ask for antibiotics may, in fact, be seeking treatment to alleviate pain; however, findings from a systematic review showed that antibiotics are among the least effective treatments for symptomatic relief of sore throat. In contrast, symptomatic treatments such as NSAIDs and analgesics were found to be up to 93% more effective than placebo. Together with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, these findings suggest that non-antibiotic treatments should be considered instead of antibiotics for relieving sore throat symptoms. Importantly, in our study, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge provided comparable pain relief in patients both with and without beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C) infection. Both formulations may therefore represent an alternative and preferable first-line treatment for patients with acute sore throat without any of the "red flags" that might indicate a more serious illness. Even when the symptoms and course of sore throat suggest that antibiotics are warranted, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray or lozenge could be combined with antibiotic therapy to effectively relieve pain and other symptoms.

### Cancer and the emotions in 18th-century literature [^115aYfij]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Cancer and the emotions in the long 18th century

In her seminal work on cancer metaphors in Illness as Metaphor, Susan Sontag famously contended that cancer was associated with emotional repression. According to Sontag, 'many people believe that cancer is a disease of insufficient passion, afflicting those who are sexually repressed, inhibited, unspontaneous, incapable of expressing anger'. 5 In 18th-century literature, however, cancer was typically associated not with emotional deficiency but with emotional excess. It was often used as a metaphor for the dangers of feeling — of feeling too intensely or for too long, even if the feeling in question might otherwise be considered pleasurable, virtuous or just.

While cancer as discussed in 18th-century texts does not consistently map on to the distinct neoplastic condition we refer to as cancer today, the connection with emotion is integral to the disease's medical history. From the 16th through to the 18th century, the terms 'cancer' and 'canker' were used to refer to any kind of persistent, non-healing sore, and medical practitioners connected both 'cancers' and 'cankers' with emotional states of long duration. As Alanna Skuse and Marjo Kaartinen have noted, many early modern medical writings attributed the development of cancer to the indulgence of grief. 6 Skuse observes that some 16th-century and 17th-century medical practitioners also viewed 'anger, brooding, and mourning' as potentially 'contributing to the development of cancers in both sexes'. 7

ACOEM Occupational Medicine Practice Guidelines — shared decision making and cost-effectiveness specify that testing and treatment decisions "should be the result of collaboration between the clinician and the patient with full disclosure of benefits and risks". "The best treatment strategy should be preferentially recommended", generally the approach that shows "the greatest magnitude of difference in comparing with placebo/sham", is superior to other approaches, has "the least risk of adverse effects and is low cost", with "the magnitude of treatment benefit" as "the most important" consideration and cost the least, though "at times cost may be the key distinguishing factor". If the patient cedes judgment, "the clinician's analysis as to the best treatment strategy should be implemented". For costlier options, "discretion should be generally exercised prior to ordering the test or treatment and the stronger the evidence of efficacy should be".

Chemical cold packs and ice packs — Limited studies show no benefit in heat reduction with traditional placement of ice or chemical cold packs over major vessels; ice packs have greater cooling capacity than chemical cold packs and, if used, are most efficacious when wet and covering the entire body; in a small translational study, chemical cold packs applied to the palms, soles, and cheeks showed twice the cooling rate compared to traditional major-vessel placements; Recommendations: If ice packs are used, we recommend applying them to cover the entire body (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If too few ice packs are available to cover the entire body, we recommend they be applied to the cheeks, palms, and soles rather than the skin covering the major vessels (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PdY73]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Corticosteroids significantly increase the proportion of patients with sore throat who will experience complete resolution of pain at both 24 and 48 hours. Fewer than four patients need to be treated to prevent one patient continuing to experience a painful sore throat at 24 hours. Although corticosteroids decreased the mean time to onset of pain relief by 6 hours, pooled analysis showed significant heterogeneity. All effects were in addition to antibiotic use.

We found that the effects of corticosteroids on mean time to onset of pain relief were homogenous in severe, exudative, or bacterial pathogen positive sore throat alone. Our data do not support an effect in mild sore throat because only one study included patients with milder symptoms at baseline, and showed no significant effect. A meta-regression analysis showed no evidence of interactions across different subgroups (such as route of corticosteroid, age, severity) on the outcome of mean time to onset of pain relief.

The effects of corticosteroids on resolution of pain were most apparent in the initial 24 hours, which implies that a single dose of corticosteroids may be sufficient. This effect is similar to that seen in croup where a single dose is generally adequate. Furthermore, the one trial comparing three daily doses of dexamethasone with a single dose found no difference in effect. w2

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^11435F2m]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling.

17.1 Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

17.2 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for cold sores.

17.3 Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that valacyclovir hydrochloride is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with valacyclovir hydrochloride. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type-specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV-2 acquisition exists.

Valacyclovir hydrochloride has not been shown to reduce transmission of sexually transmitted infections other than HSV-2.

If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated, patients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom of an episode.

There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated more than 72 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a first episode of genital herpes or more than 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of a recurrent episode.

There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 1 year's duration in otherwise healthy patients. There are no data on the safety or effectiveness of chronic suppressive therapy of more than 6 months' duration in HIV-infected patients.

17.4 Herpes Zoster

There are no data on treatment initiated more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Patients should be advised to initiate treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^117Dhz7v]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Guidelines recommend symptomatic management of pharyngitis as a first-line treatment, and suggest avoiding or delaying antibiotic use in acute pharyngitis, except in the minority of patients with more severe strep infection or risk factors for serious complications such as rheumatic fever. The availability of rapid and effective symptomatic relief is, therefore, an important factor in meeting patients' expectations and avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics; most cases of pharyngitis can be managed by patients using over-the-counter (OTC) treatments as a means of controlling their symptoms. As inflammation is the underlying cause of pharyngitis, treatment of the condition with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can offer rapid and long-lasting relief from pain.

To minimize the potential risk of an adverse event, regulatory bodies and medical societies recommend using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms. Locally administered formulations of NSAIDs, such as lozenges and sprays, facilitate targeted application of active ingredient to the throat, allowing absorption of the drug directly where it is needed. This allows administration of a lower dose than systemic therapy, reducing the potential for adverse effects. Flurbiprofen is an NSAID that has been formulated for local delivery at a low dose and is commercially available as a single active ingredient in both lozenge and spray formulations. It is most commonly used at a dose of 8.75 mg, based on the results of a dose-ranging study that demonstrated linear dose–response relationships for effectiveness and adverse events at doses between 5.0 mg and 12.5 mg. Its use for the symptomatic relief of pharyngitis of viral, bacterial, or unknown etiology has been assessed in a number of studies. It has also been evaluated for the relief of postoperative sore throat POST,–a common complication of general anesthesiaand tonsillectomythat can negatively impact patients' postoperative comfort.

The aim of this paper is to review the available clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, locally delivered to the throat for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis/sore throat. This review predominantly focuses on the management of sore throat associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI); its use for POST prevention is discussed in brief.

### A randomised double-blind study comparing the effect of 1072-nm light against placebo for the treatment of herpes labialis [^116U123C]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research demonstrated that 1072-nm narrowband laser light is effective in the treatment of cold sores.

Aim

To evaluate the efficacy of an over-the-counter cold-sore treatment device (Virulite CS) incorporating 1072-nm light-emitting diodes.

Methods

A randomised, prospective, double-blind, self-reported study was performed to compare the efficacy of at least six 3-min treatments of 1072-nm narrowband light against placebo, in the treatment of herpes labialis.

Results

The 1072-nm light-emitting diode device reduced cold-sore healing time to 6.3 days compared with 9.4 days for placebo (P = 0.048). The time the cold sore took to form a crust was also reduced from 2.00 days for those treated with 1072-nm light, compared with 2.88 days for placebo (P = 0.059)

Conclusions

The significant difference between the mean healing times in the two groups demonstrates that the Virulite CS device is an effective means of treating herpes labialis.

### Efficacy of cryotherapy for plantar warts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115USc1q]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the level of evidence and the degree of recommendation of the included studies, all were controlled and RCTs with a level of evidence of 1b and degree of recommendation A. In 10/14 and 11/14 of the included studies, a high risk‐of‐bias in the blinding of results and of participants and/or professionals respectively was found. A high risk‐of‐bias in the allocation concealment in 4/14 studies and high risk of bias in the random sequency in 1/14 studies was found. In general, in all studies a medium or high risk of bias in some of the items was observed, mainly due to lack of information. Even though all studies were randomized clinical trials, the high risk of bias in the blinding of patients and professionals together with the lack of information in most of the studies limits the conclusions of this review with meta‐analysis. In the meta‐analysis by Bertolotti et al.concerning the efficacy of cryotherapy for anogenital warts, they also found a high risk of bias in blinding. The authors consider blinding of the practitioner applying a non‐pharmacological treatment to be difficult and recommend the design of strategies for future RCTs, such as not informing participants of the study objectives until the end of the study.

Another limitation of the present study is the total cure rate was only analyzed and other aspects, such as partial clearance, number of sessions, time to cure, patient satisfaction, quality of life during treatment, and cost‐effectiveness ratios were not considered. Many of these variables were also not reported in most other studies. In addition, the intensity of cryotherapy and duration of application or form of application (spray or swab) was not sufficiently standardized in the RCTs. The lack of studies of each treatment was another limitation when making the subgroups since not enough articles could be found to be able to analyze each intervention separately from cryotherapy. Therefore, we grouped the treatments into four major subgroups (keratolytics, physical treatments, antiviral, chemotherapy, and retinoids, and placebo and others). For this reason, heterogeneity was high in most of the subgroups.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^116Fgr84]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Local therapies, such as lozenges and sprays, are useful for the symptomatic treatment of sore throats as they allow direct application to the inflamed and painful area, with a reduced risk of toxicity when compared with systemic treatments. Lozenges allow a high initial deposition of active ingredient in the mouth and throat, while sprays are effective in coating the posterior pharynxfor rapid delivery to the affected area.

Flurbiprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with proven analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, and lozenges containing 8.75 mg flurbiprofen have been shown to be safe and effective in relieving the symptoms of a sore throat (including pain).–Flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges are available over-the-counter in many countries, and they are the only formulation of flurbiprofen currently available in Russia. However, an innovative spray formulation containing flurbiprofen 8.75 mg has recently been developed to provide patients with another treatment option for the relief of sore throat symptoms. In the first safety and efficacy study of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray, treatment was well tolerated, and rapid, long-lasting relief from sore throat pain and other symptoms was observed.

The primary objective of this randomized, non-inferiority study was to assess the efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to URTI. Treatment was assessed in the overall population and in subgroups of patients who tested positive or negative for beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C).

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^111qHq9k]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome

Of the 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores, 70 reported a recurrence (32/38 (84%) in the BCG group and 38/46 (83%) in the control group) with a median time to recurrence of 2.2 (IQR 1.6, 3.5) months after randomisation in the BCG group, compared with 1.8 (IQR 1.1, 4.2) months in the control group. The time to first cold sore recurrence was 1.55 months greater in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p 0.02) with a HR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.32–0.91; Fig. 2, Table 2). The beneficial effect of BCG on the time to first cold sore recurrence was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p 0.003; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76; Table 2), and persisted in all the other sensitivity and supplementary analyses (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). In prespecified subgroup analyses (Fig. 2), only sex was associated with the treatment effect (p for treatment arm × sex interaction 0.007), with a difference in time to first cold sore recurrence of 5.20 (95% CI −0.14 to 10.53) months in males (HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02–1.71), compared with 0.43 (95% CI −1.04 to 1.91) months in females (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.53–1.41).

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116LEwRB]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Fig 4 Weighted mean difference in mean time to onset of pain relief (hours) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference was calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

Time to complete resolution of pain was reported in six studies. On average, patients receiving a single dose corticosteroid experienced complete resolution 11.1 hours earlier (95% confidence interval −0.4 to −21.8; I² = 85%; low quality; fig 5, table 2). In our subgroup analysis, we found a significantly larger effect among those treated with intramuscular corticosteroids (mean difference −22.4 (95% confidence interval −27.3 to −17.5) and −1.5 (−12.6 to 9.5), for intramuscular and oral corticosteroids, respectively; P = 0.001 for interaction); however, the effect modification is suggested by comparison between rather than within studies. We found no other subgroup effect (table B in appendix 3).

Fig 5 Weighted mean difference in mean time to complete resolution of pain (hours) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

Meta-analysis from eight studies that assessed pain with a visual analogue scale (0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) at baseline and after 24 hoursshowed a 1.3 points lower pain score among patients treated with corticosteroids compared with those treated with placebo at 24 hours (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 1.9; I² = 65%; moderate quality; fig 6, table 2). We found no evidence of subgroup effect for this outcome (table B in appendix 3).

Fig 6 Weighted mean difference in absolute reduction of pain at 24 hours (0–10; 0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) between corticosteroids and placebo groups in review of treatment of sore throat. Pooled mean difference calculated by DerSimonian-Laird random effects model

To assess the possibility that there was selective reporting, we examined the magnitude of effect on the time to onset of pain relief, time to complete resolution of pain, and absolute pain reduction in studies that did and did not report resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours. The magnitude of effect on the other pain outcomes was similar in both sets of studies, making selective reporting less likely (table C in appendix 3).

### Recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a comprehensive review and recommendations on therapeutic options [^112c8dvn]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common chronic disease in the oral mucosa that affects about 20% of the population. It is characterized by solitary or multiple, recurrent, small ulcers with erythematous haloes and yellow/gray floors. RAS can be managed through a wide variety of preventative measures and therapies, intending to reduce ulcer pain, stimulate ulcer healing, and/or prevent ulcer recurrence. First-line treatment options include topical medications in the form of corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide), anti-inflammatory drugs (amlexanox), antibiotics (doxycycline), and antiseptics (lidocaine). In more severe cases of RAS where local treatment is insufficient, systemic drugs in the form of corticosteroids (prednisone), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide), and antibiotics/antimicrobials (clofazimine) can prove effective. This review will summarize current treatment options for RAS with discussion of prevention, topical measures, natural treatments, systemic therapies, and new potential therapies. Furthermore, this review will provide recommendations on therapeutic options for RAS based on disease severity and patient circumstances.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of aphthous stomatitis [^1129nbRU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aphthous ulcers are the most common oral mucosal lesions in the general population. These often are recurrent and periodic lesions that cause clinically significant morbidity. Many suggestions have been proposed but the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is unknown. Several precipitating factors for aphthous ulcers appear to operate in subjects with genetic predisposition. An autoimmune or hypersensitivity mechanism is widely considered possible. Sometimes aphthous ulcers can be the sign of systemic diseases, so it is essential to establish a correct diagnosis to determine suitable therapy. Before initiating medications for aphthous lesions, clinicians should determine whether well-recognized causes are contributing to the disease and these factors should be corrected. Various treatment modalities are used, but no therapy is definitive. Topical medications, such as antimicrobial mouth-washes and topical corticosteroids (dexamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinonide, or clobetasol), can achieve the primary goal to reduce pain and to improve healing time but do not improve recurrence or remission rates. Systemic medications can be tried if topical therapy is ineffective.

Literature search

A systematic literature search was adopted with no language restrictions. The literature search was conducted by the two panel leads using seven electronic search engines: MEDLINE (PubMed MeSH), Wiley Online Library, Google Scholar, Athens, ResearchGate, Net and PubFacts.com. The search terms and inclusion criteria followed PICOS (Table S1; see Supporting Information). The Boolean AND and OR operators were used to combine these terms as appropriate. Searches of cited references were conducted on eligible papers. Updating of the available literature was continued up to publication. Forty‐six full articles were identified, and 36 were finally included after exclusion of 10 duplicates.

Inclusion criteria were applied to all articles identified by the searches (Appendix S8; see Supporting Information). These were discerned from the papers' abstracts and titles, or the full articles in cases of uncertainty. Papers that were unpublished or did not meet the methodological filters were retained as grey literature. These were examined to provide context or considered divergence within the main recommendations.

### Treatment of the common cold [^1151CgAt]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute upper respiratory tract infections are extremely common in adults and children, but only a few safe and effective treatments are available. Patients typically present with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, general malaise, and/or low-grade fever. Informing patients about the self-limited nature of the common cold can help manage expectations, limit antibiotic use, and avoid over-the-counter purchases that may not help. Treatments with proven effectiveness for cold symptoms in adults include over-the-counter analgesics, zinc, nasal decongestants with or without antihistamines, and ipratropium for cough. Lower-quality evidence suggests that Lactobacillus casei may be beneficial in older adults. The only established safe and effective treatments for children are acetylcysteine, honey (for children one year and older), nasal saline irrigation, intranasal ipratropium, and topical application of ointment containing camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus oils. Over-the-counter cold medications should not be used in children younger than four years. Counseling patients about the importance of good hand hygiene is the best way to prevent transmission of cold viruses.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan-associated select adverse events: clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management [^117DeahA]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

If OM/S is suspected, start by ruling out other causes (eg, oral thrush, herpetic lesions) and treat accordingly (eg, oral nystatin for oral thrush). If OM/S is confirmed, the clinical trial protocols suggested increasing the frequency of bland mouth rinses up to every hour, if necessary and applicable, and provide adequate topical pain management (eg, doxepin 0.5%, viscous lidocaine 2%). In addition to continuing prophylactic dexamethasone mouthwash or alternative, to temporarily help with oral pain so patients can eat and drink more comfortably, we consider prescribing a lidocaine-based mouthwash, such as one consisting of diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, and aluminum-magnesium hydroxide to be used 15–20 minutes before eating meals. We also may consider a topical clobetasol gel dabbed on mouth sores to be applied twice daily until improved and 3 times weekly until resolution. The mouth sores should be dried with gauze before applying the clobetasol gel. If severe OM/S occurs (grade ≥ 3), and it cannot be resolved topically or with dose holds or reductions, we also had significant success with using a short course of oral corticosteroids, as per institutional guidelines. We recommend patients drink smoothies, shakes, and other cold beverages to keep well hydrated and/or supplemental caloric drinks to help with oral AEs. We also counsel our patients to avoid crunchy, spicy, hot, and citrus/acidic foods. Additionally, patients should be educated to avoid tobacco and alcohol consumption.

PPES

Prevention strategies for PPES include prophylactic removal of hyperkeratotic areas, application of moisturizing cream containing urea ≥ 10%, pedicures, and cushioning of callused areas using soft or padded shoes [48]. Other preventive tactics include avoidance of activities that cause force or rubbing on the hands and feet during the first 6 weeks of treatment and limiting contact with harsh chemicals and sources of heat, such as sitting in saunas or the sun.

Management of PPES consists of keratolytic agents such as urea ≥ 10% for grade ≥ 1 PPES, with addition of high‐potency topical steroids such as fluocinonide 0.05% for grade ≥ 2 symptoms.

Stomatitis

Preventive strategies include undertaking dental work aimed at eliminating existing tooth and gum disease before the start of treatment and education regarding the importance of thorough and frequent cleaning of the oral cavity. Avoidance of salty, spicy, or citrus‐based foods, as well as hot beverages, may help prevent stomatitis.

Upon emergence of grade 1 or 2 stomatitis, dexamethasone 0.5 mg/5 mL elixir is recommended; an augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% gel applied to gauze and held against the affected surface may also assist in alleviating symptoms.

Dry Skin

Patients should be advised to moisturize skin to minimize the risk of skin adverse events and to avoid excessive exposure to detergents and soaps containing fragrances. Urea preparations have been shown to prevent transepidermal water loss, and salicylic acid preparations are helpful for their keratolytic, bacteriostatic, and fungicidal effects [50]. Exfoliation of scaly areas of xerosis is recommended. For more severe grade 3 xerosis, which results in asteatotic dermatitis, treatment can be initiated with low‐potency topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 2.5% cream/ointment or triamcinolone 0.1% cream.

Dry Mouth/Xerostomia

Patient education is an important component of dry mouth prevention. The importance of good oral hygiene, regular dentist visits, and other strategies for preventing oral disease should be stressed.

Treatment may include systemic and topical salivary stimulants, such as cevimeline and pilocarpine, and intraoral topical agents, such as chewing gums and saliva stimulants and substitutes [59]. High‐fluoride toothpaste is also recommended to prevent cavities.

The efficacy and safety of SITAVIG was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, patient-initiated, multicenter trial comparing SITAVIG 50 mg administered as a single dose (n = 378) to placebo (n = 397) in patients with recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores). A total of 376 SITAVIG treated patients and 395 placebo treated patients were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) efficacy population defined as all patients who took study treatment and who had a start date and time of treatment initiation recorded. The mean age was 41.0 years (range: 18–80 years) and the majority of patients were female (68.6%), and Caucasian (94.9%). All patients had at least 4 herpes episodes in the previous year of whom 68.4% had ≥ 5 episodes. Patients were instructed to initiate treatment within one hour after the onset of prodromal symptoms and before the appearance of any signs of herpes labialis lesions by applying the tablet to the buccal mucosa in the canine fossa. If the tablet was detached within the first 6 hours, subjects were instructed to reapply a tablet.

The mean and median durations of the recurrent herpes labialis episode (ITT population, n = 771) were approximately half a day shorter in patients treated with SITAVIG compared with patients treated with placebo.

In research participants from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc. with data on canker sores, 67.8% were over 45 years old, 59.2% of participants were female and 72.4% of participants reported ever having canker sores. In the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR) Over 50s (Aged) study (AG), which examined aging and age-related disease in twin pairs from the Australian Twin Registry, the mean age was 61.2 years (range = 50.2, 85.6). A large proportion of participants were female (74.1%) and the proportion reporting a history of mouth ulcers was 18.7%. Two other studies exclusively or partially included younger participants, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a UK population-based birth cohort (mean age = 23.9 years, range = 22.8, 25.3; 65.2% females), and QIMR Melanocytic Naevi in Adolescent Twins (TW) study, which primarily examined melanotic naevae in twin pairs (mean age 24.2 years, range = 10.1, 62.3 (a combination of adolescents and their parents); 53.8% females). In these studies, the proportion reporting ulcers was much higher (ALSPAC: ulcer cases = 74%, TW: percentage reporting having ulcers at least rarely = 86.8%) (Table 1).

Chemical cold packs/ice packs — adjunct placement and efficacy: Traditional use places packs on the neck, axillae, and groin, but limited studies show no benefit in heat reduction at these sites. Ice packs have greater cooling capacity than chemical cold packs and, if used, are most efficacious when wet and covering the entire body. A small translational study found chemical cold packs on the palms, soles, and cheeks produced twice the cooling rate over traditional major vascular locations. Recommendations: Ice packs should be applied to cover the entire body (1C), and if chemical cold packs are used, they should be applied to the cheeks, palms, and soles rather than the skin covering the major vessels (1C).

### Dying comfortably in very old age with or without dementia in different care settings-a representative "older old" population study [^115pkiKa]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 3
Distribution of symptoms in the final illness Informants' reports describe a complex overlap of multiple symptoms experienced by very old people in their final illness. Illustrates this for participants with any reported symptoms (n = 155 with for whom informants replied "Yes" for at least one symptom; n = 18 with only "No" responses and n = 7 with only "No" or "Don't know" responses not shown). The majority (61%) of participants were reported to have suffered from at least two of the seven symptoms that the study interviews asked about. For only 10% were none of these symptoms reported, and for a further 4% informants were unsure whether they had suffered any of these symptoms

Figure 4 illustrates what percentage of the people who were reported to have had pain (n = 73, 41%), depression (n = 51, 29%) and pressure sores (n = 29, 16%) were also reported to have had treatment for these and, of these treated, for what percentage treatment was reported to have been effective. For example, of the 41% reported to have had pain 78% reportedly had pain-relieving treatment, for whom informants reported 53% found this effective, i.e. only 41% of those in pain were thought to have had adequate pain relief (53% of 78%). Informants were frequently uncertain as to whether these symptoms were experienced, treated and, if so, whether symptoms were relieved. This was particularly so for depression and pressure sores.

Fig. 4
Treatment reported for pain, depression and pressure sores and reported effectiveness. Illustrates what proportion of three treatable symptoms reported to have affected deceased participants in their final illness – pain, depression and pressure sores – were said by informants to have been given any treatment and, if so, what proportion of those treated were reported to have had effective symptom relief. For example, of the 29% reported as suffering depression only 8% received treatment, of which only half were reported to have been effective

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^113JnJ4P]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Burns: Cooling thermal burns — Background and referral context: Thermal burns are caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, hot surfaces, and hot gases. Burns can lead to damaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychosocial consequences. Superficial (first-degree) burns are characterized by skin redness and pain without blistering or other loosening or destruction of the skin surface, and the intact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree burns generally heal without scarring, and the risk of infection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve destruction of the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and often require treatment beyond what can be provided in the first aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, and reduce scarring. Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalation injury (sore throat around the nose or mouth, difficulty breathing) require hospital treatment. Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied, the majority of studies involve immediate application of cool running water.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^112SUenu]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed to many people with sore throat. As most cases of sore throat are viral and/or self-limiting, guidelines recommend symptomatic management as first-line treatment. This paper reviews the available clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, locally delivered to the throat for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis/sore throat.

Method

A literature search was performed on 27 February 2019 using PubMed. Studies that met the following criteria were included in a narrative review: (1) studies evaluating the effectiveness of flurbiprofen for pharyngitis/sore throat; (2) randomized controlled studies; (3) locally administered formulation of study drug/comparator; and (4) flurbiprofen administered at 8.75 mg dose (single- or multiple-dose administration).

Results

A total of 17 papers were included in the review: 15 publications reporting data from nine unique clinical studies of flurbiprofen for acute pharyngitis, and two reporting studies of flurbiprofen for the prevention of postoperative sore throat (POST). Studies in acute pharyngitis demonstrated that single- and multiple-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg, locally administered in lozenge, spray or microgranule form, was well tolerated and provided early onset and long-lasting symptomatic relief from throat pain and soreness, sensation of swollen throat, difficulty swallowing, and other associated symptoms. This included patients with more severe symptoms, patients with confirmed Streptococcus A/C sore throat, and patients taking concomitant antibiotics. In addition, a single preoperative dose of flurbiprofen lozenge was shown to be effective for relieving early POST in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

Conclusion

Locally administered, low-dose flurbiprofen offers a useful first-line treatment option for symptomatic relief in patients with "uncomplicated" acute pharyngitis/sore throat associated with upper respiratory tract infection, thus potentially helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. It also offers an effective preoperative treatment option for the reduction of early POST severity and incidence.

### Patient information: what are canker sores? [^112QZDKw]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The cause of canker sores is unclear but may be related to an immune reaction, genetic factors, or deficiencies in nutrients, including vitamin B12, folic acid, and ferritin. Canker sores are more common in patients with certain medical conditions, such as celiac disease, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and HIV/AIDS. Sodium lauryl sulfate, a primary cleansing agent in toothpaste, has also been associated with canker sores. There are 3 categories of canker sores based on the size and number of ulcers. Minor canker sores comprise about 80% of all canker sores. They are small, painful, round- or oval-shaped grayish-white ulcers encircled by a red ring that can occur on the inside lining of the lips and cheeks, the underside of the tongue, and the area of the mouth below the tongue. Minor canker sores usually heal without scarring within 7 to 10 days.

Major canker sores are the most severe type, accounting for about 10% to 15% of canker sores. They often occur in clusters of 1 to 3 ulcers on the lips, throat, and soft palate. Major canker sores are painful ulcers that are larger than 1 cm, may persist for longer than 4 weeks, and often cause scarring. Herpetiform canker sores are the least common type. They are very small painful ulcers that often merge to form larger, irregularly shaped ulcers. Herpetiform canker sores typically heal without scarring within 7 to 14 days. Most canker sores heal on their own. Natural compounds such as curcumin and honey extract as well as herbal therapies and probiotics can decrease canker sore pain and may reduce the size of the ulcers. For individuals with recurrent canker sores, topical corticosteroids may reduce the size and frequency of the ulcers. Laser therapy may also help decrease symptoms and promote healing.

People with severe or frequently recurring canker sores may be prescribed oral medications to improve healing and/or reduce recurrence.
