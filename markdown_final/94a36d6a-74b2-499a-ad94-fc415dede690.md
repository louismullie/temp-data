## Question

Is there a cut off age for a cardiac ablation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a cutoff age for cardiac ablation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what major guidelines and consensus statements say about age limits. Then, I should verify how age influences outcomes and complications in randomized and observational data. Next, I will examine pediatric and very elderly cohorts to understand practical thresholds. After that, I need to consider arrhythmia-specific nuances and emerging technologies like pulsed-field ablation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state a clear conclusion with caveats anchored to the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance on a hard age cutoff. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline does not specify a maximum age for catheter ablation; instead, it emphasizes symptom-driven rhythm control and patient selection, including that ablation can be first-line in selected patients and is reasonable after failed or intolerant antiarrhythmic therapy, without any numeric upper age limit in the indication language [^115Qfavv] [^1113ZkDJ]. The 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS AF ablation consensus explicitly states it is reasonable to use similar indications in selected older people as in younger patients, acknowledging somewhat higher complications, greater need for concomitant AADs, and somewhat reduced efficacy, again without proposing a strict age cutoff [^112MJUxT] [^112U9Gxa]. For SVT, the 2015 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline advises individualized management in adults over 75, again implying no fixed age ceiling [^11633QLL].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric considerations because sometimes people conflate "minimum age" with "minimum weight". The PACES/HRS pediatric consensus moved away from age thresholds and adopted a weight-based framework, generally using approximately 15 kg to stratify candidacy, with ablation in very small infants reserved for life-threatening or refractory arrhythmias and performed by experienced pediatric electrophysiologists; this is a practical safety threshold rather than a biological age prohibition [^111pr6NB] [^114TvZei]. I initially thought there was a strict minimum age of 4–5 years, but hold on, I should correct that: the consensus deliberately de-emphasized age in favor of weight and operator/institutional expertise, so there is no endorsed minimum age per se, only a weight- and risk-informed approach [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how age actually affects outcomes in older adults. The CABANA randomized trial showed the largest relative and absolute benefit of ablation versus drugs in patients under 65, a modest benefit in 65–74, and no clear composite outcome benefit in those 75 and older, though arrhythmia recurrence was still lower with ablation across all age strata, which is clinically meaningful for symptom control [^116a41um]. Observational long-term data suggest that each 10-year increase in age associates with higher recurrence, death, and major adverse cardiac events after AF ablation, reinforcing that age meaningfully modifies risk–benefit, even if it does not impose a categorical exclusion [^11485bpe] [^112U9Gxa].

> I will now examine very elderly cohorts to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. Multiple registries and series report that patients 80 years and older can undergo AF ablation with acceptable safety and similar acute success, albeit with higher comorbidity burdens and sometimes more recurrences; for example, UC San Diego registry data found comparable long-term outcomes in octogenarians versus younger patients, and a meta-analysis of patients over 75 showed similar success but higher complication rates compared with younger cohorts [^113HcGgu] [^113TpWye] [^116aGJVR]. But wait, I should double-check that these are mostly observational and subject to selection bias toward healthier elderly, so the absence of a prohibitive signal does not equal universal eligibility [^116aGJVR].

> Let me consider arrhythmia-specific nuances. For typical atrial flutter, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation is highly effective and often favored over long-term antiarrhythmic therapy, and age alone rarely precludes it when symptoms warrant intervention, though careful patient selection is prudent in the very old [^115Qfavv]. For AVNRT, contemporary series show excellent acute success exceeding 95% even in patients over 75, with low but nonzero complication rates, supporting ablation as a reasonable option when symptoms are significant or drugs are undesirable [^115bnKtD]. For ventricular tachycardia in structural heart disease, small geriatric series suggest similar procedural endpoints and acceptable safety in octogenarians, but candidacy should hinge on substrate, hemodynamics, and life expectancy rather than age alone [^117X3ZXu].

> Hold on, I should verify how emerging technologies alter the calculus. Pulsed-field ablation (PFA) cohorts demonstrate rapid pulmonary vein isolation with low overall complication rates and comparable acute procedural metrics in older adults, though recurrence remains higher in those 75 and older, consistent with substrate effects rather than a safety signal from the energy source itself; this supports the notion that technology may mitigate some risks but does not erase age-related substrate and recurrence risk [^112dis7b] [^113MY9QU] [^11228KdN]. I need to ensure we do not overstate PFA-specific age benefits, as head-to-head randomized age-stratified data are still limited [^113TRuWF].

> Next, I should review frailty and procedural risk modifiers because chronological age is an imperfect proxy. Nationwide data show that frailty, not just age, independently predicts mortality, complications, and readmissions after AF ablation, and very elderly patients in contemporary practice are increasingly represented, underscoring the need to integrate frailty, comorbidity burden, and center/operator experience into decisions rather than applying a rigid age cutoff [^113jYj3u] [^112Jnw8Y]. Let me reconsider whether volume thresholds are codified; while some advocate minimum operator or center volumes, exact numeric cutoffs are not universally mandated, though outcomes correlate with experience, which is particularly relevant for older or complex patients [^115Atj8S].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no guideline-endorsed, universally applied cutoff age for cardiac ablation; candidacy should be individualized based on symptoms, arrhythmia type, atrial substrate, frailty and comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preferences, with shared decision-making that transparently discusses higher complication rates and somewhat lower efficacy in older adults but also the potential for meaningful symptom and quality-of-life improvements [^115Qfavv] [^112MJUxT] [^116rYHaf]. Practically, many centers accept patients into their 80s when they are reasonably robust, while recognizing that the balance may favor medical therapy in frail, multimorbid, or limited-life-expectancy individuals, and that earlier intervention in the disease course may improve success and durability of rhythm control [^113HcGgu] [^113TpWye] [^117J8hdT].

> Final answer: No, there is no official cutoff age for cardiac ablation; ablation can be considered across the lifespan when clinically indicated, with pediatric candidacy guided primarily by weight and risk rather than age, and adult and elderly candidacy determined by symptoms, arrhythmia substrate, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences, acknowledging higher complication rates and modestly lower efficacy with advancing age but no absolute age-based exclusion in contemporary guidelines [^111pr6NB] [^115Qfavv] [^112MJUxT] [^116a41um].

There is **no strict age cutoff** for cardiac ablation [^113TpWye]. Decisions should be individualized based on symptoms, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^11633QLL]. Ablation is reasonable in selected older adults, including those ≥ 75–80 years [^112BTuoM], but **complication rates are higher** and efficacy is somewhat lower with advancing age [^112U9Gxa] [^116aGJVR]. In children, ablation is generally considered for those ≥ 15 kg or > 4 years, with caution in smaller infants [^111pr6NB] [^111kWsFe]. There is no absolute upper or lower age limit; candidacy depends on a careful risk–benefit assessment and shared decision-making [^112MJUxT].

---

## Upper age limit for cardiac ablation

- **No strict upper age limit**: There is no universally accepted upper age limit for cardiac ablation [^113TpWye]. The decision to perform ablation in older adults is individualized, considering symptoms, comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preferences [^11633QLL].

- **Elderly patients (≥ 75 years)**: Studies and expert consensus statements indicate that catheter ablation can be performed safely and effectively in selected elderly patients, including those aged 75 years and older [^112BTuoM]. However, complication rates are somewhat higher, and efficacy may be reduced compared to younger patients [^112U9Gxa] [^116aGJVR].

- **Very elderly patients (≥ 80 years)**: Recent studies have demonstrated that catheter ablation can be performed safely and effectively in patients aged 80 years and older, with acceptable complication rates and favorable clinical outcomes [^113HcGgu] [^113TpWye]. Nevertheless, careful patient selection and risk assessment are essential [^113jYj3u].

---

## Lower age limit for cardiac ablation

- **Pediatric patients**: There is no strict lower age limit for cardiac ablation in pediatric patients. The decision to perform ablation in young children is based on factors such as weight, arrhythmia type, and clinical urgency [^111pr6NB].

- **Weight-based considerations**: The PACES/HRS expert consensus statement recommends that catheter ablation be considered in children weighing at least 15 kg (approximately 33 pounds) [^111pr6NB]. For smaller children, particularly those weighing less than 15 kg, ablation is generally reserved for life-threatening or refractory arrhythmias [^111kWsFe].

- **Infants and very young children**: Ablation in infants and very young children (≤ 1 year old) is controversial and typically reserved for severe, life-threatening arrhythmias refractory to medical management. The risks and benefits must be carefully weighed, and procedures should be performed by experienced pediatric electrophysiologists [^113mtwvT].

## Factors influencing age-related candidacy for cardiac ablation

Several factors influence the decision to perform cardiac ablation across different age groups:

| **Factor** | **Influence on candidacy** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older age is associated with higher complication rates and reduced efficacy, but no absolute cutoff exists [^112MJUxT] [^116aGJVR] |
| Comorbidities | Higher comorbidity burden increases procedural risk and may influence decision-making [^113jYj3u] |
| Arrhythmia type and severity | Persistent AF and complex arrhythmias may have lower success rates and higher recurrence rates in older patients [^112U9Gxa] |
| Patient preferences | Shared decision-making and patient preferences play a crucial role in determining candidacy [^116kVxyq] |
| Operator experience and facility resources | Experienced operators and well-equipped facilities are essential for safe and effective ablation in older patients [^112RSiPj] |

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications by age group

- **Younger patients (< 65 years)**: Generally experience lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays, and higher success rates compared to older patients [^117R6x7y] [^116AZ3UU].

- **Middle-aged patients (65–74 years)**: Moderate complication rates and success rates, with individualized decision-making based on comorbidities and patient preferences [^116a41um].

- **Elderly patients (≥ 75 years)**: Higher complication rates, including vascular complications and stroke, but acceptable success rates in selected patients [^116aGJVR] [^112U9Gxa].

- **Very elderly patients (≥ 80 years)**: Acceptable safety and efficacy profiles in carefully selected patients, with careful risk assessment and patient selection [^113HcGgu] [^113TpWye].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements emphasize individualized decision-making based on patient-specific factors rather than strict age cutoffs [^116kVxyq]. The **HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert consensus statement** recommends that catheter ablation be considered in selected older patients, acknowledging higher complication rates and reduced efficacy but supporting its use when clinically indicated [^112MJUxT]. The **PACES/HRS expert consensus statement** provides specific recommendations for pediatric patients, emphasizing weight-based considerations and clinical urgency rather than strict age limits [^111pr6NB].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no strict age cutoff** for cardiac ablation. The decision to perform ablation should be individualized, considering patient age, comorbidities, arrhythmia type and severity, and patient preferences. Ablation can be performed safely and effectively in selected elderly patients, including those aged 75 years and older, but careful risk assessment and shared decision-making are essential [^112U9Gxa]. In pediatric patients, ablation is generally considered for children weighing at least 15 kg, with caution exercised in smaller infants [^111pr6NB].

Catheter Ablation in Older People

AF is in large part a disease of the older person. During the past decade, there have been a number of studies that have specifically focused on reporting the outcomes of AF ablation in older individuals. The age cutoff for defining elderly varied between age ≥ 70 years, age ≥ 75 years, and age ≥ 80 years. The number of older people in these studies was small, with five of the seven studies enrolling fewer than 100 patients and the largest reporting outcomes on 261 older people. Taken as a whole, the results of these studies provide evidence that catheter ablation of AF has an acceptable safety and efficacy profile in selected older individual over the age of 75 or 80 years. However, as shown in analysis of the relationship between age and 5-year outcomes of AF ablation, age significantly impacts long-term outcomes of AF ablation. This study reported that for every 10-year increase in age there was a higher multivariate-adjusted risk of AF recurrence, death, and major cardiac events.

The writing group recommends that it is reasonable to use similar indications for AF ablation in selected older people with AF as in younger patients (Class IIa, LOE B-NR). It is important to note that the complications of the procedure are somewhat increased in older individuals, the need for concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy postablation is greater, and the efficacy is somewhat reduced. It is also important to recognize that amiodarone, although not a good long-term pharmacological option in younger individuals, is an appropriate treatment strategy in older people.

Catheter Ablation in Other Populations of Patients Not Well Represented in Clinical Trials

Shown in Table 2 are indications for AF ablation in several additional subgroups of patients not well represented in clinical trials. These subgroups include patients with hypertrophic dilated cardiomyopathy, young patients (< 45 years of age), high-level athletes, and patients with tachy-brady syndrome. The references supporting the recommendations of the writing group are shown.

### PACES / HRS expert consensus statement on the use of catheter ablation in children and patients with congenital heart disease: developed in partnership with the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the association for European pediatric and congenital cardiology (AEPC) [^111pr6NB]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

PACES/HRS pediatric catheter ablation — recommendation organization and patient-size threshold are specified as follows: guidance is divided into three categories (Safety, Procedure, Arrhythmia) per the statements that recommendations are split into "Safety — those related to general issues, such as substrate location, the risk of AV block, and coronary risk; Procedure — issues related to laboratory equipment, personnel, fluoroscopy use, ablation energy, catheter choice, sedation/anesthesia, and pre- and post-ablation procedure management; and Arrhythmia — issues related to the specific condition being managed". Prior age-based thresholds were " > 4 years" or " < 5 years", but the committee concluded that "age was a less important factor than patient weight" and "chose a cutoff of 'approximately 15 kg'", noting "The neonate or very small infant is one exception". For voting, "'consensus' was defined as a 75% or greater agreement by the writing members".

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

PACES/HRS — weight-based categorization and general guidance for ablation in small children specify that the task force chose an approximate cutoff of 15 kg to differentiate indications for ablation, with children less than approximately 15 kg termed "smaller children" and over 15 kg "larger children". In general, catheter ablation in the very smallest children (3 to 7 kg and younger than 6 months of age) should be reserved for life-threatening arrhythmias or refractory arrhythmias after multiple failed attempts at medical management. Ablation should be performed by an experienced pediatric electrophysiologist who limits power, temperature, and the number and duration of applications, and the use of alternate energy sources prior to RF, such as cryoablation, can be considered.

### VT ablation in geriatric patients with structural heart disease: should there still be an age limit? [^117X3ZXu]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study sought to examine the feasibility and outcome of ablation of ventricular tachycardias (VTs) in a contemporary cohort of geriatric patients with structural heart disease (SHD).

Background

Geriatric patients are often underrepresented in large studies. As frailty is becoming an increasing problem, we need to examine the best course of action for this population.

Methods and Results

We investigated 68 SHD-patients ≥ 75 years old undergoing VT-ablation (men 88%, ischemic cardiomyopathy 77%, electrical storm 72%, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 31%) and divided the cohort into two groups: 75–79 years old (n = 51) and ≥ 80 years old (n = 17). The two groups showed similar results regarding noninducibility as ablation endpoint (p = .693), major procedure-related complications (p = .488), and VT-recurrence (p = .882) during the 39-month follow-up. At the end of the follow-up, 10 patients in the octogenarian group (59%) versus 16 patients of the other group (31%) died.

Conclusion

Geriatric patients with SHD including octogenarians showed similar results regarding procedural endpoints, freedom of VT, and major procedure-associated complications after VT-ablation. When ablation is indicated, age alone should not be an inhibiting factor to treat these patients.

### Does age impact safety and efficacy during pulse-field ablation for atrial fibrillation? [^11228KdN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficiency and Efficacy Profile

The assessment of catheter ablation outcomes in older patients with AF remains inconclusive due to the limited sample sizes in existing studies, variations in ablation methodologies, and heterogeneous patient selection criteria. The potential benefits of catheter ablation for older patients, particularly those > 75 years old, compared with younger counterparts remain uncertain, primarily due to the exclusion or underrepresentation of this older demographic in clinical trials. Consequently, the available published data show conflicting results regarding the efficacy of catheter ablation in the aged.

Heeger et al, comparing patients aged 65–74 versus ≥ 75 years after AF cryoballoon ablation, showed no statistical difference between age groups (38.8% versus 38.7%). This percentage of recurrences was to be expected, because several studies have shown similar re‐occurrence of AF after 1 ablation procedure. Based on our findings, even in our population there were no statistically significant differences in terms of arrhythmia recurrences during follow‐up between patients aged 65 to 74 years and patients aged ≥ 75 years. However, younger patients had a significantly lower arrhythmia recurrence rate and later recurrences than older patients, using a 65‐years cut‐off. This finding has been confirmed even after normalizing for confounders (eg, comorbidities).

Notably, the Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation trialrevealed an age‐related disparity in clinical outcomes between ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy, with the greatest relative and absolute prognostic benefit observed in patients < 65 years of age, suggesting potential clinical benefits of catheter ablation for select patient subgroups.

In addition to that, age is a significant factor in the development of extensive atrial fibrosis, which is linked to a reduced likelihood of successful AF ablation, and our study also confirmed previous observations that older patients presented more frequently with extra‐PV triggers or low voltage areas necessitating additional left atrial ablations.

Moreover, older patients exhibited a higher burden of comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease, underscoring the need for extended catheter laboratory utilization due to the inherent complexity of their cases. However, it is noteworthy that procedural, fluoroscopy, and ablation times were comparable between older and younger patient cohorts.

Given these considerations, age alone should not serve as a decisive factor in determining candidacy for AF ablation, particularly when considering potential benefits such as reduced incidence of cardioembolic events and dementiaassociated with AF ablation, in patients who may exhibit contraindications for oral anticoagulation more frequently.

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^115Atj8S]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — procedure volume considerations report that "some experts have advocated mandatory minimum numbers for invasive procedures (eg, catheter ablation or appendage occlusion) in order to optimize quality", and that "These minimum volume standards are relatively easy to implement and track over time". The page adds that "There is a positive correlation between case volume and treatment results and an inverse correlation with complication rates", yet "many questions regarding minimum volume requirements remain unanswered, including the optimum cutoff, the lack of scientific data for any clear value for cutoffs, and whether volume requirements should be per center or per operator".

Age and atrial fibrillation ablation — In ageing patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), studies defined ageing variably as ≥ 65 through to ≥ 80, and observational data report high multiple-procedure success rates at 12 months of up to 80% in older patients; however, one study showed a reduced success rate in patients over 65 years while another showed similar efficacy in those over the age of 80 years to the younger cohort.

### Arrhythmias in patients ≥ 80 years of age: pathophysiology, management, and outcomes [^112YKen9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Advances in medical care have led to an increase in the number of octogenarians and even older patients, forming an important and unique patient subgroup. It is clear that advancing age is an independent risk factor for the development of most arrhythmias, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Patients ≥ 80 years of age have significant structural and electrical remodeling of cardiac tissue; accrue competing comorbidities; react differently to drug therapy; and may experience falls, frailty, and cognitive impairment, presenting significant therapeutic challenges. Unfortunately, very old patients are under-represented in clinical trials, leading to critical gaps in evidence to guide effective and safe treatment of arrhythmias. In this state-of-the-art review, we examine the pathophysiology of aging and arrhythmias and then present the available evidence on age-specific management of the most common arrhythmias, including drugs, catheter ablation, and cardiac implantable electronic devices.

Age-related risk in atrial fibrillation (AF) increases markedly with aging; it is rare to develop AF prior to age 50, and by age 80, approximately 10% of individuals are diagnosed with AF, and age is noted as perhaps the most powerful AF risk factor.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia in older adults — individualized management: Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in patients more than 75 years of age should be individualized to incorporate age, comorbid illness, physical and cognitive functions, patient preferences, and severity of symptoms, and therapeutic decisions should be balanced between the overall risks and benefits of the invasive nature of ablation versus long-term commitment to pharmacological therapy.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to young patients, catheter ablation, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering catheter ablation as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF in selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, if rhythm control is desired.

### Does age impact safety and efficacy during pulse-field ablation for atrial fibrillation? [^115jCwyk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional evaluations comparing different technologies in a specific older population are imperative to definitively clarify which strategy may be the best, both in terms of effectiveness and safety, for a subset of patients with more comorbidities and potential risk of increased complications.

Limitations

The principal limitations of this study arise from its intrinsic nonrandomized design. Nevertheless, the study was conducted prospectively, adhering to the standard‐of‐care protocols at each participating center for AF ablation and patient management. Moreover, the ATHENA study was designed to evaluate the real‐world application and integration of a specific ablation technology within a heterogeneous population of patients with AF. Additionally, the proportion of very older patients (> 75 years, ≈10%) undergoing AF ablation is relatively low. Nevertheless, this cohort represents the largest population treated with the PFA system to date, allowing for comparisons with their younger counterparts.

### Association of age with clinical features and ablation outcomes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias [^111V18M2]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The role of age in clinical characteristics and catheter ablation outcomes of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) or orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) has been assessed in retrospective studies categorising age by arbitrary cut-offs, but contemporary analyses of age-related trends are lacking. We aimed to study the relationship of age with epidemiological, clinical features and catheter ablation outcomes of AVNRT and AVRT.

Methods

We recruited 600 patients (median age 56 years, 60% female) with a confirmed diagnosis of AVNRT (n = 455) or AVRT (n = 145) by means of an electrophysiological study. They were interrogated for arrhythmia-related symptoms with a structured questionnaire and followed up to 1 year. We analysed age as a continuous variable using regression models and adjusting for relevant covariables.

Results

Both typical and atypical forms of AVNRT upraised with age while AVRT decreased (p < 0.001 by regression). Female sex predominance in AVNRT was not observed in older patients. Overall, these tachycardias became more symptomatic with ageing despite a longer tachycardia cycle length (p < 0.001) and regardless of the presence of structural heart disease, with a higher proportion of dizziness, syncope, chest pain or dyspnoea (p < 0.005 for all) and a lower presence of palpitations or neck pounding (p < 0.001 for both). Age was not associated with catheter ablation acute success, periprocedural complications or 1-year recurrence rates (p > 0.05 for all).

Conclusions

Age, evaluated as a continuous variable, had a significant association with the clinical profile of patients with AVNRT and AVRT. Nevertheless, catheter ablation outcomes and complications were not significantly related to patients' age.

### Does age impact safety and efficacy during pulse-field ablation for atrial fibrillation? [^112vUMrs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases progressively with age, and the anticipated trend in the age distribution of AF within developed countries suggests a forthcoming shift, characterized by a projected rise in AF prevalence among the older population. Age represents a significant risk factor not only for the initial onset but also for the subsequent progression of AF from paroxysmal to persistent and permanent forms. Thermal ablation, utilizing radiofrequency or cryoballoon, is an established strategy for AF. Recent meta‐analyses have shown comparable success rates in AF ablation, albeit with a notably elevated risk of complications observed in patients > 75 years of age compared with their younger counterparts.

A novel nonthermal ablation approach known as pulsed field ablation (PFA) has recently emerged, providing fast lesion creation through irreversible electroporation. There is limited evidence assessing the efficiency, effectiveness, and safety outcomes of PFA technology in older (> 75 years) patients. The aim of our analysis is to compare the safety and efficacy of PFA in older patients (≥ 75 years of age) to younger patients.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^111sdf4C]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Scope of the guideline — The document provides a contemporary guideline for the management of adults who have ventricular arrhythmias (VA) or who are at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) from VA. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is defined as the sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation. The guideline includes indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for treatment of VA and prevention of SCD but does not delve into individual device selection and programming, and it includes indications for catheter ablation of VA but does not provide recommendations on specific techniques or ablation technologies. Recommendations for interventional therapies apply only if they can be implemented by qualified clinicians such that outcomes consistent with published literature are a reasonable expectation, and all ICD-related recommendations require that meaningful survival of > 1 year is expected. The document is aimed at the adult population (≥ 18 years of age) and offers no specific recommendations for pediatric patients.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^114nky5B]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guideline — scope, definitions, and applicability defines sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) as the "sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation", limits scope to SCA and sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias (VA), and includes indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and catheter ablation while excluding device selection/programming details and ablation techniques. An American Heart Association science advisory discusses wearable cardioverter-defibrillators, but recommendations on this topic were developed independently of that document. Interventional therapy recommendations apply only if therapies can be implemented by qualified clinicians with outcomes consistent with the published literature, and all ICD-related recommendations require that meaningful survival of > 1 year is expected, defined as reasonable quality of life and functional status. The document is aimed at the adult population (≥ 18 years of age) and offers no specific recommendations for pediatric patients.

### Does age impact safety and efficacy during pulse-field ablation for atrial fibrillation? [^112dis7b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no evidence evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and safety outcomes in older patients in the context of pulsed-field ablation technology for the ablation of atrial fibrillation. We aimed to compare safety, efficacy, and acute and long-term outcomes of pulsed-field ablation in older patients (≥ 75years) with younger ones.

Methods

We enrolled consecutive patients who had undergone atrial fibrillation ablation with the pulsed-field ablation FARAPULSE system (Boston Scientific) at 15 centers. Patients were stratified by age (< 65, 65–74, and ≥ 75years) and efficacy and safety profiles of these groups were compared.

Results

A total of 1082 patients were included: 108 (10%) were ≥ 75years old, 374 (34.6%) were 65–74years old and 600 (55.4%) were < 65years old. Older patients displayed a more pronounced risk profile compared with their younger counterparts, characterized by a significant higher burden of comorbidities. No differences in terms of procedural metrics were found. Pulmonary vein isolation was achieved in all patients. An overall low rate of procedural-related complications was reported (3.0%) without difference between young and older patients (P = 0.241). During a mean follow-up of 342 ± 111days, a primary efficacy end point occurred in 605 of 748 (80.9%) patients with available outcome information. The arrhythmia recurrence rate ranged from 14.4% in patients < 65years old to 26.9% of older patients (P = 0.011).

Conclusions

Drawing from these findings, using the FARAPULSE system for atrial fibrillation ablation in older patients demonstrated swift, safe, and effective acute outcomes, mirroring a comparable pattern observed in younger patients and recurrence rates in line with the literature in older patients.

The management of the asymptomatic pre-excited patient largely hinges on risk stratification and individual patient considerations and choice. A high threshold to treat patients may lead to a small overall risk of death while a low threshold clearly leads to increased invasive testing and ablation with associated cost and procedural risk. A firm recommendation to uniformly assess all by electrophysiology study or, alternatively, reassure all is inappropriate and unjustified by data as reflected in the recent guideline recommendations. The use of noninvasive and invasive parameters to identify the potentially at-risk individual with surveillance for symptoms in those comfortable with this approach or ablation for those choosing this alternative for individual reasons remains the cornerstone of best practice.

Background

There is no evidence evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and safety outcomes in older patients in the context of pulsed‐field ablation technology for the ablation of atrial fibrillation. We aimed to compare safety, efficacy, and acute and long‐term outcomes of pulsed‐field ablation in older patients (≥ 75 years) with younger ones.

### Association between age and outcomes of catheter ablation versus medical therapy for atrial fibrillation: results from the CABANA trial [^116a41um]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Observational data suggest that catheter ablation may be safe and effective to treat younger and older patients with atrial fibrillation. No large, randomized trial has examined this issue. This report describes outcomes according to age at entry in the CABANA trial (Catheter Ablation versus Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation).

Methods

Patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 65 years of age, or < 65 with ≥ 1 risk factor for stroke, were randomly assigned to catheter ablation versus drug therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, the composite of mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Treatment effect estimates were adjusted for baseline covariables using proportional hazards regression models.

Results

Of 2204 patients randomly assigned in CABANA, 766 (34.8%) were < 65 years of age, 1130 (51.3%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 308 (14.0%) were ≥ 75 years of age. Catheter ablation was associated with a 43% reduction in the primary outcome for patients < 65 years of age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.57 [95% CI, 0.30–1.09]), a 21% reduction for 65 to 74 years of age (aHR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.54–1.16]), and an indeterminate effect for age ≥ 75 years of age (aHR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.75–2.58]). Four-year event rates for ablation versus drug therapy across age groups, respectively, were 3.2% versus 7.8%, 7.8% versus 9.6%, and 14.8% versus 9.0%. For every 10-year increase in age, the primary outcome aHR increased (ie, less favorable to ablation) an average of 27% (interaction P value = 0.215). A similar pattern was seen with all-cause mortality: for every 10-year increase in age, the aHR increased an average of 46% (interaction P value = 0.111). Atrial fibrillation recurrence rates were lower with ablation than with drug therapy across age subgroups (aHR 0.47, 0.58, and 0.49, respectively). Treatment-related complications were infrequent for both arms (< 3%) regardless of age.

Conclusions

We found age-based variations in clinical outcomes for catheter ablation compared with drug therapy, with the largest relative and absolute benefits of catheter ablation in younger patients. No prognostic benefits for ablation were seen in the oldest patients. No differences were found by age in treatment-related complications or in the relative effectiveness of catheter ablation in preventing recurrent atrial arrhythmias.

### How to assess the impact of diagnosis-to-ablation time in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation [^112WhAmj]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Zhou et al. have elucidated that a reduced diagnosis‐to‐ablation time correlates with diminished susceptibility to cardiovascular incidents and recurrent atrial fibrillation among patients exhibiting early‐onset atrial fibrillation. However, several pivotal concerns have been raised.

One significant query pertains to the rationale behind the authors' delineation of the threshold for early‐onset atrial fibrillation at 45 years, as opposed to the commonly established 60 years. Previous literature has indicated the conjunction of early‐onset atrial fibrillation with hypertension at the age of 40. This early‐onset manifestation of atrial fibrillation might potentially intertwine with distinctive genetic disorders. Notably, the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation following catheter ablation stands at 40% over a span of 5 years, signifying a considerable rate warranting comprehensive interventions addressing associated comorbidities or underlying etiologies alongside atrial fibrillation ablation.

The protocol for managing recurrent atrial fibrillation remains nebulous. While the authors evaluated not only atrial fibrillation recurrence but also mortality, readmission due to heart failure, and incidences of bleeding, the strategy for addressing recurrent atrial fibrillation and its consequential impact on these outcomes necessitates elucidation.

Accurate diagnosis of concurrent heart failure in patients afflicted with atrial fibrillation poses a challenge due to their overlapping symptoms. Notably, 5% of subjects in the authors' study exhibited heart failure. Clarity regarding the authors' methodology for diagnosing concurrent heart failure is imperative.

Furthermore, the authors' definition of cardiac rehospitalization lacks precision. It seemingly encompasses acute coronary syndrome, which may not inherently correlate with atrial fibrillation. A preferable approach might entail segregating heart failure rehospitalization to better discern the intricate association between atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Long‐Term Ablation Outcome and Predictors of/Atrial Tachycardia Recurrence During Follow‐Up

Over a median follow‐up of 364 [95% CI, 239–407] days, primary efficacy end point occurred in 605 of 748 (80.9%) patients with available outcome information (median time to recurrence: 186 [95% CI, 133–244] days). At multivariate logistic analysis adjusted for baseline confounders (Table 3), age (hazard ratio = 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01–1.05]; P = 0.0043) remained associated with atrial arrhythmias recurrence during follow‐up. The arrhythmia recurrence rate ranged from 14.4% in young patients to 26.9% of older patients (P = 0.011 versus young patients). Older and young‐older patients exhibited a similar arrhythmia recurrence rate (24.6% for young‐older, P = 0.658 versus older patients). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of time to AF recurrence during follow‐up, according to young, young‐older, and older patients. The time to recurrence was longer in younger patients than in young‐older and older patients (overall log‐rank P = 0.0005).

Statistical Analysis

For descriptive purposes, continuous variables are summarized as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range), and categorical variables are summarized as percentages across the 3 age categories. To assess generalizability, patient characteristics between those with and without missing AFEQTs, after excluding deaths, were compared. Continuous variables and their group differences were assessed using Student's t test or the Mann–Whitney U test based on their distributions, and the chi‐square test was used to compare categorical variables. A positive change in AFEQT scores (score at 1 year — score at baseline) indicates a health status improvement and a negative change signifies a decline.

Initially, we compared the unadjusted baseline AFEQT scores and their changes within 1 year across 3 age categories. To further assess the clinical importance of health status improvements, we also compared the proportion of patients achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in AFEQT‐OS within 1 year among the age groups. The thresholds of clinically meaningful improvement were defined based on prior literature, as described. One approach applied a uniform threshold of a 5‐point improvement across the overall population. Alternatively, an age‐specific approach was applied with thresholds set at 7.6 points for patients aged < 75 years and 3.4 points for those aged ≥ 75 years. Furthermore, to explore potential clinical determinants of the clinically meaningful improvement, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses stratified by age groups (< 75 and ≥ 75 years). The dependent variables were whether a patient achieved a clinically meaningful improvement, based on the aforementioned age‐specific cutoffs. The models were adjusted for the following variables, selected based on prior literature: baseline AFEQT‐OS, sex, body mass index (≥ 25 kg/m² or not), estimated glomerular filtration rate (≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² or not), anemia (defined as < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women), previous history of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and vascular disease, AF type (paroxysmal versus nonparoxysmal), treatment strategy (rate versus rhythm control), the use of oral anticoagulation, and participating institutions (high volume hospitals [performing over 250 catheter ablation cases per year] versus others).

### The impact of age on 5-year outcomes after atrial fibrillation catheter ablation [^11485bpe]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is an established therapeutic rhythm approach in symptomatic patients. Many studies have shown that age has little to no impact on outcomes during the first year after ablation. However, AF is a disease of aging and age-based substrate for arrhythmia is likely to progress. To this regard, we examined patients with 5-year outcome data following an index AF ablation procedure to define the impact of age on long-term outcomes.

Methods

A total of 923 patients that underwent their index AF ablation and had 5 years of follow-up were studied. Patients were followed up for atrial flutter/AF recurrence, heart failure, stroke, death, and cardiac function. Patients were separated and compared in 5 age-based groups (< 50, 51–60, 61–70, 71–80, > 80).

Results

The average age of the population was 66 ± 11 years and 59% were male. The AF was paroxysmal in 55%, persistent in 27%, and longstanding persistent in 18%. Older patients were more likely female and had higher rates of cardiovascular diseases. For every 10-year increase in age there was a higher multivariate-adjusted risk of atrial flutter/AF recurrence (HR: 1.13, P = 0.01), death (HR:1.91, P < 0.0001), and major adverse cardiac events (HR: 1.09, P = 0.07). Although atrial flutter/AF recurrence rates by age were similar at 1 year, at 5 years, younger patients had significantly lower rates of recurrences.

Conclusion

Age significantly impacts outcomes after AF ablation when analyzed with long-term follow-up. These data highlight the progressive nature of AF and the need to consider interventions early.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common atrial arrhythmia. With increasing age AF is becoming clinically manifest in a growing number of patients. In parallel, the need and wish for definitive therapy is growing due to improved ablation techniques with higher success and low‐complication rates. Catheter ablation has developed as first line therapy in various arrhythmias. This is reflected in a strengthening of ablation in the recently updated ESC guidelines for the management of supraventricular tachycardias. 1 Interestingly, recommendations are not age‐dependent. In AF, however, many centers have an individual age limit for ablation. 2

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has been developed as the cornerstone of AF ablation. Specific data on AF ablation of patients > 75 years was first published by Nademannee et al. 3 in 2015. A recent multicentre study presented high‐success rates in 104 patients ≥ 75 years who underwent PVI with the cryoballoon. 4 In order to compare a "single‐shot" strategy such as the cryoballoon to a point‐by‐point ablation approach we performed an analysis of patients > 75 years undergoing their first PVI.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF in selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF if rhythm control is desired.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — comparisons with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line or early therapy: In selected patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation is described as a suitable first-line option, and longer-term follow-up showed reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias versus drugs (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38–0.67]) with fewer persistent AF episodes (1.9% vs 7.4%; HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13–0.70]). In CABANA, ablation was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in recurrent AF (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45–0.60]; P < 0.001). Randomized trials comparing ablation to AADs as first-line therapy found at 24 months a lower AF burden with ablation (ablation, 9% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 18%; P = 0.004), and at 1 year fewer recurrent atrial arrhythmias in EARLY-AF (43% vs 68%; P < 0.001) and STOP AF First (25% vs 55%; P < 0.001). Across these trials, procedural complications were observed in 2% to 5% of patients, AF burden remained low in EARLY-AF (percentage of time in AF: ablation, 0.6% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 3.9%), and the average age was ≤ 60 years; ablation is also noted as effective in persistent AF, particularly if of relatively recent onset (< 1 year).

AF catheter ablation — synopsis of effectiveness and patient selection: More recent information has shown that ablation for AF is more effective than antiarrhythmic drugs for both persistent and paroxysmal AF and that earlier implementation of rhythm control strategies is an important factor for improving AF ablation success rates. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have mainly used younger patients (< 70 years of age) who also experience the largest benefits, observational studies have reported improvement in quality of life (QOL) with catheter ablation in older patients. The document also notes that significantly reducing the frequency and duration of AF episodes but not eliminating all future episodes of AF may represent a clinically important improvement.

Left atrial volume assessment — techniques, validity, and prognostic value: Left atrial (LA) volume can be measured by multiple imaging approaches, but reliance on echocardiographic anterior–posterior diameter thresholds is limited; using "LAD cutoffs of 5 or 5.5 cm" correlates poorly with true LA volume. Calculation from three-dimensional dimensions obtained by CT, MR, or 3D echo "underestimates true left atrial volume… by 10–20%", whereas invasive measurements such as angiography and point‑by‑point electroanatomic mapping overestimate LA size and volume. Across studies, "LA volume is one of the strongest predictors of outcome following AF ablation".

2 METHODS

2.1 Study population

The study protocol adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Yonsei University Health System. All patients provided written informed consent for inclusion in the Yonsei AF Ablation Registry Database (registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02138695). From March 2009 to September 2017, 1005 patients who underwent AFCA for AF and whose first ECG diagnosis time point was evident were analyzed (75% male, 59 ± 11 years of age, 39% PAF). AF onset was defined as the index ECG showing AF. AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset was classified as PAF. 15 We analyzed the sensitivity and specificity for predicting clinical recurrences of AF after AFCA on the basis of the different cut‐off ranges of the AF duration (Figure 1 and Table S1). As a result of the analysis, the 3‐year cut‐off value represented the best dichotomy among a number of tested cut‐off values. Therefore, we compared the patients with an AF duration of less than 3 years and those with that longer than 3 years based on a preliminary adjusted hazard ratio (HR) analysis. The clinical characteristics and rhythm outcomes were compared based on the AF duration (≤ 3 years, n = 537; > 3 years, n = 468) and AF burden (PAF, n = 387; PeAF, n = 618). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) valvular AF, (b) structural heart disease other than left ventricular hypertrophy, (c) left atrial (LA) diameter ≥ 60 mm, and (d) a history of a previous AF ablation or cardiac surgery. All antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) were discontinued for a minimum period of five half‐lives before the procedure. Anticoagulation therapy was maintained before the catheter ablation. The anatomy of the LA and the pulmonary veins (PVs) in all patients was imaged using three‐dimensional (3D) spiral computed tomography (CT) scans (64 Channel, LightSpeed Volume CT, Philips, Brilliance 63, Amsterdam, Netherlands).

Outcomes of AF Ablation in Young Patients

As an age-related condition, AF is uncommon in young adults. However, younger patients with AF are often highly symptomatic and might have a desire to avoid long-term medical therapy, making catheter ablation a potentially attractive treatment option.

Limited information is available regarding the outcomes of AF ablation in unusually young patients. At least two single-center studies and one multicenter study have reported on the outcomes of AF ablation in unusually young patients. Two of these three studies defined young ablation patients as those under the age of 45 years; the other reported on outcomes of AF ablation for lone AF, defined as age < 65 with no cardiac, pulmonary, or structural heart disease (mean age 45).

In a 2010 single-center study, 232 patients under age 45 were identified from an overall ablation cohort. The authors reported that younger patients had lower rates of major complications compared with more typically aged AF ablation patients. The rate of the author-defined primary outcome of AF control was similar across age groups, but a higher proportion of young patients (76%) were AF-free in the absence of AADs after 1 or more ablation procedures than older patients (from 53%–68%). A 2016 single-center study reported on ablation outcomes in 76 patients with lone AF (9% of their overall ablation population). Freedom from atrial arrhythmia after one procedure was 74%, whereas freedom from atrial arrhythmia after the last procedure without AADs was 96%. The largest study on AF ablation in younger patients was a multicenter German registry in which 593 patients aged ≤ 45 years were compared with 6650 patients aged > 45 years. In this study, the younger patients had lower rates of complication, shorter hospital stays, and lower rates of AF recurrence and AAD than older patients. Together, these studies suggest that AF ablation might be both safer and more effective in younger patients compared with "average" or older AF patients, although this result could be due in part to a lower burden of cardiac and noncardiac comorbid diseases. It has been suggested that AF ablation might more readily be considered first-line rhythm control therapy in younger rather than older patients; however the evidence base for making such a recommendation is not strong. The recommendations for AF ablation in young patients are shown in Table 2.

Clinical Perspective

Currently, there is uncertainty regarding whether a particular technology for AF catheter ablation should be prioritized in older patients owing to its potentially improved safety profile.

Ikenouchi et al, in a propensity‐matched comparison of older patients ≥ 75 years, reported that cryoballoon ablation was associated with similar efficacy and safety, but with shorter procedural time when compared with radiofrequency ablation. In a recent meta‐analysisconsidering the different strategies used for AF ablation and complications, Prasitlumkum et aldid not find any differences in complication rates in patients > 75 years or < 75 years who underwent cryoballoon ablation. On the other hand, greater risks were noticed in the older group (> 75 years) in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation. Yet, the question of whether cryoablation is safer for older patients remains unsettled, given that most of the studies included in this meta‐analysis did not furnish data specifically intended for subanalyses in this demographic. Although our study is the first one assessing this topic, the question remains unsolved also in the context of PFA. While there are abundant data from single‐center studies or randomized multicenter trials on the increased safety and efficacy adopting PFA rather than pure thermal energy only, there is currently no specific assessment considering various age groups.

Although we did not conduct a comparative assessment among different technologies, our findings have important clinical implications, because they demonstrate that older patients can still benefit from AF ablation with this novel therapy. Some medical centers might refrain from offering ablation therapy to older patients due to a perceived less favorable risk‐to‐benefit ratio associated with catheter ablation in this demographic. In our study, in terms of procedural efficiency, most older patients underwent procedures lasting < 90 minutes, although including cases from the introduction of PFA to until now, meaning that overall ablation times might also have been hampered by first cases performed by inexperienced operators in the PFA system. This aspect is significant when considering frail patients, often burdened with multiple comorbidities, requiring specific attention and precautions for optimal procedure management. In our cohort, older patients, in addition to being burdened by a higher prevalence of comorbidities, exhibited greater renal and respiratory compromise, crucial factors in procedural management. Despite these challenges, no additional complications arose, and outcomes were satisfactory, aligning with existing literature for this patient demographic.

Atrial fibrillation — catheter ablation outcomes versus antiarrhythmic drugs report that the average age of patients undergoing catheter ablation was 55.7 years (95% CI, 54.1 to 57.4) with paroxysmal, symptomatic AF for 5.7 years (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.6); repeat catheter ablation procedures were performed in 12.6% of the ablation group, and during the 9-month follow-up period, 34% of ablation patients had recurrence of symptomatic AF compared with 84% of the drug-treated group; available data demonstrate 1 year or more of freedom from recurrent AF in most carefully selected patients, but asymptomatic recurrence can occur and long-term efficacy and late success in heart failure and other advanced structural heart disease remain uncertain.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in elderly patients — age-stratified data show comparable efficacy and safety with nuances in reintervention: Groups included < 65 years, 65–74 years, and ≥ 75 years; although 1165 patients were studied, the ≥ 75 cohort had 32 patients, and over a mean follow-up of 27 months AF control (no AF on or off antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) or "rare" AF) was comparable between older and younger patients. In patients ≥ 75 years, 174 patients (55% PAF) had 127 (73%) maintain sinus rhythm after a single procedure with an acceptable major complication rate of 1.6%. In 103 octogenarians, non-PV triggers were more prevalent (84% vs 69%, P = 0.001), and at a mean follow-up of 18 ± 6 months, 71 (69%) were free from AF off AADs after a single procedure versus 71% in patients < 80 years (P = NS), with complication rates not differing. In Medicare claims data for 15,423 ablation patients between 2007 and 2009, only 11% underwent a second ablation by 1 year after the index procedure.

Recommendations and General Considerations

Shown in Table 2, and summarized in Figures 7 and 8 of this document, are the Consensus Indications for Catheter and Surgical Ablation of AF. As outlined in the introduction section of this document, these indications are stratified as Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III indications. The evidence supporting these indications is provided, as well as a selection of the key references supporting these levels of evidence. In making these recommendations, the writing group considered the body of published literature that has defined the safety and efficacy of catheter and surgical ablation of AF. Also considered in these recommendations is the personal lifetime experience in the field of each of the writing group members. Both the number of clinical trials and the quality of these trials were considered. In considering the class of indications recommended by this writing group, it is important to keep several points in mind. First, these classes of indications only define the indications for catheter and surgical ablation of AF when performed by an electrophysiologist or a surgeon who has received appropriate training and/or who has a certain level of experience and is performing the procedure in an experienced center (Section 11). Catheter and surgical ablation of AF are highly complex procedures, and a careful assessment of the benefit and risk must be considered for each patient. Second, these indications stratify patients based only on the type of AF and whether the procedure is being performed prior to or following a trial of one or more Class I or III antiarrhythmic medications. This document for the first time includes indications for catheter ablation of select asymptomatic patients. As detailed in Section 9, there are many other additional clinical and imaging-based variables that can be used to further define the efficacy and risk of ablation in a given patient. Some of the variables that can be used to define patients in whom a lower success rate or a higher complication rate can be expected include the presence of concomitant heart disease, obesity, sleep apnea, LA size, patient age and frailty, as well as the duration of time the patient has been in continuous AF. Each of these variables needs to be considered when discussing the risks and benefits of AF ablation with a particular patient. In the presence of substantial risk or anticipated difficulty of ablation, it could be more appropriate to use additional AAD options, even if the patient on face value might present with a Class I or IIa indication for ablation. Third, it is important to consider patient preference and values. Some patients are reluctant to consider a major procedure or surgery and have a strong preference for a pharmacological approach. In these patients, trials of antiarrhythmic agents including amiodarone might be preferred to catheter ablation. On the other hand, some patients prefer a nonpharmacological approach. Fourth, it is important to recognize that some patients early in the course of their AF journey might have only infrequent episodes for many years and/or could have AF that is responsive to well-tolerated AAD therapy. And Finally, it is important to bear in mind that a decision to perform catheter or surgical AF ablation should only be made after a patient carefully considers the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — cerebrovascular events and anticoagulation discontinuation outcomes — are reported across observational cohorts. Another single-center report described outcomes in 635 patients with one or more risk factors for stroke during a mean follow-up of 836 ± 605 days after an AF procedure; when anticoagulation was discontinued in 434 of 710 patients who remained in sinus rhythm, there were three ischemic strokes and two TIAs with an estimated five-year stroke rate of 3%. An observational study from five large AF ablation centers included 3,344 patients; there were 347 that had a CHADS2 score of greater than two and among these 347 patients no thromboembolic events occurred. Age-stratified data showed a periprocedure CVA occurred in 0.8% and 1% of patients ≥ 65 and < 65 years of age, respectively, while late CVA occurred in 3% of patients ≥ 65 years of age and 1% of patients < 65 years of age; in those > 65 years, anticoagulation was stopped in 56% of those with a CHADS2 score ≥ 1, and 180 patients had a CHADS2 score of two or greater. Among patients > 75 years, age > 75 years was the only independent risk factor for CVA (OR, 4.9). A separate series of 565 patients found the only independent predictors of thromboembolic events were recurrence of AF despite multiple ablations and the CHA2DS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score.

### Age, frailty, and outcomes after atrial fibrillation ablation: a nationwide cohort study [^113jYj3u]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter ablation is a major treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), but its outcomes in relation to age and frailty are not well understood, especially in an aging population.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of the 2016–2021 National Inpatient Sample database identified patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF. Patients were categorized by age and frailty status (low, intermediate, high). Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to examine outcomes.

Results

Among 292,395 patients, 79.2% were aged 35–65 years, 15.7% were aged 66–79 years, and 5.1% were aged ≥ 80 years at the time of ablation. The proportion of patients aged ≥ 80 years increased from 11% in 2016% to 21.1% in 2021. Females comprised a higher proportion of the oldest age group (51.4%), but no sex differences were observed across frailty levels. In-hospital mortality was highest in the high frailty group. Patients over 80 years had higher odds of cardiac rhythm restoration and pacemaker implantation but lower risks of cardiogenic shock, mechanical circulatory support, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Higher frailty was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, complications, and MACCE.

Conclusions

Catheter ablation is increasingly performed in older patients. Advanced age and higher frailty are independently associated with adverse outcomes. These factors should be considered when evaluating patients for this procedure, and strategies to mitigate these risks should be explored.

5 CONCLUSION

Catheter ablation of AF in patients ≥ 75 years of age is associated with a good safety profile and a favorable clinical outcome in patients with paroxysmal as well as persistent AF. The data is in favor of the single‐shot devices such as the cryoballoon for PVI in this patient cohort. Randomized trials have to be performed to further evaluate this possible advantage. Only few patients are in need for an AVN ablation during follow‐up.

Infants and small children — scope and substrate distribution: Transcatheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in infants (1 year of age and younger) and small children (15 kg and less) is controversial; studies have not consistently limited analyses to these definitions and this section focuses on subsets such as infants or those specifically weighing less than 15 kg. In children younger than 1 year of age, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and focal atrial tachycardia (FAT) account for 80%, 5%, and 15% of SVT, respectively.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pre-excitation syndrome, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines recommend to consider performing ablation in young patients with shortest pre-excited R-R interval > 250 ms in AF at the time of diagnostic study if the location of the pathway and/or patient characteristics do not suggest that ablation may incur an increased risk of adverse events, such as AV block or coronary artery injury.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^114YEL6r]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Although there are several classification systems for AF, for this consensus document, we have adopted in large part the classification system that was presented in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation. We recommend that this classification system be used for future studies of catheter and surgical ablation of AF. Paroxysmal AF (PAF) is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset (Table 1); persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond 7 days; and long-standing persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of greater than 12 months' duration. Early persistent AF is a new term we have defined as continuous AF of more than 7 days' duration but less than 3 months' duration. Within the context of AF ablation and clinical trials of AF ablation, early persistent AF defines a population of patients in whom better outcomes of AF ablation are anticipated as compared with persistent AF of more than 3 months' duration. The term permanent AF is defined as AF in which the presence of the AF is accepted by the patient and physician, and no further attempts will be made to either restore or maintain sinus rhythm. It is important, therefore, to recognize that the term permanent AF represents a therapeutic attitude on the part of a patient and their physician rather than on any inherent pathophysiological attribute of the AF. Such decisions can change as symptoms, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, and patient and physician preferences evolve. If a rhythm control strategy is recommended after reevaluation, the AF should be redesignated as paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent AF. Within the context of any rhythm control strategy, including catheter and surgical AF ablation, the term permanent AF is not meaningful and should not be used. Silent AF is defined as asymptomatic AF diagnosed by an opportune ECG or rhythm strip. Paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent AF can be silent. We recognize that a particular patient might have AF episodes that fall into one or more of these categories; therefore, we recommended that patients be categorized by their most frequent pattern of AF during the 6 months prior to performance of an ablation procedure. Lone AF is a descriptor that has been applied to younger patients without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. Because the definitions are variable, the term lone AF is potentially confusing, and should not be used to describe populations of patients with AF nor to guide therapeutic decisions. The term chronic AF also has variable definitions and should not be used to describe populations of patients with AF.

Procedural Characteristics and Acute Effectiveness

De novo PVI was performed in 945 patients (87.3%). Seven hundred forty‐four procedures (68.8%) were performed with patients under general anesthesia, whereas deep sedation was applied in 338 (31.2%) patients. A 3D mapping system was used in 227 (21.0%) patients and intracardiac echocardiography in 288 (26.6%). At the end of the procedure, PVI was achieved in all (100%) patients (median number of PFA applications to achieve PVI = 32 [32–40]). Additional lesions outside PVs were delivered in 268 (24.8%) cases (263 [24.3%] cases with PVI plus additional lesions and 5 [0.5%] cases with additional lesions only) with a median of 16 [95% CI, 12–20] PFA deliveries. Complete PVI was achieved in all patients, as was left atrial posterior wall isolation in patients who underwent left atrial posterior wall as additional lesion set, all validated through differential pacing and/or 3D mapping. Periprocedural details have been reported in Table 2. The overall median skin‐to‐skin time and catheter laboratory utilization (patient entering–leaving the Electrophysiology laboratory (EP) laboratory) were 63 [54–82] minutes and 75 [60–105] minutes, respectively; fluoroscopy time was 15 [12–21] minutes. No differences in terms of procedural metrics were found among groups (ie, skin‐to‐skin time, fluoroscopy time or time to PVI) except for a higher number of PFA deliveries outside of PVs in the young‐older group (P = 0.009 versus young and P = 0.017 versus older) (Table 2 and Figure S1A and S1B). Catheter laboratory utilization was < 120 minutes and 90 minutes in 82.5% (ranging from 84.8% in young patients to 78.7% in older patients, P = 0.118) and 69% (ranging from 71.3% in young patients to 66.0% in young‐older patients, P = 0.087) of the cases, respectively (Figure 1A). Skin‐to‐skin time was < 90 minutes and 60 minutes in 83.4% (ranging from 85.3% in young patients to 80.6% in older patients, P = 0.246) and 49.5% (ranging from 52% in young patients to 42.6% in older patients, P = 0.076) of the cases, respectively (Figure 1B).

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Cost effectiveness of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is described with reported reductions in annual health care costs from a mean of $1,920 ± 889 pre-ablation to $87 ± 68 post-ablation, with procedural costs approximately $17,000 and total charges typically greater than $50,000; another study reported an initial ablation cost of approximately 4,700 Euros with approximately 450 Euros/year thereafter versus pharmacological management approximately 1,600 Euros. In 55-year-old patients at moderate risk of stroke, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $28,700 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas in patients with no risk factors for stroke the ICER was $98,900 per QALY. In 65-year-old patients at moderate risk of stroke and with an 80% one-year success rate, the relative risk of stroke after ablation would need to decrease by ≥ 42% for the ICER to be < $50,000; $50,000 is generally considered the threshold for cost-effectiveness. Limited data suggest AF ablation may be cost-effective in patients with one or more risk factors for stroke but not in those with no risk factors.

### Efficacy and risk of atrial fibrillation ablation before 45 years of age [^117R6x7y]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Young patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) tend to be more symptomatic and less willing to take long-term medications, yet catheter ablation remains recommended as second-line therapy for AF regardless of age. This study seeks to characterize the effectiveness and risk of AF ablation in the young.

Methods and Results

Consecutive (n = 1548) patients who underwent 2038 AF ablation procedures were included. Major procedural complications and efficacy were analyzed on the basis of age at the initial procedure: < 45 years (group 1), 45 to 54 years (group 2), 55 to 64 years (group 3), and ≥ 65 years (group 4). AF control was defined as no or rare AF on or off antiarrhythmic drugs. The primary outcome of AF control was similar in all groups; it was achieved in 87% in group 1, 88% in group 2, 88% in group 3, and 82% in group 4 (P = 0.06). However, more group 1 patients demonstrated freedom from AF off antiarrhythmic drugs (76%) compared with group 2 at 68%, group 3 at 65%, and group 4 at 53% (P < 0.001). There were no major complications in group 1, 10 (1.7%) in group 2, 14 (1.4%) in group 3, and 10 (2.6%) in group 4 (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

In patients younger than 45 years, there is a lower major complication rate and a comparable efficacy rate, with a greater chance of being AF free without antiarrhythmic drugs. These findings suggest that it may be appropriate to consider ablative therapy as first-line therapy in this age group.

Genetic contribution to atrial fibrillation (AF) is established, with heritability and elevated risk in relatives, but limited incremental predictive value beyond clinical factors: it is now well recognized that AF is heritable; individuals having a first-degree relative with AF have approximately a 40% increased risk for development of AF after accounting for established clinical AF risk factors; however, similar to other common diseases, the genetic risk for AF provides minimal additional predictive value after considering basic clinical risk factors such as age and sex.

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy — secondary prevention in older adults is characterized by limited benefit signals in those older than 75 years but should not be withheld solely due to age. Among 252 patients older than 75 years, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.06 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.64; p = 0.79) and for arrhythmic death 0.90 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.95; p = 0.79), and the interaction p value was 0.09, which suggests that the elderly derive less benefit than younger patients. Nonetheless, mean survival of more than 4 years may be expected even among octogenarians, and age alone should not be used as a sole criterion to withhold device-based therapy; decision-making should include the indication for device implantation, the number of comorbidities, and patient preferences.

### Does age impact safety and efficacy during pulse-field ablation for atrial fibrillation? [^112aCRXg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our multicenter experience with PFA for AF revealed a markedly favorable safety profile, evidenced by a low overall complication rate (3.0%). Notably, only 0.3% of patients encountered major adverse events, including 2 cases of pericardial tamponade and 1 transient ischemic attack. Importantly, no complications could definitively be attributed to the electroporation energy source. Moreover, minor complications (2.8%) following the procedure primarily stemmed from vascular access or catheterization, aligning with existing literature.

In addition to that, the rates of vascular complications are increased in the presence of concomitant disorders often associated with older age, and they are not attributable to the use of a specific ablation technology such as PFA.

In the context of AF ablation, older patients had a higher susceptibility to postprocedural complications compared with younger patients, as anticipated. Consistent with extensive observational studies conducted on population cohorts, advancing age correlates proportionally with adverse end points. As individuals age, physiological and anatomical changes increase their susceptibility to complications arising from catheter ablation procedures. Remarkably, we did not observe variations in safety profiles among distinct age groups, with overall complication rates ranging from 2.7% to 5.6% albeit with a trend towards older patients. It is important to note that the majority of complications are vascular in nature (0.9%), and these tend to be more common in older patients (in our study they ranged from 0.5% in patients < 65 years to 3.7% in patients ≥ 75 years), regardless of the energy source used, but are associated with the use of large‐sized sheaths. Notably, cardiac‐related complications were comparable across all 3 groups. One of the most likely explanations is that the utilization of additional trigger ablation techniques beyond PVI, more frequently used in older patients, potentially contributes to increased adverse outcomes of thermal ablation. In line with this observation, our older cohort underwent an ablation strategy entailing a broader lesion set compared with younger patients; nevertheless, no disparities were noted based on age demographics, and this might be explainable by the well‐known myocardial selectivity of PFA.

### Are the atrial natriuretic peptides a missing link predicting low-voltage areas in atrial fibrillation? Introducing the novel biomarker-based atrial fibrillation substrate prediction (ANP) score [^113iXwGW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), left atrial (LA) enlargement, and the presence of low-voltage areas (LVAs) indicate an advanced disease stage. NT-proANP is a biomarker, which is significantly higher in both phenotypes. Prediction of LVAs before catheter ablation could impact the prognosis and therapeutical management in AF patients.

Objective

The aim of this study was to (a) analyze the predictive value of a novel biomarker-based AF substrate prediction score, and (b) compare it with DR-FLASH and APPLE scores.

Methods

Patients undergoing first AF catheter ablation were included. LA volume (LAV) was analyzed prior to ablation using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Blood plasma samples from the femoral vein were collected before AF ablation. NT-proANP was analyzed using commercially available assays. LVAs were determined using high-density maps during catheter ablation and defined as < 0.5 mV. The novel ANP score (one point for Age ≥ 65years, NT-proANP > 17ng/mL, and Persistent AF) was calculated at baseline.

Results

The study population included 156 AF patients (64 ± 10years, 65% males, 61% persistent AF, 28% LVAs). The cut-off ANP score ≥ 2 demonstrated 77% sensitivity and 70% specificity. On logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] 3.469) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (area under the curve [AUC] 0.778, P < .001), the ANP score significantly predicted LVAs presence. There were no differences between novel ANP score - which is a new one - is described in the Abstract; with APPLE (AUC 0.718, P = 0.378) and DR-FLASH (AUC 0.766, P = 0.856) scores.

Conclusions

The novel biomarker-based ANP score demonstrates good prediction of LVAs.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — mortality profile and volume effects are described, with cardiac tamponade accounting for 25% of deaths (3% later than 30 days), stroke responsible in 16% (6% later than 30 days), AEF in 16%, and extensive pneumonia in 6%; less common periprocedural causes were each 3% of early deaths, and 22% of all deaths occurred more than 30 days after the procedure with listed late causes each contributing 3% of late deaths. In the community setting, the mortality risk of AF ablation can be much higher, due primarily to inexperienced operators and low-volume hospitals that performed fewer than 50 procedures annually, and when a 30-day all-cause mortality definition is used, mortality rises to 1 in 125 patients within the Medicare population (mean age of 72).

### Sex differences in cardiac arrhythmia: a consensus document of the European Heart Rhythm Association, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^115Wmukd]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — outcomes and complications by sex reports that there are three recurrent findings when analysing AF ablation procedures in women compared with men: women are significantly older when presenting for AF ablation, women have a worse outcome regarding freedom from AF post-ablation, and some complications occur more frequently in women than in men; while some smaller (long-term) observational studies found no difference in outcome between women and men, the majority of studies indicate female sex as a predictor for less favourable outcome in paroxysmal and persistent AF, and female sex was also a major predictor of AF ablation procedural failure in most risk scores.

Each recommendation in this document was assigned a Class of Recommendation (COR) and a Level of Evidence (LOE) according to the system developed by ACC and AHA (Table 1). The COR denotes the strength of the recommendation based on a careful assessment of the estimated benefits and risks; COR I indicates that the benefit of an intervention far exceeds its risk; COR IIa indicates that the benefit of the intervention moderately exceeds the risk; COR IIb indicates that the benefit may not exceed the risk; and COR III indicates that the benefit is equivalent to or is exceeded by the risk. The LOE reflects the quality of the evidence that supports the recommendation. LOE A is derived from high-quality randomized controlled trials; LOE B-R is derived from moderate-quality randomized controlled trials; LOE B-NR is derived from well-designed nonrandomized studies; LOE C-LD is derived from randomized or nonrandomized studies with limitations of design or execution; and LOE C-EO indicates that a recommendation was based on expert opinion.

Unique to this consensus statement is the systematic review commissioned specifically for this document as part of HRS's efforts to adopt the rigorous methodology required for guideline development. The systematic review was performed by an experienced evidence-based practice committee based at the University of Connecticut, which examined the question of VT ablation vs control in patients with VT and ischemic heart disease (IHD). The question, in PICOT format, was as follows: In adults with history of sustained VT and IHD, what is the effectiveness and what are the detriments of catheter ablation compared with other interventions? Components of the PICOT were as follows: P = adults with history of sustained VT and IHD; I = catheter ablation; C = control (no therapy or antiarrhythmic drug [AAD]); O = outcomes of interest, which included 1) appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapies (ICD shock or antitachycardia pacing [ATP]), 2) appropriate ICD shocks, 3) VT storm (defined as three shocks within 24 hours), 4) recurrent VT/VF, 5) cardiac hospitalizations, and 6) all-cause mortality; and T = no time restrictions.

### Safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in the very elderly (≥ 80 years old): insights from the UC San Diego AF ablation registry [^114PhL6H]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) has become increasingly prevalent and its incidence increases with aging, with over half of AF patients projected to be over the age of 80 by 2050. Catheter ablation has emerged as a viable alternative to long‐term pharmacologic antiarrhythmic therapy for rhythm control of AF and will likely be used more commonly given its inclusion in guidelines and increasing evidence in favor of an early rhythm control strategy. However, the management of AF in the elderly is complicated by concurrent comorbidities, age‐related physiological changes, and frailty. While there are multiple studies evaluating catheter ablation in the elderly, the majority of patients included were less than 70 years of age. The safety and efficacy of catheter ablation in the very elderly (≥ 80 years old) population is thus not as well described.

### Outcome of catheter ablation in the very elderly-insights from a large matched analysis [^111QqAAP]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

As life expectancy is steadily increasing and quality of life remains high also in the very elderly, the health system is in a constant transition and challenges have changed over time. With increasing age arrhythmias are becoming clinically manifest in a growing number of patients, too. The need and wish for definitive therapy is also growing due to improved ablation techniques and consequently higher success rates. Catheter ablation has evolved as first line therapy for various arrhythmias. This is reflected in the recently updated ESC guidelines for the management of supraventricular tachycardias (SVT). 1 Of note, recommendations for ablation procedures are not limited to a special group of patients. While guidelines have devoted paragraphs to the specialized treatment of patients with congenital heart disease or during pregnancy, no specific recommendations are made for older patients. 1

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are very prevalent in the elderly. For typical AFL in particular, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation (CTI) has evolved as the gold standard since the 1990s in most patients as recurrence rate is high and treatment by CTI characterized by very high success rates. 2, 3 Surprisingly, recent evidence found markedly higher complication rates related to CTI than previously reported. 4 Advanced age was found to be a major risk factor so that the authors postulated that patient selection for CTI should be made particularly careful in the elderly in whom outcome studies on CTI are scarce. In contrast to AFL, atrioventricular nodal re‐entry tachycardia (AVNRT) manifests/presents most often in young and middle‐aged adults. Interestingly, more recent studies showed, that effectiveness of slow‐pathway modulation was greater in younger patients compared to patients > 50 years. 5 In addition, age seems to be a relevant factor in socioeconomic aspects of AVNRT ablation. Farkowski et al 6 showed that treatment costs were higher with increased patient age.

Outcomes of AF Ablation in Elderly Patients

Several studies have been published describing the outcomes of AF ablation in elderly patients. One study compared the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation in three groups of patients: < 65 years, 65–74 years, and ≥ 75 years. Although the total study population included 1165 patients, the group ≥ 75 years only included 32 patients. Over a mean follow-up of 27 months, AF control defined as no AF on or off AADs or "rare" AF was comparable in the older and younger patients. The older patients were less likely to undergo repeat ablation and were more likely to remain on AADs. Complication rates were similar. In another study of 174 patients > 75 years, 55% of whom had PAF, 127 (73%) maintained sinus rhythm after a single procedure, with an acute major complication rate of 1%. Another study evaluated catheter ablation for AF in 103 octogenarians with paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent AF compared with patients < 80 years. The proportion of patients with the different types of AF was similar in both groups. A higher rate of non-PV triggers (84% vs 69%, P = 0.001) was found in the octogenarians. After a mean follow-up of 18 ± 6 months, 71 (69%) of the octogenarians remained free from AF off AADs after a single procedure vs 71% in patients < 80 years (P = NS). Complication rates did not differ between the two groups. Other studies of octogenarians have found similar results.

### Should concomitant surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation be performed in elderly patients? [^111tKCBo]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The incidence of atrial fibrillation increases with age, and therefore many elderly patients presenting for cardiac surgery have atrial fibrillation. In recent publications, increasing age has been recognized as a predictor for ablation failure. Furthermore, many surgeons are reluctant to perform a surgical ablation in elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of concomitant surgical atrial fibrillation ablation in elderly patients.

Methods

Between 2003 and 2013, 556 patients underwent concomitant surgical atrial fibrillation ablation at the University Heart Center Hamburg and served as our primary study cohort. During follow-up, rhythm monitoring was established by 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram (70.5%) or an implantable loop recorder (29.5%) at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The primary end point of the study was freedom from atrial fibrillation at 12 months follow-up and the detection of deviations from a linear association between age and risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence. A multiple logistic regression model including age as a linear term was used to identify predictors for rhythm outcome.

Results

Mean patients' age was 68.4 ± 9.07 years, and 67.3% of the patients were male. Mean duration of atrial fibrillation was 3.5 ± 3.3 years, and mean left atrium diameters were enlarged with 50.5 ± 8.8 mm. There were no major ablation-related complications. The 30-day and 1-year survivals were 97.7% and 95.8%, respectively. The overall rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation ranged from 62% to 72% and was independent of age. The age-dependent risk of atrial fibrillation at 12 months was significantly increased in elderly patients undergoing a concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Multiple logistic regression model revealed double valve procedures (odds ratio, 3.48; p = 0.020), preoperative persistent atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 2.43; p = 0.001), and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in elderly patients (odds ratio, 2.03; p = 0.009) as risk factors for recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm at discharge (odds ratio, 0.39; P < .001) and bipolar ablation (odds ratio, 0.32; P < .001) were significant predictors for successful ablation.

Conclusions

Surgical atrial fibrillation ablation was safe and effective independently of age. Sinus rhythm at discharge and bipolar ablation were significant predictors for successful ablation, whereas double valve procedures, preoperative persistent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in elderly patients were risk factors for recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1114SEQh]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Catheter ablation candidacy in HF with AF notes patients likely to benefit — AF-mediated CMP suspected, earlier stage of HF, no significant ventricular scar on CMR, no or minimal atrial fibrosis, paroxysmal and early persistent AF, and younger patients without significant other comorbidities — and those less likely to benefit — advanced HF, significant ventricular scar on CMR, severe atrial myopathy (dilation/fibrosis), long-standing persistent AF, prior failed ablations, and advanced age or multiple comorbidities. For HFrEF, AF catheter ablation (1) is specified, whereas for HFpEF, AF catheter ablation (2a) is specified. After ablation, no clinical AF leads to long-term surveillance for recurrent AF in AF-induced CMP and recovered LVEF (2a), while recurrent AF leads to a decision for pharmacological rhythm- vs. rate-control strategy including pharmacological cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion, and repeat ablation.

AF catheter ablation — indications and first-line use in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL): In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF (Class 1, Level A). In patients with symptomatic or clinically significant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future atrial arrhythmias (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who are being managed with a rhythm-control strategy, catheter ablation as first-line therapy can be useful to improve symptoms (Class 2a, Level B-R).

### Underrepresentation of women in trials of atrial fibrillation ablations: fact or thinking? [^112Lk6Pt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The situation may even be more complex as there could also be a bias against older patients when investigating an invasive ablation procedure in contrast to a conservative, drug‐based approach. For instance, an age > 75 years is considered a relative contraindication of RFA in the Danish national guideline and older (as well as frail) patients were systematically excluded from previous clinical trials. This may have contributed to the observed results as older people have much higher incidence and prevalence of AF, and in fact, most AF cases occur in age groups > 65 years. Because women are more represented in patients with AF above the age of 80 years, any potential bias against older patients may also disbalance female representation. Taken together, this underlines the importance to carefully consider adequate representation of female patients (and, of course, those with other relevant characteristics such as, for instance, age, race, ethnicity, and comorbidity burden) when planning clinical trials and to monitor adequate representation throughout a trial. This should include refined metrics such as the PPR. Moreover, representation aspects should be carefully reported in publications even if perfect representation could not be achieved in a particular trial.

Randomized clinical trials have undoubtedly been of enormous importance in the advancement of medicine. However, the time of randomized clinical trials may be nearing its end with the advent of personalized medicine approaches. In the era of personalized medicine, not every patient can be perfectly mirrored in a randomized clinical trial because personalized medicine aims to characterize patients on a far deeper level. Individual patient characteristics should be considered rather than classical group‐based characteristics. The field of AF is no exemption as individual biomechanical aspects in AF, captured by advanced imaging and personalized computational models are discussed. The ultimate aim of personalized medicine is to provide patient‐specific care, taking into thorough consideration different causes, pathomechanisms, and patient characteristics in what is considered a certain condition. We may see more analyses of inequality in medical research, and it is of utmost importance to counteract those, but it is equally important to solve the problem of how we should fit individual patients and their characteristics into the grid of evidence being available.

### Ablation of frequent PVC in patients meeting criteria for primary prevention ICD implant: safety of withholding the implant [^111mc9Qs]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Premature ventricular complex (PVC) ablation has been shown to improve left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and New York Heart Association functional class in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Both are considered key variables in predicting risk of sudden cardiac death.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess whether ablation might remove the primary prevention (PP) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) indication in patients with frequent PVC.

Methods

Sixty-six consecutive patients with PP-ICD indication and frequent PVC [33 (50%) men; mean age 53 ± 13 years; 11 (17%) with ischemic heart disease] underwent PVC ablation. The ICD was withheld and the indication was reevaluated at 6 and 12 months.

Results

LVEF progressively improved from 28% ± 4% at baseline to 42% ± 12% at 12 months (P < .001). New York Heart Association functional class improved from 2 patients with NYHA functional class I (3%) at baseline to 35 (53%) at 12 months (P < .001). The brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 246 ± 187 to 176 ± 380 pg/mL (P = 0.004). The PP-ICD indication was removed in 42 patients (64%) during follow-up, from 38 (92%) of them at 6 months, showing an independent association with baseline PVC burden and successful sustained ablation. In patients with successful sustained ablation, a cutoff value of 13% PVC burden had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93% (area under the curve 99%) for removing ICD indication postablation. No sudden cardiac deaths or malignant ventricular arrhythmias were observed.

Conclusion

In patients with frequent PVC and PP-ICD indication, ablation improves LVEF and, in most cases, allows removal of the indication. Withholding the ICD and reevaluating within 6 months of ablation seems to be a safe and appropriate strategy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Older patients with comorbidities — primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) candidacy: The guideline states, "For older patients and those with significant comorbidities, who meet indications for a primary prevention ICD, an ICD is reasonable if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected". Supportive text specifies that "Older age is defined as ≥ 75 years", and that "neither age nor comorbidities alone should be exclusions for an ICD", while noting evidence limitations because "most data are from nonrandomized studies and "both selection and unidentified confounding biases can never be fully adjusted for". It further observes that "older adults are prone to higher complication rates, shorter life expectancies (and thus, fewer years during which they could derive benefit from an ICD), and varying preferences", concluding that "it is important to take a particularly nuanced and patient-centered approach to treating these patients".

### Ablation surgery in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: an 8-year clinical experience [^114kFZLV]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This analysis was undertaken to evaluate the results of persistent atrial fibrillation ablation procedures concomitant to open surgery and to identify risk factors for persistent atrial fibrillation recurrence.

Methods

Since 2001, a total of 325 consecutive patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (duration, 0.5–33 years) have undergone persistent atrial fibrillation ablation concomitant to open surgery by creating 2 encircling isolation lesions around the left and right pulmonary veins and a connecting lesion between both with the use of radiofrequency ablation procedures. Patients were restudied at discharge, 3 months, and 3 years after surgery.

Results

Survivals at the time of reexamination at discharge, 3 months, and 3 years were 97.8%, 96.2%, and 94.4%, respectively. Stable sinus rhythm could be documented in 72.1%, 73.9%, and 75.6% of surviving patients, respectively. Long-term persistent atrial fibrillation before surgery and a larger left atrium were predictive of postoperative persistent atrial fibrillation return (P < .001). Statistical analysis demonstrated cutoff points of 5 years for persistent atrial fibrillation and 55 mm for left atrium diameter; 89.7% of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation duration of less than 5 years and 84.5% of patients with left atrium size of 55 mm or less were in stable sinus rhythm at late follow-up. Cardiac rhythm at discharge and at 3 months was predictive of long-term rhythm prognosis (P < .001). Age, gender, concomitant diseases (eg, arterial hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, or pulmonary disease), and the underlying cause of heart disease did not significantly influence the postoperative cardiac rhythm.

Conclusions

The duration of persistent atrial fibrillation and the size of the left atrium are the most reliable preoperative variables to predict the success rate of ablation concomitant to open surgery. The probability of reestablishing stable sinus rhythm is excellent when persistent atrial fibrillation duration is short and left atrium size is small.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Synopsis and epidemiology of AFL and post-ablation AF risk: AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall incidence of 88 per 100 000 person-years, and the incidence increases with age; it is 2.5 times more common in men than in women and is more likely with underlying heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because of the high effectiveness of CTI ablation, many physicians may elect to discontinue oral anticoagulation > 1 month after ablation in the absence of previously detected AF, but subsequent AF after CTI-dependent AFL ablation has been reported as 34% over 14 months. Non–CTI-dependent or "atypical" AFL or atrial tachycardia after AF ablation should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF, and this section refers to treatment of "typical" (CTI-dependent) AFL.

Tetralogy of Fallot after repair — ventricular tachycardia (VT) prevalence is quantified across cohorts and age: in a multicenter study of 793 patients repaired at a mean age of eight years, sustained monomorphic VT occurred in 4.5% during a mean postoperative follow-up of 21 years and sudden cardiac death occurred in another 2%; in a more recent multicenter study of 556 adults (mean age 37 years) with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular arrhythmias had occurred in 14.6% of patients. The prevalence was less than 10% before 25 years and reaches greater than 30% by 35 years of age, and in another report was less than 10% before the age of 25 years with marked increase after the age of 45 years; with current early transatrial–transpulmonary repair that avoids right ventriculotomy, it is hoped that the prevalence of VT will decrease.

The 2003 ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines designated "no treatment" as a Class I recommendation and catheter ablation as a Class IIa recommendation in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation; the guideline writing committee stated that the positive predictive value of the EP study is too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients and that potential benefit must be balanced against the approximately 2% risk of a major complication associated with catheter ablation.

### The impact of age on ablation outcomes in AF-mediated cardiomyopathy [^115AuYN5]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The absence of ventricular scar in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and systolic heart failure (HF) predicts left ventricular (LV) recovery following AF ablation. It is unknown whether age impacts the degree of LV recovery, reverse remodeling, or AF recurrence following catheter ablation (CA) among this population.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of age on LV recovery and AF recurrence in a population with AF and systolic HF without fibrosis (termed AF-mediated cardiomyopathy) following CA.

Methods

Consecutive patients undergoing CA between 2013 and 2021 with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < 45% and absence of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) detected LV myocardial fibrosis were stratified by age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65years). Following CA, participants underwent remote rhythm monitoring for 12 months with repeat CMR for HF surveillance.

Results

The study population consisted of 70 patients (10% female, mean LVEF 33 ± 9%), stratified into younger (age < 65 years, 63%) and older (age ≥ 65 years, 37%) cohorts. Baseline comorbidities, LVEF (34 ± 9 vs. 33 ± 8 ≥ 65years, p = .686), atrial and ventricular dimensions (left atrial volume index: 55 ± 21 vs. 56 ± 14mL/m² age ≥ 65, p = .834; indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume: 108 ± 40 vs. 104 ± 28mL/m² age ≥ 65, p = .681), pharmacotherapy and ablation strategy (pulmonary vein isolation in all; posterior wall isolation in 27% vs. 19% age ≥ 65, p = .448; cavotricuspid isthmus in 9% vs. 11.5% age ≥ 65) were comparable (all p > .05) albeit a higher CHADS 2 VASc score in the older cohort (2.7 ± 0.9 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6 age < 65, p < .001). Freedom from AF was comparable (hazard ratio: 0.65, 95% confidence interval: 0.38–1.48, LogRank p = .283) as was AF burden [0% (interquartile range, IQR: 0.0–2.1) vs. age ≥ 65: [0% (IQR 0.0–1.7), p = .516], irrespective of age. There was a significant improvement in LV systolic function in both groups (ΔLVEF+21 ± 14% vs. +21 ± 12% age ≥ 65, p = .913), with LV recovery in the vast majority (73% vs. 69%, respectively, p = .759) at 13 (IQR: 12–16) months. This was accompanied by comparable improvements in functional status (New York Heart Association class p = .851; 6-min walk distance 50 ± 61 vs. 93 ± 134m in age ≥ 65, p = .066), biomarkers (ΔN-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide -139 ± 246 vs. -168 ± 181 age ≥ 65, p = .629) and HF symptoms (Short Form-36 survey Δphysical component summary p = .483/Δmental component summary, p = .841).

Conclusion

In patients undergoing CA for AF with systolic HF in the absence of ventricular scar, comparable improvements in ventricular function, symptoms, and freedom from AF are achieved irrespective of age.

### Safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in the very elderly (≥ 80 years old): insights from the UC San Diego AF ablation registry [^113TpWye]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this retrospective cohort study, catheter ablation of AF appears to be similarly effective and safe in patients 80 years of age or older when compared to a younger cohort. The very elderly (≥ 80 years old) was selected as the study group as they were previously underrepresented in studies of catheter ablation of AF. Four previously published, small, observational studies reported similar complication rates between 2.5% and 7.5% for elderly patients, but did not evaluate differences in mortality. Although another previous study evaluated the safety of catheter ablation in this population, with data reported on both procedural complications and mortality, it did not report data on the efficacy of catheter ablation in preventing recurrence of AF in this patient population. In this study, recurrence rates of atrial arrhythmias both off and on or off AADs were similar between groups over 5 years of follow‐up. Similar to what was previously published, rates of all‐cause hospitalizations and mortality in this study were also not significantly different between groups after multivariable adjustment.

The presence of more comorbidities in the very elderly group, such as coronary artery disease and hypertension, argues against selection bias. However, frailty is not taken into account as it is difficult to objectively quantify and it could thus be argued that the least frail, very elderly patients were chosen for a catheter ablation strategy.

The current analysis adds more to pre‐existing literature as it evaluated in‐hospital and long‐term outcomes on both the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation in the very elderly (≥ 80 years old) population compared to a younger cohort. Despite the age difference, there was no statistically significant difference in follow‐up between groups, with a median follow‐up of over 3.5 years in the very elderly group. Rhythm control with an ablation strategy is thus feasible in select elderly patients and there should not be an age limit above which patients are not considered for ablation. However, the median age of the very elderly group was 81.5, so it remains unanswered how safe and effective ablation of AF is in an even older population. These findings are significant as AF is the most common arrhythmia in the elderly, with the prevalence expected to increase over the next several decades. Although large studies have previously been published on the safety and efficacy of AF in elderly cohorts, the long‐term follow‐up involving outcomes such as atrial arrhythmia recurrence, hospitalizations, and mortality compared to a younger cohort makes these findings valuable.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric catheter ablation outcomes and risks — Catheter ablation can be successfully performed in children of all ages, with acute success rates comparable to those reported in adults, but complications in initial large series were reported in 4% to 8%, with major complications in 0.9% to 3.2%, and rates were higher in patients weighing < 15 kg. Serious complications include AV block requiring pacing, perforation, and coronary artery or mitral valve injury, and in early series, death was reported in 0.12% of children with normal hearts and was associated with lower weight and increased number of ablation lesions. Increased institutional experience, advanced mapping techniques, and use of cryoablation have reduced the incidence of complications, as well as the radiation exposure associated with the procedure, and the text notes that most centers perform elective ablation for children weighing > 12 kg to 15 kg.

Cardiac pacing strategies — right ventricular (RV) pacing burden, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and His bundle pacing — are characterized as follows: In LVEF < 40%, an analysis of the DAVID trial found the cutoff of 40% pacing as a predictor of increased HF adverse events, and a cutoff of at least 40% RV pacing is where increases in left ventricular end-systolic volume index and decreases in LVEF have been demonstrated. In patients with LVEF of > 50%, CRT has not been associated with increased exertional capacity or improved QOL compared with RV pacing. Although the BLOCK-HF trial demonstrated benefit with CRT compared with RV pacing, the benefit was attributable to improved LV function with CRT rather than worsened LV function with RV pacing. His bundle pacing prevents or mitigates ventricular dyssynchrony and mechanical adverse remodeling observed with RV pacing, with reports of a reduction in HF hospitalizations compared to RV pacing in the group pacing > 40% and a significant decrease in heart failure hospitalizations particularly in those with ventricular pacing > 20% compared with RV pacing; however, a progressive increase in thresholds was identified in a small number of patients and feasibility after atrioventricular nodal ablation has been shown.

### Rationale, considerations, and goals for atrial fibrillation centers of excellence: a Heart Rhythm Society perspective [^116rYHaf]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation centers of excellence — rhythm control and catheter ablation selection — The major indication for rhythm control is to improve QoL in patients who are symptomatic with AF, and the most important criterion for patient selection is the presence of symptoms or cardiovascular dysfunction related to AF. Systematic and serial assessment of QoL and symptoms is important when assessing responses and when to consider switching to a new rhythm control intervention, and systematic collection of patient reported outcomes (PRO) data can facilitate management. Most guidelines suggest that ablation should be second line to antiarrhythmic treatment (class I or III drugs), though ablation also should be considered in patients with cardiomyopathy, tachy-brady syndrome, patients < 60 years old, or those with professions that require no AF; first-line therapy might also be considered for patients who prefer to avoid medical therapy. The Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial recently reported a reduction in hospitalization and improved QoL for patients randomized to ablation in the intention-to-treat analysis.

### Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in the elderly > 75 years old: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aGJVR]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is increasingly performed worldwide. As comfort with AF ablation increases, the procedure is increasingly used in patients that are older and in those with more comorbidities. However, it is not well established whether AF ablation in the elderly, especially those > 75 years old, has comparable safety and efficacy to younger populations.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety profiles in patients older than 75 years undergoing AF ablation with younger patients.

Methods

Databases from EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane, were searched from inception through September 2021. Studies that compared the success rates in AF catheter ablation and all complications rates between patients who were older vs under 75 years were included. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.

Results

Twenty-seven observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 363,542 patients who underwent AF ablation. Comparing patients older than 75 years old to younger patients, there was no difference in the success of ablation rates between elderly and younger patients (pooled OR 0.85: 95% CI:0.69–1.05, p = .131). On the other hand, AF ablation in the elderly was associated with higher complication rates (pooled OR 1.42: 95% CI:1.21–1.68, p < .001).

Conclusion

As AF ablation is expanded to elderly populations, our study found that AF ablation success rates were similar in both elderly and younger patients. However, older patients experience higher rates of complications that should be considered when offering the procedure and as a means to improve outcomes with future innovations.

### Relation of frailty to outcomes after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^112Jnw8Y]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) improves outcomes compared with medical treatment alone. Risk stratification for outcomes following AF ablation remains an important area of uncertainty. This analysis evaluated the association between frailty and outcomes following AF ablation. We evaluated US inpatients receiving AF ablation between January 1, 2016 and December 1, 2016 using Medicare fee-for-service billing codes. Diagnosis codes were used to calculate patients' Hospital Frailty Risk Score, with the cohort divided according to established cut-points of low (< 5), intermediate (5 to 15), and high (> 15) risk for frailty. The primary outcome was survival. Among 5,070 in patients treated with catheter ablation (mean age 74.9 ± 6.8 years, 51.1% female), 38.6% were defined as frail with a Hospital Frailty Risk Score > 5, including 8.3% at high risk. Mortality rates (up to 630 days) were 5.8% in the low-risk group, 23.4% in the intermediate-risk group, and 42.2% in the high-risk group (log-rank p values < 0.001 for comparison between categories). In restricted cubic spline regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios for long-term mortality monotonically increased with increasing values of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (adjusted hazard ratio 1.065, 95% confidence interval 1.054 to 1.077). In secondary end points, frailty was independently associated with length of stay, postprocedure 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission and postdischarge 30-day mortality rates. In conclusion, frailty as assessed by a claims-based score is common in inpatient recipients of AF ablation, and provides risk stratification for mortality and other key clinical outcomes.

### Concomitant cardiac surgery and radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation: a retrospective single center study [^117VX45L]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Concomitant cardiac surgery and radiofrequency atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is an established procedure recommended in guidelines. However, the results have not been as good as expected. The authors therefore searched for predictive factors of success of the ablation procedure.

Design

The authors carried out a retrospective cohort study.

Setting

All the included patients had cardiac surgery in the Dijon University Hospital.

Participants

One hundred sixty-three patients with AF underwent a concomitant radiofrequency ablation between January 2009 and December 2016.

Interventions

A radiofrequency device was used to isolate the pulmonary veins creating a "Box lesion".

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoint of the study was freedom from AF at 12 months with follow-up assessed by an electrocardiogram or a 24-hour recording electrocardiogram Holter. The patient's mean age was 71 ± 9 years with a sex ratio of 1.4. Sixty-six percent of patients had paroxysmal AF and 34% nonparoxysmal AF, which includes persistent and long-standing persistent AF. Sixty-one percent of patients had an AF history for more than 1 year. The mean left atrial diameter was 47 ± 10 mm. No major ablation complications related to the procedure occurred. Overall freedom from AF rate after 1-year follow-up was 60% (n = 98). Six patients (4%) received an additional catheter-based ablation, and 10 patients (6%) had an electrical cardioversion during the follow-up period. The authors identified preoperative paroxysmal AF (odds ratio [OR] 2.54 [1.27–5.14] p = 0.008) and recent history of AF, less than 1 year, (OR 1.99 [1–4.06] p = 0.05) as statistically significant predictors for sinus rhythm maintenance at the 12-month follow-up. At the 12-month follow-up, 64% of patients who had concomitant epicardial treatment were in sinus rhythm and 57% of patients were in sinus rhythm after endocardial treatment. There were no significant differences in rhythm outcome between epicardial and endocardial radiofrequency approach, or between surgical procedures (mitral valve replacement versus coronary artery bypass grafting). The authors could not identify in a univariate analysis a significant left atrium size cutoff upon which ablation was less likely to be successful at 12 months follow-up.

Conclusions

Concomitant cardiac surgery and radiofrequency AF ablation provided freedom from AF for 60% of patients after 1-year follow-up. The authors have shown that paroxysmal AF and recent AF are predictive factors of success. Nevertheless, thorough postoperative care is necessary to improve long-term results, including the use of additional catheter ablation or cardioversion.

Section 4 Indications for Catheter Ablation

Following are the consensus recommendations for catheter ablation of VAs organized by underlying diagnosis and substrate. These recommendations are each assigned a COR and an LOE according to the current recommendation classification system. In drafting each of these recommendations, the writing committee took into account the published literature in the specific area, including the methodological quality and size of each study, as well as the collective clinical experience of the writing group when published data were not available. Implicit in each recommendation are several points: 1) the procedure is being performed by an electrophysiologist with appropriate training and experience in the procedure and in a facility with appropriate resources; 2) patient and procedural complexity vary widely, and some patients or situations merit a more experienced operator or a center with more capabilities than others, even within the same recommendation (eg, when an epicardial procedure is indicated and the operator or institution has limited experience with this procedure, it might be preferable to refer the patient to an operator or institution with adequate experience in performing epicardial procedures); 3) the patient is an appropriate candidate for the procedure (as outlined in Section 5.1), recognizing that the level of patient suitability for a procedure will vary widely with the clinical scenario; and 4) the patient's (or designee's) informed consent, values, and overall clinical trajectory are fundamental to a decision to proceed (or not) with any procedure. Therefore, in some clinical scenarios, initiation or continuation of medical therapy instead of an ablation procedure may be the most appropriate option, even when a class 1 recommendation for ablation is present. There may also be scenarios not explicitly covered in this document, and on which little or no published literature is available, in which the physician and patient must rely solely on their own judgment.

In drafting these recommendations, the writing committee also referenced several other relevant clinical documents, including the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death, among others. The exclusive focus of the current document on VA ablation led to the opportunity to develop more detailed and nuanced recommendations.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Summary of efficacy — The results of the studies and surveys reviewed above provide substantial evidence of the efficacy of catheter ablation to treat patients with paroxysmal AF and that ablation is an effective treatment of AF for many patients; although data are emerging to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of ablation of AF in other patient populations, especially the very elderly, those with longstanding persistent AF, and patients with reduced systolic function and heart failure, these remain areas in need of further investigation; the authors note they are hopeful that recommended clinical study designs will be used to further define efficacy and safety across varied populations.

### Progressive cardiogenic shock after catheter ablation in a man aged 78 years… [^1144g41C]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A patient in their late 70s was referred for catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia. After a steam pop that occurred during radiofrequency ablation, the patient experienced progressive blood pressure decrease without evidence of pericardial effusion, followed by refractory electromechanical dissociation. An emergency exploratory cardiac surgery revealed a major intramural hematoma dissecting a vast majority of the right and left ventricular myocardium. Despite efforts, the patient died during surgery. Benali K, Seguy B, Sacher F. Progressive Cardiogenic Shock After Catheter Ablation in a Man Aged 78 Years. JAMA Cardiol.
