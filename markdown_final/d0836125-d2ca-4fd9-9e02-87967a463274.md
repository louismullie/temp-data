## Question

Norovirus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of norovirus, covering epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, special populations, prevention, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the global burden and who is most affected. Then, I should verify transmission dynamics and outbreak settings. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and complications. After that, I need to check diagnostic strategies and their limitations. Then, I will examine treatment, including supportive care and investigational therapies. I will now examine special populations at higher risk. Finally, I should confirm prevention and control measures and outline future research and vaccine prospects, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and burden. Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, responsible for roughly 685–699 million illnesses and an estimated 136,000–278,000 deaths annually, with the highest morbidity and mortality in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals, and with GII.4 historically predominant and driving large outbreaks due to antigenic drift and escape from herd immunity [^116rHaLf] [^114kN4q5] [^115xwCC8]. Hold on, I should verify the U.S. estimates: norovirus causes about 19–21 million illnesses, 56,000–71,000 hospitalizations, and 570–800 deaths per year, with the highest hospitalization and death rates in older adults and the highest outpatient visit rates in children under 5 years, which aligns with broader surveillance data [^115wnS1y] [^113X3xko]. I need to ensure I note the post–rotavirus vaccine shift: norovirus has become the leading cause of medically attended pediatric AGE in several high-income settings, reinforcing its public health significance [^114bMaJA].

> Next, I should review transmission and outbreak settings. Norovirus spreads primarily via the fecal–oral route, with person-to-person contact, contaminated food and water, and contaminated surfaces as key drivers; aerosolization of vomitus can seed environmental contamination, and the virus is environmentally stable and chlorine tolerant, complicating control efforts [^115QWTMP] [^117633CV]. Wait, let me verify the infectious dose: human challenge studies suggest a low infectious dose on the order of 18–2,800 viral particles, which helps explain explosive outbreaks in closed settings, and dose appears to influence time to onset and shedding kinetics, though the relationship with severity is complex [^116Fw4h3] [^111ChDYW]. I should confirm outbreak-prone venues: long-term care facilities, hospitals, childcare centers, and cruise ships account for a disproportionate share of outbreaks, with attack rates often exceeding 50% and outbreaks lasting 2–6 weeks, imposing substantial operational and economic burdens on healthcare systems [^114EgNVM] [^113gEwFY].

> I will now examine clinical manifestations. Typical illness is acute, with abrupt onset of vomiting, nonbloody diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and occasional low-grade fever; symptoms usually resolve within 1–3 days in immunocompetent hosts, though shedding can persist beyond symptom resolution, complicating infection control [^111K6eJC] [^116UtX9W]. Hold on, I should verify complications: dehydration is the most common and can be severe in young children and older adults; seizures, including afebrile convulsions, are reported in children; rare complications include rhabdomyolysis and exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, and immunocompromised patients may develop chronic norovirus enteropathy with malabsorption and weight loss [^111SuvqM] [^112z2nTP] [^115XKJra] [^115M3Cwj]. Let me reconsider the duration in special settings: in hospitalized cohorts, median illness duration may extend to 3–5 days, reflecting host and environmental factors, which is important for discharge planning and isolation policies [^111vwnnH].

> Next, I should review diagnosis. Routine testing is not necessary for uncomplicated cases; diagnosis is clinical, but I need to ensure I specify when testing is indicated: severe disease, immunocompromise, persistent symptoms, outbreak investigations, or public health purposes, ideally using RT-PCR for highest sensitivity and specificity, with multiplex panels expanding access but requiring careful clinical interpretation [^114cTUk3] [^113TfNu8]. Wait, I should double-check specimen choice: diarrheal stool is preferred over rectal swabs, with substantially higher detection yields, and a single specimen is usually sufficient in acute disease, though persistent diarrhea may warrant repeat testing [^116GmvSi]. I should confirm outbreak case definitions: short incubation (24–48 hours), high vomiting frequency (> 50%), brief illness (12–60 hours), and absence of bacterial pathogens support norovirus attribution in outbreak contexts [^114cTUk3].

> Now, treatment. I need to ensure I emphasize that management is supportive: oral rehydration with correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits is first-line; antiemetics such as ondansetron can reduce vomiting and facilitate rehydration, particularly in children; antibiotics are ineffective and should be avoided unless treating a confirmed bacterial coinfection, and empiric antimicrobials are discouraged in acute watery diarrhea without inflammatory features [^116UtX9W] [^116QsJDo] [^117NPL7v]. Hold on, I should verify special populations: in immunocompromised patients with chronic norovirus, case reports describe off-label use of ribavirin, nitazoxanide, or interferon with variable outcomes, and oral or nasoduodenal human immunoglobulin has shown promise in small series, though evidence quality is low and dosing is not standardized; reducing immunosuppression when feasible may aid clearance, but this is not always possible in primary immunodeficiencies [^111MCRUA] [^114ozXrj] [^116xoUda]. Let me reconsider pediatric antiemetic use: while not curative, ondansetron can improve hydration success and reduce healthcare utilization in children with vomiting from AGE, aligning with supportive care goals [^116QsJDo].

> I will now examine special populations. In older adults, especially residents of long-term care facilities, norovirus carries high attack rates and excess mortality, with median symptom duration around 4 days and frequent need for intravenous fluids; underdiagnosis is common and contributes to nosocomial spread and unnecessary imaging or antibiotics [^117MufGs] [^113U18BU]. In immunocompromised hosts, norovirus can establish chronic infection lasting weeks to years, driving enteropathy and malnutrition; superinfections and relapses occur, and standard IVIG/SCIG does not reliably clear gastrointestinal infection, necessitating individualized strategies and infection control precautions to limit transmission [^11629CXW] [^114XWx2T] [^115M3Cwj]. But wait, what if the host is a secretor-negative individual? Histo-blood group antigen expression modulates susceptibility, with secretor status influencing infection risk and severity, which may partly explain interindividual variability in outcomes and transmission efficiency [^115xwCC8].

> Next, I should review prevention and control. Hand hygiene is foundational; soap and water are preferred because alcohol-based sanitizers have limited efficacy against norovirus, especially in outbreak settings, and should be supplemented with environmental disinfection using chlorine-based agents and attention to high-touch surfaces and shared equipment [^1156Q3xD] [^117633CV]. I need to ensure I cover outbreak management: cohorting ill patients, restricting movements, excluding ill staff, and coordinating with public health authorities are essential, and in healthcare settings, standard and transmission-based precautions reduce spread; in food handling, strict adherence to safe food practices is critical given norovirus's prominence in foodborne outbreaks [^112b3zaS] [^114geuHh] [^115QWTMP]. Hold on, I should verify vaccine status: no licensed vaccine exists, but several candidates are in clinical development, and modeling suggests vaccination of high-risk groups could reduce morbidity and transmission, though durability and breadth across diverse strains remain key challenges [^114kN4q5] [^1162W36n].

> Finally, I should consider future directions. Advances in human intestinal enteroid culture systems are accelerating antiviral screening and immunotherapeutic development, and improved surveillance and genotyping are needed to track strain evolution and anticipate pandemic waves, particularly for GII.4 variants [^115xwCC8] [^114kN4q5]. Wait, let me verify the economic rationale: norovirus imposes substantial hospital opportunity costs and system-level burdens, strengthening the case for investment in vaccines, antivirals, and evidence-based infection control interventions once available [^113gEwFY]. I should double-check that current research priorities include correlates of protection, mucosal immunity, and standardized protocols for oral immunoglobulin or other passive strategies in chronic infection, given the heterogeneity of current case-series outcomes [^116xoUda].

Norovirus is the **leading cause of acute gastroenteritis** worldwide [^1118NxdG], with a low infectious dose and high environmental stability that fuel rapid transmission [^115QWTMP]. Illness is typically self-limited (1–3 days) [^111K6eJC] and managed with supportive care; however, **severe dehydration** can occur in children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients [^116rHaLf]. Diagnosis is clinical, with RT-PCR reserved for outbreaks or high-risk patients [^114cTUk3]. No specific antivirals or vaccines are approved [^1151EKke]; prevention relies on hand hygiene, food safety, and environmental disinfection [^1156Q3xD] [^115D3xcK]. In immunocompromised hosts, norovirus can cause chronic infection with persistent shedding and malabsorption [^11629CXW]; oral immunoglobulin is an emerging, evidence-limited therapy [^116xoUda].

---

## Epidemiology and transmission

- **Global burden**: Norovirus causes ~685 million cases and 136,000–278,000 deaths annually, with the highest burden in children under 5 years, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals [^116rHaLf] [^114kN4q5].

- **Transmission**: Highly contagious via fecal-oral route, person-to-person, contaminated food/water, and aerosolized vomitus; low infectious dose (18–2,800 particles) and environmental stability enable rapid spread [^114kN4q5] [^115QWTMP].

- **Outbreaks**: Common in healthcare, long-term care, childcare, and food service settings, with attack rates up to 50% and prolonged durations (mean 16–19 days) [^114EgNVM] [^112b3zaS].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Incubation**: 12–48 hours [^111K6eJC].

- **Symptoms**: Sudden onset vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and occasional fever; vomiting is prominent in adults, diarrhea in children [^111K6eJC] [^112Nxmb7].

- **Duration**: Typically 1–3 days; immunocompromised patients may have chronic infection lasting weeks to months [^111K6eJC] [^11629CXW].

- **Complications**: Dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and, rarely, encephalopathy or seizures, especially in children and older adults [^111SuvqM] [^112z2nTP].

---

## Diagnosis

Routine testing is not recommended for uncomplicated cases; diagnosis is **clinical** [^114cTUk3]. RT-PCR is the gold standard for outbreak investigations, high-risk patients, or persistent cases, offering high sensitivity and specificity [^114cTUk3] [^112BMaTV]. Immunoassays are rapid but less sensitive and should be interpreted cautiously [^114cTUk3] [^112BMaTV].

---

## Treatment

Supportive care with oral rehydration is the mainstay; **IV fluids** are used for severe dehydration [^116UtX9W] [^112Nxmb7]. Antiemetics such as ondansetron reduce vomiting and facilitate rehydration [^116QsJDo]. Antibiotics are ineffective and should not be used [^111K6eJC] [^117NPL7v].

---

## Prevention and control

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent soap-and-water handwashing is critical; alcohol-based sanitizers are less effective against norovirus [^1156Q3xD] [^117633CV].

- **Food safety**: Strict hygiene and handling practices reduce foodborne transmission [^115D3xcK].

- **Environmental disinfection**: Use chlorine-based cleaners (≥ 1,000 ppm) for contaminated surfaces [^notfound].

- **Infection control**: Isolate symptomatic individuals and exclude ill staff from work in healthcare and food service settings [^114EgNVM].

---

## Special populations

Immunocompromised patients are at risk for **chronic infection**, persistent shedding, and malabsorption; oral immunoglobulin is an emerging therapy with limited evidence [^11629CXW] [^116xoUda]. Pregnant women have a low risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes but are vulnerable to dehydration; supportive care is recommended. Older adults have higher rates of severe outcomes, hospitalization, and mortality, especially in long-term care settings [^117EvoSx].

---

## Current research and future directions

Vaccine candidates are in clinical trials, but **none are approved** due to strain diversity and short-lived immunity [^114kN4q5] [^1151EKke]. Antivirals remain investigational; nitazoxanide and ribavirin show limited efficacy in chronic cases [^114nH2Tc] [^111MCRUA]. Improved diagnostics, including rapid molecular tests, are under development to enhance outbreak detection and management [^117633CV] [^1146Tc8o].

---

Norovirus is a highly contagious cause of acute gastroenteritis with a **self-limited course** in most patients; **supportive care** is the cornerstone of management, while prevention hinges on hand hygiene, food safety, and environmental control. Chronic infection in immunocompromised hosts remains a challenge, with oral immunoglobulin as a promising but unproven therapy [^116xoUda].

### Viral gastroenteritis [^116UtX9W]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Since the discovery of norovirus in 1972 as a cause of what was contemporarily known as acute infectious non-bacterial gastroenteritis, scientific understanding of the viral gastroenteritides has continued to evolve. It is now recognised that a small number of viruses are the predominant cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, in both high-income and low-income settings. Although treatment is still largely restricted to the replacement of fluid and electrolytes, improved diagnostics have allowed attribution of illness, enabling both targeted treatment of individual patients and prioritisation of interventions for populations worldwide. Questions remain regarding specific genetic and immunological factors underlying host susceptibility, and the optimal clinical management of patients who are susceptible to severe or prolonged manifestations of disease. Meanwhile, the worldwide implementation of rotavirus vaccines has led to substantial reductions in morbidity and mortality, and spurred interest in vaccine development to diminish the impact of the most prevalent viruses that are implicated in this syndrome.

### Norovirus infection in immunocompromised hosts [^11629CXW]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Acute gastroenteritis caused by noroviruses often has a duration of 2–3 days and is characteristically self-limiting. In contrast, chronic infection caused by noroviruses in immunocompromised individuals can last from weeks to years, making clinical management difficult. The mechanisms by which noroviruses establish persistent infection, and the role of immunocompromised hosts as a reservoir for noroviruses in the general human population, are not known. However, study of this patient cohort may lead to new insights into norovirus biology and approaches to treatment.

Treatment and prevention

Treatment

To date, no US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies are available for norovirus AGE. Most norovirus AGE episodes last 2–3 days, are self-limiting, and are managed with hydration and supportive care. Severe cases may require medical intervention to alleviate fluid loss, including hospitalization. In lower-income countries with limited access to rehydration therapies, prevention of norovirus AGE is essential. Beyond infection control precautions, rehydration treatments do not differ substantially from the treatment of other non-bacterial causes of diarrhea.

In immunocompromised individuals with persistent norovirus infections, complications can be treated using intravenous fluids, parenteral nutrition, and adjustment of immunosuppression. Given the risk for chronic and severe disease, immunocompromised individuals could potentially benefit from prevention through vaccination or norovirus antiviral treatments –.

Norovirus and rotavirus in high-risk populations — chronic and severe norovirus infection has been reported in patients receiving immunosuppression following organ transplantation, and patients who acquire norovirus infection while hospitalized, especially people with immunocompromising conditions and people of advanced age, may be more likely to die. Persistent non-vaccine-related and vaccine-related rotavirus diarrhea has been reported in young children with primary immunodeficiency, but rotavirus disease and hospitalizations overall have been reduced markedly since licensure of the 2 ACIP-recommended rotavirus vaccines.

### Clinical and in vitro evidence favoring immunoglobulin treatment of a chronic norovirus infection in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency [^114ozXrj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a growing number of immunocompromised patients due to increased solid organ transplantation, increased incidence of cancer, and advances in the care of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). Norovirus is the most common viral cause of gastroenteritis and these infections can become chronic in immunocompromised individuals. The mechanisms behind viral clearance are not clear, although high titers of immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies that can block binding of the virus to its receptors correlate with protection. Norovirus-specific IgA is associated with protection and a shorter duration of virus shedding, and norovirus-specific T cells have been detected in children and blood donors. There are at least 10 norovirus genogroups that can be further subdivided in genotypes, and as a result individual can be infected multiple times during their lifetime. Most infections are caused by genotype GII.4, for which new variants that can escape herd immunity emerge over time. It is, therefore, likely that people have a broad antibody response against GII.4.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^114SArro]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Giardia sp. norovirus, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. are predominant etiological agents of infectious gastroenteritis in individuals with CVID. Symptoms are typically nonspecific and vary from self‐limiting to chronic or refractory gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, and weight loss. A favourable correlation exists between Giardia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter infections in CVID patients exhibiting undetectable serum IgA levels, which is expected considering the recognized function of IgA in mucosal immunity. Norovirus and cytomegalovirus infections seldom possess clinical relevance in immunocompetent individuals; nonetheless, their sequelae might be severe in cases of CVID.

Norovirus gastroenteritis is a predominant cause of gastroenteritis globally. Its prevalence has been determined to be 7% among CVID patients. Norovirus impacts 19% of the global population; however, it has been detected in up to 100% of individuals with CVID enteropathy. Chronic norovirus infections have been recognized as a cause of CVID enteropathy. Consequently, individuals with CVID and concomitant norovirus infections must be actively followed for symptom remission, and alternate treatments should be contemplated if infections persist.

However, currently, there is no established conventional therapy for chronic norovirus infection resulting in CVID enteropathy. In the absence of systematic comprehensive studies, we must depend solely on case reports. We recently diagnosed and successfully treated a patient with CVID‐associated enteropathy related to chronic norovirus infection, which constitutes the central focus of this review. Our objective is to provide a concise overview of this distinct form of primary immunodeficiency, drawing on the current — albeit still incomplete — body of knowledge.

### Noroviruses everywhere: has something changed? [^1176UWCQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noroviruses causing gastroenteritis in humans have increasingly been described in both the scientific literature and the lay press. This review summarizes new information about where and why these viruses are detected as well as new developments to prevent or treat these infections.

Recent Findings

Noroviruses are highly infectious and quite stable. Noroviruses infect all age groups, with particularly severe disease occurring in young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic diseases. Noroviruses also cause persistent infections in immunosuppressed patients. Host susceptibility factors have been identified, including histo-blood group antigens that likely function as initial receptors for some noroviruses. The patterns of susceptibility are complex, however, and not completely understood for all virus strains. X-ray crystallographic information on the virus capsid and other viral-encoded proteins provides targets for structure-based drug development.

Summary

The availability of new methods of detecting noroviruses has resulted in increased detection of these pathogens. Advances in understanding of virus replication and structure should lead to development of strategies to prevent and treat these infections. Such efforts may be challenged by the emergence of new virus strains that appear through mechanisms that remain to be understood.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^113aXDvg]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

The future appears promising. Sophisticated norovirus culture methods, such as human intestine enteroids, may enhance our understanding of viral persistence and treatment efficacy. Simultaneously, it is essential to delineate the immunological correlates of viral clearance and to investigate targeted antiviral or vaccination methods. Until such advancements occur, the management of chronic norovirus‐associated CVID enteropathy must remain personalised, incorporating supportive care, meticulous nutritional monitoring, and targeted therapeutic interventions. Recognising chronic norovirus infection as a primary etiological factor in CVID enteropathy signifies a paradigm change, underscoring the necessity for systematic investigations to enhance diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive methods in this susceptible patient cohort.

What factors contributed to the success of the OHIG treatment we implemented? In our patient's case, we could not evaluate the Intratect preparation utilised to ascertain the norovirus‐specific neutralising antibody titre. Nevertheless, the patient's clear clinical improvement confirms that OHIG treatment was ‐at least partially‐effective in neutralising the virus. Throughout the treatment, our patient was supplied a cumulative total of 60 g (15 g per dosage) of OHIG on four separate occasions, exceeding the quantities reported in other case studies, where patients got roughly 4 g per day. It is believed that 3 g of IgA and somewhat less IgG are secreted daily in the digestive tract. In our case, 270 mg of remnant IgA per treatment was used, resulting in a cumulative total of 1080 mg of IgA. The residual IgA from the Intratect preparation may have contributed, although the IgG utilised may have mitigated the absence of mucosal IgA.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^117MufGs]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective medical record review showed the clinical pictures, treatment, and medical resource use related to NG outbreaks at 19 typical geriatric facilities in Japan. From 2009 to 2011, there were 8 NG outbreaks in 6 facilities (32%), resulting in 146 infected residents. Analysis of the medical records of 107 infected residents in 5 of these facilities yielded the following results: 106 (99%) infected residents presented with primary symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea; 84 (79%) presented with associated symptoms; median symptom duration was 4 days; and approximately 70% of infected residents were diagnosed on the basis of symptom progression alone. Isolation circumstances varied between facilities. Approximately 75% of infected residents received treatment, most commonly infusions and antibiotics. The median antibiotic cost was about twice the all-drug cost.

Almost all of the infected residents presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and approximately 80% presented with associated symptoms, including decreased appetite, fever of 37 °C or greater, and general malaise, over a median symptom duration of 4 days. In a study of 7 LTCFs in the United States where outbreaks of NG occurred between 2009 and 2013, 40 of the 62 patients were aged 70 years or older, all of the infected residents aged 70 years or older presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and median symptom duration was 4 days. Up to this point, no studies in Japan or other Asian countries have investigated the clinical course of NG in multiple facilities for elderly persons based on medical records, making the present study the first of its kind. The clinical course of NG in facilities in this study was found to be nearly consistent with that previously reported for facilities in the United States.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^115NC6Ss]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

There are a number of limitations to this study. First, because there is no established diagnostic standard for NG, residents who were diagnosed by facilities to be infected with NG were designated "infected residents". Doctors in facilities made NG diagnoses based on the presence of symptoms typical of NG, timing of incidence, incidence among other residents, staff reports of residents' symptoms, and their own experience. Because there is a possibility that facilities treat all residents with NG-like symptoms as being infected as a precautionary measure to prevent further spread of infection within the facility, the number of infected residents may have been overestimated. Meanwhile, given the error based on the accuracy of diagnostic kits, the number of infected residents diagnosed using diagnostic kits may have been underestimated. The second limitation has to do with the fact that it was only possible to examine the medical records of infected residents in the 5 facilities that granted permission to do so. The 5 cooperating facilities had a mean capacity of 99 patients and a median average occupancy rate of 97%, making them typical examples of the 3533 geriatric intermediate care facilities in Japan (mean capacity of 91 patients, mean occupancy rate of 92%). However, we believe that the results of this study were obtained from a group of facilities that pay relatively greater attention to preventing and dealing with infection. Thus, caution must be exercised when generalizing these findings to other LTCFs. Third, with regard to additional expenses associated with the NG outbreaks at LTCFs, it was only possible to clarify the costs of drugs and other medical supplies directly used in treating the patients. NG outbreaks generate indirect costs associated with limited admission of new patients, staff sick leave and overtime, cleaning fees, and so on. The data on the duration of limited admissions and the numbers of patients admitted during these periods that could be obtained (median duration (range): 20 days (11 to 52 days); 0 to 2 patients) suggest that the financial impact on facilities was small. It was not possible to obtain data on whether staff were infected and took sick leave as a result of any of the outbreaks investigated in this study. No additional cleaning fees were incurred as a result of the NG outbreaks. This is because, in the facilities investigated, the cleaning was not outsourced to a third party but, rather, performed as part of staff duties, which is typical practice for LTFCs in Japan.

### Control of norovirus infection [^115D3xcK]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of the review is to provide an update on control measures for norovirus (NoV), which is the most commonly implicated pathogen in acute gastroenteritis and outbreaks, causing major disruption in nurseries, schools, hospitals and care homes.

Recent Findings

Important developments include the discovery that virus particles, previously considered to be the infectious unit, also occur in clusters, which appear to be more virulent than individual virus particles; a working culture system using human stem-cell derived enteroids; promising results from early phase clinical trials of candidate NoV vaccines, which appear to be safe and immunogenic; chronic NoV affects patients with primary and secondary immune deficiencies. Although several treatments have been used none are supported by well designed clinical trials; infection control procedures are effective if properly implemented.

Summary

NoV remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Although there are exciting developments on the vaccine front, the mainstay of control remains good hand hygiene, adherence to infection control procedures and limiting contamination of food, water and the wider environment. Once vaccines are available there will be important decisions to be made about how best to implement them.

Public health control and testing — an organism-specific diagnosis usually is necessary for public health control efforts because clinical factors alone rarely are sufficient to distinguish between etiologic agents; the most common cause of diarrheal disease outbreaks is norovirus; and health departments can provide guidance on testing, with public health laboratories assisting in testing for agents that exceed the diagnostic capacity of the clinical laboratory.

### A narrative review of norovirus epidemiology, biology, and challenges to vaccine development [^114kN4q5]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) globally. AGE resulting from norovirus causes significant morbidity and mortality in countries of all income levels, particularly among young children and older adults. Prevention of norovirus AGE represents a unique challenge as the virus is genetically diverse with multiple genogroups and genotypes cocirculating globally and causing disease in humans. Variants of the GII.4 genotype are typically the most common genotype, and other genotypes cause varying amounts of disease year-to-year, with GII.2, GII.3, and GII.6 most prevalent in recent years. Noroviruses are primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route and only a very small number of virions are required for infection, which makes outbreaks of norovirus extremely difficult to control when they occur. Settings like long-term care facilities, daycares, and hospitals are at high risk of outbreaks and can have very high attack rates resulting in substantial costs and disease burden. Severe cases of norovirus AGE are most common in vulnerable patient populations, such as infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, with available treatments limited to rehydration therapies and supportive care. To date, there are no FDA-approved norovirus vaccines; however, several candidates are currently in development. Given the substantial human and economic burden associated with norovirus AGE, a vaccine to prevent morbidity and mortality and protect vulnerable populations could have a significant impact on global public health.

5 Diagnostic Considerations

5.1 CVID

The diagnosis of CVID is frequently difficult due to its diverse clinical manifestations and the lack of universally recognized diagnostic criteria. The latest International Consensus Document (ICON) guidelines define five criteria necessary for diagnosis. (1) Serum IgG levels exceeding two standard deviations below the age‐adjusted reference range, confirmed on a minimum of two occasions separated by more than 3 weeks unless levels are severely diminished (< 100–300 mg/dL, contingent on age); (2) a concurrent reduction in either IgA or IgM; (3) compromised antibody responses to vaccination; (4) age exceeding 4 years; and (5) exclusion of secondary aetiologies of hypogammaglobulinemia.

The diagnostic criteria put forward by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) vary in numerous significant respects. The ESID definition mandates a reduction in IgA, and the assessment of switched memory B cells (with levels below 70% of the age‐specific reference range) may act as a substitute for vaccination response evaluation. Furthermore, it is essential to establish the lack of significant T‐cell deficiency, and patients must exhibit at least one clinical manifestation, including heightened vulnerability to infections, autoimmune disorders, granulomatous inflammation, unexplained polyclonal lymphoproliferation, or a familial history of antibody deficiency. Tables 1 and Table 2 summarise the most commonly used diagnostic criteria for CVID.

9 Future Perspectives

Existing evidence for the application of oral immunoglobulin for norovirus infection treatment is scarce, predominantly derived from case studies and limited trials. These studies may exhibit publication bias, thus rendering the generalisability of the findings unclear. A notable disadvantage is the absence of high‐quality, randomized clinical trials, essential for validating the treatment's efficacy and establishing the best dose regimen.

The mechanism of action of immunoglobulin is intricate; it may exhibit both anti‐inflammatory and pro‐inflammatory characteristics, and the localised intestine effects of oral treatment remain inadequately comprehended. This necessitates additional inquiry to enhance comprehension of the pharmacodynamic and immunomodulatory mechanisms.

Additional methodological issues further obfuscate the interpretation of the data. The mode of delivery, such as nasoduodenal or nasogastric, can differ markedly across studies, thereby influencing efficacy and leading to result discrepancies. This constrains the extensive extrapolation of the data.

The existing data are encouraging; yet, the evidential quality is minimal. Future well‐structured, randomized, controlled trials are essential to elucidate the conditions, dosage, and delivery route for the effective use of oral immunoglobulin in treating norovirus infection.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^115M3Cwj]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency, characterised by impaired antibody production, immune dysregulation, and a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Gastrointestinal involvement is frequent, affecting up to 20% of patients and significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality. Among infectious triggers, norovirus plays a particularly important role, as persistent infection may drive chronic inflammation and contribute to the development of CVID-associated enteropathy, a severe non-infectious complication marked by chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, and weight loss. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving impaired humoural immunity, absent mucosal IgA, and aberrant T- and B-cell interactions, resulting in defective viral clearance and sustained mucosal injury. Although viral eradication has been shown to induce clinical and histological improvement, no standardized therapeutic strategy currently exists. Intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin replacement fails to adequately protect against gastrointestinal infections, and off-label antivirals such as ribavirin, nitazoxanide, or interferon alpha have yielded inconsistent results. Oral administered immunoglobulin preparations have shown variable efficacy in case reports, reflecting differences in viral genotypes, host susceptibility, and donor antibody repertoires. In this review, we summarise current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnostic considerations of CVID-associated enteropathy linked to chronic norovirus infection, with a special focus on therapeutic aspects. We also present our experience with a patient successfully treated with immunoglobulin therapy administered via nasogastric tube, leading to clinical remission, nutritional recovery, and viral clearance. Recognising norovirus as a key etiological factor in CVID enteropathy emphasises the need to conduct systematic studies and evidence-based therapeutic approaches.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^112BMaTV]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 75% of infected residents were administered some type of treatment, with approximately 60% receiving infusion intravenously and approximately 30% receiving antibiotics. This study showed the actual state of treatment of NG patients in LTCFs, which had been unknown. Measures to prevent or control norovirus infection include hand washing, isolation of infected persons, and environmental disinfection; the recommended treatment is fluid when needed based on symptoms. More than half of infected residents in this study received intravenous fluid therapy, suggesting compliance with the MHLW manual. In contrast, the reasons for administration of antibiotics are not clear. According to previous studies, facilities for the elderly account for 47 to 79% of all antibiotic use in facilities every year, with 70% being administered to patients suffering from urinary tract and respiratory infections. It has been reported that 16 to 40% of antibiotic use in facilities is inappropriate. Of the 30 infected residents in this study who were administered antibiotics, 2 had symptoms besides vomiting and diarrhea associated with norovirus infection (1 patient was making abnormal respiratory sounds, and 1 patient had pneumonia) that might require treatment with antibiotics. Given that antibiotics are not expected to affect norovirus, the administration of antibiotics to the other 28 patients may have been inappropriate. Antibiotics should be administered cautiously to elderly individuals whose overall health status is in decline.

Approximately 70% of 107 infected residents were diagnosed on the basis of symptom progression. Methods for detecting norovirus include nucleic acid-based PCR methods and antigen-based immunoassay methods. The former methods are typically performed by government agencies or research entities to identify the causal agents of mass outbreaks of food poisoning or infection and require approximately 6 h to obtain results. Accordingly, antigen-based immunoassay methods, which are easy to perform and yield results in approximately 20 min or less, are more suitable for facilities. However, immunoassays have a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 98%, resulting in a high probability of false-negative results. According to the cooperating facilities in this study, one set of immunoassays (10 tests) costs between USD 150 and 200, which is paid entirely by the facilities. It is for this reason that most of the infected residents were diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation.

### Norovirus infections in long-term care facilities [^1149QshZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

Noroviruses have emerged as one of the leading causes of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, affecting community-dwelling and institutionalized older adults. Recent global epidemics present a growing challenge to the healthcare system and to long-term care facilities. Noroviruses spread readily and rapidly through multiple routes (e.g., person-to-person contact, contact with contaminated surfaces, airborne dissemination of vomitus) and thus are able to sustain an epidemic efficiently and successfully. Although norovirus gastroenteritis is a short self-limited illness in healthy immunocompetent individuals, it can result in significant morbidity and mortality in vulnerable compromised persons such as frail elderly persons and older residents of nursing homes. Diagnosis is made by clinical assessment and confirmed primarily by stool evaluation using polymerase chain reaction. Treatment is confined to supportive measures. Public health prevention and control strategies provide guidance regarding surveillance and the necessary steps to curb the clinical effect and spread of norovirus infections in various settings, including long-term care.

ABSTRACT

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency, characterised by impaired antibody production, immune dysregulation, and a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations.

### Norovirus illnesses in children and adolescents [^115AD1jk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of childhood vomiting and diarrhea in the United States and globally. Although most illnesses caused by norovirus are self-resolving, severe outcomes may occur from dehydration, including hospitalization and death. A vast majority of deaths from norovirus occur in developing countries. Immunocompromised children are at risk for more severe outcomes. Treatment of norovirus illness is focused on early correction of dehydration and maintenance of fluid status and nutrition. Hand hygiene, exclusion of ill individuals, and environmental cleaning are important for norovirus outbreak prevention and control, and vaccines to prevent norovirus illness are currently under development.

### Norovirus infection in older adults: epidemiology, risk factors, and opportunities for prevention and control [^117EvoSx]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis. In older adults, it is responsible for an estimated 3.7 million illnesses; 320,000 outpatient visits; 69,000 emergency department visits; 39,000 hospitalizations; and 960 deaths annually in the United States. Older adults are particularly at risk for severe outcomes, including prolonged symptoms and death. Long-term care facilities and hospitals are the most common settings for norovirus outbreaks in developed countries. Diagnostic platforms are expanding. Several norovirus vaccines in clinical trials have the potential to reap benefits. This review summarizes current knowledge on norovirus infection in older adults.

Diagnosis

Norovirus may be suspected based on symptoms, but routine testing is not usually conducted outside of outbreak investigations. Laboratory confirmation of norovirus is generally not necessary in clinical settings, although it may be useful in select situations, for example in immunocompromised patients with severe or persistent symptoms or for public health purposes during outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The most widely used method is reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, which provides high sensitivity and specificity, can estimate viral load in stool samples, and can discriminate between pathogens. Enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can also be used to diagnose norovirus AGE in stool samples but have poor sensitivity. Ideally, stool specimens should be collected < 2–3 days from symptom onset and frozen or refrigerated to ensure nucleic acid integrity.

Clinical and epidemiologic criteria are commonly used to identify outbreak cases. Outbreaks of AGE can be attributed to norovirus when there is a mean (or median) illness duration of 12–60 h; a mean (or median) incubation period of 24–48 h; vomiting in > 50% of individuals; and no enteric bacteria found.

### Norovirus infections in a tertiary care centre-individual cases do not necessarily lead to an outbreak [^111RTxgh]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Norovirus is responsible for the majority of gastroenteritis outbreaks within healthcare settings. Routes of spread include foodborne-, waterborne- and especially person-to-person transmissions.

Objective

We investigated the overall attack rate of norovirus, within and outside outbreak situations, transmitted via patient-to-patient contact in a tertiary care centre from January 2012 to March 2015.

Study Design

We monitored exposed asymptomatic patients next to infectious patients for the development of symptoms of acute gastroenteritis following exposure.

Results

We detected 102 patients with contact to 94 infectious patients. Of these only 11 patients developed typical norovirus symptoms after exposure while 91 patients remained asymptomatic. Total secondary attack rate was only 10.8%.

Conclusions

Patient-to-patient transmission of norovirus is potentially overestimated within clinical settings. Future prevention strategies should consider personal risk factors of exposed patients.

3 Clinical observation

The most prevalent symptoms associated with norovirus infection include emesis and diarrhea, occasionally accompanied by nausea, abdominal discomfort, cramping, anorexia, malaise, and low-grade pyrexia. Common complications may encompass benign seizures, febrile seizures, convulsions, necrotizing enterocolitis as well as exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. Detection of respiratory secretions from children presenting with respiratory symptoms revealed that norovirus may also be implicated in respiratory diseases. Additionally, there have been reported cases where mild meningoencephalitis can be attributed to norovirus infection based on clinical manifestations.

The main symptoms associated with norovirus infection exhibited variability among individuals, with a higher prevalence observed in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Studies have indicated that young children exhibit more severe symptoms, with the establishment of protective immunity to prevent re-infection typically occurring before the age of 2 years. The primary manifestations of diarrhea in infants under 1 year old include watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, convulsions, and potentially fatal outcomes in severe cases.

In addition, the patients with norovirus gastroenteritis accompanied by convulsions also experience transient vomiting (lasting for approximately 2 days) in the absence of fever. For patients with immunocompetent norovirus gastroenteritis, the incubation period of infection is typically short, usually ranging from 24 to 48 h. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which generally resolve within a span of 72 h.

Furthermore, the various strains of the virus would exhibit distinct clinical manifestations. According to previous studies, the GII genotype is globally prevalent in human norovirus infections, while the GI genotype is only observed in a limited number of cases. Considering seasonal variations, the prevalence of GI genotypes is primarily observed during spring, whereas GII genotypes are predominant during autumn. Compared to other genotypes, norovirus GII infection is associated with a higher incidence of severe diarrhea and vomiting. Additionally, a greater proportion of patients infected with genotype GI experienced symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea lasting less than 3 days, and increased bowel sounds.

The comprehension of dominant strains and their correlation with clinical manifestations will facilitate the enhancement of clinical diagnosis accuracy and the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies.

### Estimating the hospital burden of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in england and its opportunity costs for nonadmitted patients [^1147hbVm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study quantified the hospital burden of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis for the NHS in England. It included for the first time the wider health impact that infectious diseases such as norovirus can have for other patients awaiting admission by reducing the beds and staff available to them.

Summary of Key Findings and Clinical Implications

Of all inpatients with primary or secondary all-cause gastrointestinal diagnoses in England between July 2013 and June 2016, 18% (95% CI, 16%‒22%) and 24% (95% CI, 21%‒30%) were attributable to norovirus, respectively. While the general increase in patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal illnesses in England throughout this period seemed to be driven by secondary diagnoses, the increase in norovirus-attributable inpatients identified after July 2013 appeared to be driven by primary diagnoses (less so by secondary diagnoses or outbreaks or coding variations; see Supplementary Material A). Discharging gastrointestinal inpatients faster in recent years (Supplementary Material A) and enhanced hygiene and other infection control measures, as well as a potentially increasing awareness, may all have contributed to fewer secondary norovirus-associated hospital cases and norovirus outbreaks.

Our regression results also showed that norovirus is now the second-highest contributor of gastrointestinal hospital diagnoses, after Campylobacter. The proportional increase in the burden of norovirus is largely driven by the reduction in rotavirus, which led to a reduced total number of laboratory-confirmed cases (see Supplementary Material A). Overall, the total number of bed-days tied up by norovirus-associated gastroenteritis annually is equivalent to the entire daily NHS hospital bed capacity in England being unavailable for > 2 days (ie, 290000 / 133000). The bed-days lost to norovirus prevented admission of other patients, who are estimated to have the potential to gain twice as many QALYs from hospitalization as the norovirus patients who displaced them. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the wider impact of norovirus outbreaks on health. In addition, a combined £10.3 million was lost annually from bed-days kept unoccupied and staff absences. With the prospect of several norovirus treatments and vaccines becoming available soon, our estimates may serve as baseline for future analyses.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^114ZSGrS]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Persistent norovirus replication has been recognized as a principal etiological factor of CVID enteropathy, a serious non‐infectious consequence marked by chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, weight loss, and diminished quality of life.

The pathophysiological relationship between CVID and norovirus persistence is complex. Impaired humoural immunity, especially IgA deficiency, and abnormal B‐cell maturation, impede viral clearance. As a result, a long‐lasting infection keeps damaging epithelial cells through uncontrolled CD8+ T‐cell responses and immune‐mediated tissue damage. Significantly, viral clearance has been linked to both clinical and histological enhancement, which emphasises the aetiology of norovirus in this distinct enteropathy.

Nonetheless, therapeutic alternatives continue to be inadequate. Standard immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG/SCIG) offers inadequate protection against GI infections, and OHIG (oral/via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube/administration of human immunoglobulin) has yielded variable results. The diversity probably comes from changes in the viral genotype, host factors, and the range of neutralising antibodies in preparations made from donors. Likewise, off‐label antivirals like ribavirin and nitazoxanide have demonstrated sporadic and unexpected efficacy. These limitations underscore the absence of standardized, evidence‐based methodologies, as the majority of data is sourced from case reports or small series, with no randomized clinical trials available.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^116xwwoV]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

It can be inferred that OHIG treatment did not accomplish total viral eradication; nonetheless, it successfully diminished the quantity of infectious virus in the intestine momentarily, enabling the patient's immune system to eliminate the residual infection. The reported failure of OHIG treatment in certain instances may be attributed to norovirus mutation or the presence of a viral strain against which the donors who participated in the immunoglobulin preparation did not generate neutralising antibodies. Consequently, it would be prudent to standardise immunoglobulin preparations according to the concentration of norovirus‐specific neutralising antibodies or, alternatively, utilise convalescent plasma, akin to therapies for SARS‐CoV‐2.

There is also evidence that some of the immunoglobulin administered orally avoids degradation in the stomach and reaches the small intestine.

For our patient, we administered OHIG therapy alongside IVIG treatment. While lacking precise findings, one cannot dismiss the putative antiviral function of the idiotype network modulated by immunoglobulin therapy in the mucosa.

6 Therapeutic Possibilities

In patients on immunosuppressive therapy, reducing these medications may help resolve norovirus infections, but this is not possible for patients with PID, and there are no approved vaccines or therapeutic agents. Ribavirin and nitazoxanide are off‐label norovirus treatments. A nucleoside analogue, ribavirin, treats persistent hepatitis C infections. Broad‐spectrum antiparasitic nitazoxanide has been examined as an antiviral, which inhibits norovirus replicon replication. Interferon 2‐alpha may also reduce norovirus shedding in pigs.

The therapeutic efficacy of ribavirin in CVID‐associated enteropathy complicated by norovirus infection has been reported only in a limited number of cases. The mean duration of infection was approximately 2.5 years, although in some patients it persisted for more than 6 years. Given the impaired mucosal absorption of ribavirin in CVID enteropathy, monitoring of drug levels is recommended. In selected cases, trough concentrations were measured, and the lowest effective therapeutic level was determined to be 1000 ng/mL. Despite this, infection clearance was achieved in only two of seven patients after 1 year of treatment, while therapeutic failure has also been observed in individuals receiving doses exceeding this threshold.

It is believed that the antiviral action of nitazoxanide works either by boosting the host's innate immune response or by blocking the maturation of viral proteins. In norovirus infection, initial findings were promising; however, following investigations regarding chronic infection have produced inconsistent effects. One potential reason for treatment failure is the biological heterogeneity across norovirus genotypes, encompassing disparities in cellular entry mechanisms and sensitivity to host interferon pathways.

IVIG and SCIG treat numerous infections in PID patients. To ensure a wide range of antibody specificities against various illnesses, these immunoglobulin preparations are made from plasma from multiple (from 1000 up to 100,000) donors. In persistent norovirus infections, immunoglobulins are given directly to the gut via nasoduodenal tubes (i.e.: OHIG).

The above treatments have been empirically tested with varying success rates, resulting in quick cures for some individuals but not others. Most of these investigations typically failed to assess virus genotypes, shedding patterns, and clearance processes throughout therapy, confounding the assessment of treatment outcome variability and therapeutic improvements. However, two new norovirus cell culture models — one using B cells and the other using human intestinal enteroids — may help improve chronic norovirus infection treatment.

CONCLUSION

As such a wide range of the population is affected by norovirus, defining a target group for interventions, and vaccination in particular, is a challenge. Targeting a norovirus vaccine to protect the populations at higher risk of disease may include infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. The majority of outbreaks occur among the elderly in hospitals or in long-term residential care facilities; therefore, a vaccine to protect this population is a priority. Vaccination of infants will address the most common cause of pediatric hospitalization due to gastroenteritis in countries in which rotavirus vaccine is in use. In addition, immunizing children could have important indirect benefits by limiting the transmission of norovirus in the general population. Before vaccines are ready to be rolled out for widespread use, there are still important questions that need to be answered such as the immunogenicity in infants and the elderly, which may be substantially reduced because of differences in exposure history and immune state and duration of protection.

As immunocompromised hospital patients may have chronic diarrhea and norovirus excretion, development of effective antiviral treatments and/or passive immunotherapy is a priority. Such therapies may not only benefit the affected patient directly, but may also benefit efforts to control transmission in the hospital, especially in transplant and oncology care units, in which most patients are immunosuppressed and at high risk of severe norovirus disease outcomes.

Given the high economic burden of nosocomial norovirus outbreaks, second only in the United Kingdom to the cost associated with urinary tract infections, a full cost–benefit analysis should inform refurbishment initiatives and future hospital design in that country, and perhaps others with similar hospital design structures. More generally, we advocate for a stronger evidence base for infection prevention and control of norovirus in healthcare settings, well designed controlled trials, or, where that is impractical or unethical, observational studies should be conducted on interventions, including ward closure, disinfection regimes, and cohorting strategies.

### Viral gastroenteritis [^111FDjoo]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Enteric viruses, particularly rotaviruses and noroviruses, are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. Rotaviruses primarily affect young children, accounting for almost 40% of hospital admissions for diarrhoea and 200000 deaths worldwide, with the majority of deaths occurring in developing countries. Two vaccines against rotavirus were licensed in 2006 and have been implemented in 95 countries as of April, 2018. Data from eight high-income and middle-income countries showed a 49–89% decline in rotavirus-associated hospital admissions and a 17–55% decline in all-cause gastroenteritis-associated hospital admissions among children younger than 5 years, within 2 years of vaccine introduction. Noroviruses affect people of all ages, and are a leading cause of foodborne disease and outbreaks of gastroenteritis worldwide. Prevention of norovirus infection relies on frequent hand hygiene, limiting contact with people who are infected with the virus, and disinfection of contaminated environmental surfaces. Norovirus vaccine candidates are in clinical trials; whether vaccines will provide durable protection against the range of genetically and antigenically diverse norovirus strains remains unknown. Treatment of viral gastroenteritis is based primarily on replacement of fluid and electrolytes.

### Are noroviruses emerging? [^115FKnv4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

First, research on the disease prevalence of noroviruses is only beginning. If noroviruses are an increasingly common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, with some cases resulting in diarrhea-related deaths and hospitalizations, then substantially greater investments are required in their diagnosis. Increased use of diagnostics along with improved surveillance, such as in sentinel sites, will permit identification of new strains and shifts in the epidemiology of norovirus disease. The development of easy-to-use, sensitive assays for use by clinical and public health laboratories should also have a high priority.

Second, we do not know how to stop norovirus transmission. Foods can be contaminated with norovirus either at the source or at the point of service by infected food handlers. Noroviruses can spread by water, direct person-to-person contact, or airborne droplets of vomitus, and they can persist in the environment as a source of continuing infection despite efforts at disinfection. Recent advances in finding a cell culture system for noroviruses may allow for assessing the efficacy of various disinfectants, but only by full epidemiologic investigation of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks and by application of molecular tests will transmission routes be determined, differences in epidemiology between strains be detected, and targeted control measures implemented.

Norovirus infections are common and likely to become more so. Effective prevention strategies must now be designed and implemented.

### Clinical pictures, treatments, and resource use of norovirus gastroenteritis in long-term care facilities: a survey with a chart review in Japan [^116aQAUi]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The items investigated were NG incidence and restriction of new admissions due to the outbreak (duration of restriction, number of new admissions to the facility during the restricted period), refer to Additional files 1 and 2. Residents who were suspected of having NG and were treated accordingly by facilities were designated "infected residents". Definition of outbreak is an epidemic limited to localized increase in the incidence of a disease. If an NG outbreak had occurred, the facility in question was visited with permission, and the medical records of infected residents were examined to collect the following information: sex, age, nursing care level, symptoms, symptom duration, use (or non-use) of an NG diagnostic kit, isolation circumstances, treatment during the symptomatic period (name of medications, daily dose, and number of days administered for each medicine), and outcomes. Symptoms were classified into primary symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) and associated symptoms (symptoms other than primary symptoms such as decreased appetite, fever of 37 °C or greater, general malaise). In cases where permission to examine medical records was not granted, the facility was asked to provide the above information for infected residents. The symptom durations were defined as the existence of symptom during the stay in the facility regardless of the infected residents' outcomes. Outcome data of patients who were transferred and hospitalized were confirmed by the facilities' records. Statistical analyses were performed comparing the group of residents who received treatment and the group of residents who did not receive treatment for the following items: age, care level, symptom duration, number of isolated residents, isolation duration, presentation of primary symptoms, and outcome (recovery or death). Independent t -tests were performed for continuous independent variables, and chi-squared tests were performed for categorical independent variables. IBM SPSS Ver. 24 was used to perform all analyses.

Symptoms exhibited by infected residents

Of the 107 patients whose records were examined, 106 (99%) presented with vomiting or diarrhea (both vomiting and diarrhea 52 (49%), diarrhea only 37 (35%), vomiting only 17 (16%)). Associated symptoms of some kind were observed in 84 (79%) patients, with some patients presenting with multiple symptoms (decreased appetite 69 (65%), fever of 37.0 °C or greater 59 (55%), general malaise 47 (44%), and vomiting of blood 2 (2%)). Median symptom duration for the 107 patients was 4 days (25th percentile, 2 days; 75th percentile, 6 days).

Isolation of infected residents

The number of isolated infected residents is shown in Table 1. The most common isolation method used was to place infected residents in the same room. However, in cases where same-room placement was deemed difficult due to room shortages, divider curtains around the beds were used to set off areas for infected residents. Of the 107 patients, 72 (67.3%) were isolated. Median isolation duration was 4 days (25th percentile, 3 days; 75th percentile, 5 days).

### Norovirus in healthcare settings [^1146jmB5]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an overview of the burden of norovirus disease in healthcare settings and the factors responsible for outbreaks in these institutions; to assess progress on interventions aimed at reducing the burden of norovirus disease.

Recent Findings

Norovirus outbreaks in healthcare settings are driven by confluence of viral diversity, the built environment, and host factors. Some of these characteristics may be modifiable and the target of successful interventions.

Summary

Most norovirus outbreaks in hospital and residential care institutions are associated with a particular genotype, known as GII.4. The persistence of norovirus is associated with strain diversity, which is driven by immune evasion and viral adaptation to interaction with a variety of human histo-blood group antigens. The healthcare environment presents serious challenges for control, both because of the physical structure of the built space and the high levels of contact among patient populations who may have compromised hygiene. Increased vulnerability among the populations in healthcare institutions is likely to be multifactorial and may include the following: nutritional status, immunodeficiency or senescence, chronic inflammation, and microbiome alterations. Current control measures are based on general infection control principles, and treatment is mainly supportive and nonspecific. Vaccines and antiviral agents are being developed with promising results, but none are currently available.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^113X3xko]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — U.S. burden and pathogen-specific epidemiology (Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network [FoodNet]/CDC): Acute gastroenteritis accounts for an estimated 179 million outpatient visits, nearly 500 000 hospitalizations, and > 5000 deaths annually. In adults, 1.5% of all hospital discharges are coded as gastroenteritis, the lifetime risk of a hospital discharge with gastroenteritis is 1 in 8, and the estimated prevalence of diarrhea among adults in the prior month is 3%–7%. Incidence is highest among children < 5 years, while hospitalization and death are highest in persons 65 years or older. FoodNet data indicate norovirus (58%) exceeds Salmonella enterica subspecies (11%) as a cause of illness, whereas Salmonella enterica subspecies exceed norovirus for hospitalization (35% vs 28%) and death (28% vs 11%). Before rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus caused 3 million annual episodes, > 500 000 outpatient visits, 27 000 hospitalizations, and about 25 deaths; after vaccine introduction, norovirus has been associated with nearly 1 million ambulatory care visits and 14 000 hospitalizations annually. Among children < 5 years, common bacterial pathogens are Salmonella enterica subspecies (42%), Campylobacter (28%), Shigella (21%), Yersinia (5%), and E. coli O157 (3%); together these five pathogens caused 291 000 illnesses, 103 000 physician visits, 7800 hospitalizations, and 64 deaths yearly, and before rotavirus vaccine an average of 369 children aged < 5 years died from diarrhea.

### Systematic literature review of role of noroviruses in sporadic gastroenteritis [^115y2jJJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review of studies that used reverse transcription-PCR to diagnose norovirus (NoV) infections in patients with mild or moderate (outpatient) and severe (hospitalized) diarrhea. NoVs accounted for 12%(95% confidence interval [CI] 10%-15%) of severe gastroenteritis cases among children < 5 years of age and 12% (95% CI 9%-15%) of mild and moderate diarrhea cases among persons of all ages. Of 19 studies among children < 5 years of age, 7 were in developing countries where pooled prevalence of severe NoV disease (12%) was comparable to that for industrialized countries (12%). We estimate that each year NoVs cause 64,000 episodes of diarrhea requiring hospitalization and 900,000 clinic visits among children in industrialized countries, and up to 200,000 deaths of children < 5 years of age in developing countries. Future efforts should focus on developing targeted strategies, possibly even vaccines, for preventing NoV disease and better documenting their impact among children living in developing countries, where > 95% of the deaths from diarrhea occur.

### Norovirus disease in the United States [^115wnS1y]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although recognized as the leading cause of epidemic acute gastroenteritis across all age groups, norovirus has remained poorly characterized with respect to its endemic disease incidence. Use of different methods, including attributable proportion extrapolation, population-based surveillance, and indirect modeling, in several recent studies has considerably improved norovirus disease incidence estimates for the United States. Norovirus causes an average of 570–800 deaths, 56,000–71,000 hospitalizations, 400,000 emergency department visits, 1.7–1.9 million outpatient visits, and 19–21 million total illnesses per year. Persons > 65 years of age are at greatest risk for norovirus-associated death, and children < 5 years of age have the highest rates of norovirus-associated medical care visits. Endemic norovirus disease occurs year round but exhibits a pronounced winter peak and increases by ≤ 50% during years in which pandemic strains emerge. These findings support continued development and targeting of appropriate interventions, including vaccines, for norovirus disease.

### The molecular pathology of noroviruses [^116ui84x]. The Journal of Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Norovirus infection in humans typically results in acute gastroenteritis but may also occur in many animal species. Noroviruses are recognized as one of the most common causes of acute gastroenteritis in the world, being responsible for almost 20% of all cases. Despite their prevalence and impact, our knowledge of the norovirus life cycle and the pathological processes associated with norovirus-induced disease is limited. Whilst infection of the intestine is the norm, extraintestinal spread and associated pathologies have also been described. In addition, long-term chronic infections are now recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge with respect to norovirus pathology and the underlying mechanisms that have been characterized to date.

### Estimating the hospital burden of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in england and its opportunity costs for nonadmitted patients [^113gEwFY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus has been associated with almost one-fifth of cases of all-cause acute gastroenteritis worldwide, resulting in an estimated median of 698.8 million illnesses and 218800 deaths annually across all ages. Norovirus most commonly occurs in the community. However, local hospital outbreaks of norovirus are highly disruptive and have significant economic costs internationally. These outbreaks can lead to increased norovirus-specific infections that may reduce available beds within the hospital system through infected patients blocking space for new admissions, beds left unoccupied for reasons of infection control and to allow cleaning and decontamination after outbreaks, and staff absences due to infection.

The impact of norovirus on the hospital system prompted the introduction of the English Hospital Norovirus Outbreak Reporting System (HNORS) in 2009, and in 2010 the National Health Service (NHS) England started monitoring the performance of all acute care hospitals during winter. While both systems enable detection of hospital bed pressures and norovirus outbreaks, neither collects individual-patient data. Therefore, the data collected by such surveillance systems alone do not capture the full burden of norovirus. With several antiviral treatments and vaccine candidates in development, obtaining a comprehensive overview of the baseline burden of norovirus in hospitals is timely to inform policy makers and investment in control strategies.

Moreover, as acute hospitals in many countries, including England, face high occupancy rates of beds, patients who cannot be admitted due to beds being unavailable result in health and economic losses to the healthcare system. Costing the burden of hospital infections such as norovirus has previously only considered actual expenditures incurred from dealing with an outbreak, ignoring the wider health impact for other patients awaiting admission. This is likely to underestimate the impact of norovirus on the healthcare systems and, consequently, any benefits from investing in novel vaccines, treatments, or infection control.

### Unrecognized norovirus infections in health care institutions and their clinical impact [^113U18BU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Noroviruses (NoVs) have emerged as the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis (GE) in humans. Although diagnostic facilities have greatly improved, significant underdiagnosis of NoV in hospitals may still occur, thereby increasing clinical burden and nosocomial spread. We evaluated the underdiagnosis of sporadic NoV infections in a tertiary care hospital and estimated its clinical impact. From December 2008 until July 2009, fecal samples specifically referred for bacterial but not viral examination were retrospectively tested for NoV by real-time PCR. The clinical and virological data from patients with undiagnosed NoV infection (missed patients) were evaluated and compared with those from patients with recognized NoV. During the study period, 45 patients with undiagnosed NoV were detected, whereas 50 patients were regularly diagnosed. The missed NoV cases were more frequently adults than children (80% versus 46%; P < 0.001). The viral load levels did not differ between the diagnosed and missed patients, but missed patients more frequently presented without diarrhea (20% versus 4%; P < 0.07). The newly admitted missed NoV cases with GE underwent more diagnostic imaging (24% versus 4%; P < 0.01) and tended to be hospitalized longer. When missed-NoV patients were included, the number of nosocomial clusters doubled and missed patients were index cases in 5 of the 6 clusters. These data indicate that NoV infections are frequently missed despite routine laboratory testing and demonstrate that underdiagnosis of NoV patients is associated with costly abdominal imaging and nosocomial clustering. Awareness of NoV infection in adult patients and education about the importance of viral GE should be increased.

### Advances toward a norovirus antiviral: from classical inhibitors to lethal mutagenesis [^114nH2Tc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

SUMMARY

In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of small-molecule inhibitors for HuNoV (Table 1), driven by different approaches and accompanied by increased understanding of the norovirus life cycle and development of new systems for studying norovirus replication. Importantly, however, further studies will be required to bring any of these potential compounds through clinical trials and into the clinic. To date, the only reported preliminary clinical trial tested nitazoxanide, a compound licensed against certain parasites, which produced a modest decrease in symptom duration in healthy individuals but, more importantly, resolved symptoms within a single chronically infected patient. However, no further use has been reported since 2011. Evaluating inhibitors that are currently in trials or under development for other viruses with conserved protein functions, including 2CMC derivatives and favipiravir, may serve to accelerate treatments for HuNoV through clinical trials.

The preferred approach of active surveillance enrollment and laboratory testing of all acute gastroenteritis patients from multiple sites was used in a recent study by Payne et al. from the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. This network of 3 pediatric hospitals conducted year-round, population-based, active surveillance for hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient clinic visits for acute gastroenteritis among children < 5 years of age for whom laboratory confirmation of cases was available. Payne et al. reported annual norovirus hospitalization, ED visit, and outpatient visit rates of 7, 141, and 319/10,000 children < 5 years of age, respectively, over a 2-year period. Because the outpatient surveillance in the New Vaccine Surveillance Network used sentinel clinics and was not truly population based, the norovirus outpatient visit rate was based on extrapolation of norovirus prevalence to the all-cause acute gastroenteritis outpatient rates from NAMCS/NHAMCS. Extending these norovirus incidence rates to the ≈20 million US children < 5 years of age, Payne et al. estimated 14,000 hospitalizations, 281,000 ED visits, and 627,000 outpatient visits for this age group. They also reported that the median health care charges for norovirus hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient visits were $3,918, $435, and $151, respectively, corresponding to an annual total of $273 million in norovirus-associated treatment costs for US children < 5 years of age. Compared with the estimates reported by Patel et al. among children < 5 years of age, Payne et al. estimated ≈55% fewer hospitalizations but ≈2 times as many ED and outpatient visits (Figure 1). Moreover, Payne et al. reported that norovirus had become the leading cause of medically attended acute gastroenteritis in children during the post-rotavirus vaccine era.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^117NPL7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute and persistent watery diarrhea is generally discouraged: in most people with acute watery diarrhea and without recent international travel, empiric antimicrobial therapy is not recommended (strong, low), with an exception that may be made in people who are ill-appearing, and empiric treatment should be avoided in people with persistent watery diarrhea lasting 14 days or more (strong, low). Asymptomatic contacts of people with acute or persistent watery diarrhea should not be offered empiric or preventive therapy, but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate). Features suggesting inflammatory infection that warrant investigation include high fever, significant abdominal pain, and duration > 3 days, and given the relatively small benefit of empiric treatment (1 day shorter illness on average) and the likelihood of viral infection in the absence of inflammatory signs, empiric treatment cannot be recommended and may be potentially harmful.

### A narrative review of norovirus epidemiology, biology, and challenges to vaccine development [^116rHaLf]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) worldwide, causing ~685 million cases annually. Each year, an estimated 1.5 million deaths occur globally due to all-cause AGE, with 136,000 to 278,000 related to norovirus infection –. Young children, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals are particularly vulnerable to severe norovirus disease and its associated complications. In lower-income countries, deaths from norovirus AGE are common among children as a result of severe diarrhea and dehydration; in higher-income countries, deaths occur less frequently and are more commonly observed in the elderlydue to complications from disease including sepsis, cardiac complications, malnutrition, and colon perforation.

Hand washing — Frequent and effective hand washing and alcohol-based hand sanitizers are of limited value in preventing most forms of traveler's diarrhea but may be useful where low-dose pathogens are responsible for the illness, such as during a cruise ship outbreak of norovirus infection, institutional outbreak, or in endemic diarrhea prevention (Conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). The evidence of hand washing and use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers in preventing TD is mixed, with low-inoculum pathogens (noroviruses and Shigella) highlighted; hand washing should be effective in reducing these highly communicable pathogens and should be aggressively pursued in cruise-ship, community, or institutional outbreaks. Effective hand washing and proper use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers could be well used in preventing TD if thoroughly pursued by persons preparing food, but is unlikely to impact when done by the person consuming the contaminated food. For cruise travelers regular hand washing can be useful in reducing the risk of either apparent or inapparent transmission of norovirus infection. Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers often have anti-viral properties, one study found hand washing with soap and water removed norovirus from hands whereas alcohol-based hand sanitizers were not effective, and a retrospective survey in travelers reported that regular sanitizer use did not appear to offer protection against diarrhea or respiratory tract infection.

### Advances in human norovirus research: vaccines, genotype distribution and antiviral strategies [^116QsJDo]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

1.4 Public health strategies to prevent norovirus infection

In the research and development of vaccines, numerous challenges exist in developing effective solutions for norovirus, including the intricate nature of human natural immune response to norovirus, the genetic diversity within the viral norovirus genome, the absence of a reliable viral in vitro culture system, and limited animal models available for vaccine testing. Consequently, an approved norovirus vaccine has yet to be established. Fortunately, several studies have reported that zebrafish can serve as a novel HuNov model, offering valuable insights for the investigation of norovirus vaccines. On the other hand, for acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus, the current primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy. This included a rehydration phase involving the intake of oral rehydration electrolytes and water, as well as a maintenance stage treatment that involved consuming electrolytes, water, and appropriate food. Research has demonstrated that ondansetron can be used to alleviate symptoms in children experiencing vomiting. Meanwhile, the public health care program should be further strengthened to effectively prevent viral infections. Additionally, measures should be implemented to enhance daily life and minimize the risk of viral infection. These measures primarily rely on consistent adherence to hand hygiene practices, meticulous attention to sanitizing environmental surfaces, and minimizing direct contact with infectious sources.

### Systematic literature review of role of noroviruses in sporadic gastroenteritis [^116Hj1eB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Despite improved safety of food, water, and sanitation and aggressive promotion of noninvasive interventions (e.g. oral rehydration therapy) and prevention strategies (e.g. increased breastfeeding), diarrhea remains a common cause of illness worldwide. It accounts for ≈1.8 million annual deaths in children < 5 years of age. Reduction of this disease will require targeted prevention and treatment strategies against the common agents causing severe diarrhea.

Noroviruses (NoVs) and sapoviruses are genetically and antigenically diverse single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to 2 different genera (Norovirus and Sapovirus) in the family Caliciviridae and are collectively referred to as human caliciviruses. The prototype virus of the NoVs, Norwalk virus, was identified in 1972. However, the inability to cultivate these viruses in routine cell culture and the consequent challenges in developing sensitive nonmolecular diagnostic assays hindered initial efforts to define the epidemiology and assess the impact of disease associated with NoV infection. In the past 15 years, the availability of sensitive molecular diagnostic methods based on reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) has allowed broader examination of the etiologic role of NoVs in epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis.

Since the application of molecular assays, NoVs have been well-documented as the leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis in all age groups, causing > 90% of nonbacterial and ≈50% of all-cause epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Recent studies that used improved diagnostics have demonstrated that NoVs may also fill in the "diagnostic gap" in severe sporadic gastroenteritis among all age groups worldwide. Much of the misconception of NoV as an infrequent cause of severe sporadic diarrhea might also stem from studies undertaken before the mid-1990s that found low rates of NoV infection because available diagnostics such as electron microscopy and antigen detection assays had poor sensitivity. Recent data are emerging that are debunking these misconceptions, suggesting that the impact of NoV disease may be much greater than previously suspected and the disease may be more severe in some populations (,–). However, because these novel assays are not typically available outside of reference laboratories, the true global prevalence and potential economic impact of NoV disease remain unrecognized. To further understand the etiologic role of NoVs in sporadic diarrhea, we conducted a systematic review to identify studies that used similar inclusion criteria and molecular assays based on RT-PCR to detect NoVs in fecal specimens from patients with diarrhea.

Figure 3
Estimates of annual burden (annual number of illnesses and associated outcomes) and individual lifetime risks for norovirus disease across all age groups, United States. Data were derived from estimates of deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient visits, and illnesses. Ranges represent point estimates from different studies, not uncertainty bounds.

Although the estimates summarized herein were developed by using distinct methods, each with their own strengths and limitations, the broad agreement among them is reassuring and provides a clearer picture of the norovirus disease burden in the United States. Population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed norovirus disease provides the most direct assessment of disease incidence, but depending on the study population, might have limited generalizability. Indirect attribution from regression modeling makes use of the most nationally representative data available but relies on temporality of acute gastroenteritis to ascribe etiology, as opposed to diagnostic testing. Attributable proportion extrapolation is somewhat of a hybrid between these 2 methods, being limited primarily by the comparability of the 2 populations involved in the extrapolation. Aside from differences in methods, the variation between estimates from the different studies might be partly caused by different time periods from which they were derived, given major year-to-year fluctuations in norovirus disease driven by the emergence of new strains.

### Advances in human norovirus research: vaccines, genotype distribution and antiviral strategies [^116hU1k5]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

6 Future outlook

Norovirus accounts for approximately 20% of the global burden of acute gastroenteritis. According to available literature, norovirus is responsible for an estimated 698.8 million cases of illness and 218,800 deaths annually across all age groups. However, limited research content and findings hinder a comprehensive understanding of norovirus.

According to the correlated characteristics of norovirus, future research on antiviral drugs and vaccines could focus on inhibiting virus invasion or blocking virus binding with receptors on the surface of norovirus, such as HBGAs and TLR. Additionally, targeting specific proteins expressed by the genome of norovirus can inhibit viral replication, transcription, and translation to facilitate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines. Furthermore, plant-derived substances or synthesized drugs can be utilized to impede viral pathogenesis for treatment and prevention purposes. Currently, numerous studies have been conducted on drugs and vaccines with some pharmaceutical companies already progressing related products through clinical experiments. It is anticipated that more effective drugs will be developed in the future leading to improved research and treatment outcomes for norovirus.

### Infection control for norovirus [^117633CV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Norovirus infections are notoriously difficult to prevent and control, owing to their low infectious dose, high shedding titre, and environmental stability. The virus can spread through multiple transmission routes, of which person-to-person and foodborne are the most important. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have helped to establish norovirus as the most common cause of sporadic gastroenteritis and the most common cause of outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis across all ages. In this article, we review the epidemiology and virology of noroviruses, and prevention and control guidelines, with a focus on the principles of disinfection and decontamination. Outbreak management relies on sound infection control principles, including hand hygiene, limiting exposure to infectious individuals, and thorough environmental decontamination. Ideally, all infection control recommendations would rely on empirical evidence, but a number of challenges, including the inability to culture noroviruses in the laboratory and the challenges of outbreak management in complex environments, has made it difficult to garner clear evidence of efficacy in certain areas of infection control. New experimental data on cultivable surrogates for human norovirus and on environmental survivability and relative resistance to commonly used disinfectants are providing new insights for further refinining disinfection practices. Finally, clinical trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines, which may shift the current infection control principles to more targeted interventions.

Introduction

Noroviruses are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) across all age groups and are responsible for 18% of diarrheal disease globally. Norovirus is highly contagious and transmitted by the fecal-oral route –. Infections have a broad clinical spectrum that ranges from asymptomatic or self-limiting illness to severe or fatal disease. The public health impact generated by noroviruses is significant, with more than 20 million cases in the United States, 680 million cases worldwide and 219 thousand deaths annually. The disease burden is especially significant among children, with more than 200 million infections reported in children under 5 years of age and 50,000 cases resulting in death every year –. The total economic burden of noroviruses is estimated to be $64.5 billion annually. Despite the prevalence of norovirus infection and associated disease burden, there are no approved prophylactics or targeted therapies. Treatments remain only palliative, resulting in a significant unmet medical need.

Institutional settings — Outbreaks of diarrhea in institutional settings are a substantial public health problem, and the National Outbreak Reporting System collects data on multiple outbreak types; during 2009–2013, reported acute gastroenteritis outbreaks had primary transmission through person-to-person contact, environmental contamination, and unknown modes of transmission. In outbreaks where a setting was reported, 70% occurred in long-term care facilities; in contrast, 59% of Shigella-associated outbreaks and 36% of Salmonella-associated outbreaks were identified in childcare facilities. Norovirus was implicated in 84% of outbreaks where an etiology was suspected or confirmed, and existing infection control guidelines are recommended for control of norovirus and the extremely chlorine-tolerant Cryptosporidium in institutional settings.

Viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is common and afflicts people of all ages. Nonviral causes of AGE are less common. Norovirus is a leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of AGE across all ages. Universal rotavirus vaccination of infants has reduced frequency and severity of rotavirus AGE cases in children and indirectly reduced cases in older adults. Severe illness is more likely in persons at age extremes or with immunocompromising conditions. Viral causes of AGE can lead to protracted diarrheal illness in immunocompromised persons. Nucleic acid amplification tests are changing diagnostic testing algorithms.

Outbreaks

Norovirus AGE outbreaks are associated with high attack rates and substantial economic and clinical burden. The most commonly reported setting for norovirus outbreaks in the US and other industrialized countries is healthcare settings. The costs to hospitals associated with outbreaks can be substantial, depending on the number of units affected. Two systematic reviews of norovirus outbreaks occurring in hospitals and nursing homes worldwide found a median attack rate of 50% (range, 9–78) during an outbreak event and a protracted duration of outbreak with a mean of 16 days (range, 3–44) in nursing homes and 19 days (range, 6–92) in hospitals. Both patients and staff are important drivers of transmission of norovirus, though evidence suggests a larger number of transmitted infections occur in outbreaks when the index cases are patients than when index cases are staff. In a 1-year surveillance study of gastroenteritis outbreaks in three hospitals in England, attack rates of confirmed norovirus AGE during hospital outbreaks were 24.5% for staff (95% CI, 17.8–31.2) and 53.2% for patients (95% CI, 41.5–65.0). Guidelines to help control outbreaks in healthcare settings include enhanced hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, restriction of patient movements, and exclusion of ill staff from work.

This review facilitates identification of key groups that would benefit from prevention strategies aimed at controlling norovirus and provides the grist for development of appropriate interventions, including vaccines. Such data are particularly timely and relevant given that a candidate norovirus vaccine is approaching a phase 3 efficacy trial and could potentially be licensed within the next 5–7 years.

### Super-infections and relapses occur in chronic norovirus infections [^114XWx2T]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Norovirus causes chronic infections in immunocompromised patients with considerable associated morbidity. It is not known whether chronic infections involve super- or re-infections or relapses.

Objectives

To retrospectively investigate whether longitudinal sampling in chronically infected patients demonstrates persistent infection with the same virus, or super- or re-infection.

Study Design

Norovirus full genomes were generated from 86 longitudinal samples from 25 paediatric patients. Consensus sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis and genotyping.

Results

Super-infections occurred in 17% of chronically infected patients who were continuously PCR positive; including two with mixed norovirus infections. The median duration of infection was 107days longer in those with super-infections; however this was not statistically significant. A third of patients with interrupted norovirus shedding continued to be infected with the same virus despite up to 2 months of PCR negative stools, classified as a relapse. The majority (67%) of patients with interrupted shedding were re-infected with a different genotype.

Conclusions

Chronically infected patients who are continuously PCR positive are most likely to remain infected with the same virus; however super-infections do occur leading to mixed infection. Patients with interrupted shedding are likely to represent re-infection with a different genotype, however relapsing infections also occur. Our findings have implications for infection control as immunosuppressed patients remain susceptible to new norovirus infections despite current or recent infection and may continue to be infectious after norovirus is undetectable in stool. The relevance to children without co-morbidities remains to be determined.

### Global prevalence of asymptomatic norovirus infection: a meta-analysis [^111ShnbG]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

In practice, estimates of prevalence of asymptomatic NoV infections are affected by study design, settings, population, the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and other factors. Based on the 71 studies in our analysis, prevalence of asymptomatic NoV infection was 7%. The same result was obtained in another study in which prevalence was estimated from 20 studies, where asymptomatic individuals were only from control groups matched with cases in case–control studies. Studies with this design also met our study inclusion criteria, and our result in this design was also 7%. Beyond that, our studies included another two designs of studies. Prevalence was higher in cohort studies, and the proportion was calculated as the sum of several specimens collected from each individual divided by total number of positive individuals. Cohort studies might be a source of heterogeneity because detection of NoV in their stool may be shedding from a previously symptomatic infection. Information on the length of follow up or interval between previous reports of symptoms and sample collection was rarely given in texts. Norovirus prevalence tended to be higher in cases of acute gastroenteritis compared with asymptomatic infection. A pooled prevalence of norovirus in 187,336 patients with acute gastroenteritis from 175 articles was as high as 18% (95% CI 17–20). The high prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic norovirus infection showed that this pathogen brought heavy burdens and targeted control programs were needed for norovirus prevention.

### Vital signs: foodborne norovirus outbreaks-United States, 2009–2012 [^115QWTMP]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Noroviruses are the leading cause of both sporadic cases and reported outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea or vomiting) in the United States. Each year, there are an estimated 19–21 million cases of norovirus disease, including 1.7–1.9 million outpatient visits, 400,000 emergency department visits, 56,000–71,000 hospitalizations, and 570–800 deaths, which result in approximately $777 million in health-care costs. Rates of severe outcomes, such as hospitalization and death, are greatest in children aged < 5 years and older adults aged ≥ 65 years. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes fever, although norovirus infections also can be asymptomatic. This genetically-diverse group of viruses comprises six genogroups (GI–GVI), three of which (GI, GII, and GIV) cause human disease. Genogroups are further subdivided into at least 38 known norovirus genotypes; GII.4 strains cause most outbreaks worldwide.

Transmission of norovirus occurs primarily via the fecal-oral route, including direct person-to-person contact, consumption of contaminated food or water, or contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Noroviruses also might be spread through incidental ingestion of vomitus droplets, which can disperse via aerosolization. The varied means through which noroviruses spread coupled with their environmental stability (remain infectious at freezing temperatures or until heated above 140°F [60°C], and for 2 weeks on surfaces), resistance to common disinfectants, low infectious dose (18–2,800 viral particles), and copious shedding (up to 10¹² viral particles per gram of feces) among persons with asymptomatic infections as well as before, during, and after the manifestation of symptomatic infections make these viruses challenging to control.

Norovirus diagnostics generally rely on molecular methods and are not in widespread clinical use for sporadic cases; however, data collected through outbreak investigations provide insights that can help guide prevention efforts. Noroviruses often are associated with person-to-person spread in health-care settings, for which specific prevention and control guidelines are available *; however, noroviruses also are the leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne disease in the United States, and thus require specific attention to improve food safety. This report provides an updated description of the epidemiology of U.S. norovirus outbreaks, focusing on those resulting primarily from foodborne transmission, to help target interventions.

Estimated Prevalence of NoV Disease in Children

We estimate that each year NoVs cause ≈900,000 episodes of gastroenteritis that require a clinic visit and ≈64,000 hospitalizations among children < 5 years of age residing in high-income countries (Table 3). If one assumes that the proportion of annual childhood diarrhea-associated hospitalizations (≈124 million) and deaths (≈1.8 million) in developing countries approximates the overall proportion of children (12.1%) with severe NoV illness in our review, NoVs may cause up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths each year in children in developing countries.

### Epidemiology, prevention, and control of the number one foodborne illness: human norovirus [^1146Tc8o]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Human norovirus (NoV) is the number one cause of foodborne illness. Despite tremendous research efforts, human NoV is still poorly understood and understudied. There is no effective measure to eliminate this virus from food and the environment. Future research efforts should focus on developing: (1) an efficient cell culture system and a robust animal model, (2) rapid and sensitive detection methods, (3) novel sanitizers and control interventions, and (4) vaccines and antiviral drugs. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to build multidisciplinary and multi-institutional teams to combat this important biodefense agent.

The patient's IgG trough concentration was initially extremely low (< 0.7 g/L), but with the administration of 20–30 g IVIG every four weeks, the IgG level increased gradually to the expected trough level of 5–6 g/L.

However, repeated stool RT‐PCR tests [BioFire FilmArray and Viasure Multiplex Norovirus GI + GII Real Time PCR Detection Kit (Ct was 29)] confirmed the persistent positive result for norovirus GII. Based on previous case reports, with some modifications, in January 2025, during close immunological monitoring, we initiated oral human immunoglobulin (OHIG) supplementation via nasogastric tube. The patient received 15 g of Intratect immunoglobulin on two occasions, 5 days apart, each administered in the morning on an empty stomach. The preparation used was a 50 g/L Intratect solution (supplied in 100 mL vials) with the following approximate IgG subclass distribution: 57% IgG1, 37% IgG2, 3% IgG3, and 3% IgG4. The maximum IgA content of the solution is 900 μg/mL. For each administration, a total of 300 mL of solution was prepared and delivered in 30 mL aliquots every 20 min through the nasogastric tube.

In February 2025, repeated stool RT‐PCR again detected norovirus; however, the patient reported a near‐complete resolution of diarrhoea and had gained 2 kg in body weight. At that time, her IgG trough concentration had risen to 5.2 g/L. In March 2025, the patient underwent a second cycle of OHIG treatment as described above, receiving 15 g on two occasions, five days apart.

Subsequent stool RT‐PCR testing in April and June 2025 was negative for norovirus. The patient's body weight continued to increase, reaching 52 kg, and IgG trough levels stabilised between 4.9 and 5.4 g/L under ongoing monthly 30 g IVIG therapy. A follow‐up colonoscopy performed in April 2025 confirmed completely normal mucosal appearance both macroscopically and histologically.

### Human noroviruses: recent advances in a 50-year history [^115xwCC8]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noroviruses are a major cause of gastroenteritis. This review summarizes new information on noroviruses that may lead to the development of improved measures for limiting their human health impact.

Recent Findings

GII.4 strains remain the most common human noroviruses causing disease, although GII.2 and GII.17 strains have recently emerged as dominant strains in some populations. Histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) expression on the gut mucosa drives susceptibility to different norovirus strains. Antibodies that block virus binding to these glycans correlate with protection from infection and illness. Immunocompromised patients are significantly impacted by norovirus infection, and the increasing availability of molecular diagnostics has improved infection recognition. Human noroviruses can be propagated in human intestinal enteroid cultures containing enterocytes that are a significant primary target for initiating infection. Strain-specific requirements for replication exist with bile being essential for some strains. Several vaccine candidates are progressing through preclinical and clinical development and studies of potential antiviral interventions are underway.

Summary

Norovirus epidemiology is complex and requires continued surveillance to track the emergence of new strains and recombinants, especially with the continued progress in vaccine development. Humans are the best model to study disease pathogenesis and prevention. New in-vitro cultivation methods should lead to better approaches for understanding virus-host interactions and ultimately to improved strategies for mitigation of human norovirus-associated disease.

### Development of rhabdomyolysis in a child after norovirus gastroenteritis [^115XKJra]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In children, the most significant cause of rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown is viral infection. However, there are no reports that norovirus, a gastroenteric virus that commonly infects children, specifically causes rhabdomyolysis. Here, we report the first pediatric case of norovirus-associated rhabdomyolysis.

Case Presentation

The patient, a 2-year-old boy with fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, was referred to our hospital with dysstasia and transaminitis. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. Additionally, norovirus genogroup GII was detected from stool samples by real-time quantitative reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, and thereafter, the norovirus GII.4 variant was identified.

Conclusion

However, the association between rhabdomyolysis and the isolated norovirus variant was not clarified. After treatment the patient recovered without renal failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Rhabdomyolysis is a disease for which there is a need for early detection and treatment. If abnormal posture or muscle weakness is observed during the course of gastroenteritis, blood and urinary tests should be performed to rule out rhabdomyolysis.

Simulations assuming a duration of shedding of 15 days and no under-reporting (outcomes from other simulations are shown in 'Additional file 5'). Dashed lines indicate the first day of each calendar month. SGSS Second Generation Surveillance System

We also tested the impact of model assumptions regarding under-reporting and the duration of shedding (Figure S2). Assumptions about under-reporting affect the rate of infection; if incidence was under-reported in Harris, this will result in a higher rate of infection in the community and the potential for a more rapid change in incidence. Assumptions on the duration of shedding have a lesser impact; simulation assuming a shorter duration of shedding suggests a higher incidence in the 2021/22 norovirus year (Additional file 1: Table S1).

### Updated norovirus outbreak management and disease prevention guidelines [^116pmaC1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Noroviruses are the most common cause of epidemic gastroenteritis, responsible for at least 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide, and a major cause of foodborne illness. In the United States, approximately 21 million illnesses attributable to norovirus are estimated to occur annually. Since 2001, when the most recent norovirus recommendations were published (CDC. "Norwalk-like viruses". Public health consequences and outbreak management. MMWR 2001;50[No. RR-9]), substantial advances have been made in norovirus epidemiology, immunology, diagnostic methods, and infection control. As molecular diagnostic techniques have improved in performance and become more widely available, detection and reporting of norovirus outbreaks have increased. Although the inability to culture human noroviruses in vitro has hampered progress, assessment of the performance of disinfectants has been facilitated by the discovery of new, cultivable surrogates for human noroviruses. In addition, the periodic emergence of epidemic strains (from genogroup II type 4, GII.4) and outbreaks in specific populations (e.g., the elderly in nursing homes) have been characterized. This report reviews these recent advances and provides guidelines for outbreak management and disease prevention. These recommendations are intended for use by public health professionals investigating outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis, including state and local health authorities, as well as academic and research institutions.

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors for seizures associated with norovirus gastroenteritis in childhood [^112z2nTP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Norovirus has become increasingly recognized as causing viral gastroenteritis in children. Few data are available on the characteristics of children admitted to pediatric emergency departments with norovirus gastroenteritis and accompanying seizures. Our aim in this study was to describe the clinical features of, and risk factors for, seizures accompanying norovirus gastroenteritis. We collected 6359 stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, of whom 1444 (22.71%) had laboratory-confirmed norovirus gastroenteritis. Of all patients, 108 (7.48%) children exhibited norovirus gastroenteritis and seizures; 49 (45.4%) were febrile, and 59 (54.6%) afebrile. The mean patient age was 2.31 ± 2.12 years; most were < 5 years of age (92.6%). The afebrile group had a significantly higher incidence of 2 or more seizures than the febrile subjects (P = 0.004). Early recognition and prompt treatment of convulsions associated with norovirus gastroenteritis in children are important. Future studies might explore the long-term prognoses of these patients.

### Complicated norovirus infection and assessment of severity by a modified vesikari disease score system in hospitalized children [^117J2W9U]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is one of the most common infectious diseases and still a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide. The two most important viral agents in children are rotaviruses and noroviruses. Norovirus (NoV) is genetically classified into 6 established genogroups (GI-GVI), while tentative genogroup GVII is proposed, and of which GI, GII, and GIV cause diseases in humans. NoV GII.4 has emerged as the predominant genotype causing outbreaks of AGE worldwide. In multivariate analysis, NoV GII.4 were associated with higher hospitalization and mortality rates. In the United States and Europe, NoV are responsible for approximately 50% of all reported gastroenteritis outbreaks. Similar to rotavirus infection, the main symptoms caused by norovirus infection are diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and even severe dehydration that needs hospitalization. Complications of norovirus AGE in children, such as convulsion, severe dehydration, malnutrition, bowel obstruction and even death were sporadically reported. Significant clinical features correlated with different viral strains has been documented recently, and after implementing rotavirus vaccination, norovirus infection has become one of the most important enteric pathogens threatening human health. Our recent study showed that in Taiwan under suboptimal use of rotavirus vaccines, a significant increase of norovirus infection was observed in the post- rotavirus vaccine era.

Disease severity score system for AGE was established previously. The severity score for different clinical features and complications caused by emerging enteric viruses such as NoV is lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features and complications with norovirus infection in hospitalized pediatric patients supposed to have moderate to severe illness, compared to children treated in the community setting, and furthermore, we proposed a disease scoring system modified from Vesakari score system for evaluation of norovirus disease with variable severity in hospitalized patients.

Multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) — capabilities, interpretation, and public health considerations: Multipathogen nucleic acid and amplification tests can simultaneously detect viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents including norovirus, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) in less time than traditional methods. With these assays, it is common to detect the presence of > 1 pathogen, and even a positive result for 1 pathogen should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation because tests detect nucleic acid as compared with traditional assays that generally detect viable organisms; the importance of detection of multiple pathogens in the same specimen is often unclear. The current FDA-cleared multiplex assays do not quantify the amount of nucleic acid present, and guidelines by IDSA and the American Society for Microbiology describe optimal tests with findings summarized in Table 5; since those guidelines, several gastrointestinal panels that detect > 20 viral, bacterial, and parasite enteric organisms have become available. There are important drawbacks to increasing use of CIDTs, as replacement of culture by CIDT in clinical laboratories will impede outbreak detection and investigation, while public health laboratories use molecular subtyping to detect, investigate, and control enteric outbreaks.

### Norovirus disease in the United States [^112bbRN4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in characterizing the incidence of norovirus disease in the United States; however, additional work is needed to fill some key gaps. Age-specific rates of norovirus disease, ideally from direct laboratory testing among population-based community cohorts, would help identify groups most often infected and thus those likely serving as primary human reservoirs for transmission. The causal role of norovirus and common concurrent conditions in norovirus-associated deaths also requires further clarification to help protect the most vulnerable populations. In addition, stable surveillance platforms that enable systematic and ongoing assessment of endemic norovirus disease are needed to characterize long-term trends, annual fluctuations, and effects of emergent norovirus strains.

As progress continues in the arena of norovirus vaccine development, such endemic norovirus disease data will be critical to guide formulation and quantify potential effects of vaccine. The burden of norovirus disease in the United States justifies continued efforts toward developing potential norovirus vaccines and identification of specific groups for such interventions. Our review suggests that for a vaccine to have maximal impact, it would need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in young children and the elderly, groups at the highest risk for severe norovirus disease. Other groups at risk for epidemic disease might also include health care workers, travelers, and military personnel. Data from our review can inform cost-effectiveness and modeling studies to define an investment case and public health strategy for controlling norovirus disease in anticipation of completion of vaccine development and licensure.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — clinical presentations and likely etiologies are listed as follows: Persistent or chronic diarrhea has likely pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. Giardia lamblia, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Cystoisospora belli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Visible blood in stool lists STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli), Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Entamoeba histolytica, noncholera Vibrio species, Yersinia, Balantidium coli, and Plesiomonas as likely pathogens. Fever is not highly discriminatory — viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections can cause fever; in general, higher temperatures are suggestive of bacterial or E. histolytica, and patients infected with STEC usually are not febrile at time of presentation. Severe abdominal pain, often with grossly bloody stools (occasionally nonbloody) and minimal or no fever, lists STEC, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia enterocolitica as likely pathogens. Persistent abdominal pain and fever lists Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis and may mimic appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting within ≤ 24 hours suggests ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin or Bacillus cereus (short-incubation emetic syndrome). Diarrhea and abdominal cramping lasting 1–2 days suggests ingestion of Clostridium perfringens or B. cereus (long-incubation diarrheal syndrome). Vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea lasting 2–3 days lists norovirus as the likely pathogen.

Specimen selection for infectious diarrhea testing — Recommendation 19 states that "The optimal specimen for laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea is a diarrheal stool sample (ie, a sample that takes the shape of the container)". For bacterial detection, "if a timely diarrheal stool sample cannot be collected, a rectal swab may be used (weak, low)", and for viral and protozoal agents and "C. difficile toxin, fresh stool is preferred (weak, low)". Evidence notes higher yield from stool vs rectal swab in adults in emergency departments, with detection in "stool samples (49% of cases in one study)" vs "rectal swabs (9% of cases)", and "detection of norovirus, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens was 4- to 6-fold greater" from stool. Regarding number of specimens, "In general, only a single stool specimen is required", though additional cultures "may increase the sensitivity" in "patients with persistent diarrhea". Laboratories using CIDTs "may have different specimen requirements", but "collection of a diarrheal stool specimen is important" for culture and susceptibility until CIDTs can serve these functions.

### Effect of norovirus inoculum dose on virus kinetics, shedding, and symptoms [^111ChDYW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The effect of norovirus dose on outcomes such as virus shedding and symptoms after initial infection is not well understood. We performed a secondary analysis of a human challenge study by using Bayesian mixed-effects models. As the dose increased from 4.8 to 4,800 reverse transcription PCR units, the total amount of shed virus in feces increased from 4.5 × 10¹¹ to 3.4 × 10¹² genomic equivalent copies; in vomit, virus increased from 6.4 × 10⁵ to 3.0 × 10⁷ genomic equivalent copies. Onset time of viral shedding in feces decreased from 1.4 to 0.8 days, and time of peak viral shedding decreased from 2.3 to 1.5 days. Time to symptom onset decreased from 1.5 to 0.8 days. One type of symptom score increased. An increase in norovirus dose was associated with more rapid shedding and symptom onset and possibly increased severity. However, the effect on virus load and shedding was inconclusive.

### Determination of the 50% human infectious dose for norwalk virus [^116Fw4h3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Noroviruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. An understanding of the infectious dose of these viruses is important for risk assessment studies.

Methods

Healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of different dosages of Norwalk virus. Eligible subjects were monitored for clinical gastroenteritis, and infection status was determined. The presence of virus in vomitus was also assessed.

Results

Fifty-seven persons were enrolled; 8 received placebo and an additional 8 persons were considered to be nonsusceptible on the basis of being secretor negative. Twenty-one persons were infected (all blood group O or A), and 67% of those infected developed viral gastroenteritis. The 50% human infectious dose was calculated to be 3.3 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction units (approximately 1320 genomic equivalents [gEq]) for secretor-positive blood group O or A persons and 7.0 (approximately 2800 gEq) for all secretor-positive persons. The time of illness onset was inversely correlated with inoculum dose. The maximal concentration of virus shedding was higher for persons with gastroenteritis. Norwalk virus was identified in 15 of 27 (56%) vomitus samples at a median concentration of 41 000 gEq/mL.

Conclusions

The 50% human infectious dose measured is higher than previous estimates and similar to that of other RNA viruses. Clinical Trials RegistrationNCT00138476.

### Clinical manifestation of norovirus gastroenteritis in health care settings [^111vwnnH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Noroviruses are generally believed to cause relatively mild gastroenteritis of short duration in otherwise healthy adults. However, outbreaks in health care settings are common and affect vulnerable populations. During 2002–2003, a total of 4 major hospitals, 11 community hospitals, and 135 nursing homes in the county of Avon, England, were prospectively monitored for outbreaks of gastroenteritis. For 482 hospital staff, 166 nursing home staff, and 266 nursing home residents, the median duration of norovirus gastroenteritis was 2 days, with 75% achieving complete recovery within 3 days. The median duration of norovirus gastroenteritis for 730 hospital patients was 3 days (75% of the patients achieved complete recovery within 5 days), which was significantly longer than that for all other groups (P < .001). Therefore, infection in hospitalized persons may be more severe than that in other groups in the community at large. This increased duration of acute illness should be considered when implementing measures to prevent transmission in hospital settings.

Individuals remained in the E compartment for the incubation period duration before moving to 1 of the infectious compartments (at a rate of 1/incubation period duration). Individuals had a probability of being symptomatic, moving to the Is compartment, remaining in the Is compartment until their symptoms resolved, and moving to the Ip compartment (at a rate of 1/symptomatic illness duration). Those who did not experience symptoms moved directly into the Ia compartment. Individuals stayed in the Ia compartment for their viral shedding duration (i.e. infectious period duration), whereas individuals stayed in the Ip compartment for the remainder of their viral shedding duration after their symptoms resolve (i.e. total viral shedding duration minus symptomatic illness duration). After the viral shedding duration ended, individuals in the Ip and Ia compartments moved to the R compartment, remaining there for the duration of the simulation (although the duration and degree of natural immunity is not well understood, it is thought to last for at least a year). Each day, any individual could die (i.e. all-cause mortality), moving to the D compartment. Additionally, those in the Is compartment could die from norovirus illness, moving to the D compartment at a rate equivalent to the probability of norovirus-associated mortality. Each day, new susceptible individuals entered the population in the group aged 0–4 years to maintain a stable population size (i.e. births equal deaths).

Vaccination was modeled to prevent disease (i.e. symptomatic illness), following a challenge study showing that an intramuscular vaccine reduced clinical symptomsand protected for a year (following natural immunity). Vaccinated individuals could become exposed and move to the E compartment; however, at the end of the incubation period, they had a lower probability of developing symptomatic infection (i.e. attenuated by vaccine efficacy). Thus, vaccinated individuals in the E compartment moved to the Ia compartment based on the probability of asymptomatic infection and vaccine efficacy, where they could actively transmit for the viral shedding duration before moving to the R compartment.

Each individual with symptomatic norovirus had probabilities of seeking medical care (i.e. outpatient or ambulatory care visits) and hospitalization. Additionally, each symptomatic individual had a probability of missing productive days (e.g. work or school) for a given duration. Those who were vaccinated had a probability of experiencing side effects (e.g. acute gastroenteritis), which were assumed to last the same duration as symptomatic norovirus illness.

### General information about norovirus… [^112Nxmb7]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

General Information about Norovirus General Information about Norovirus Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause gastroenteritis in people. Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines, causing an acute onset of severe vomiting and diarrhea. Norovirus illness is usually brief in people who are otherwise healthy. Young children, the elderly, and people with other medical illnesses are most at risk for more severe or prolonged infection. Like all viral infections, noroviruses are not affected by treatment with antibiotics. Norovirus infections spread very rapidly. Healthcare facilities and other institutional settings are particularly at-risk for outbreaks because of increased person-to-person contact. For more images of this bacterium, search the Public Health Image Library.

Symptoms of Norovirus The symptoms of norovirus illness usually include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Sometimes people also have a low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness. People may suddenly feel very sick and vomit frequently or have several episodes of diarrhea, but most people get better within 1 or 2 days and they have no long-term health effects related to their illness. Diarrhea is more common in children and vomiting is more common in adults. In some cases, people are unable to drink enough liquids to replace the liquids they lost because of frequent vomiting and diarrhea. This is called dehydration — the loss of a great deal of water from their body. Symptoms of dehydration include decreased urination, dry mouth and throat, and dizziness when standing up. In these cases, patients may be hospitalized and often given fluids through a tube placed in a vein.

Transmission of Norovirus Noroviruses are found in the feces and vomit of infected people. This virus is very contagious and can spread rapidly throughout healthcare facilities. People can become infected with the virus in several ways:

- Having direct contact with another person who is infected
- Eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus
- Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus, and then touching your mouth or other food items. Prevention of Norovirus In a healthcare facility, patients with suspected norovirus may be placed in private rooms or share rooms with other patients with the same infection. Additional prevention measures in healthcare facilities can decrease the chance of coming in contact with noroviruses:.
