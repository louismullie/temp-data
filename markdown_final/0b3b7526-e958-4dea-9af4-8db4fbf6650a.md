## Question

When should naloxone 0.4 mg IV be given versus 2 mg for opioid reversal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to give naloxone 0.4 mg IV versus 2 mg IV for opioid reversal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory anchor and what the FDA label allows. Then, I should assess clinical severity, opioid tolerance, and suspected opioid class, especially fentanyl and nitazenes. Next, I will integrate titration strategy, adverse-event tradeoffs, and monitoring for re-narcotization. Finally, I should cover special situations like postoperative partial reversal, buprenorphine exposures, neonatal dosing, and out-of-hospital protocols, and end with a concise practical summary and linkage-to-care plan [^115npDGW] [^115aT8vt] [^116nZA5q].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline so I don't jump to conclusions. The FDA labeling permits an initial IV dose of naloxone ranging from 0.4 mg to 2 mg and emphasizes that naloxone's duration is often shorter than the implicated opioid, requiring repeated dosing and continued surveillance; infusions may be used when needed [^115npDGW] [^115aT8vt] [^111vrGa9]. I need to ensure my recommendations stay within that labeled range while being clinically tailored to the presentation and suspected opioid [^115npDGW].

> Now, I will consider clinical severity and opioid tolerance, because that usually drives whether I start at 0.4 mg IV. In an opioid‑dependent patient with mild‑to‑moderate ventilatory depression, starting low and titrating minimizes precipitated withdrawal and agitation; some ED case series even show success with 0.04–0.12 mg titrated IV, though the labeled minimum is 0.4 mg and the case-series evidence quality is limited, so I should verify that this approach is used in monitored settings with a clear titration plan [^111Z69RV] [^115npDGW]. Hold on, I should also review the adverse-event signal: a systematic review found lower adverse events with low-dose strategies compared with standard-dose 0.4–2 mg, which supports starting at the lowest effective dose in tolerant patients when time allows [^114GksWL]. This aligns with the "Goldilocks" dosing principle of starting modestly and titrating to effect, balancing under-reversal and over-antagonism [^116nZA5q].

> Next, I will address when to start at 2 mg IV up front. If there is moderate‑to‑severe respiratory depression or an unknown opioid with high pretest probability of fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, a 2 mg IV bolus can be justified to rapidly restore ventilation, because outbreaks suggest that 0.4 mg often fails and that total doses in the several‑milligram range are frequently required in fentanyl exposures [^114dNgLU]. Wait, let me verify mechanistic plausibility: fentanyls' micro‑pharmacokinetics and lipid solubility may create local conditions that hinder rapid antagonist competition, which helps explain why higher or repeated doses are often necessary without contradicting equilibrium pharmacology principles [^115ZXZWv]. So, in high‑severity or suspected fentanyl cases, 2 mg IV as an initial dose is reasonable, with readiness to repeat quickly if needed within labeled practice [^115npDGW].

> I should double‑check escalation and cumulative dosing. If there is an inadequate response after the initial dose, repeating at 2–3 minute intervals and escalating the cumulative dose toward 10 mg is a commonly used upper threshold in clinical protocols for undifferentiated overdoses; to be precise, that explicit 10 mg ceiling comes from contemporary reviews and practice summaries rather than the core label language, so I need to cite those accordingly and not overstate the label itself [^112BZMz1] [^115npDGW]. But wait, what about safety at higher doses? A retrospective ED series did not find increased pulmonary complications with higher total naloxone doses, which is reassuring, though I still aim for the lowest effective dose to avoid severe withdrawal and cardiovascular stress, especially in opioid‑dependent patients [^112Vv7XM] [^114GksWL]. In community or out‑of‑hospital settings where titration is harder, 2 mg IM/IN or 4 mg IN formulations are standard and practical, with repeated dosing every 2–3 minutes until ventilation improves [^11227LeZ] [^114dNgLU].

> Let me now think about the postoperative or procedural use case where partial reversal is desired. For patients who still need analgesia, labeled guidance supports 0.1–0.2 mg IV increments every 2–3 minutes to achieve adequate ventilation while preserving some analgesia, and intraoperative studies support that low-dose naloxone can mitigate opioid adverse effects without abolishing analgesia, reinforcing a small‑increment titration strategy here [^111cNJot] [^114nj95T]. I need to ensure we avoid overshooting in these cases to prevent abrupt pain escalation and hemodynamic stress [^111cNJot].

> Administration technique and immediate monitoring are crucial, so I will review them carefully. Naloxone IV should be pushed over roughly 30–60 seconds with reassessment within 1–2 minutes for respiratory rate, oxygenation, and mental status; if response is inadequate, repeat doses at 2–3 minute intervals while preparing for airway support and considering alternative causes if reversal fails at higher cumulative doses [^115npDGW] [^112BZMz1]. Hold on, let me verify the adverse‑event tradeoff one more time: ED data suggest that lower initial doses lead to fewer adverse events without a clear increase in redosing needs, supporting a titration mindset whenever feasible and safe [^114GksWL].

> I need to be ready to manage precipitated withdrawal if it occurs after a higher initial dose. Signs include agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, piloerection, yawning, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping; the immediate step is to slow or pause further naloxone administration and provide supportive care, only giving additional naloxone if respiratory depression recurs, recognizing that abrupt and complete reversal increases withdrawal risk in opioid‑dependent patients and can be dangerous in neonates [^111vrGa9]. Let me reconsider benzodiazepine use: they may be used judiciously for severe agitation but can worsen respiratory depression, so they should be used with caution and close monitoring while prioritizing airway and ventilation [^111vrGa9].

> Next, I should review strategies for long‑acting opioids and re‑narcotization because this often drives the need for infusions. When reversal is achieved but respiratory depression recurs as naloxone wears off, repeat boluses or a continuous infusion titrated to respiratory drive are appropriate; this is particularly relevant for methadone, extended‑release formulations, and partial agonists, and patients require prolonged observation given naloxone's shorter half‑life [^115npDGW] [^111vrGa9]. For buprenorphine specifically, I need to check the evidence: higher doses and infusions are often required, with volunteer data suggesting a window where 2–4 mg followed by infusion can reverse respiratory depression, albeit more slowly than with full agonists, and mechanical ventilation support may be needed if reversal remains incomplete [^115dLBrP] [^111vrGa9].

> Special populations and settings require tailored dosing, so I will examine them carefully. For neonatal opioid exposure, the label recommends 0.01 mg/kg IV initially, with escalation to 0.1 mg/kg if needed, while vigilantly monitoring for life‑threatening withdrawal; for postoperative partial reversal in adults, very small increments as above are preferred; and for renal impairment, no naloxone dose adjustment is required by labeling, which simplifies emergent care considerations [^111cNJot] [^117Xpthq]. In out‑of‑hospital care, practical products are 2 mg or 4 mg IN and IM autoinjectors with repeated dosing every 2–3 minutes; recent comparative data suggest IM can restore breathing with fewer doses than IN in fentanyl‑induced apnea, though both routes are acceptable and used widely in the community [^11227LeZ] [^114mPTyx]. Wait, I initially cited a Medicare high‑dose opioid risk study as b64c7c92; let me double‑check the reference ID spelling before I rely on it for tolerance‑related caution — yes, it is b6407c92, and it supports targeted naloxone access and the reality that many chronic‑opioid patients are at overdose risk, reinforcing my preference for 0.4 mg IV starts with careful titration in tolerant patients [^115fCQbB].

> To avoid confusion, I will explicitly summarize the 0.4 mg IV versus 2 mg IV decision so nothing gets lost in translation. If the patient is likely opioid‑tolerant with mild‑to‑moderate respiratory depression, start with 0.4 mg IV and titrate in small increments to minimize precipitated withdrawal and cardiovascular stress, recognizing that even smaller aliquots are possible in monitored ED settings per limited evidence; if the patient has severe respiratory compromise or the exposure is unknown with a high likelihood of fentanyl or other potent synthetics, start with 2 mg IV to more rapidly restore ventilation, then repeat and escalate every 2–3 minutes as needed while preparing advanced airway support if there is inadequate response [^114GksWL] [^111Z69RV] [^114dNgLU] [^115npDGW]. But wait, I should verify the cumulative dose advice once more: escalating up to around 10 mg total before reconsidering the diagnosis is common in protocols and review articles, after which non‑opioid etiologies should be strongly considered or advanced ventilatory support continued as indicated [^112BZMz1].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation, observation, and linkage to care are not overlooked. I should document total dose, route, timing, clinical response, and adverse effects; observe for at least a few hours after the last naloxone dose with longer monitoring for long‑acting opioids; provide overdose education and dispense or prescribe take‑home naloxone; and arrange follow‑up or warm handoff for addiction treatment, consistent with harm‑reduction and ASAM guidance, noting that OTC availability expands access but does not replace comprehensive overdose education and linkage strategies [^115npDGW] [^116nZA5q] [^116HPtYE] [^111nZKSX]. Hold on, I should verify that the education piece includes first‑aid and airway emphasis and cautious titration messaging where feasible — that is indeed highlighted in the Goldilocks dosing framework for the current synthetic‑opioid era [^116nZA5q].

Use IV naloxone 0.4 mg as the initial dose for most opioid overdoses, titrating every 2–3 minutes [^115aT8vt] to restore breathing while minimizing withdrawal [^115npDGW] [^111Z69RV]. Use IV naloxone 2 mg when there is severe respiratory depression [^115aT8vt] or suspected high-potency synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl) [^114mPTyx] that may require higher doses for reversal [^114dNgLU]. Always titrate to effect [^116nZA5q] and monitor for recurrence, as naloxone's duration may be shorter than the opioid's [^115npDGW] [^111vrGa9].

## Clinical scenarios for 0.4 mg IV naloxone

Use the 0.4 mg IV dose in the following scenarios:

- **Standard opioid overdose**: Typical heroin, morphine, or oxycodone overdoses with moderate respiratory depression [^115npDGW] [^114hGKA1].

- **Opioid-dependent patients**: To avoid precipitated withdrawal, start low [^111vrGa9] and titrate [^111Z69RV].

- **Postoperative opioid reversal**: Titrate 0.1–0.2 mg increments every 2–3 minutes to adequate ventilation and alertness [^111cNJot].

- **General titration strategy**: Start low [^116nZA5q] and titrate every 2–3 minutes until adequate ventilation is achieved [^115npDGW].

---

## Clinical scenarios for 2 mg IV naloxone

Use the 2 mg IV dose in the following scenarios:

- **Severe respiratory depression**: Apnea [^114mPTyx] or near-apnea requiring rapid reversal [^115npDGW].

- **High-potency synthetic opioids**: Suspected fentanyl or analogs that often need higher doses [^114dNgLU] [^112BZMz1].

- **Unknown opioid exposure**: Severe depression when the opioid is unknown and rapid reversal is critical [^115npDGW] [^115aT8vt].

- **Partial agonist overdose**: Buprenorphine [^115dLBrP] or pentazocine may require higher or repeated doses [^111vrGa9].

## Risks and benefits of 0.4 mg vs. 2 mg doses

| **Aspect** | **0.4 mg** | **2 mg** |
|-|-|-|
| Benefits | - Lower withdrawal risk [^114GksWL] <br/> - Preserves analgesia [^111cNJot] <br/> - Suitable for opioid-dependent patients [^111Z69RV] | - Rapid reversal of severe depression [^115aT8vt] <br/> - Effective for potent synthetics [^114dNgLU] [^114mPTyx] |
| Risks | - May be insufficient for potent synthetics [^114dNgLU] [^114mPTyx] <br/> - May require repeated dosing [^115npDGW] | - Higher withdrawal risk [^111vrGa9] <br/> - Potential cardiovascular stress [^111cNJot] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 0.4–2 mg IV, titrated every 2–3 minutes to effect [^115aT8vt] [^115npDGW].

- **Opioid-dependent patients**: Start at 0.04–0.1 mg [^111Z69RV] and titrate to avoid withdrawal [^111vrGa9].

- **High-potency synthetics**: Consider higher initial doses (up to 2 mg) [^115aT8vt] and repeat as needed [^114dNgLU] [^112BZMz1].

- **Postoperative reversal**: Titrate 0.1–0.2 mg increments every 2–3 minutes [^111cNJot].

## Patient-specific factors influencing dose selection

Opioid tolerance can necessitate higher naloxone doses, whereas dependence favors lower, carefully titrated dosing [^111Z69RV] [^116nZA5q]. Cardiovascular comorbidities warrant cautious titration to avoid stress [^111vrGa9] [^111cNJot]. Elderly patients may require lower, carefully titrated doses because of comorbidities and sensitivity. High-potency synthetic opioid exposures often require higher initial doses [^114dNgLU] [^114mPTyx].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring is essential to detect recurrent respiratory depression [^115npDGW], because naloxone's effect may be shorter than the opioid's [^11227LeZ]. If respiratory depression recurs, administer additional doses [^111cNJot] or initiate an infusion [^115npDGW]. Also monitor for and treat withdrawal symptoms, especially in opioid-dependent patients [^111vrGa9].

---

Use 0.4 mg IV naloxone for most overdoses, titrating to effect [^111Z69RV], and reserve 2 mg IV for severe depression or suspected high-potency synthetics [^114dNgLU]; always titrate and monitor for recurrence [^115npDGW] and withdrawal [^111vrGa9].

### Reversal of opioid-induced ventilatory depression using low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg): a case series [^111Z69RV]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naloxone is commonly administered in the emergency department (ED) to reverse opioid intoxication. Several naloxone dose recommendations exist for the acute management of opioid intoxication based on limited published clinical data. A case series of ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression that was reversed using a low-dose naloxone (0.04 mg with titration) is presented.

- **Methods**: ED patients with opioid-induced ventilatory depression requiring naloxone administration were identified through medical toxicology consultation. A retrospective review of medical records was performed. Collected data included history and pre- and post-naloxone information, such as respiratory rate (RR), pulse oximetry (pulse ox), end-tidal CO2 level (ET-CO2), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS).

- **Results**: Fifteen ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression (median RR, 6 breaths/min) who were managed using a low-dose naloxone strategy were identified. Twelve of the fifteen patients reported ingestion of methadone (range, 30 to 180 mg). The median naloxone dose of 0.08 mg (range, 0.04 to 0.12 mg) reversed opioid-induced ventilatory and CNS depression. Two patients experienced acute opioid withdrawal after receiving 0.08 mg.

- **Conclusion**: ED patients with moderate to severe opioid-induced ventilatory depression can be reversed using 0.04 mg IV naloxone with appropriate dose titration.

### Misuse of novel synthetic opioids: A deadly new trend [^114dNgLU]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Naloxone is a competitive μ-opioid receptor antagonist, which serves as an effective antidote for opioid overdose. The recommended initial dose of naloxone is 0.4 to 2 mg; however, it is known that doses of 10 to 20 mg may be required to reverse the effects of potent synthetic opioids. Emergency department data from a fentanyl outbreak in Chicago during 2005 to 2006 revealed that the standard 0.4 mg naloxone dose was only successful in reversing 15% of cases, and the mean naloxone dose required for rescue was 3.36 mg. Despite initial naloxone doses exceeding 2 mg, no withdrawal symptoms or other adverse effects were noted in this study.

Given these data and the increasing prevalence of IMF and NSO, it seems logical to increase the standard initial naloxone dose from 0.4 to 2 mg. Currently, there are two forms of naloxone available for emergency use in community settings: an intramuscular autoinjector manufactured by Kaléo Pharma and a 4 mg nasal spray manufactured by Adapt Pharma. Kaléo received US FDA approval on October 19, 2016, to begin manufacturing a 2 mg autoinjector, and this has recently replaced its 0.4 mg formulation. Concerns have been raised regarding the efficacy of intranasal naloxone in reversing overdose from synthetic opioids. However, the basis for such concerns involved a 2 mg dosage, and the formulation for intranasal delivery is 4 mg. A randomized controlled trial comparing intranasal and intramuscular naloxone of the same dosage for suspected heroin overdose concluded similar efficacy, and both routes could be used as first-line treatment.

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^115npDGW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naloxone hydrochloride injection may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. The most rapid onset of action is achieved by intravenous administration, which is recommended in emergency situations. Since the duration of action of some opioids may exceed that of naloxone, the patient should be kept under continued surveillance. Repeated doses of naloxone should be administered as necessary.

- **Intravenous infusion**: Naloxone hydrochloride injection may be diluted for intravenous infusion in normal saline or 5% dextrose solutions. The addition of 2 mg of naloxone in 500 mL of either solution provides a concentration of 0.004 mg/mL. Mixtures should be used within 24 hours. After 24 hours, the remaining unused mixture must be discarded. The rate of administration should be titrated in accordance with the patient's response. Naloxone hydrochloride injection should not be mixed with preparations containing bisulfite, metabisulfite, long-chain or high molecular weight anions, or any solution having an alkaline pH. No drug or chemical agent should be added to naloxone hydrochloride injection unless its effect on the chemical and physical stability of the solution has first been established.

- **General**: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit.

- **Usage in adults - Opioid overdose (known or suspected)**: An initial dose of 0.4 mg to 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride may be administered intravenously.

### Intraoperative naloxone reduces remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia but not pain: a randomized controlled trial [^114nj95T]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). High credibility.

The intraoperative use of a high dose of remifentanil may induce postoperative hyperalgesia. Low-dose naloxone can selectively reverse some adverse effects of opioids without compromising analgesia. We hypothesized that the intraoperative use of a high dose of remifentanil combined with a low-dose naloxone infusion reduces postoperative hyperalgesia compared with the use of remifentanil alone.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery were randomly assigned into one of three groups. These groups were categorized based on the intraoperative effect-site concentration of remifentanil, with or without a continuous infusion of naloxone: 4 ng/ml remifentanil with 0.05 μg/kg/h naloxone in the high-remifentanil with naloxone group, and 4 or 1 ng/ml remifentanil with a placebo in the high- or low-remifentanil groups, respectively. We measured the pain thresholds (primary outcome) to mechanical stimuli using von Frey filaments and the incidence of hyperalgesia on the peri-incisional area 24 hours after surgery. Pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and adverse events were also measured up to 48 hours after surgery.

- **Results**: The pain threshold, presented as von Frey numbers [median (interquartile range)], was significantly lower in the high-remifentanil group (n = 31) than in the high-remifentanil with naloxone (n = 30) and the low-remifentanil (n = 30) groups [3.63 (3.22–3.84) vs. 3.84 (3.76–4.00) vs. 3.80 (3.69–4.08), P = 0.011]. The incidence of hyperalgesia was also higher in the high-remifentanil group than in the other groups [21/31 vs. 10/30 vs. 9/30, P = 0.005].

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^113Y4nfv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naloxone hydrochloride is effective in the complete or partial reversal of opioid depression, counteracting effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Additionally, it can reverse the psychotomimetic and dysphoric effects of agonist-antagonists like pentazocine.

As an essentially pure opioid antagonist, naloxone hydrochloride does not possess the agonistic or morphine-like properties typical of other opioid antagonists. When administered in usual doses and absent any opioids or agonistic effects from other opioid antagonists, it exhibits essentially no pharmacologic activity.

Notably, naloxone hydrochloride does not produce tolerance or cause physical or psychological dependence. However, it can induce withdrawal symptoms in the presence of physical dependence on opioids. Opioid withdrawal symptoms may appear shortly after administration and last approximately two hours. The severity and duration of withdrawal are related to the naloxone hydrochloride dose and the degree and type of opioid dependence.

Although the precise mechanism of action of naloxone hydrochloride is not fully understood, in vitro evidence indicates it antagonizes opioid effects by competing for the mu, kappa, and sigma opiate receptor sites in the central nervous system, with the strongest affinity for the mu receptor.

When administered intravenously, the onset of action of naloxone hydrochloride is generally rapid.

### Morphine sulfate [^115pouNW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration instructions**: Morphine sulfate tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of morphine sulfate tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with morphine sulfate tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments.

- **Patient access to naloxone for opioid overdose**: Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose.

### Naloxone reversal of morphine- and morphine-6-glucuronide-induced respiratory depression in healthy volunteers: A mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling study [^114hGKA1]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced respiratory depression is antagonized effectively by the competitive opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. However, to fully understand the complex opioid agonist-antagonist interaction, the effects of various naloxone doses on morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G)-induced respiratory depression were studied in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four subjects received 0.15 mg/kg morphine intravenously at t = 0 followed by placebo, 200 or 400 microg naloxone at t = 30 min. Thirty-two subjects received 0.3 mg/kg M6G intravenously at t = 0 followed by placebo, 25, 100, or 400 microg naloxone at t = 55 min. There were a total of 8 subjects per treatment group. Respiration was measured on a breath-to-breath basis at constant end-tidal Pco2. A mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model consisting of a part describing biophase equilibration and a part describing receptor association-dissociation kinetics was used to analyze the data.

- **Results**: Naloxone reversal of M6G-induced respiratory depression developed more slowly than reversal of the respiratory effect of morphine. A simulation study revealed that this was related to the slower receptor association-dissociation kinetics of M6G (koff M6G = 0.0327 ± 0.00455 min versus morphine 0.138 ± 0.0148 min; values are typical ± SE). The duration of naloxone reversal was longer for M6G. This was related to the three-to-fourfold greater potency of naloxone as an antagonist against M6G compared with morphine. Increasing the naloxone dose had no effect on the speed of reversal, but it did extend the duration.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^113UK5Du]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

To explore the pharmacokinetics of repeated administration, intranasal (i.n.) bioavailability relative to intramuscular (i.m.) as reported above is in the range of 47–51%. Hence, a 2:1 dose ratio (i.n.:i.m.) was assumed for the simulations. This involved comparing cumulative 2 × 2 mg i.n. doses administered at 3-minute intervals with five cumulative 0.4 mg i.m. doses administered at the same intervals, totaling 2 mg i.m.

Figure 3 demonstrates that the peak plasma level from the observed 2 mg i.n. dose occurs between those from the observed i.m. 0.4 mg dose and the simulated 2 mg i.m. dose (5 × 0.4 mg administered 3 minutes apart). This simulation suggests that, in a hypothetical overdose scenario, a second dose of 2 mg i.n. administered after 3 minutes would expose the patient to approximately the same plasma naloxone levels, in terms of both initial rise and peak, as five consecutive i.m. 0.4 mg doses (also 3 minutes apart), totaling 2 mg.

In addition, the plasma naloxone levels from the simulated 2 × 2 mg i.n. dose declined more slowly than the simulated 0.4 mg i.m. administrations, indicating that plasma naloxone concentrations would be sustained for longer than those from i.m. dosing.

### How the complex pharmacology of the fentanyls contributes to their lethality [^115ZXZWv]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

There is increasing awareness that respiratory depression caused by fentanyls is more challenging to reverse with naloxone compared to other opioids such as heroin, often necessitating multiple or higher doses of naloxone. The reason for this is unclear and has been mistakenly attributed to the high affinity of fentanyls for binding at the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). It is a fundamental principle of pharmacology that, under equilibrium-competitive conditions, the degree of antagonism observed depends solely on the antagonist's affinity and concentration and is independent of the agonist's binding affinity. This means agonists with different affinities should be reversed equally. The difficulty in reversing fentanyls may indicate that their high lipid solubility results in atypical micro-pharmacokinetic profiles that enhance the agonist:antagonist concentration ratio near the receptors, preventing equilibrium competition. Alternatively, it could be that they interact with MOR in a unique way that reduces naloxone's ability to displace them.

In treating heroin overdose, the goal is to administer a low dose of naloxone, sufficient to reverse respiratory depression without causing withdrawal symptoms. Additional doses of naloxone can be given if respiration fails to recover. When a fentanyl overdose is suspected, it may be necessary to rapidly increase the naloxone dose to reverse the respiratory depression.

Tolerance develops to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids. Cross-tolerance develops between opioid drugs acting at the same receptor, but the degree of cross-…

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^112R6yAt]. Addiction (2018). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetic profiles**: PK parameters are shown in Table 1. Mean plasma naloxone concentrations during the first 2 hours post-dosing are displayed in Figure 1 (left-hand side), including an expanded depiction of the first 20 minutes (right-hand side).

- **Plasma concentration following i.v. administration**: A dose of 0.4 mg spiked and reached an early peak (geometric mean C max 5.94 ng/ml, median T max 2 minutes), followed by a rapid decline during the next 10 minutes and a gradual decline thereafter.

- **Plasma concentration following i.m. administration**: The i.m. administration (0.4 mg) showed more gradual early uptake, with a lower and later peak (geometric mean C max 1.27 ng/ml, median T max 10 minutes), and a flatter, slower decline thereafter. Overall AUCt-based exposure was comparable for i.m. and i.v.

- **Plasma concentration following i.n. administration**: All i.n. doses (1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg) achieved maximum plasma levels within 15–30 minutes (median T max). Geometric mean C max values for 1 mg i.n. (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg i.n. (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg i.n. (6.02 ng/ml) were greater than for i.m.

For all three i.n. doses, geometric mean AUCt values (2.56–10.01 h × ng/ml) exceeded those of 0.4 mg i.m. and i.v. (both: 2.01 h × ng/ml). Of the three i.n. doses, the 2 mg dose followed the 0.4 mg i.m. curve most closely during the first 10 minutes post-dose, reached blood levels at twice the 0.4 mg i.m. dose by 15 minutes, and maintained blood levels at more than twice the 0.4 mg i.m. dose for the next 2 hours.

### Nebulized naloxone gently and effectively reverses methadone intoxication [^115m4kEW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with lethargy and respiratory depression after ingesting methadone. Initial oxygen saturation was 61% on room air and did not improve with supplemental oxygenation. As venous access was initially unobtainable, naloxone was administered by nebulizer. Within 5 minutes, oxygen saturation reached 100% and mental status returned to normal. The patient did not develop severe withdrawal symptoms. Naloxone hydrochloride has been administered by various routes to treat opioid toxicity. This report describes the successful use of nebulized naloxone for methadone toxicity.

### Management of suspected opioid overdose with naloxone in out-of-hospital settings: A systematic review [^114DbbWh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Naloxone is effective for reversing opioid overdose, but optimal strategies for out-of-hospital use are uncertain.

- **Purpose**: To synthesize evidence on the effects of naloxone route of administration and dosing for suspected opioid overdose in out-of-hospital settings on mortality, reversal of overdose, and harms, and the need for transport to a health care facility after reversal of overdose with naloxone.

- **Data sources**: Ovid MEDLINE (1946 through September 2017), PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) materials, and reference lists.

- **Study selection**: English-language cohort studies and randomized trials that compared different doses of naloxone, administration routes, or transport versus nontransport after reversal of overdose with naloxone were selected. Main outcomes were mortality, reversal of overdose, recurrence of overdose, and harms.

- **Data extraction**: Dual extraction and quality assessment of individual studies were conducted, along with a consensus assessment of overall strength of evidence (SOE).

- **Data synthesis**: Of 13 eligible studies, 3 randomized controlled trials and 4 cohort studies compared different administration routes. At the same dose (2 mg), one trial found similar efficacy between higher-concentration intranasal naloxone (2 mg/mL) and intramuscular naloxone, and one trial found that lower-concentration intranasal naloxone (2 mg/5 mL) was less effective than intramuscular naloxone but was associated with decreased risk for agitation (low SOE). Evidence was insufficient to evaluate other comparisons of route of administration.

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^115fCQbB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

Approximately one‐fourth of Medicare MTM‐eligible patients with chronic opioid use were prescribed daily MME ≥ 50. Patients on higher opioid doses were more likely to utilize specific central nervous system (CNS) active medications compared to patients with lower chronic opioid doses. Almost 1 in 4 patients with chronic opioid use utilized ≥ 4 CNS active medications. Furthermore, this study found potential underprescribing of naloxone over a two‐year period. Patients receiving chronic high‐dose opioid therapy were likely to be < 85 years of age, male, and with ≥ 17 medications. Targeted medication reviews can identify patients at risk for adverse events and increase opportunities to improve access to naloxone among patients prescribed chronic opioid therapy.

### Buprenorphine and naloxone [^116X7Yhe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The "very low" dose (1 mg solution) would be less than a tablet dose of 2 mg; the "low" dose (4 mg solution) approximates a 6 mg tablet dose; the "moderate" dose (8 mg solution) approximates a 12 mg tablet dose; and the "high" dose (16 mg solution) approximates a 24 mg tablet dose.

The safety of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film during treatment induction is supported by a clinical trial involving 16 patients treated with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, and 18 treated with a buprenorphine-only sublingual film. Few differences in the adverse event profiles were noted between buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film and the buprenorphine-only sublingual film.

- **Most common adverse events**: The most common adverse event occurring during treatment induction and the three days following induction using buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film was restlessness. Other adverse events included anxiety, piloerection, stomach discomfort, irritability, headache, rhinorrhea, cold sweat, arthralgia, and increased lacrimation.

Four subjects left the study early on the first day of sublingual film administration. However, there was no evidence to suggest that any of the four subjects experienced precipitated withdrawal secondary to the administration of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual films.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a consistent pattern.

### Naloxone dosing in the era of synthetic opioids: Applying the Goldilocks principle [^116nZA5q]. Addiction (2025). High credibility.

The opioid overdose epidemic remains a critical public health crisis. In recent years, synthetic opioids like fentanyl and nitazenes have driven a sharp rise in deaths. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, has been established as a key intervention for reversing opioid overdoses and saving lives. However, there remains a critical need to optimize naloxone dosing strategies.

This article examines the challenges of both under-dosing and over-antagonism in naloxone administration, emphasizing the importance of a tailored approach to overdose management. A 'just the right dose' approach is essential for minimizing the risks of over-antagonism while still reversing opioid overdose. This involves starting with a modest naloxone dose and carefully titrating it based on the patient's response, considering factors such as opioid type, overdose severity, and opioid tolerance.

A tailored approach to naloxone dosing may present challenges for non-medically trained responders, but it can ensure that as many people as possible receive the right dose of naloxone when they need it. Training programs should also emphasize the importance of first aid and supportive care, including airway management and alerting emergency services, as well as careful monitoring of the patient's response.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^115dM434]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Our particular focus has been the study of concentrated naloxone nasal spray to identify a dose and formulation comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) 0.4 mg and similarly appropriate for dose-titration, as recommended currently for the i.m. dose. Our exploratory dose simulations indicate that a 2 mg intranasal (i.n.) dose provides an opportunity for titration, with administration of a second 2 mg i.n. dose resulting in naloxone exposure similar to a series of five i.m. 0.4 mg doses (i.e. 2 mg i.m. in total). Such an i.n. schedule would straddle the overall dose range of an 'initial [injectable] dose between 0.4 mg–2 mg', as recommended by the WHO.

- **Advantages of incremental dose titration**: The possibility of incremental dose titration presents distinct advantages, as it could significantly reduce the risk of adverse reactions. High initial naloxone doses may trigger severe sudden-onset opioid withdrawal. A recent qualitative analysis of cases of heroin/opioid overdose reversals identified apparent excessive naloxone dosing ('over-antagonism'), sometimes triggering patient self-discharge and active further drug-seeking. In addition to pharmacological toxicity, such 'behavioral toxicity' needs to be considered. Withdrawal symptoms can be particularly challenging for overdose witnesses to manage in the community setting. Simulation of repeat administration of the 2 mg i.n. dose produced roughly equivalent plasma naloxone levels to a single 4 mg i.n. dose. Administering a single 2 mg i.n. dose at first and following up with a second 2 mg i.n. dose only if needed could lower the risk of naloxone 'over-antagonism' and improve safety.

### Prescribe to prevent: Overdose prevention and naloxone rescue kits for prescribers and pharmacists [^112ZoppE]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

What are common risks for opioid overdose?

Medical providers and pharmacists should understand, explain to patients, and take actions to reduce overdose risk. The following should be considered when assessing a patient's risk.

First, previous nonfatal overdose is associated with future overdose. Second, higher opioid doses, such as daily doses higher than 50 morphine milliequivalents, and changes in dose or formulations increase overdose risk; people who use heroin are thus frequently at risk due to unpredictable changes in substance purity, for example, adulteration with fentanyl. Third, polypharmacy and mixing substances contribute to overdose risk, as opioid overdoses commonly involve other substances. Psychoactive medications of particular concern include barbiturates, stimulants, and benzodiazepines. Other medications that can have synergistically central nervous system depressive effects include clonidine, promethazine, and gabapentin. Fourth, socially isolated individuals who use prescription opioids or heroin alone have little chance of being rescued. Isolation is also associated with depression, which is itself associated with overdose. Fifth, chronic medical illnesses involving organs such as the lung, liver, kidney, and brain — primarily responsible for metabolizing substances and respiration — can compromise the body's ability to handle opioids. Sixth, periods of abstinence, such as periods of incarceration, hospitalization, and medical detoxification, cause reduced opioid tolerance and thus increased overdose risk.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^112BZMz1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Naloxone is an essential tool for reversing opioid overdoses. On the street, it is typically administered via nasal spray or intramuscular/subcutaneous injection by bystanders or first responders. Due to naloxone's short half-life of 30 to 90 minutes, its effectiveness is often limited, necessitating multiple doses to prevent re-narcotization by fentanyl and its synthetic analogues. Patients generally require ongoing monitoring, and naloxone should be administered every 2 to 3 minutes for patients who relapse. Failure to monitor the patient until emergency medical services (EMS) arrive, especially following a high fentanyl or synthetic overdose, could result in death. For patients who relapse after multiple doses, EMS can provide oxygen and additional intravenous doses (if i.v. access is quickly available), with the dosage adjusted based on the patient's response during transport to the hospital.

In a hospital setting, patients receive close monitoring to address potential re-narcotization, especially with long-acting opioids. The precise naloxone dose needed for opioid reversal varies based on the amount and type of opioid ingested, its receptor affinity, the patient's weight and age, comorbidities, and any polysubstance use. Because this information is often unknown, an empirical dosing approach is necessary. For adults, initial doses range from 0.4 mg to 2 mg, with increases every 2 to 3 minutes as needed, up to a total of 10 mg. Patients with rebound toxicity are often moved to the intensive care unit (ICU), where they are administered continuous naloxone infusions.

### Moving naloxone over the counter is necessary but not sufficient [^111nZKSX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is available in numerous formulations and can be easily administered to avert death from opioid overdose. Amid a historic overdose crisis in the United States, naloxone has a crucial role in stemming the loss of life. However, it remains largely inaccessible to the public. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of the first over-the-counter formulation of naloxone. Although this historic change provides an important opportunity to increase the distribution of naloxone, we must take careful steps during this transition so that it does not paradoxically threaten overall access to this life-saving medication.

Specifically, we must ensure that a larger supply of naloxone will meet the newly increased demand at a sustainable price for consumers who are most in need. We must also continue to prioritize comprehensive methods of distribution, such as overdose education and naloxone distribution programs, that serve as important tools to reach the most vulnerable populations. In addition, simultaneous investment in harm-reduction strategies, such as supervised consumption spaces, is critical to ensure that naloxone is available in settings where its life-saving potential can be most fully realized.

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: A randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^114mPTyx]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Severe opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) can be treated with intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) naloxone. It is relevant to compare their efficacy and determine the optimal strategy to restore breathing following OIRD. In this open-label, crossover, one-on-one randomized trial, conducted in a research unit of an academic medical center, we compared the required number of IM (5 mg/0.5 mL) versus IN (4 mg/0.1 mL) naloxone doses following 10 µg/kg intravenous fentanyl-induced apnea in opioid-naïve participants and participants who chronically use an opioid. After 2 min of apnea, IM or IN naloxone was given at 2 min intervals until return of adequate ventilation. The primary outcome was the number of naloxone doses needed to achieve full reversal of breathing. If necessary, rescue intravenous naloxone was administered.

Eighteen opioid-naïve participants were randomized, 16 analyzed. The required median IM naloxone doses were 1.5 (IQR 1–2) versus 2 (1–3) for IN naloxone (p = 0.0002); one participant required rescue naloxone. No serious adverse events occurred. Similarly, in participants who chronically used an opioid, IM was more effective than IN naloxone. In these participants, adverse effects included muscle rigidity in the IN treated participants and mild to moderate withdrawal irrespective of treatment. Here we show the superiority of IM over IN naloxone in the number of doses required for full reversal of breathing following opioid-induced apnea. While the trial shows superiority for IM naloxone with products used in the community, we relate our findings to t

### Do higher doses of naloxone increase the risk of pulmonary complications [^112Vv7XM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although naloxone has proven to be an effective opioid reversal agent, concern that high doses of naloxone can cause pulmonary edema may prevent health care providers from administering it in initial high doses.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine whether increased doses of naloxone are correlated with an increase in pulmonary complications in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after an opioid overdose.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of patients treated with naloxone by emergency medical services (EMS) or in the ED at an urban level I trauma center and three associated freestanding EDs. Data were queried from EMS run reports and the medical record and included demographic characteristics, naloxone dosing, administration route, and pulmonary complications. Patients were grouped by naloxone dose received, defined as low (≤ 2 mg), moderate (> 2 mg to ≤ 4 mg), and high (> 4 mg).

- **Results**: Of the 639 patients included, 13 (2.0%) were diagnosed with a pulmonary complication. There was no difference in the development of pulmonary complications across groups (p = 0.676) or based on the route of administration (p = 0.342). The administration of higher doses of naloxone was not associated with longer hospital stays (p = 0.0327).

- **Conclusions**: Study results suggest that the reluctance of many health care providers to administer larger doses of naloxone on initial treatment may not be warranted. In this investigation, there were no poor outcomes associated with an increase in naloxone administration.

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^114BDPCf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Low credibility.

From an initial sample of 55,951, a total of 4,568 patients were included, of which 3,452 (76%) had a daily MME < 50, and 1,116 (24%) had a daily MME ≥ 50. The majority of patients were ≥ 65 years of age (75%), predominantly female (66%), and had ≥ 4 prescribers (74%) with 1 prescribing opioids (54%). Patients mostly had ≥ 11 unique medications (81%), used 2 pharmacies (58%), and predominantly (80%) resided in regions where more than 10% of households lived below the federal poverty level.

A multivariate logistic regression found age (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.003), and the number of unique medications (p < 0.001) associated with having a daily MME ≥ 50. Patients under 85 years of age compared to those ≥ 85 had 1.57–4.19 times the odds of being prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50. Males were more likely than females to be prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50 (OR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08–1.45, p = 0.003). While the number of medications was significantly associated with being prescribed a daily MME ≥ 50, only patients with ≥ 17 unique medications compared to patients with 8–10 medications had a significant association (OR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.25–1.93, p < 0.001).

### Suboxone [^115SUwwf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Physiologic effects**: Buprenorphine in intravenous (2mg, 4mg, 8mg, 12mg, and 16mg) and sublingual (12mg) doses has been administered to non-dependent subjects to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence. Compared with placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, or skin temperature across time. Notably, systolic BP was higher in the 8mg group than placebo (3-hour AUC values). Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments. Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts. Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.

The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose-ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers. In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4mg and higher than after methadone. Both drugs decreased O2 saturation to the same degree.

- **Effect of naloxone**: Physiologic and subjective effects following acute sublingual administration of SUBOXONE and SUBUTEX tablets were similar at equivalent dose levels of buprenorphine. Naloxone, in the SUBOXONE formulation, had no clinically significant impact.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^113Q96KT]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Systemic side effects of opioid toxicity include life-threatening opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), which can be fatal, especially in opioid-naïve patients. We tested the ability of our prodrugs (15 µmol kg−1; single s.c. dose, n = 6) to reverse OIRD caused by a high dose of fentanyl (LD50 of 3 mg kg−1; single s.c. dose) in naïve male rats using non-invasive whole-body plethysmography. This high dose of fentanyl, over ten times higher than literature reports, was used to mimic the OIRD of potent synthetic opioid analogues.

After the first fentanyl dose, neither the vehicle nor the lipidated naloxone prodrug, C12-E2-Naloxone, reversed OIRD, despite showing hydrolysis in rat plasma. This was expected as lipidation slows the release of prodrug from s.c. tissue. We also had difficulty formulating C12-E2-Naloxone, necessitating doubling the dosing vehicle volume. Two out of six rats in each group died; therefore, we did not proceed with testing the C12-E2-Naloxone prodrug.

Naloxone and the alkyl ester AG10-L-E1-Naloxone provided rapid reversal of OIRD within 5 minutes. For AG10-L-E2-Naloxone, recovery began at 65 minutes, but the Minute Volume did not reach normal levels (55.2 ± 16.6% of baseline at 90 minutes).

### A comparison of intramuscular (Zimhi) and intranasal naloxone (Narcan) in reversal of fentanyl-induced apnea: a randomized, crossover, open-label trial [^113NP722]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this randomized, open-label trial, we compared the number of required IM versus IN naloxone doses in their ability to effectively reverse fentanyl-induced apnea. We studied healthy individuals and a small exploratory sample of participants who use a daily average of 200 MMEs. In both populations, IM naloxone was more effective in reversing fentanyl-induced apnea compared to IN naloxone, without a need for intravenous rescue naloxone. The median times to restoration of ventilation to baseline levels were similar: 2.3 minutes in opioid-naïve individuals and 2.4 minutes in chronic opioid users following IM naloxone. In contrast, IN naloxone administration was not only less effective (i.e. one extra dose was needed) but also required IV rescue naloxone to restore adequate breathing activity in one healthy participant (6.3%) and two participants who use daily opioids (40%), with median recovery times of 3.4 minutes for healthy volunteers and 7.3 minutes for chronic opioid users.

Opioid-induced apnea followed by cardiac arrest results from hypoxia and possibly from direct opioid effects on the heart through an opioid effect on potassium channels. This leads to significant mortality and morbidity given the large number of individuals that abuse potent opioids, particularly in the US and Canada, but certainly also in some other countries. In the US alone, 80,000 people died from an opioid overdose in 2023. Dealing with potent opioid-induced respiratory depression, apnea, and cardiac arrest poses a significant challenge due to the recent substantial increase in the strength of illegally consumed opioids.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^1122KB3F]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: The primary outcome of this study is to identify characteristics of study participants in a large opioid treatment program (OTP) for opioid use disorder (OUD) who used take-home naloxone to perform one or more opioid overdose (OD) reversals in the community.

- **Methods**: This 6-month prospective cohort study provided take-home naloxone and opioid OD education for 287 study participants with OUD. Characteristics associated with the use of the take-home naloxone were determined from among 16 variables using multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: The study participants who had greater odds of using the take-home naloxone to perform OD reversals, compared to those who did not use the take-home naloxone, had the following characteristics:

- **Emergency room care**: They received emergency room care themselves for OD (OR = 4.89, 95% CI 1.54–15.52, P = 0.007).
- **Witnessed overdose**: They previously witnessed someone else OD (OR = 5.67, 95% CI 1.24–25.87, P = 0.025).
- **Drug testing**: They tested positive for two or more illicit substances at their 6-month urine analysis (OR = 5.26, 95% CI 1.58–17.54, P = 0.007) or were missing their 6-month urine analysis (OR = 3.46, 95% CI 1.42–8.43, P = 0.006).
- **Age**: They were less than 30 years old (OR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.02–7.66, P = 0.045).
- **Ethnicity**: They were Hispanic (OR = 3.98, 95% CI 1.41–11.21, P = 0.009).

This study prospectively identified several characteristics of patients enrolled in an OTP with increased odds of using take-home naloxone in their social networks. Future harm reduction efforts may benefit by using these targeted characteristics to identify those most likely to use naloxone in their communities.

### Low-dose naloxone does not improve morphine-induced nausea, vomiting, or pruritus [^114NW5Zs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We tested the hypothesis that low-dose naloxone delivered with intravenous (IV) bolus morphine to emergency department patients in pain would reduce nausea. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. Patients receiving a 0.10 mg/kg morphine IV bolus rated pain, nausea, and pruritus on 100-mm visual analog scales at enrollment and after 20 minutes. Patients were randomized to receive either 0.25 microg/kg naloxone or an equal volume placebo administered with IV morphine.

One hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled, with 99 (76%) treated according to protocol and having sufficient data for analysis. At 20 minutes, the difference between groups (naloxone-placebo) was 1 mm (95% confidence interval, -9 to 11) for nausea, 1 mm (95% CI, -3 to 3) for pruritus, 4% (95% CI, -1 to 9) for vomiting, and 0% (95% CI, -5 to 5) for rescue antiemetics. Pain was significantly reduced in both groups.

The addition of 0.25 microg/kg naloxone to bolus morphine does not improve nausea, pruritus, vomiting, or reduce the use of rescue antiemetics when administered to emergency department patients in pain.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^117AX8X4]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Take-home naloxone can prevent death from heroin/opioid overdose, but pre-provision is difficult because naloxone is usually given by injection. Non-injectable alternatives, including naloxone nasal sprays, are currently being developed. To be effective, the intranasal (i.n.) spray dose must be adequate but not excessive, and early absorption must be comparable to intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We report on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a specially produced concentrated novel nasal spray. The specific aims were to estimate PK profiles of i.n. naloxone, compare early systemic exposure with i.n. versus i.m. naloxone, and estimate i.n. bioavailability.

- **Design**: Open-label, randomized, five-way cross-over PK study.

- **Setting**: Clinical trials facility (Croydon, UK).

- **Participants**: Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (age 20–54 years; 11 female).

- **Intervention and comparator**: Three doses of i.n. (1 mg/0.1 ml, 2 mg/0.1 ml, 4 mg/0.2 ml) versus 0.4 mg i.m. (reference) and 0.4 mg intravenous (i.v.) naloxone.

- **Measurements**: Regular blood samples were taken, with high-frequency sampling during the first 15 minutes to capture early systemic exposure. PK parameters were determined from plasma naloxone concentrations. Exploratory analyses involved the simulation of repeat administration.

Findings indicate that mean peak concentration (C max) values for 1 mg (1.51 ng/ml), 2 mg (2.87 ng/ml), and 4 mg (6.02 ng/ml) i.n. exceeded 0.4 mg i.m. (1.27 ng/ml) naloxone. All three i.n. doses rapidly achieved plasma levels greater than 50% of peak concentrations (T50%) by 10 minutes, peaking at 15–30 minutes.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^111sgCfd]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The results of this study, taken together with other recently published data, provide strong support for the potential value of concentrated intranasal (i.n.) naloxone spray for opioid overdose reversal. Across all three i.n. doses, naloxone exposure was dose-proportional, with approximately 50% absolute bioavailability. We identified the 2 mg/0.1 mL i.n. dose as most similar to the 0.4 mg intramuscular (i.m.) reference, producing comparable early naloxone concentrations. The 2 mg i.n. dose effectively maintained plasma levels for the following 2 hours. In September 2017, following the acceptance of this manuscript but pre-publication, the European Medicines Agency gave a positive opinion to the application for a product license for a 1.8 mg/0.1 mL concentrated naloxone nasal spray under the trade name Nyxoid; 1.8 mg naloxone in Nyxoid is equivalent to 2 mg naloxone hydrochloride.

Clinicians and policymakers will need to consider the potential merits of the different time-course profiles, including the speed of onset and duration of effect, of i.n. versus injectable naloxone. Additionally, there may be implementation advantages with i.n. naloxone for broad-based take-home naloxone provision.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^114sZPXR]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

The lack of correlation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of high-dose naloxone was surprising. Despite significant plasma concentrations of naloxone at 6 hours (25 nM), similar to that from AG10-L-E2-naloxone (21 nM), rats treated with the high naloxone dose performed poorly in plethysmography experiments following a second fentanyl dose, with two rats dying (Figs. 5a, d). These data suggest that high initial levels of naloxone (6498 nM at 15 min) may be harmful, making animals more vulnerable to the toxicity of the second fentanyl dose.

To investigate further, we performed an efficacy study in which we administered fentanyl and high doses of antagonists (naloxone and AG10-L-E2-naloxone) intravenously (60 µmol kg⁻¹; single i.v. dose) (Fig. 5g–i). Before starting our efficacy study, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study on high i.v. doses of naloxone and AG10-L-E2-naloxone (Fig. 5f; 60 µmol kg⁻¹; single i.v. dose) (see Supplementary Table 4). The data showed high early concentrations of both naloxone (20,597 nM at 15 min) and naloxone released from AG10-L-E2-naloxone (1599 nM at 15 min).

- **Pharmacokinetic analysis**: The cutoff time for all time points in the pharmacokinetic study was 24 hours. For the 20 mg kg⁻¹ doses, the C max ratios of i.v./s.c. were 8-fold for naloxone and 500-fold for AG10-L-E2-naloxone, indicating a significant depot effect for AG10-L-E2-naloxone after s.c. dosing due to flip-flop kinetics caused by slower dissolution and gradual absorption.

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^111vrGa9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**:
	Naloxone hydrochloride should be administered cautiously to individuals, including newborns of mothers who are known or suspected to be physically dependent on opioids. In such cases, an abrupt and complete reversal of opioid effects may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome.

- **Drug dependence signs and symptoms**:
		- **General symptoms**: Body aches, diarrhea, tachycardia, fever, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, sweating, yawning, nausea or vomiting, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, shivering or trembling, abdominal cramps, weakness, increased blood pressure.
		- **Neonatal symptoms**: Convulsions, excessive crying, hyperactive reflexes.

- **Repeat administration**: The patient who has satisfactorily responded to naloxone hydrochloride should be kept under continued surveillance. Repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride should be administered as necessary, since the duration of action of some opioids may exceed that of naloxone hydrochloride.

- **Respiratory depression due to other drugs**:
		- **Ineffectiveness**: Naloxone hydrochloride is not effective against respiratory depression due to non-opioid drugs and in the management of acute toxicity caused by levopropoxyphene.
		- **Partial agonists or mixed agonist/antagonists**: Reversal of respiratory depression by partial agonists or mixed agonist/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete or require higher doses of naloxone. If an incomplete response occurs, respirations should be mechanically assisted as clinically indicated.

Additional supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency medical assistance.

- **Dosage forms and strengths**: Nasal spray: 2 mg and 4 mg of naloxone hydrochloride in 0.1 mL.

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to naloxone hydrochloride.

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Risk of respiratory and CNS depression**: Due to the duration of action of naloxone relative to the opioid, keep the patient under continued surveillance and administer repeat doses of naloxone using a new nasal spray with each dose, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance.
	- **Risk of limited efficacy with partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists**: Reversal of respiratory depression caused by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. Larger or repeat doses may be required.
	- **Precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal**: Use in patients who are opioid-dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. Monitor for the development of opioid withdrawal.
	- **Risk of cardiovascular (CV) effects**: Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression may result in adverse CV effects. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had pre-existing CV disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse CV effects. Monitor these patients closely in an appropriate healthcare setting after use of naloxone hydrochloride.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray over first 30 minutes post-dosing: analysis of suitability for opioid overdose reversal [^112W1s9c]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Lack of non-injectable naloxone formulations has impeded widespread take-home provision for the prevention of heroin/opioid overdose deaths. For non-injectable formulations that are finally being investigated, rapid onset of action and sufficient bioavailability will be vital. We present an analysis of data from a study of concentrated naloxone nasal spray formulations. Our aims are to assess (1) pharmacokinetic properties and (2) suitability for overdose reversal in terms of naloxone absorption within 30 minutes post-dosing.

- **Design and interventions/comparator**: Open-label, randomized, four-way crossover Latin-square pharmacokinetic study of naloxone administration by three routes: intranasal at two doses (8 mg/0.4 ml, 16 mg/0.4 ml) versus sublingual (16 mg/ml) versus intravenous reference (1 mg/ml).

- **Setting**: Clinical Pharmacology Unit at The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, USA).

- **Participants**: Twelve healthy volunteers (age 20–41; seven female).

- **Measurements**: From blood plasma naloxone concentrations, (1) standard pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum plasma concentration (C max) and mean absolute bioavailability (F%, relative to intravenous injection), were determined; as well as (2) partial area under the curve (AUC) values, t max (time to maximum plasma concentration), and t 50% (time to 50% of maximum plasma concentration) as measures of early absorption.

- **Findings**: Bioavailability was F% = 25–28% for intranasal naloxone. Sublingual had low bioavailability (F% = 2%) and was not considered further. Mean C max values for 8 mg (12.8…

### High opioid doses, naloxone, and central nervous system active medications received by Medicare-enrolled adults [^113HKkfj]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). High credibility.

A total of 219 providers prescribed naloxone filled by 202 patients. Among these providers, the three most predominant specialties included primary care (n = 74), nurse practitioners or nurse specialists (n = 31), and physicians who specialized in pain medicine and anesthesiology (n = 26). There were 17 pharmacists, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialized physicians, and physician assistants who also prescribed naloxone. Complete information can be found in Table S3 and is illustrated in Figure 2.

### Electronic advisories increase naloxone prescribing across health care settings [^116bZ5dy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Naloxone is a life-saving, yet underprescribed, medication recommended for patients at high risk of opioid overdose. We set out to evaluate the changes in prescriber practices due to the use of an electronic health record (EHR) advisory. This advisory prompted opioid prescribers to co-prescribe naloxone when prescribing a high-dose opioid. It also provided prescribers with guidance on decreasing opioid doses for safety.

This retrospective chart abstraction study looked at all opioid and naloxone prescriptions written as emergency department (ED) discharge, inpatient hospital discharge, or outpatient medications between July 1, 2018, and February 1, 2020. The EHR advisory went live on June 1, 2019. Included in the analysis were all adult patients seen in these settings at a large county hospital and associated outpatient clinics.

We performed an interrupted time series analysis examining naloxone prescriptions and daily opioid dosing in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), before and after the initiation of the EHR advisory. The EHR advisory was associated with changes in prescribers' behavior, leading to increased naloxone prescriptions and decreased prescribed opioid doses.

In conclusion, EHR advisories are an effective systems-level intervention to enhance the safety of prescribed opioids and increase rates of naloxone prescribing.

### Acute opioid withdrawal following intramuscular administration of naloxone 1.6 mg: A prospective out-of-hospital series [^116PxctF]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Large doses of intramuscular (IM) naloxone are commonly used in out-of-hospital settings to reverse opioid toxicity; however, they are used less commonly in hospitals due to concerns about opioid withdrawal, particularly agitation. This study aimed to determine the frequency of severe agitation following a single 1.6 mg IM naloxone dose.

The researchers conducted a prospective study of adult patients (aged > 15 years) treated by an Australian state ambulance service with 1.6 mg IM naloxone for respiratory depression. The primary outcome was severe agitation within 1 hour of naloxone administration. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of presentations with acute opioid withdrawal, characterized by tachycardia (pulse rate > 100 beats/min), hypertension (systolic > 140 mm Hg), vomiting, agitation, seizure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or pulmonary edema. Reversal of respiratory depression was defined by a respiratory rate > 10 breaths/min and saturation > 92% or a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.

From October 2019 to July 2021, there were 197 presentations in 171 patients, with a median age of 41 years (range, 18 to 80 years). Among the total patients, 119 were men (70%). The most commonly used opioids were heroin (131 [66%]), oxycodone (14 [7%]), and morphine (11 [6%]). Severe agitation occurred in 14 (7% [95% confidence interval {CI} 4% to 12%]) of the presentations, and opioid withdrawal occurred in 76 presentations.

### Naloxone hydrochloride [^111cNJot]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

*Postoperative opioid depression*: For the partial reversal of opioid depression following the use of opioids during surgery, smaller doses of naloxone hydrochloride are usually sufficient. The dose of naloxone hydrochloride should be titrated according to the patient's response. For the initial reversal of respiratory depression, naloxone hydrochloride should be injected in increments of 0.1 to 0.2 mg intravenously at two- to three-minute intervals to achieve the desired degree of reversal, i.e. adequate ventilation and alertness without significant pain or discomfort. Larger than necessary dosages of naloxone may result in significant reversal of analgesia and an increase in blood pressure. Similarly, too rapid reversal may induce nausea, vomiting, sweating, or circulatory stress.

Repeat doses of naloxone may be required within one- to two-hour intervals depending on the amount, type (i.e. short or long acting), and time interval since the last administration of an opioid. Supplemental intramuscular doses have been shown to produce a longer-lasting effect.

*Septic shock*: The optimal dosage of naloxone hydrochloride or duration of therapy for the treatment of hypotension in septic shock patients has not been established (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

*Usage in children - Opioid overdose, known or suspected*: The usual initial dose in children is 0.01 mg/kg body weight given intravenously. If this dose does not result in the desired degree of clinical improvement, a subsequent dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight may be administered. If an intravenous route of administration is not available, naloxone administration through other routes may be considered.

### Naloxone reversal of buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression [^115dLBrP]. Anesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this investigation was to examine the ability of the opioid antagonist naloxone to reverse respiratory depression produced by the mu-opioid analgesic, buprenorphine, in healthy volunteers. The studies were designed in light of the claims that buprenorphine is relatively resistant to the effects of naloxone.

- **Methods**: In a first attempt, the effect of an intravenous bolus dose of 0.8 mg naloxone was assessed on 0.2 mg buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression. Next, the effect of increasing naloxone doses (0.5–7 mg, given over 30 minutes) on 0.2 mg buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression was tested. Subsequently, continuous naloxone infusions were applied to reverse respiratory depression from 0.2 and 0.4 mg buprenorphine. All doses are per 70 kg. Respiration was measured against a background of constant increased end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration.

- **Results**: An intravenous naloxone dose of 0.8 mg had no effect on respiratory depression from buprenorphine. Increasing doses of naloxone given over 30 minutes produced full reversal of buprenorphine effect in the dose range of 2–4 mg naloxone. Further increasing the naloxone dose (doses of 5 mg or greater) caused a decline in reversal activity. Naloxone bolus doses of 2–3 mg, followed by a continuous infusion of 4 mg/h, caused full reversal within 40–60 minutes of both 0.2 and 0.4 mg buprenorphine-induced respiratory depression.

- **Conclusions**: Reversal of buprenorphine effect is possible but depends on the buprenorphine dose and the correct naloxone dose window.

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^112TiH3D]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our prior study suggests that providing opioid overdose education and take-home naloxone to opioid treatment program (OTP) patients can significantly increase overdose reversals in the community. In this study, characteristics of opioid use disorder (OUD) patients with significantly greater odds of performing naloxone overdose reversals included younger age, previously witnessing an opioid overdose, receiving emergency room care for overdose, and having positive urine toxicology screens. By targeting certain patients based on their characteristics, and supplying this patient population with additional support, overdose reversals may be increased substantially more in the community. It is possible that this targeted subset of patients may be interested in being trained as "harm reduction peer educators" in their community. This may help to further reduce opioid overdose deaths and bridge the gap between clinical and public health efforts related to naloxone distribution.

The findings in this analysis may differ in other regions of the US, or internationally. Because our findings seem to be partly dependent on social variables and connectivity, it may be valuable for other regions around the country to investigate their own OTP populations. They may discover which characteristics increase the likelihood of people performing overdose reversals in their community.

In future studies, we plan to ask study participants ethnographic, qualitative interview questions regarding their thoughts and feelings surrounding performing overdose reversals.

### Systematic review of naloxone dosing and adverse events in the emergency department [^114GksWL]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Experts recommend using the lowest effective dose of naloxone to balance the reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression and avoid precipitated opioid withdrawal. However, there are no established dosing standards within the emergency department (ED).

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to determine naloxone dosing practice in the ED and their association with adverse events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and EBSCO from 2000 to 2021. Articles containing patient-level data for the initial ED dose and patient outcomes had data abstracted by two independent reviewers. Patients were divided into subgroups according to the initial dose of i.v. naloxone: low dose ([LD], < 0.4 mg), standard dose ([SD], 0.4–2 mg), and high dose ([HD], > 2 mg). Our outcomes were the dose range administered and adverse events per dose. We compared groups using chi-squared difference of proportions or Fisher's exact test.

- **Results**: The review included 13 articles with 209 patients in the results analysis: 111 patients in LD (0.04–0.1 mg), 95 in SD (0.4–2 mg), and 3 in HD (4–12 mg). At least one adverse event was reported in 37 patients from the SD group (38.9%) compared with 14 in the LD group (12.6%, p < 0.0001) and 2 in the HD group (100.0%, p = 0.16). At least one additional dose was administered to 53 patients in the SD group (55.8%) compared with 55 in the LD group (49.5%, p < 0.0001) and 3 in the HD group (100.0%, p = 0.48).

- **Conclusions**: Lower doses of naloxone in the ED may help reduce related adverse events without increasing the need for additional doses. Future studies should evaluate these findings further to establish more standardized dosing guidelines.

### The evolution of recommended naloxone dosing for opioid overdose by medical specialty [^112Q4Mha]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Opioid abuse and opioid overdose deaths have increased significantly over the past decade. Naloxone is a potentially life-saving medication that can reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, though precipitated opioid withdrawal can pose acute risks to the patient and medical personnel. The optimal naloxone dose is unclear, and few studies address this question.

- **Methods**: A convenience sample of commonly available references was queried for the recommended IV naloxone dose. When dosing recommendations differed for opioid-tolerant patients, these were also recorded.

- **Results**: Twenty-five references were located. Forty-eight percent recommended a starting dose ≤ 0.05 mg, while 36% recommend a dose ten-fold higher. More than half of medical toxicology and general medical sources recommended a low-dose strategy with a starting dose lower than 0.05 mg IV.

- **Conclusion**: There are variations in the recommended doses for naloxone, with ranges spanning an order of magnitude. Further exploration is needed to determine the dose that balances reversal of respiratory depression with the mitigation of withdrawal.

### Vital signs: Pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing - United States, 2012–2018 [^114PAPoZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

The CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain recommends considering prescribing naloxone when factors that increase risk for overdose are present, such as a history of overdose or substance use disorder, opioid dosages ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day (high-dose), and concurrent use of benzodiazepines. In light of the high numbers of drug overdose deaths involving opioids — 36% of which in 2017 involved prescription opioids — improving access to naloxone is a public health priority. The CDC examined trends and characteristics of naloxone dispensing from retail pharmacies at national and county levels in the United States.

- **Methods**: CDC analyzed 2012–2018 retail pharmacy data from IQVIA, a health care, data science, and technology company, to assess U.S. naloxone dispensing by U.S. Census region, urban/rural status, prescriber specialty, and recipient characteristics, including age group, sex, out-of-pocket costs, and method of payment. Factors associated with naloxone dispensing at the county level also were examined.

- **Results**: The number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed from retail pharmacies increased substantially from 2012 to 2018, including a 106% increase from 2017 to 2018 alone. Nationally, in 2018, one naloxone prescription was dispensed for every 69 high-dose opioid prescriptions. Substantial regional variation in naloxone dispensing was found, including a twenty-fivefold variation across counties, with the lowest rates in the most rural counties. A wide variation was also noted by prescriber specialty. Compared with naloxone prescribing…

### Characteristics of patients with opioid use disorder associated with performing overdose reversals in the community: An opioid treatment program analysis [^116r5RQQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018).

The opioid crisis is a U.S. public health epidemic. Drug overdose (OD) deaths exceed all other causes of injury, including motor vehicle accidents and gun-related violence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 91 U.S. deaths per day involving opioids. Approximately 3 million Americans suffer from opioid use disorder (OUD), a condition characterized by escalating physical and psychological cravings for opioid analgesics.

People begin using opioid analgesics for various reasons. Some initially obtain prescription opioids from a medical provider for a diagnosis of acute or chronic pain. Others may begin using prescription opioids from a friend, a relative, or a stranger for the psychoactive feeling of well-being. Ultimately, the majority of people who develop OUD will switch to heroin because of its lower cost and accessibility. Polydrug use among people who use heroin, especially the use of alcohol and benzodiazepines, is an important contributor to drug OD.

Although self-administration of naloxone is not possible during an OD event, people who OD, especially from heroin, are usually not alone. Community members present, when trained and supplied with naloxone, can serve as first responders by performing OD reversals on others in their community. Community members who perform OD reversals are often reluctant to call emergency medical services due to fear of police. Other barriers to naloxone access include cost, inadequate first responder training, and lengthy response times, especially in rural communities.

### Development and preclinical testing of a naloxone prodrug depot for extended protection against opioid overdose [^113qC5Ck]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For the efficacy study (Fig. 5g–i; antagonists administered at 60 µmol kg−1; single i.v. dose), both treatments reversed opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) after the first fentanyl dose. However, naloxone-treated rats experienced significant hyperventilation and severe convulsions, unlike AG10-L-E2-Naloxone-treated animals (Fig. 5g). Four rats died in the vehicle group. Both treatments showed high plasma naloxone concentrations at 6 hours (750 nM for naloxone and 60 nM for naloxone released from AG10-L-E2-Naloxone) and at 24 hours (395 nM and 44 nM, respectively). Nonetheless, neither treatment effectively protected against OIRD after the second (6 hours) and third (24 hours) fentanyl doses (Fig. 5h, i). These findings suggest that very high initial naloxone levels may harm animals or alter the μ-opioid receptors, reducing the effectiveness of naloxone over time. There have been rare reports of fatal naloxone-induced pulmonary edema in humans at high doses. We believe prodrugs like AG10-L-E2-Naloxone could help investigate these effects further.

- **AG10-L-E2-Naloxone is a potential preventive and prophylactic agent against fentanyl-induced mortality and OIRD**: To compensate for the lower efficacy of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone in the first 30 minutes after dosing, we combined the prodrug with a small amount of free naloxone. A single subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of AG10-L-E2-Naloxone (60 µmol kg−1) and naloxone (3 µmol kg−1; equivalent to 1 mg kg−1) provided excellent efficacy, fully reversing OIRD after all three fentanyl doses without causing severe hyperventilation or convulsions, indicating a low risk of withdrawal symptoms (Fig. 6a–d).

### Naloxone counseling for harm reduction and patient engagement [^114b3pq1]. Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid-related deaths. Naloxone, the drug of choice for reversing acute opioid overdoses, is not routinely prescribed for outpatient use. The aims of this project were to improve naloxone awareness, increase naloxone prescribing, and prevent opioid overdoses.

- **Methods**: A naloxone counseling intervention was implemented in three family health centers by an interprofessional team of providers, including family medicine physicians, clinical pharmacists, and social workers. An outreach letter was designed with provider input, an electronic order set was developed to facilitate prescribing, and intranasal naloxone kits were assembled for free dispensing. Providers and staff received education about opioid overdose and naloxone prescribing. Faculty and resident physicians were surveyed before and after the intervention to assess their attitudes. Patients who received naloxone kits were surveyed to assess their attitudes and their use of opioids and naloxone.

- **Results**: Over 16 months, 71 outreach letters were distributed, and 97 naloxone kits were dispensed. The majority of kits were prescribed for illicit opioid use. Faculty and resident physician surveys indicated improved knowledge about naloxone prescribing and increased professional satisfaction in caring for patients requesting opioids. Surveyed patients endorsed high levels of comfort discussing opioid use with their primary care physician. Five successful opioid overdose reversals were reported.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115oyzQ8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend allowing 7–14 days to elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone. This interval is essential when considering a transition from buprenorphine to naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids before starting naltrexone.

### Naloxone use by emergency medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national survey [^114xQCbn]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is transmitted via droplets and secretions and may present a risk to emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians who perform procedures such as overdose reversal with intranasal naloxone. COVID-19 in the United States (US) has occurred in the midst of an opioid crisis that averages 128 overdose deaths per day. Anecdotal reports cite an increase in opioid overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to responses from the American Medical Association and loosening of regulations regarding access to medications for opioid use disorder by federal entities.

- **Notably, some law enforcement jurisdictions**: Have banned the administration of intranasal naloxone to avoid potential exposure of their personnel to SARS-CoV-2.

- **Guidelines for EMS clinicians**: Recommend the use of intranasal over intramuscular naloxone, whereas recent guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health and Services Administration (SAMHSA) favors intramuscular use if sufficient personal protective equipment is not available.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide information on one aspect of the effect of the pandemic on frontline EMS practices, we sought to determine the effect of COVID-19 on the perceived prevalence of opioid overdoses and the use of intranasal naloxone by EMS in the US.

### Low-dose oral naloxone reverses opioid-induced constipation and analgesia [^1121qr9s]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The most common side effect of opioid therapy is constipation, which is often difficult to treat and is believed to be primarily a peripheral effect. Single large doses of oral naloxone have been shown to be efficacious in reversing opioid-induced constipation; however, they often cause the unwanted side effect of analgesia reversal. This study evaluated the effects on constipation and analgesia of low doses of oral naloxone given three times daily. Patients taking stable doses of opioids with complaints of constipation were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were given 4 mg or 2 mg of oral naloxone, or placebo, three times daily. Stool frequency and symptoms related to constipation were recorded daily. Patients also recorded the daily amount of analgesics required to maintain pain control. Nine patients were recruited for the study. All the patients who received oral naloxone had some improvement in their bowel frequency. Three of the patients also experienced reversal of analgesia, including one who had complete reversal of analgesia. This study demonstrates that reversal of analgesia still occurred despite dividing the oral naloxone into very low doses relative to the total dose of opioid used. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone.

### Heroin overdose resuscitation with naloxone: Patient uses own prescribed supply to save the life of a peer [^113rFEHT]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Opiate overdose is the primary cause of death among injection-drug users and represents a significant public health concern worldwide. The condition can be reversed through the timely administration of naloxone, and users have shown willingness to carry the antidote for emergency situations, known as take-home naloxone. In November 2014, new WHO guidelines indicated that naloxone should be made available to anyone at risk of witnessing an overdose. This case presents a 46-year-old man in opioid-maintenance treatment who successfully used take-home naloxone to rescue an overdose victim. Notably, this is the first documented case of a patient using dose titration of naloxone to restore respiratory function while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. To enhance the safety of take-home naloxone, the authors recommend that clinicians involved in the treatment of opiate users:

- **Prescribe take-home naloxone** to all patients.
- **Forewarn patients** of potential side effects.
- **Instruct patients** in naloxone dose titration.

### Pharmacokinetics of concentrated naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose reversal: Phase I healthy volunteer study [^115usEHY]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

- **Study participants**: Thirty-eight subjects (aged 20–54 years) were randomized, of whom 27 were male and 11 were female. Before period 2 dosing, four subjects discontinued (three tested positive for drugs of abuse, and one withdrew consent). As the protocol allowed for replacement subjects, three additional subjects were randomized to the next available treatment sequence in the randomization schedule, exceeding the original enrollment target of 35 subjects. In total, six subjects did not complete the study (see supporting information, Fig. S1): six missed the 0.4 mg i.m. session, five missed the 1 mg i.n. session, four missed the 4 mg i.n. and 0.4 mg i.v. sessions, and two missed the 2 mg i.n. session. These 21 sessions were handled as missing data. Consequently, values reported below refer to sample sizes of n = 32 (0.4 mg i.m.), n = 33 (1 mg i.n.), n = 34 (4 mg i.n. 0.4 mg i.v.), and n = 36 (2 mg i.n.), unless specified otherwise.

- **Safety**: No severe adverse events (AEs) occurred. In total, 17 out of 38 subjects experienced 24 AEs (see supporting information, Table S1), of which 11 AEs in nine subjects were assessed as naloxone-related. AE occurrence did not seem to be dose-related: seven subjects experienced AEs following a 2 mg i.n. dose, while only three subjects experienced AEs following a 4 mg i.n. dose.

### Vital signs: Pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing - United States, 2012–2018 [^111XAQKu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Counties with the greatest need for overdose reversal, such as those with high rates of drug overdose death and high-dose opioid dispensing, tend to have a higher rate of pharmacy-based naloxone dispensing. The highest county-level naloxone dispensing rates were observed in some of the states hit hardest by opioid overdose mortality, such as Florida and Massachusetts, and in states that have implemented requirements for naloxone coprescribing, like Arizona and Virginia. Improved access to naloxone holds promise for opioid overdose reversals and provides the opportunity to link survivors to treatment to prevent future overdoses.

Variation in pharmacy naloxone dispensing rates cannot be fully explained by factors linked to the need for naloxone. Many states have only recently implemented laws requiring coprescription; thus, sufficient time has not passed to examine their full impact. Compared with metropolitan counties, rural counties had a higher likelihood of having low rates of naloxone dispensing, even when controlling for other relevant factors. This is concerning given slower EMS response times and underuse of naloxone by EMS in rural areas relative to the overdose prevalence, which are potentially attributable to resource, certification, and practice constraints. Harm-reduction programs are more limited in rural areas, and a smaller proportion of rural programs distribute naloxone. Thus, pharmacy naloxone dispensing holds great promise for a positive impact in rural communities.

Clinicians have reported a lack of knowledge and low levels of self-efficacy in counseling patients about naloxone, suggesting a need for improved educational efforts.
