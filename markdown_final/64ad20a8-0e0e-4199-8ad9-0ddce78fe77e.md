## Question

What considerations need to be made for a patient taking this for the first time with a history of type 2 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about considerations for a patient taking a medication for the first time with a history of type 2 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify baseline labs and risk stratification. Next, I will consider first-line therapy selection and when to start combination therapy. After that, I need to check comorbidity-driven add-ons, insulin indications, and hypoglycemia risk mitigation. Finally, I will review monitoring, education, and follow-up, and then summarize a practical decision framework with contingencies for special populations and cost constraints.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and phenotype before jumping to treatment choices. I need to ensure we are not missing LADA or MODY, and I should double-check for red flags like ketonuria, rapid weight loss, or severe symptomatic hyperglycemia that would push me toward insulin initially rather than oral therapy, especially in younger patients or those with autoimmune features [^115qY15W] [^111LdjBz].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline workup I must obtain: fasting glucose or A1c to confirm diabetes, comprehensive metabolic panel including eGFR and liver enzymes, a lipid panel, blood pressure, weight/BMI, and a foot exam. I should also screen for microvascular complications and document cardiovascular risk factors, because these will shape both glycemic targets and agent selection, and I need to check for contraindications to metformin such as eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or significant hepatic disease [^notfound].

> I will now examine the A1c and symptom burden to decide intensity. If A1c is 7.5–9.0% without symptoms, metformin monotherapy is reasonable, but if A1c is ≥ 9.0% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, or if there are symptoms or catabolic features, I should consider dual therapy or even basal insulin up front to avoid prolonged hyperglycemia and clinical inertia, and I need to ensure I escalate within 2–3 months if targets are not met [^114o5Fsx] [^112Vy4C8] [^116Ytq72].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about metformin being the only option. I should confirm that metformin remains first-line unless contraindicated because of its durable A1c lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or loss, and favorable cost, and I need to titrate to 2000 mg/day as tolerated over 1–2 months while reinforcing lifestyle therapy from the outset [^114dK8ee] [^114yCGpj].

> Let me consider combination therapy thoughtfully. When A1c is high or progression risk is substantial, early combination with metformin plus a second agent can shorten time to goal and may better preserve beta-cell function, but I should confirm that the second agent is chosen based on comorbidities and patient preferences, and I must avoid combining GLP-1 receptor agonists with DPP-4 inhibitors because both target GLP-1 pathways and have not been studied together [^116WNWFw] [^116dChC3] [^113nUjKU].

> Next, I should review comorbidity-driven add-ons. For established ASCVD or high ASCVD risk, a GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefit is appropriate, whereas for HF or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor is preferred, and I need to ensure I start at the lowest effective dose and titrate per trial-tested regimens, while counseling on GI side effects for GLP-1 RAs and genital infections/volume depletion for SGLT2 inhibitors [^116przRK] [^116MXcjn] [^115JdpUi].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with marked hyperglycemia, catabolism, or ketosis? In that case I should initiate basal insulin promptly, often alongside metformin, and then de-escalate insulin once metabolic stability returns, and I need to remember that early insulin can simplify later management by reducing the need for sequential failures of oral agents [^11698p33] [^113cqupB].

> I need to ensure hypoglycemia risk is addressed. If I am adding a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor to a regimen that includes insulin or a sulfonylurea, I should reduce the insulin dose by about 20% and consider weaning the sulfonylurea, and I should provide structured hypoglycemia education, prescribe glucagon for high-risk patients, and consider CGM where appropriate to detect and prevent events [^112yVSdJ] [^113uhrnz] [^116heVy6].

> Let me think about special populations. In older or frail adults, I should set less stringent A1c targets, prioritize agents with low hypoglycemia risk, and be cautious with polypharmacy, whereas in CKD I should confirm eGFR thresholds for SGLT2 inhibitors and consider that some agents remain beneficial down to eGFR 20–30, and in pregnancy or planned pregnancy I must avoid teratogenic agents and pivot to insulin-based regimens [^1143Y9Px] [^112e8tUU] [^1111qHRT].

> I should double-check cost and access constraints because they often drive adherence. When resources are limited, metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and human insulin are reasonable lower-cost options, and I need to discuss out-of-pocket costs explicitly and consider generics when available to avoid cost-related nonadherence [^115Kx4cT] [^113H6NUt].

> Next, I should review the monitoring plan. I will reassess A1c every 3 months until at target, then every 6 months, check renal and hepatic function periodically, monitor for adverse effects specific to the chosen agents, and at each visit screen for hypoglycemia, weight change, blood pressure, and cardiovascular status, adjusting therapy proactively rather than waiting for failure [^115BGuVq] [^113uhrnz].

> I will now examine patient education and self-management. DSMES should start at diagnosis and continue at least annually, I should teach sick-day rules including when to hold metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 RAs, and I must provide written action plans for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, with reinforcement of nutrition and physical activity goals tailored to comorbidities and preferences [^112je3M7] [^116krW4H].

> Hold on, I should verify that my decision framework is coherent: confirm diagnosis and phenotype, risk-stratify by A1c and comorbidities, start metformin unless contraindicated, escalate to combination therapy if A1c is high or not at goal within 2–3 months, add cardiorenal-protective agents for ASCVD/HF/CKD, initiate insulin for marked hyperglycemia or catabolism, mitigate hypoglycemia by adjusting secretagogues and insulin, individualize for age/frailty/CKD/pregnancy, and embed cost and adherence into shared decision-making with structured follow-up every 3–6 months [^116WNWFw] [^116przRK] [^115n3kKz].

For a patient with type 2 diabetes starting a new medication, prioritize **metformin first-line** unless contraindicated [^114dK8ee], and tailor therapy to comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^115n3kKz]. Use **combination therapy** if A1c is ≥ 1.5% above goal or ≥ 9.0% [^114o5Fsx] [^112Vy4C8], and add SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs for cardiovascular or renal benefit [^116MXcjn] [^117RJxxH]. Educate on hypoglycemia, sick-day management, and adherence; monitor A1c every 3–6 months [^notfound] and adjust therapy to minimize hypoglycemia and maximize cardiorenal benefit [^113uhrnz].

---

## Initial assessment and baseline evaluation

- **Confirm diagnosis and baseline metrics**: Verify T2D diagnosis with fasting glucose, A1c, and clinical context; establish baseline weight, BMI, blood pressure, and renal function (eGFR) [^notfound].

- **Comorbidity assessment**: Identify cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF), liver disease, and obesity, as these drive agent selection [^116uW7GJ].

- **Hypoglycemia risk assessment**: Evaluate age, renal function, cognitive status, and prior hypoglycemia to guide regimen choice and targets [^113uhrnz].

- **Patient preferences and social determinants**: Engage in shared decision-making and consider cost, access, and adherence barriers [^114ckfLp].

---

## First-line pharmacologic therapy

- **Metformin as initial therapy**: Start metformin unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², severe hepatic impairment, or intolerance) [^114dK8ee] [^111qNBNG].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Concurrently initiate nutrition and physical activity plans to improve glycemia, weight, and cardiovascular risk [^114dK8ee].

- **Titration**: Increase metformin to the maximally effective dose over 1–2 months as tolerated [^114dK8ee].

---

## Combination therapy considerations

- **Indications for combination therapy**: Consider initial combination if A1c is ≥ 1.5% above goal or ≥ 9.0% [^114o5Fsx] [^112dHfyA].

- **Preferred combination agents**: SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs are preferred when cardiovascular or renal disease is present or high risk [^116MXcjn] [^117RJxxH].

- **Agents to avoid in combination**: Do not combine GLP-1 RAs with DPP-4 inhibitors due to redundancy and lack of evidence [^113nUjKU].

---

## Special considerations for specific comorbidities

| **Comorbidity** | **Preferred agents** | **Agents to avoid or use with caution** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular disease | - SGLT2 inhibitors <br/> - GLP-1 RAs | - Insulin (hypoglycemia risk) <br/> - Sulfonylureas |
| Chronic kidney disease | - SGLT2 inhibitors (eGFR ≥ 20) <br/> - GLP-1 RAs | - Metformin (if eGFR < 30) <br/> - Insulin (dose adjust) |
| Heart failure | SGLT2 inhibitors | Thiazolidinediones |
| Obesity | - GLP-1 RAs <br/> - SGLT2 inhibitors | - Insulin <br/> - Sulfonylureas |
| Liver disease | - Metformin (if mild) <br/> - GLP-1 RAs | Thiazolidinediones |

---

## Hypoglycemia risk management

- **Identify high-risk patients**: Older adults, those with renal impairment, or on insulin/sulfonylureas require heightened vigilance [^111Dpmwg].

- **Minimize hypoglycemia risk**: Prefer agents with low hypoglycemia risk (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs) and adjust insulin/sulfonylureas when adding new therapies [^116heVy6].

- **Patient education**: Teach recognition, treatment, and prevention of hypoglycemia; provide glucagon for high-risk patients [^113uhrnz].

---

## Patient education and adherence support

Provide **comprehensive education** on medication purpose, dosing, side effects, and adherence, and connect patients with **diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES)** to improve outcomes [^113HvNGo]. Address cost, pill burden, and complexity to enhance adherence [^1143Y9Px].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Regular monitoring**: Check A1c every 3–6 months [^notfound] and adjust therapy to maintain individualized targets [^115n3kKz].

- **Renal and hepatic monitoring**: Monitor renal function with metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors; assess liver function as indicated [^113bzp94].

- **Cardiovascular and renal outcomes**: Track blood pressure, lipid profiles, and renal function to guide therapy and detect complications [^1165xVua].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Metformin first-line**: Unless contraindicated, start metformin and titrate to effect [^114dK8ee].

- **Combination therapy**: Use when A1c is significantly above goal or comorbidities warrant early intensification [^114o5Fsx].

- **Comorbidity-driven selection**: Choose SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs for CVD/CKD/HF or obesity [^116MXcjn].

- **Hypoglycemia prevention**: Prioritize low-risk agents and educate patients [^113uhrnz].

- **Shared decision-making**: Align therapy with patient preferences, access, and adherence [^114ckfLp].

---

Initiating therapy in T2D requires a **person-centered approach** that balances glycemic targets with comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences, using metformin first-line and escalating to combination therapy with cardiorenal-protective agents as indicated [^115n3kKz].

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^1138nfFm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor initiation and practical considerations are noted, including that individuals with HbA1c in the low or normal range (eg, < 7.0%) might not be initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor based on the KDIGO guideline. Trial context indicates that approximately 18%–25% of participants in large SGLT2 inhibitor trials and 50% in CREDENCE were not on metformin at baseline, and there are no post hoc analyses comparing outcomes according to baseline metformin therapy; therefore, in some cases, it may be reasonable to reduce or discontinue metformin to safely utilize an SGLT2 inhibitor from a glycemic perspective. The KDOQI work group agreed with withholding SGLT2 inhibitors during hospitalization or periods of fasting when risk for diabetic ketoacidosis is higher and to consider decreasing or holding diuretics in euvolemic individuals at initiation to reduce hypovolemia risk, and it underscores the expected initial decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. For implementation, KDIGO offers a clinical practice point to prioritize agents with proven cardiorenal benefit and acknowledges that therapy choice will depend on insurance and assistance programs, while highlighting current US uptake gaps where only 21%–50% of eligible people receive ACEI/ARB therapy versus 75%–80% in Europe.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) initiation — monitoring and coadministration guidance is emphasized as follows: Patients initiating a GLP-1RA should be informed that transient nausea is a relatively common side effect, and nausea and vomiting can be minimized by starting with the lowest dose, up-titrating gradually according to the label recommendations, ceasing up titration when the nausea becomes uncomfortable, and eating smaller portions; a low-fat diet can also help. This nausea does not imply gastrointestinal pathology and is usually self-limited in patients treated with longer-acting GLP-1RAs. GLP-1RAs should be used with caution in patients who have had problems with clinically significant gastroparesis, and if treatment is suspended, reinitiation should again be at the lowest dose, with gradual up-titration to avoid recurrent nausea and vomiting. GLP-1RA should not be coadministered with DPP4 inhibitors given that both work through GLP-1 signaling and have not been studied for use together. An increased risk of diabetic retinopathy complications has been noted with semaglutide, predominantly in patients with a prior history of proliferative retinopathy; therefore, these patients should have regular eye examinations, as recommended by the current guidelines.

Treatment options

ADA and EASD state that pharmacotherapy should be started at the time of a T2D diagnosis, yet nearly 40% of patients discontinue medications within the first year, illustrating the need for shared decision-making. Some patients may prefer a lifestyle approach despite the recommendation for pharmacological management. In patients motivated to avoid medications and willing to engage in a lifestyle programme at the time of diagnosis, a structured approach can be beneficial.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) should also be considered, although insurance barriers can exist. Manufacturers are trying to counter this concern with lower cost over-the-counter (OTC; purchased without a prescription) CGM devices. The ADA recommends such technologies are used with initial and ongoing training, education and data monitoring.

Providers and patients have treatment options (online supplemental table 1), facilitating crucial shared decision-making regarding optimal matching of patient to treatment. Attention must also be given to social determinants of health that impact patients' care. Consideration of these factors can assist with development of a treatment plan that can optimise engagement and efficacy. Figure 1 presents practical considerations for personalising treatment. Online supplemental table 2 presents a possible waiting room questionnaire for patients.

### Capivasertib (Truqap) [^1171GnX9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Before initiating treatment with TRUQAP, test fasting glucose levels (FPG or FBG), HbA1C levels, and optimize fasting glucose.

After initiating treatment with TRUQAP, monitor or self-monitor fasting glucose levels on Day 3 or 4 of the dosing week during weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8; then monthly while on treatment with TRUQAP; and as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1C levels every 3 months during treatment with TRUQAP and as clinically indicated. Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

For patients who experience hyperglycemia during treatment with TRUQAP, monitor fasting glucose at least twice weekly, on days on and off TRUQAP, until fasting glucose decreases to baseline levels. During treatment with anti-diabetic medications, monitor fasting glucose at least once a week for 2 months, followed by once every 2 weeks, or as clinically indicated.

Consider consultation with a healthcare practitioner with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycemia and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

Withhold TRUQAP immediately when ketoacidosis is suspected. If ketoacidosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue TRUQAP.

Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue TRUQAP [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and monitoring — practical actions: If HbA1c is well-controlled at baseline or there is a known history of frequent hypoglycemic events, wean or stop sulfonylurea and consider reducing total daily insulin dose by ~20% when starting therapy. Instruct patients to more closely monitor glucose at home for the first 4 weeks of therapy, consider discontinuing any sulfonylurea or glinide, and for those taking insulin consider modestly reducing total daily insulin dose (by up to 20%). Educate patients regarding risk of genital mycotic infections and importance of genital hygiene; avoid hypovolemia and consider reducing diuretic dose if symptoms of dehydration occur; educate on symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis and that it can occur even if blood glucose is in the 150–250 mg/dL range; and educate on foot care and to report any foot wounds immediately.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116wgDm5]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Prediabetes — pharmacologic prevention and evidence quality: We recommend that clinicians continue monitoring the most up-to-date research for evidence-based changes in practice management related to prediabetes. The evidence informing this area is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, with sample sizes low and follow-up varying from 6.0 months to 3.5 years. In patients who are poor candidates for metformin, the benefits of using an alternative medication to prevent progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus slightly outweighed the potential harm of side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. Accordingly, in adults with prediabetes who have participated in healthy lifestyle modification and remain at high risk for progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest evaluating patient characteristics (e.g., age, life expectancy, co-occurring conditions, BMI, other risk factors) and offering metformin or other select medications to reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### We can change the natural history of type 2 diabetes [^114tDPtP]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

As diabetes develops, we currently waste the first ∼10 years of the natural history. If we found prediabetes and early diabetes when they first presented and treated them more effectively, we could prevent or delay the progression of hyperglycemia and the development of complications. Evidence for this comes from trials where lifestyle change and/or glucose-lowering medications decreased progression from prediabetes to diabetes. After withdrawal of these interventions, there was no "catch-up"-cumulative development of diabetes in the previously treated groups remained less than in control subjects. Moreover, achieving normal glucose levels even transiently during the trials was associated with a substantial reduction in subsequent development of diabetes. These findings indicate that we can change the natural history through routine screening to find prediabetes and early diabetes, combined with management aimed to keep glucose levels as close to normal as possible, without hypoglycemia. We should also test the hypothesis with a randomized controlled trial.

Figure 2 — Practical guide for initiating SGLT2 inhibitors describes patient selection, intervention, and follow-up for type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2; high-priority features include ACR ≥ 200 mg/g [≥ 20 mg/mmol] and heart failure, and potential contraindications include genital infection risk, diabetic ketoacidosis, foot ulcers, and immunosuppression. SGLT2 inhibitor options with proven benefits are canagliflozin 100 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 10 mg, with education on sick day protocol, perioperative care, and foot care, and follow-up includes assessing adverse effects, reviewing knowledge, and anticipating an acute drop in eGFR, which is generally not a reason to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor. For glycemia, hypoglycemia risk factors include insulin or sulfonylurea use, history of severe hypoglycemia, and HbA1c at or below goal; if high, education includes hypoglycemia symptoms and glycemia monitoring and consider insulin/sulfonylurea dose reduction, with follow-up to ask about hypoglycemia and reduce sulfonylurea or insulin if needed. For volume, volume depletion risk factors include concurrent diuretic use, tenuous volume status, and history of AKI; if high, education includes volume depletion symptoms and consideration of diuretic dose reduction, with follow-up to re-assess volume and reduce concomitant diuretic if needed.

### Initiating therapy in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes: combination therapy vs a stepwise approach [^114jH2JQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

There is clear evidence that achieving glycaemic targets reduces the risk of developing complications as a result of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Many patients, however, continue to have suboptimal glycaemic control because of issues that include unclear advice on how to achieve these targets as well as clinical inertia. The two management approaches recommended for patients newly diagnosed with T2D are stepwise and combination therapy, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Stepwise therapy may result in good patient adherence and allow greater individualization of therapy, and minimization of side effects and cost, and so may be appropriate for patients who are closer to goal. Stepwise therapy, however, may also lead to frequent delays in achieving glycaemic goals and longer exposure to hyperglycaemia. Combination therapy, which is now emerging as an important therapy option, has a number of potential advantages over stepwise therapy, including reduction in clinical inertia and earlier and more frequent achievement of glycated haemoglobin goals by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms simultaneously, which may more effectively delay disease progression. Compared with stepwise therapy, the disadvantages of combination therapy include reduced patient adherence resulting from complex, multi-drug regimens, difficulty determining the cause of poor efficacy and/or side effects, patient refusal to accept disease, and higher cost. Fixed-dose and fixed-ratio combinations are novel therapeutic approaches which may help address several issues of treatment complexity and patient burden associated with combination therapy comprising individual drugs. The choice of which drugs to administer and the decision to use stepwise vs combination therapy, however, should always be made on an individualized basis.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to insulin therapy, indications, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate insulin, with or without metformin, as the initial pharmacologic therapy in patients with metabolic decompensation (such as marked hyperglycemia, ketosis, hyperosmolar state, or unintentional weight loss related to hyperglycemia) and/or severe symptomatic hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, visual blurring). Consider tapering or discontinuing insulin and replacing it with other agents once metabolic stability is achieved.

SGLT2 inhibitor monitoring — patients starting an SGLT2 inhibitor should be informed about the "higher risk of genital mycotic infections" and that careful perineal hygiene may lower risk; "Topical antifungal agents can be used" and treatment "may require temporary discontinuation of the SGLT2 inhibitor", while "Oral antifungals can be used but require close attention to corrected QT interval (QTc)". Counsel on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk and symptoms; "Home monitoring with urine ketone test strips may be a reasonable choice in some higher-risk patients", and to prevent DKA "avoid initial reductions in total daily insulin dose of > 20%". Recognize that "Approximately 5% to 10% of adult-onset diabetes is late-onset type 1", who have increased DKA risk and no CV outcomes data. For those "taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue", advise on hypoglycemia risk and that "discontinuing or weaning the sulfonylurea or glinide or modestly reducing total daily insulin dose by up to 20% could reduce the risk", with instruction to self-monitor glucose "during the first 3 to 4 weeks". In patients not on insulin or a secretagogue, "the risk of hypoglycemia is not significantly increased". Advise that a diuretic effect "may be observed", additive with loop diuretics; monitor for volume depletion and "decreasing the diuretic dose may be warranted" if symptoms occur. Kidney considerations include that therapy "may cause a modest initial decrease in eGFR", yet trials show "no increase in acute kidney injury", and "Monitoring renal function in the first few weeks of therapy is reasonable, particularly in patients with impaired renal function at baseline".

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of canagliflozin 300 mg versus dapagliflozin 10 mg added to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States [^114Sz6SE]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 30 million people have diabetes in the United States. The majority of people with diabetes (~ 90%) are classified as having type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is characterized by insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and hyperglycemia. Chronic uncontrolled hyperglycemia in people with T2DM is associated with an increased risk of debilitating and potentially life-threatening micro- and macrovascular complications, including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and blindness, as well as premature death. Consequently, the economic burden of diabetes in the United States is staggering; in 2012, the estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes was $245 billion, of which 18% was attributed to prescription medications to treat complications of diabetes and 12% was attributed to the costs of anti-hyperglycemic agents (AHAs) and diabetes-testing supplies.

Controlling hyperglycemia can decrease the risk of complications in people with T2DM. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages a patient-centered approach to T2DM management, with consideration of the overall risk profile (i.e. beyond glycemic control) when identifying treatment targets. Lifestyle modifications that result in healthier eating habits and increased physical activity are an important component of T2DM management that can lead to weight loss and improved glycemic control. When pharmacologic intervention is needed, metformin is generally preferred; however, most patients will require a second medication soon after metformin is initiated in order to meet treatment targets. Selection of a second-line therapy is at the discretion of the treating physician, with consideration of patient preferences, health history, and risk of side effects (e.g. hypoglycemia). Appropriate choices for combination therapy with metformin include sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and basal insulin. However, with emerging data demonstrating the cardioprotective effects of newer AHA classes (i.e. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors), some diabetes management guidelines have been revised to preferentially recommend the initiation of AHAs with demonstrated cardioprotective benefits.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to elderly patients (pharmacotherapy), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to take into account costs of care and coverage when developing treatment plans in order to reduce the risk of cost-related barriers to medication taking and self-management behaviors.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^115Qc2DG]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

Key points
- Health care providers play a crucial role in helping patients prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and manage all types of diabetes.
- They are often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program or diabetes self-management education and support services. Preventing type 2 diabetes About 1 in 3 American adults has prediabetes, which increases their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. More than 8 in 10 of them don't know they have prediabetes. As a health care provider, you're often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program. Refer your patients with prediabetes to the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program. Research shows that the program can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half.

This yearlong program, delivered by a trained Lifestyle Coach, will teach your patients how to eat healthy, increase physical activity, manage stress, and stay motivated. They can also lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke and improve their overall health. Already delivering the lifestyle change program. Managing diabetes Stay up to date on the latest Diabetes Standards of Care to ensure your patients are receiving timely, equitable, and high-quality care. These guidelines include screenings and management for diabetes and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Your patients manage their diabetes care with regular guidance and support from their health care team. At every health care visit, you and other care team members can encourage them to take the steps needed to manage their diabetes effectively:

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116heVy6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment intensification, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to reassess the need for and/or dose of medications with higher hypoglycemia risk (sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and insulin) to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia and treatment burden when initiating a new glucose-lowering medication.

### Diet and exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114F8K9T]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The question is no longer whether diet and exercise can benefit the individual with type 2 diabetes. Rather, the type and duration of exercise the magnitude of the effects on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and on risk factors for cardiovascular disease must be considered in determining the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention program. It is now clear that regular physical exercise is important in both the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. The benefits of exercise are many and include increased energy expenditure, which, combined with dietary restriction, leads to decreased body fat, increased insulin sensitivity, improved long-term glycemic control, improved lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, and increased cardiovascular fitness. Persons with type 2 diabetes often find it difficult to exercise and are at increased risk for injury or exacerbation of underlying diseases or diabetic complications. Therefore, before starting an exercise program, all patients with type 2 diabetes should have a complete history and physical examination, with particular attention to evaluation of cardiovascular disease, medications that may affect glycemic control during or after exercise, and diabetic complications including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Exercise programs should be designed to start slowly, build up gradually, and emphasize moderately intense exercise performed at least three times a week and preferably five to seven times a week for best results.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges? [^113cqupB]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Individual preference may be to delay insulin by starting another treatment. When this is done, it is desirable to advise the patient that the plan will be reevaluated in 4–6 months. If glycemic control is then unacceptable, insulin should be recommended, usually with continuation of some of the other therapies.

The stepped algorithm for use of diabetes therapies with time does seem to get ever more complex, as the range of options increases with newer classes of glucose-lowering medications. One advantage of insulin therapy is often forgotten here, namely that since it is inevitable for the majority of individuals, starting it early, when people are only on one or two oral agents, considerably simplifies further management. Essentially recurrent decisions and assessments over which other class or individual medication to use are avoided for the most part, along with the problems of monitoring success and eventual "failure" of each of those other agents. Since however many medications are licensed in at least some major markets for combination with insulin therapy, starting insulin does not preclude the addition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), thiazolidinediones, or sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) blockers, should a specific indication become clear while insulin is being used.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025 person-centered prevention of type 2 diabetes — in adults with overweight or obesity at high risk of type 2 diabetes, care goals should include weight loss and maintenance, minimizing the progression of hyperglycemia, and attention to cardiovascular risk, and pharmacotherapy should be considered to support these goals. More intensive preventive approaches should be considered for those at particularly high risk, including BMI ≥ 35 kg/m^2, fasting plasma glucose 110–125 mg/dL, 2-h postchallenge glucose 173–199 mg/dL, A1C ≥ 6.0%, and individuals with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus; evidence grades are B for 3.12 and 3.13 and A for 3.14.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112kw26g]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Place of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Clinical Guidelines

At present, clinical guidelines for diabetes do not distinguish among drugs of the SGLT2 inhibitor class. The American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) position statement for the management of hyperglycemia in T2DM recommends a patient-centered approach, selecting treatment strategies (and indeed treatment targets) based on the patient's individual characteristics. This group lists SGLT2 inhibitors along with five other options to use in combination with metformin, although given that there were no available data on CV outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors at the time this position statement was written, further updates may be expected, perhaps also with the results of the LEADER trial. The ADA 2016 Standards of Care in Diabetes discuss the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study results, noting one of the advantages of SGLT2 inhibitors as a class is the association of empagliflozin with a lower CV disease event rate and mortality in patients with CV disease. However, these guidelines continue to list SGLT2 inhibitors among various options, with the recommendation to select therapies based on individual patient needs. The AACE/ACE consensus statement on management of T2DM is updated annually, and the 2016 update included discussion of EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Again, this group continues to list SGLT2 inhibitors among various agents, although they raised the class in the hierarchy of alternative options.

Why has neither group rushed to recommend empagliflozin as first-line treatment, given the excitement around the results? This is clarified in an interim guideline update by the Canadian Diabetes Association, recently issued in response to the EMPA-REG OUTCOME results. They point out that the patients in EMPA-REG OUTCOME not only had a history of CV disease, but fewer than 2% of patients were drug-naïve, and patients typically had long-standing diabetes; therefore, for newly diagnosed (drug-naïve) patients, metformin is recommended as the first choice of agent, along with lifestyle therapy. As with other guidelines, individualizing therapy is recommended, but unlike other guidelines, when a second agent is needed, a history of CV disease is prioritized among the patient characteristics, with empagliflozin the current recommended choice of agent in such patients. As with any drug choice, there would be other factors to consider, such as adverse effects, contraindications, and cost, as well as patient preference.

AACE 2023 type 2 diabetes algorithm — early combination and escalation: For T2D with A1C > 7.5%, early combination therapy may also be considered with metformin plus another agent that does not cause hypoglycemia. Clinicians should be cognizant that combination of incretin therapies is not recommended. Antihyperglycemic medications should be titrated to the maximally tolerated dose and additional agents should be considered in a timely fashion to avoid therapeutic inertia. If the A1C is > 9% or ≥ 1.5% above goal, ≥ 2 antihyperglycemic agents may need to be initiated at once.

### Diabetes and frailty: an expert consensus statement on the management of older adults with type 2 diabetes [^1143Y9Px]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Often during reviews of frail older adults, individuals will be identified with a low HbA1c (< 48 mmol/mol; < 6.5%). It should be considered that insulin resistance may have subsided sufficiently that no therapies are required. In this scenario, it is reasonable to discontinue all antihyperglycaemic agents and review control after 3 months against an individualised HbA1c goal. Anti-hyperglycaemic therapies can work in synergy, hence the removal of one (even low-dose) component of a regimen can result in a dramatic rise in HbA1c (rebound hyperglycaemia). This highlights the importance of monitoring HbA1c and reviewing the individual if medication is de-escalated. Care must be taken to identify those who may be at risk of rebound hyperglycaemia if on multiple agents even if HbA1c is < 48 mmol/mol (< 6.5%) and, therefore, in such circumstances, a pragmatic/sequential cessation of medication may be required. In such people, previous glycaemic control/HbA1c and medication commencement history may support rapid or slower discontinuation. HbA1c can rise sharply after stopping an SU, even if this has been taken for many years, so it may be appropriate to restart at a lower dose in such cases.

People living with diabetes should be reviewed after each change in regimen (i.e. a 3-month review programme with an HbA1c measurement after every withdrawal) to check that glycaemic control (and other risk factor management) is appropriate for their frailty category, and also to check whether frailty status has changed. In all cases, it is important to explain to the individual (and relatives) that the reasons for de-escalation are concerned with improving symptoms, function and QoL, frailty status and comorbidity in order to avoid the misconception that de-escalation represents 'giving up hope'.

Whilst focus is made on de-escalation and avoidance of hypoglycaemia, it is equally important to remember that complex regimens and multiple medications will contribute to pill burden and polypharmacy, which can have a significant impact on the individual (who may already be on multiple other medications, given associations with comorbidities). Therefore, a regular review of medication is recommended, and considerations should be made for simplification of regimens, where possible, to reduce pill burden, including consideration of combination therapies. This may also improve overall adherence to medication regimens, not just those for the treatment of diabetes, and help reduce both the cost of treatment and medication errors.

### Current therapies for the medical management of diabetes [^1155cKxh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects a large and diverse number of individuals who share in common its risks for complications but who differ greatly from one another in age, health, and a number of circumstances influential to successful treatment. Because type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of diabetes cases, a number of agents have been developed for its treatment. Their unique properties offer opportunities to overcome some of the treatment limitations of older medicines and enable a more individualized and flexible approach to glucose-lowering. At the same time, new medications are accompanied by greater costs and uncertainties about their long-term benefits or safety, and thus the present state of care for type 2 diabetes places focus on a process of shared decision-making between the clinician and patient as to which treatments can optimize health while minimizing harms. We review the major classes of diabetes agents and provide some guidance for how one might approach decision-making in choosing among them.

### The management of type 2 diabetes before, during and after COVID-19 infection: what is the evidence? [^1148TZ6C]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with Covid-19 place new challenges on the management of type 2 diabetes, including the questions of whether glucose-lowering therapy should be adjusted during infection and how to manage a return to normal care after resolution of Covid-19 symptoms. Due to the sudden onset of the pandemic, physicians have by necessity made such important clinical decisions in the absence of robust evidence or consistent guidelines. The risk to patients is compounded by the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in this population, which alongside diabetes is a major risk factor for severe disease and mortality in Covid-19. We convened as experts from the Central and Eastern European region to consider what advice we can provide in the setting of type 2 diabetes and Covid-19, considering the evidence before, during and after infection. We review recommendations that have been published to date, and consider the best available-but currently limited-evidence from large observational studies and the DARE-19 randomized control trial. Notably, we find a lack of guidance on restarting patients on optimal antidiabetic therapy after recovering from Covid-19, and suggest that this may provide an opportunity to optimize treatment and counter clinical inertia that predates the pandemic. Furthermore, we emphasize that optimization applies not only to glycaemic control, but other factors such as cardiorenal protection. While we look forward to the emergence of new evidence that we hope will address these gaps, in the interim we provide a perspective, based on our collective clinical experience, on how best to manage glucose-lowering therapy as patients with Covid-19 recover from their disease and return to normal care.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges? [^111LdjBz]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

When Should Insulin Therapy Be Started?

Indications for insulin therapy and when to begin it are poorly defined in guidelines and still subject to individual judgment based on a wide range of opinion. Personal beliefs and experience, familiarity with the use of the different insulin preparations and delivery systems, individual preference, patient needle phobia, concern about chronic hyperinsulinemia, risk of hypoglycemia, and difficulties in controlling body weight are some of the many considerations regarding insulin therapy. Each one of these factors can be weighted differently between doctors and between people with diabetes. The expert group proposed that one way to rationalize the approach to insulin treatment could be to consider some clinical scenarios. These could be as follows: 1) the time of diagnosis or early thereafter; 2) in the presence of other emerging medical conditions; and 3) in the course of routine ambulatory diabetes management.

Time of Diagnosis or Early Thereafter

In specific circumstances, insulin may be considered a potential first line therapy (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Presentation of diabetes with ketonuria, with or without marked symptoms, should raise the suspicion of type 1 diabetes, although the possibility of accelerated lipolysis and ketogenesis due to starvation also deserves consideration. Ketoacidosis can be present at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, especially in the presence of another metabolic stress (i.e. myocardial infarction or infection or use of antiretroviral therapy). In such situations, immediate use of insulin is recommended and sometimes mandatory.

### Factors associated with initiation of antihyperglycaemic medication in UK patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^113ugANo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Management of type 2 diabetes is centered on glycaemic control, in conjunction with controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Diabetes treatment guidelines recommend initiating treatment with antihyperglycaemic medication either concomitantly with or following a brief period of lifestyle intervention. Despite these recommendations and confirmed inadequate glycaemic control with lifestyle interventions, many patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes remain untreated with antihyperglycaemic medication in clinical practice for extended periods of time. This hyperglycaemic burden may have long-term consequences and increase the risk for both micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes.

Early initiation of antihyperglycaemic medication is associated with reductions in microvascular events and long-term, legacy effects with reductions in myocardial infarction and death in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, treatment with antihyperglycaemic agents, as monotherapy, led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in the proportion of patients with an HbA 1c < 7% relative to diet alone in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Initiation of antihyperglycaemic medication and treatment targets should be based on clinical judgment following assessment of patient factors such as age, functional status, and pre-existing, co-morbid conditions and the risk of diabetes treatment-related side effects (e.g. hypoglycaemia). Given the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the UK, and the clinical benefits associated with antihyperglycaemic treatments, the present study was conducted to assess the association between patient age and initiation of antihyperglycaemic medication in UK patients following diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^117SpZm5]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

### Hypoglycemia: minimizing its impact in type 2 diabetes [^114ToLz5]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the risks and impact of hypoglycemia and provide guidance for the prevention of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Methods

We review and discuss the risks and impact of hypoglycemia, providing specific guidance regarding the prevention of hypoglycemia and judicial selection of glucose-lowering agents in individuals with T2DM.

Results

Hypoglycemia in T2DM is underrecognized and underreported. Emerging evidence from large clinical trials suggest that hypoglycemia may be an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in T2DM. In addition, hypoglycemia is associated with reduced quality of life, greater healthcare utilization costs, and poor adherence to medical regiments.

Conclusion

These findings have led professional organizations to emphasize the prevention of hypoglycemia as an important consideration when initiating or intensifying treatment regimens. In clinical settings, particular attention should be paid to a patient's risk for hypoglycemia when initiating or intensifying the pharmacological treatment regimen. The endocrinologist can play an important role in educating not only the patient, but also other members of the diabetes-management team regarding the need for individualized therapy.

### Approach to the patient with type 2 diabetes requiring add-on medication [^115p3jJX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In the last 20 years, the number of approved agents and agent classes for management of type 2 diabetes has expanded significantly. This more robust armamentarium affords us the opportunity to utilize drugs with complementary modes of action to address progressive hyperglycemia as insulin secretion declines over time. Furthermore, some of these agents provide additional benefits, such as weight loss, prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and protection against declining renal function. This dramatic increase of treatment options has led to complex published treatment advice which may be challenging for the busy clinician. A critical element in medication selection is awareness of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)-lowering potency of the agent being considered, and the distance of the patient's HbA1c level from the individualized goal. Other important factors in choosing medication as diabetes progresses include the recognition that there is a diminishing return of glucose-lowering efficacy as add-on agents are introduced, and that the extent of benefit for cardiac and renal protection is not fully understood. In addition, the availability of newer non-insulin agents may distract the clinician from utilizing insulin, the most potent agent available. The goal of this article is to provide a straightforward approach to add-on medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recognizing the limits of polypharmacy and the importance of employing agents best suited to achieving treatment targets. Proposed is a practical tool which provides stepwise guidance, utilizing available data on medication efficacy, while allowing flexibility based on clinician and patient preference.

Clinicians should "Discontinue DPP-4 inhibitor before starting", mitigate nausea by recommending "small portion sizes for meals, start at the lowest dose, and up-titrate as tolerated toward the goal dose used in CV outcome trials", and "Advise patients to undergo appropriate, guideline-recommended eye examinations before starting therapy if not done within the last 12 months".

### Is time ready for combination therapy at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes? [^112VoQt7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence is showing a range of beneficial effects for GLP-1 receptor agonists and especially SGLT-2 inhibitors on the cardio-renal axis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Preliminary findings suggest that: 1- such benefit extends also to patients with T2D without pre-existing CVD; and 2- background therapies do not modify the effect of these drugs. Given these considerations, some authors advanced the hypothesis that these novel agents might undermine the first-line position of metformin in the treatment algorithm of T2D. Here, we briefly discuss some pros and cons of such scenario, proposing a "starting" combination therapy with metformin plus one novel agent with trial-proven benefit as the best option to make use of the available knowledge and minimize the risk of complications in patients with newly diagnosed T2D.

### Comparing the effects of insulin glargine and thiazolidinediones on plasma lipids in type 2 diabetes: a patient-level pooled analysis [^116YgTWj]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our analysis suggests that insulin has beneficial effects on lipids and glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. The clinical impact of this observation on cardiovascular risk reduction will be addressed specifically in the ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention) trial. This randomized controlled study was designed to evaluate the effects of insulin glargine on cardiovascular risk and mortality in a variety of dysglycaemic patients (i.e. impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes) who are at high risk for a cardiovascular event. Therefore, the findings of this study will be applicable to a broad spectrum of patients with glycaemic abnormalities.

The choice of antihyperglycaemics should be individualized according to the patient's medical history, disease characteristics, comorbidities, baseline A 1c, lifestyle, body weight, and risk of adverse events. Insulin glargine might be more appropriate for patients requiring a greater reduction in A 1c, whereas TZD might be more appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycaemia. On the basis of our study, either insulin glargine or pioglitazone can be chosen if additional benefits on lipids are a consideration for choosing an antihyperglycaemic agent. Insulin glargine might be more appropriate, for instance, in patients taking a lipid-lowering medication, in light of the synergistic effects of statins and insulin glargine observed in this study, whereas pioglitazone may be preferred if HDL is very low.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to prevention of CVD, glucose-lowering medications, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating metformin to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM without ASCVD or severe target-organ damage at low, moderate,
high, or very high risk.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and lipid management in diabetes mellitus — persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D) without ASCVD and with less than 2 traditional risk factors should be assessed with one of the ASCVD risk calculators to determine initiation and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy, and clinicians should assess nontraditional ASCVD risk factors beyond a lipid panel to guide management when the initial shared decision is not self-evident. Manage persons with prediabetes and persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the age of 40 in the same manner as those with T2D. In persons with high ASCVD risk, use a moderate-intensity statin regardless of DM type or status; in very high ASCVD risk (including family history of premature ASCVD in men < 55 y and women < 65 y), use a high-intensity statin regardless of baseline LDL-C level, and for extreme risk use a high-intensity statin plus other therapies as needed to achieve lipid targets. Treatment targets are specified by risk: high (LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, apolipoprotein B [apo B] < 90 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), very high (LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, apo B < 80 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL), and extreme (LDL-C < 55 mg/dL, apo B < 70 mg/dL, non-HDL-C < 90 mg/dL). Statins are recommended for the initial treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Monitor efficacy every 6 to 12 wk and increase the dose or intensity of statin as needed to achieve goals; once targets are achieved, lipid panel or apo B can be monitored less often. Combining the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe with a statin may be considered when the desired lipid targets are not achieved with a maximally tolerated statin dose; alternately add bempedoic acid or consider adding icosapent ethyl (in persons with triglycerides 135 to 499 mg/dL) for ASCVD risk reduction. Management of hypertriglyceridemia in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk should begin with intensive lifestyle modification and statin therapy; in those on a maximally tolerated statin who have triglyceride concentrations ≥ 200 mg/dL and HDL-C < 40 mg/dL, add a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acid to achieve the desired apo B or non-HDL-C goal, and icosapent ethyl can be considered in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk.

### Glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes initiating second-line therapy: results from the global DISCOVER study programme [^114Fbvob]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The positive association between use of combination glucose‐lowering therapy as first‐line treatment and poor glycaemic control is probably explained by the fact that patients with high HbA1c levels at the time of diagnosis require more intensive pharmacological treatment than patients with lower HbA1c levels, as per clinical guideline recommendations. 6 However, these intensive treatments may fail to control glycaemia adequately, which is why HbA1c levels could remain high and require initiation of second‐line therapy. As described previously, 21, 37 our findings also showed a positive association between having a history of microvascular complications and having HbA1c levels > 8.0%. This finding is consistent with evidence that intensive glycaemic control for a prolonged period decreases the incidence of microvascular complications. 37 However, longitudinal data from DISCOVER are required to confirm a relationship between changes in HbA1c trajectories and the incidence of diabetes complications in the present study cohort.

An interesting finding in the present study was that close to 20% of patients in the study cohort had HbA1c < 7.0%. This was somewhat unexpected, given that this is a population of patients who are initiating second‐line glucose‐lowering therapy. The finding that the majority of these patients cited efficacy as the reason for changing treatment was also surprising, although it is notable that this proportion of patients was lower than in the overall population of patients with available HbA1c or FPG measurements. Similarly, although almost half of patients with HbA1c < 7.0% cited efficacy as a reason for choosing a second‐line therapy, this was lower than in the overall patient population. It could be the case that the patients with HbA1c < 7.0% in the present study were early in their disease trajectory and therefore had been set HbA1c targets below 7.0% by their physicians, consistent with guideline recommendations for patients with few comorbidities and low risk of hypoglycaemia. 7

Type 2 diabetes — Table 5 opportunities to initiate SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated cardiovascular or renal benefit: Suggested initiation scenarios include in a patient with T2D and ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA); at the time of diagnosis of clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) in a patient with T2D on a regimen without these agents; at the time of diagnosis of T2D in a patient with clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor); at hospital discharge with close outpatient follow-up after admission for ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) events; in a patient with T2D and diabetic kidney disease (SGLT2 inhibitor, alternatively GLP-1RA for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2); and in patients determined to be at high risk of ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor). At the time of hospital discharge or in the outpatient setting, increased vigilance regarding hypoglycemia surveillance is warranted, especially in background insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, and clinicians should use judgment when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if renal function is impaired or an ACE inhibitor/ARB will be started or up-titrated.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes recently commenced on sglt-2 inhibitors: an ongoing concern [^112q1SXd]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are increasingly used as an adjunctive treatment for type 2 diabetes. We report the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in 3 patients with type 2 diabetes recently commenced on SGLT-2 inhibitors.

Methods

Clinical presentation, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes of all 3 cases are described.

Results

All 3 patients had documented history of longstanding type 2 diabetes. The presentation in all patients was that of hyperglycaemia, acidosis, and ketosis occurring within 4 weeks of commencing SGLT-2 inhibitors. The risk factors for developing DKA were infection, myocardial infarction, and alcohol excess. DKA resolved within 24 hours of initiating intravenous fluids and insulin in all cases.

Conclusion

This case series illustrates the importance of careful patient selection, education, and monitoring when starting this group of antidiabetic medications.

Summary and Practical Considerations

Recent evidence from CVOTs and real-world studies provides robust support for the initiation of SGLT2i medication in people with T2DM and who either have established CVD or are at risk of developing CVD, and HF in particular, or at risk of renal decline and progression into CKD. It has been demonstrated that SGLT2i treatment in T2DM is efficacious in reducing HbA1c and is well tolerated. In addition, SGLT2i treatment has secondary benefits in terms of weight loss and lowering BP and has minimal risk of increased incidence of hypoglycaemia.

In selecting efficacious treatment for people with T2DM and risk of CVD, the ADA/EASD consensus statement notes that both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA interventions may be appropriate, and recommend determining the existence of established CVD, or the probable risk of developing CVD or CKD. In people with T2DM and established ASCVD, either a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor, with demonstrated efficacy in improving CV outcomes, can be selected, post metformin. Where the risk of developing CKD or HF is the HCP's main concern, the initiation of SGLT2i therapy is recommended. If SGLT2i treatment is not tolerated or not appropriate (the patient has an eGFR outside of the licensed range, for example), then a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated CV outcome benefit should be used.

Here, the Improving Diabetes Steering Committee provides practical advice on the use of SGLT2i treatment in four major groups of people with T2DM: people with established CVD, people at high risk for developing CVD, people at lower risk of developing CVD and frail people. Level of evidence was graded according to ADA standards (Table 1). A simple 'traffic light' approach to clinical considerations in these populations is provided in Table 2.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

Medications

The characteristics of currently available glucose-lowering interventions, when used as monotherapy, are summarized in Table 1. The glucose-lowering effectiveness of individual therapies and combinations demonstrated in clinical trials is predicated not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention but also on the duration of diabetes, baseline glycemia, previous therapy, and other factors. A major factor in selecting a class of drugs, or a specific medication within a class, to initiate therapy or when changing therapy, is the ambient level of glycemic control. When levels of glycemia are high (e.g. A1C > 8.5%), classes with greater and more rapid glucose-lowering effectiveness, or potentially earlier initiation of combination therapy, are recommended; however, patients with recent-onset diabetes often respond adequately to less intensive interventions than those with longer-term disease. When glycemic levels are closer to the target levels (e.g. A1C < 7.5%), medications with lesser potential to lower glycemia and/or a slower onset of action may be considered.

Obviously, the choice of glycemic goals and the medications used to achieve them must be individualized for each patient, balancing the potential for lowering A1C and anticipated long-term benefit with specific safety issues, as well as other characteristics of regimens, including side effects, tolerability, ease of use, long-term adherence, expense, and the nonglycemic effects of the medications. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by worsening glycemia; higher doses and additional medications are required over time if treatment goals are to be met.

5 HYPOGLYCAEMIA

5.1 Incidence and risk factors

The incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients with T2DM initiating basal insulin is relatively low. It is estimated that less than 10% of patients with T2DM initiating basal insulin experience hypoglycaemia after 1–2 years of follow‐up. The incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in these patients is even lower,: less than 1% up to 4 years follow‐up.

Fear of hypoglycaemia is common and associated with discontinuation of insulin therapy even in patients who have not actually experienced hypoglycaemia. Understanding and addressing patients' feelings and concerns about hypoglycaemia is critical for successful treatment. It is important for patients to understand the potential risk factors for hypoglycaemia. Some of the common causes of hypoglycaemia are listed in Table 3.

TABLE 3
Common causes of hypoglycaemia

Patients at risk of hypoglycaemia should be identified and modifiable risk factors should be adjusted (e.g. discontinuation of SU therapy). Risk factors for developing severe hypoglycaemia include comorbidities (e.g. renal function impairment), diabetes duration, advanced age, history of severe hypoglycaemia, high glycaemic variability, microvascular complications, and SU use. In such patients, less stringent glycaemic goals may need to be set and some may need additional monitoring or education.

5.2 What guidance should be provided for recognizing and treating hypoglycaemia?

Patients and their family members/caregivers should be educated on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia can occur quickly, and people can experience different symptoms. The advice given to patients and their family members/caregivers should empower them to recognize and address hypoglycaemia effectively without scaring them. Understanding and addressing feelings and concerns about hypoglycaemia before and during insulin treatment is critical. If experiencing symptoms of hypoglycaemia, patients should measure their blood glucose if possible, follow the '15–15 rule' and contact their healthcare provider (See Table 4). Where appropriate, care providers should be educated in rescue treatments such as oral glucose gels and intramuscular or nasal glucagon. Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of level 2 hypoglycaemia, defined as blood glucose < 54 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/L), to ensure availability in emergency situations.

The '15–15' rule a

5.3 What steps should be taken following an episode of hypoglycaemia?

It is critical to understand what may have induced the hypoglycaemic episode and how future episodes can be prevented. Table 5 lists steps to be considered when evaluating the cause of hypoglycaemia. Preventive measures should be considered in high risk patients such as always carrying a source of rapid‐acting carbohydrate whenever leaving home.m

### Clinical considerations for use of initial combination therapy in type 2 diabetes [^116dChC3]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disorder characterized by increasing hyperglycemia and the need to gradually intensify therapy in order to achieve and maintain glycemic control. Early initiation of combination therapy has been proposed as an approach to achieve glycemic goals earlier and delay the deterioration of glycemic control and with possible better preservation of β-cell function. We discuss in this article the pros and cons of this approach, focusing on individuals with HbA1c at diagnosis of 7.5–9.0%, where difference of opinion still exists on management. Initial combination therapy is proposed to lead to better and faster achievement of glycemic targets versus monotherapy and to impede clinical inertia and may possibly slow the deterioration of β-cell function. However, treating patients with sequential therapy is proposed to allow one to fully assess the efficacy and risk-to-benefit ratio of each drug as it is added. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support that rapid addition and titration of medications according to the glycemic profile achieved are inferior to initial combination therapy if glycemic targets are attained in a timely manner. Initial combination therapy is argued to postpone clinical inertia to the next decision point but does not eliminate it. Additionally, it may have been the agents chosen and not the timing of their initiation that led to improved β-cell function in the studies of initial combination therapy, and there are no data currently comparing use of the same drugs initiated simultaneously or sequentially. Heightened awareness of providers, individualization of therapy and setting, and reaching glycemic targets remain the mainstays of care.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116McLQy]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular therapies — benefits, risks, and cautions for SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs include efficacy and adverse-effect profiles along with practical considerations. SGLT2 inhibitors with demonstrated CV benefit reduce MACE, incident HF, HF hospitalization, and CV death but increase the risk of genital mycotic infections, polyuria, and potential volume depletion; GLP-1RAs with demonstrated CV benefit reduce MACE and progression of macroalbuminuria but are associated with transient nausea and vomiting. Both classes have nonglycemic benefits in systolic blood pressure and weight and have a low risk of hypoglycemia on their own or with metformin and other oral glucose-lowering medications (except insulin secretagogues). Notably, dapagliflozin was used safely even in patients without diabetes in the DAPA-HF trial; injectable GLP-1RAs use a small needle and pen device, and the first oral GLP-1RA, semaglutide, has been approved by the FDA for improving glycemic control in patients with T2D. Caution is suggested when starting an SGLT2 inhibitor in those with peripheral artery disease, severe peripheral neuropathy, lower extremity diabetic ulcers, or soft tissue infections; for active proliferative retinopathy when a significant rapid HbA1c reduction is expected, consider a GLP-1RA alternative to semaglutide SQ; and caution is suggested with GLP-1RA use in patients with active gallbladder disease or a history of pancreatitis.

### How doctors choose medications to treat type 2 diabetes: a national survey of specialists and academic generalists [^114mvVBd]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Glycemic control remains suboptimal despite the wide range of available medications. More effective medication prescription might result in better control. However, the process by which physicians choose glucose-lowering medicines is poorly understood. We sought to study the means by which physicians choose medications for type 2 diabetic patients.

Research Design and Methods

We surveyed 886 physician members of either the Society of General Internal Medicine (academic generalists, response rate 30%) or the American Diabetes Association (specialists, response rate 23%) currently managing patients with type 2 diabetes. Respondents weighed the importance of 15 patient, physician, and nonclinical factors when deciding which medications to prescribe for type 2 diabetic subjects at each of three management stages (initiation, use of second-line oral agents, and insulin).

Results

Respondents reported using a median of five major considerations (interquartile range 4–6) at each stage. Frequently cited major considerations included overall assessment of the patient's health/comorbidity, A1C level, and patient's adherence behavior but not expert guidelines/hospital algorithms or patient age. For insulin initiation, academic generalists placed greater emphasis on patient adherence (76 vs. 60% of specialists, P < 0.001). These generalists also identified patient fear of injections (68%) and patient desire to prolong noninsulin therapy (68%) as major insulin barriers. Overall, qualitative factors (e.g., adherence, motivation, overall health assessment) were somewhat more highly considered than quantitative factors (e.g. A1C, age, weight) with mean aggregate scores of 7.3 vs. 6.9 on a scale of 0–10, P < 0.001.

Conclusions

The physicians in our survey considered a wide range of qualitative and quantitative factors when making medication choices for hyperglycemia management. The apparent complexity of the medication choice process contrasts with current evidence-based treatment guidelines.

### Initiation of glucose-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in general practice [^116dYAVp]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

The purpose of this study was to investigate which factors determine the initiation of glucose-lowering therapy in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in general practice and their future glycaemic control.

Methods

All incident Type 2 diabetic patients in the general practices in a Dutch middle-sized town from 1994 to 2000 were identified. Factors associated with initiation of glucose-lowering therapy were obtained from clinical files and examined by Cox's regression analyses. Using anova, the associations between clinical characteristics at diagnosis and future glycaemic control were investigated.

Results

In total, 603 newly diagnosed patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in the study. In the first month following diagnosis, 319 (53%) started with oral therapy. One, two and three years after diagnosis of diabetes, the cumulative incidences were 71% (95% CI 66–73%), 75% (71–79%) and 81% (77–84%), respectively. Age, gender, body weight, blood pressure, history of cardiovascular disease or total serum cholesterol values were not associated with time to start of drug therapy. An increased plasma glucose level at diagnosis was strongly related to faster initiation of drug therapy and worse future glycaemic control. Immediate initiation of glucose-lowering medication was not related to future glycaemic control.

Conclusion

This study shows that the initial severity of diabetes, assessed by the degree of hyperglycaemia at time of diagnosis, is a major factor in determining the time to start of glucose-lowering drugs and the likelihood of achieving target levels of glycaemic control in the future, independent of glucose-lowering strategy. Therefore, patients with high glucose levels at diagnosis need close monitoring from the beginning of their disease.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116uW7GJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to take into account individualized glycemic and weight goals, presence of comorbidities (cardiovascular, kidney, liver, and other metabolic comorbidities), and the risk of hypoglycemia when choosing glucose-lowering therapy modification.

### Pathophysiologic approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^117NVbjB]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Two general approaches to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been advocated. 1) A "guideline" approach that advocates sequential addition of antidiabetes agents with "more established use"; this approach more appropriately should be called the "treat to failure" approach, and deficiencies with this approach have been discussed. And 2) a "pathophysiologic" approach using initial combination therapy with agents known to correct established pathophysiologic defects in T2DM. Within the pathophysiologic approach, choice of antidiabetes agents should take into account the patient's general health status and associated medical disorders. This individualized approach, which we refer to as the ABCD(E) of diabetes treatment, has been incorporated into the updated American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines.
A = A ge
B = B ody weight
C = C omplications (microvascular and macrovascular)
D = D uration of diabetes
E = L ife Ex pectancy
E = E xpense

Even though physicians must be cognizant of these associated conditions (ABCDE) when initiating therapy in newly diagnosed T2DM patients, we believe that the most important consideration is to select antidiabetes agents that correct specific pathophysiologic disturbances present in T2DM and that have complementary mechanisms of action. Although it has been argued that the pathogenesis of T2DM differs in different ethnic groups, evidence to support this is weak. Although the relative contributions of β-cell failure and insulin resistance to development of glucose intolerance may differ in different ethnic groups, the core defects of insulin resistance in muscle/liver/adipocytes and progressive β-cell failure are present in virtually all T2DM patients and must be treated aggressively to prevent the relentless rise in HbA 1c that is characteristic of T2DM.

In subsequent sections, we provide a review of the natural history of T2DM, specific pathophysiologic abnormalities responsible for T2DM, currently available antidiabetes agents and their mechanism of action, recommended glycemic goals, and use of combination therapy based upon reversal of pathophysiologic defects present in T2DM. We will not address expense but recognize that this is an important consideration in choosing any antidiabetes regimen.

### Hypoglycemia [^11746XQr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoglycemia is a common, potentially avoidable consequence of diabetes treatment and is a major barrier to initiating or intensifying antihyperglycemic therapy in efforts to achieve better glycemic control. Therapy regimen and a history of hypoglycemia are the most important predictors of future events. Other risk factors include renal insufficiency, older age, and history of hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure. Reported rates of hypoglycemia vary considerably among studies because of differences in study design, definitions used, and population included, among other factors. Although occurring more frequently in type 1 diabetes, hypoglycemia also is clinically important in type 2 diabetes. Symptoms experienced by patients vary among individuals, and many events remain undiagnosed. The incidence of severe events is unevenly distributed, with only a small proportion (∼ 5%) of individuals accounting for > 50% of events. Consequently, clinicians must be conscientious in obtaining thorough patient histories, because an accurate picture of the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic events is essential for optimal diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia in particular is associated with an increased risk of mortality, impairments in cognitive function, and adverse effects on patients' quality of life. Economically, hypoglycemia burdens the healthcare system and adversely affects workplace productivity, particularly after a nocturnal event. Ongoing healthcare reform efforts will result in even more emphasis on reducing this side effect of diabetes treatment. Therefore, improving patients' self-management skills and selecting or modifying therapy to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia will increase in importance for clinicians and patients alike.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111qpTGw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — initial and add-on therapy emphasize that metformin (unless contraindicated) and lifestyle modifications are the first steps in managing type 2 diabetes in most patients; clinicians should prioritize adding SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and CHF or CKD and should prioritize adding GLP-1 agonists in patients with an increased risk for stroke or when total body weight loss is an important goal; clinicians should aim to achieve HbA1c levels between 7% and 8% in most adults with type 2 diabetes and deintensify pharmacologic treatments in adults with HbA1c levels less than 6.5%; self-monitoring of blood glucose might be unnecessary for patients not receiving insulin; when SGLT-2 or GLP-1 therapy yields adequate glycemic control, clinicians should reduce or discontinue sulfonylureas or long-acting insulins due to increased risk for severe hypoglycemia; sulfonylureas and long-acting insulins are inferior to SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity but may have limited value for glycemic control.

SGLT2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) versus GLP-1RAs (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) — administration and factors prompting an alternative class: Mode of administration differs, with SGLT2 inhibitors oral and GLP-1RAs subcutaneous. Considerations that may prompt use of an alternative class for SGLT2 inhibitors include severely reduced kidney function, history of prior amputation, severe peripheral arterial disease, active diabetic foot ulcers (caution with canagliflozin), recurrent genital candidiasis, diabetic ketoacidosis, fracture (caution with canagliflozin), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding; for GLP-1RAs, considerations include persistent nausea despite appropriate dietary education and low doses, gastroparesis, active gallbladder disease, history of MEN2 or medullary thyroid cancer, history of proliferative retinopathy (caution with semaglutide or dulaglutide), and if the patient is considering pregnancy or breast feeding. Renal function notes specify that eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 is a caution for glycemic efficacy, the FDA label for canagliflozin allows use to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 in DKD, and to use clinical judgement when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if an ACE inhibitor or ARB is being started or up-titrated and renal function is impaired.

### Guideline approach to therapy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [^111wdWcV]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Case for guidelines

Evidence-based recommendations should be at the core of the guidelines. Not all practice guidelines on antihyperglycemic drugs, however, are consistent with available evidence. Patient enrollment in clinical studies is also based mainly on baseline A1C, and treatment of a comparator is sometimes chosen unrelated to its pathophysiologic effect on hyperglycemia.

Our past experience with antihyperglycemic drugs is that recommendations to stepwise increase these drugs whenever A1C is above target might fail to prevent disease progression, necessitating intensive insulin therapy over time. This might be due to delayed reaction by the physician to a patient's change in A1C. One possible reason for this delay is that the other antihyperglycemic drugs (other than metformin), i.e. sulfonylureas and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, have side effects that discourage physicians from recommending them as soon as A1C is above target. Introduction of insulin therapy in patients not at target, in particular, is also delayed substantially. At this stage, aiming to target with intensive insulin therapy might increase the risk for morbidity and mortality while the already long hyperglycemic exposure still puts the patient at great risk for late micro- and macrovascular complications (,–). The newer available drugs (incretins as well as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors), owing to their efficacy and relatively mild side effects, could change physicians' inertia in such a way that they will prescribe these drugs at a much earlier stage — as soon as A1C is above target. This earlier intervention could prevent treat to failure and be as effective as early combination therapy.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults-2024 update [^114yCGpj]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, metformin, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic medication due to its durable efficacy in lowering HbA1c, negligible risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain, relatively mild side effect profile, long-term track record, and affordability.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^114dK8ee]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Tier 1: well-validated core therapies

These interventions represent the best established and most effective and cost-effective therapeutic strategy for achieving the target glycemic goals. The tier one algorithm is the preferred route of therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Step 1: lifestyle intervention and metformin.

Based on the numerous demonstrated short- and long-term benefits that accrue when weight loss and increased levels of activity are achieved and maintained, as well as the cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions when they succeed, the consensus is that lifestyle interventions should be initiated as the first step in treating new-onset type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2). These interventions should be implemented by health care professionals with appropriate training — usually registered dietitians experienced in behavioral modification — and be sensitive to ethnic and cultural differences among populations. Moreover, lifestyle interventions to improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels, and to promote weight loss or at least avoid weight gain, should remain an underlying theme throughout the management of type 2 diabetes, even after medications are used. For the 10–20% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are not obese or overweight, modification of dietary composition and activity levels may play a supporting role, but medications are still generally required early in the course of diabetes (seebelow).

The authors recognize that for most individuals with type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions fail to achieve or maintain the metabolic goals either because of failure to lose weight, weight regain, progressive disease, or a combination of factors. Therefore, our consensus is that metformin therapy should be initiated concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis. Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy, in the absence of specific contraindications, for its effect on glycemia, absence of weight gain or hypoglycemia, generally low level of side effects, high level of acceptance, and relatively low cost. Metformin treatment should be titrated to its maximally effective dose over 1–2 months, as tolerated (see text box, entitled Titration of Metformin). Rapid addition of other glucose-lowering medications should be considered in the setting of persistent symptomatic hyperglycemia.

### Current and new treatment options for adults recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^116G6PJt]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Update and next steps for real-world translation of interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^114HQ7cX]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million adults worldwide now have diabetes and 318 million have impaired glucose tolerance. These numbers are expected to increase to 642 million and 482 million, respectively, by 2040. This burgeoning pandemic places an enormous burden on countries worldwide, particularly resource-poor regions. Numerous landmark trials evaluating both intensive lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions have persuasively demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or its onset can be delayed in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, key challenges remain, including how to scale up such approaches for widespread translation and implementation, how to select appropriately from various interventions and tailor them for different populations and settings, and how to ensure that preventive interventions yield clinically meaningful, cost-effective outcomes. In June 2015, a Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum convened to discuss these issues. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, begins with a summary of seminal prevention trials, followed by a discussion of considerations for selecting appropriate populations for intervention and the clinical implications of the various diagnostic criteria for prediabetes. The authors outline knowledge gaps in need of elucidation and explore a possible new avenue for securing regulatory approval of a prevention-related indication for metformin, as well as specific considerations for future pharmacological interventions to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. They conclude with descriptions of some innovative, pragmatic translational initiatives already under way around the world.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges? [^111Rg2EU]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Given the continued interest in defining the optimal management of individuals with type 2 diabetes, the Editor of Diabetes Care convened a working party of diabetes specialists to examine this topic in the context of insulin therapy. This was prompted by recent new evidence on the use of insulin in such people. The group was aware of evidence that the benefits of insulin therapy are still usually offered late, and thus the aim of the discussion was how to define the optimal timing and basis for decisions regarding insulin and to apply these concepts in practice. It was noted that recent evidence had built upon that of the previous decades, together confirming the benefits and safety of insulin therapy, albeit with concerns about the potential for hypoglycemia and gain in body weight. Insulin offers a unique ability to control hyperglycemia, being used from the time of diagnosis in some circumstances, when metabolic control is disturbed by medical illness, procedures, or therapy, as well as in the longer term in ambulatory care. For those previously starting insulin, various other forms of therapy can be added later, which offer complementary effects appropriate to individual needs. Here we review current evidence and circumstances in which insulin can be used, consider individualized choices of alternatives and combination regimens, and offer some guidance on personalized targets and tactics for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

Tier 2: less well-validated therapies

In selected clinical settings, this second-tier algorithm may be considered. Specifically, when hypoglycemia is particularly undesirable (e.g. in patients who have hazardous jobs), the addition of exenatide or pioglitazone may be considered. Rosiglitazone is not recommended. If promotion of weight loss is a major consideration and the A1C level is close to target (< 8.0%), exenatide is an option. If these interventions are not effective in achieving target A1C, or are not tolerated, addition of a sulfonylurea could be considered. Alternatively, the tier two interventions should be stopped and basal insulin started.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes: barriers and solutions for improving uptake in routine clinical practice [^116sBVNW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

6. CONCLUSIONS

The decision to initiate SGLT‐2 inhibitor therapy in T2D is probably impacted by multiple factors including inconsistencies in guideline recommendations, safety concerns, patient characteristics, cost considerations, and the specialty of the healthcare provider. In order to improve uptake, further education of both patients and providers regarding the benefits versus the risks of SGLT‐2 inhibitors in patients with T2D is needed. Support, particularly early in the treatment course, and with standpoints from all relevant specialties, including cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, and primary care, independent of glycaemic benefits, is needed.

With regard to guidelines, safety issues associated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors must be clarified, with clear guidance on patient eligibility provided, and indications such as CKD, heart failure, and cardiovascular disease must be defined clearly to provide further clarity for prescribing clinicians. Formulary committees should consider the cost‐effectiveness of SGLT‐2 inhibitor medications and quality‐adjusted life years. Ultimately, more uniform implementation of this therapy in line with trial findings and labelled indications could improve outcomes for patients with T2D.

### Pivotal role of timely basal insulin replacement after metformin failure in sustaining long-term blood glucose control at a target in type 2 diabetes [^1173S3GP]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION — EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF DIABETES CONSENSUS

The 2008 consensus of the American Diabetes Association (ADA)–European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) proposes lifestyle intervention along with metformin at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes to rapidly reduce A1C levels to < 7.0%. This "step 1" is generally well accepted, and, in fact, it is common clinical experience that combining medical nutrition treatment and physical exercise, along with metformin, reduces A1C to < 7.0% in a significant number of subjects. However, in subjects presenting with severely elevated blood glucose (A1C > 9–10%), initiation of insulin controls hyperglycemia more rapidly than oral hypoglycemic agents.

Some patients never satisfactorily respond to lifestyle modifications and metformin and do not reduce A1C to < 7.0% within a few months of treatment initiation. Other patients, after an initial successful response to lifestyle modification + metformin, may lose the response within months or a few years; therefore, their A1C progressively increases beyond the value of 7.0%. This is the time at which an aggressive "add on" treatment has to be initiated to rapidly control A1C to < 7.0% and maintain it over a long period of time ("step 2" of the ADA-EASD consensus). To successfully implement step 2, several preliminary considerations should be made. First, the initiation of step 2 should be timely, i.e. the decision should be made as early as possible after failure of step 1 to maintain A1C < 7.0%. This scenario requires consistent monitoring of A1C every 2–3 months, which makes it possible to identify the trend for progressive increases of A1C from values of 6–6.5 to 7.0%. Perhaps it would be better to move to step 2 immediately before, not after, A1C has already trespassed the threshold of 7.0%.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^111amviP]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Key takeaways

Recent new guideline recommendations ready to be routinely incorporated into routine practice include the following: ◦ Complication-centric prescribing should take center stage. Treatment plans should no longer 'silo' hyperglycemia as a single treatment target but rather manage it synchronously with the patient's comorbidities and risk factors. ◦ In patients with cardiorenal risk factors, long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) have been shown to provide protection and are recommended as preferred treatments. ◦ A novel algorithm enables treatment decision-making for latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) based on glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and C-peptide testing
Several key advances in the management of type 2 diabetes are supported by strong evidence that make these ready for use in routine care, despite remaining in a 'holding pattern' before full integration into guidelines. These include: ◦ The pleiotropic benefits of several antidiabetic agents provide important new considerations to treatment decision-making; and, should be employed in treatment selection in the clinic. ◦ Disease remission should be elevated to a primary objective of case management of type 2 diabetes beyond the role it had in past routine care. The inherent resilience of beta cells can be harnessed to help remit hyperglycemia through the use of diet and lifestyle modifications and/or short-term intensive pharmacotherapy.
The underpinnings of type 2 diabetes etiology and progression have been corrected. In particular, ◦ Early type 2 diabetes is no longer considered an intractable ('inexorable') state. Beta cells, in fact, remain robust and resilient through much of the course of the disease, and with support, can resume partial or complete glucoregulation. ◦ Type 2 diabetes is not a single disease across all patients, nor does it arise from the same defects. Accordingly, tailored therapy is imperative. ◦ Precision medicine veers away from management to treatment failure with sequential add-on therapy. Instead, targeted therapy can address the individual drivers of hyperglycemia in each patient without agents that are ineffective in the given patient. ◦ Target attainment is distinctly possible with current treatments, without treatment-emergent hypoglycemia. Intensive glucose control is pivotal for preventing or offsetting diabetes-related long-term outcomes. ◦ With the expanding antidiabetes armamentarium, it is possible to reduce reliance on sulfonylureas and exogenous insulin, which present less desirable benefit: risk profiles (including weight gain, hypoglycemia, and 'wear and tear' on beta cells) than many other currently available options.

T2DM Sick Day Rules

During periods of illness, people with T2DM should:
Contact their diabetes team if they are unsure about what to do,
Stay well hydrated (3 l fluid/day) and eat little and often,
Keep taking insulin and/or most other diabetes medications, but stop taking SGLT2i, metformin and GLP-1 RA medicines if they are unable to eat or drink, and contact their diabetes team for further directions,
If possible, keep a close record of blood glucose levels, at least every 4 h, including during the night,
If the blood glucose level is ≥ 15 mmol/l, urine/blood checks should be conducted to test ketone levels. Medical assistance should be sought when urine ketone levels are > 2 +/or blood ketone levels are > 3 mmol/l,
Maintain a normal meal pattern (where possible). If unable to eat or appetite is reduced, meals may be replaced with high-carbohydrate snacks or drinks (e.g. fruit juice, glucose tablets),
If vomiting, drowsy, unable to keep fluids down or suffering with persistent diarrhoea, medical help should be sought immediately.

Considerations When Initiating SGLT2i Therapies at an Early or Late Stage in the T2DM Treatment Pathway

SGLT2i agents may provide an effective option for people with T2DM at many stages along the treatment paradigm. Due to the increasing volume of evidence relating to the efficacy and safety profile of SGLT2i therapies in people with T2DM and CVD, these medicines are generally considered to be a logical option for many people as first-line, second-line or third-line therapy.

As previously discussed, overweight or obese people with T2DM may particularly benefit from these therapies. SGLT2is may be prescribed in combination with insulin, although caution should be used in those requiring an insulin dose reduction due to insulinopenia, as they may be predisposed to ketosis. SGLT2is may also be used in combination with GLP-1 RAs. However, there is less evidence available for the use of this therapy combination.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA): We recommend initiating a patient-clinician discussion about SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1RA therapy at a follow-up visit for patients with T2D who have or who are at very high risk for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and/or diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit is recommended for patients with T2D and HF, especially heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or who are at high risk of developing HF, DKD, clinically evident ASCVD, or combinations of these. A GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit is recommended for patients with established or at very high risk for ASCVD. Patients with T2D may become eligible for these therapies if they are subsequently hospitalized or diagnosed with ASCVD, HF, and/or DKD, although hospitalized patients were not included in most CV outcome trials and inpatient formularies may not include these agents. Outpatient adherence after an acute CV event can be favorably influenced by initiation at discharge. CV specialists should consider periodic screening for T2D by measuring HbA1c at guideline-recommended intervals (e.g., annually in patients with prediabetes). Patients with ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD and/or HF should consider initiation of an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit irrespective of HbA1c levels. Although canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin have differences in FDA-approved CV indications, they appear to have broadly similar CV and renal benefits, and the choice of an individual agent should be made after appropriate patient-clinician discussion of benefits and potential risks.

Cost and equity considerations for SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists — There are currently no generic SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists, but these formulations may become available, and clinicians should prescribe generic medications when they are available rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians and patients should discuss the cost of an add-on SGLT-2 inhibitor or GLP-1 agonist when selecting a medication from either drug class. Clinicians should be attentive to patient race and ethnicity as a social risk factor for diabetes, and worse health outcomes for type 2 diabetes may be mediated by such factors as social determinants of health.

### Beyond metformin: safety considerations in the decision-making process for selecting a second medication for type 2 diabetes management: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^113V44cB]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The trend toward personalized management of diabetes has focused attention on the differences among available pharmacological agents in terms of mechanisms of action, efficacy, and, most important, safety. Clinicians must select from these features to develop individualized therapy regimens. In June 2013, a nine-member Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum convened to review safety evidence for six major diabetes drug classes: insulin, sulfonylureas (SUs), thiazolidinediones (TZDs), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, summarizes well-delineated and theoretical safety concerns related to these drug classes, as well as the panelists' opinions regarding their best use in patients with type 2 diabetes. All of the options appear to have reasonably wide safety margins when used appropriately. Those about which we know the most-metformin, SUs, insulin, and perhaps now also TZDs-are efficacious in most patients and can be placed into a basic initial algorithm. However, these agents leave some clinical needs unmet. Selecting next steps is a more formidable process involving newer agents that are understood less well and for which there are unresolved questions regarding risk versus benefit in certain populations. Choosing a specific agent is not as important as implementing some form of early intervention and advancing rapidly to some form of combination therapy as needed. When all options are relatively safe given the benefits they confer, therapeutic decision making must rely on a personalized approach, taking into account patients' clinical circumstances, phenotype, pathophysiological defects, preferences, abilities, and costs.

Rationale for selecting specific combinations

More than one medication will be necessary for the majority of patients over time. Selection of the individual agents should be made on the basis of their glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics listed in Table 1. However, when adding second antihyperglycemic medications, the synergy of particular combinations and other interactions should be considered. In general, antihyperglycemic drugs with different mechanisms of action will have the greatest synergy. Insulin plus metformin is a particularly effective means of lowering glycemia while limiting weight gain.
