## Question

Diet advice for pre-diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diet advice for prediabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why prediabetes matters. Then, I should verify the overarching principle of individualization and the role of medical nutrition therapy. Next, I will examine core nutrition principles that apply across patterns, followed by evidence-based eating patterns. After that, I need to translate this into practical, culturally sensitive implementation with SMART goals and behavior change strategies. I should also consider special populations and monitoring, and finally synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation with supporting evidence and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why prediabetes warrants action. Prediabetes is common and carries a high lifetime risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, with approximately 5–10% annual progression and up to 70% lifetime risk, and it is also associated with increased cardiovascular risk, so early, structured lifestyle intervention is justified and impactful [^690812b6] [^6668fc94]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit from lifestyle change; yes, randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that lifestyle interventions can reduce progression by about 58% and increase regression to normoglycemia, with benefits persisting years after the intervention ends [^690812b6] [^521149ad].

> Next, I should review the overarching principle of individualization. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on macronutrient patterns. The ADA 2025 Standards emphasize that there is no single best dietary pattern and that macronutrient distribution should be individualized based on metabolic goals, preferences, and cultural context, with medical nutrition therapy delivered by a registered dietitian nutritionist when possible [^8f9a1d40] [^1fe3bfa8]. I need to ensure I'm aligning with high-quality guidance; the ACLM 2025 guideline similarly recommends prescribing a nutrition plan using SMART goals tailored to cultural background and framed in food-based advice, reflecting strong evidence and high confidence in benefit over harm [^91b2866a] [^77cc105d].

> I will now examine core nutrition principles that transcend specific eating patterns. Let me think about what consistently appears across guidelines. Emphasize whole, minimally processed foods; high fiber intake (about 14 g per 1,000 kcal); reduced saturated fat and avoidance of trans fats; limited added sugars and refined grains; and inclusion of nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds, lean proteins, and low-fat or non-dairy alternatives, while minimizing red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultraprocessed foods [^70f0ae3b] [^c1b7cd2d] [^ba46140b]. Hold on, I should verify the fiber recommendation source; yes, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics supports the USDA fiber target and links fiber to weight management and diabetes risk reduction, which is directly relevant to prediabetes [^ba46140b].

> Now, I should review evidence-based eating patterns. Let me consider Mediterranean-style patterns first. Multiple high-quality guidelines endorse Mediterranean-style eating for prediabetes because it improves glycemia, reduces progression to diabetes, and lowers cardiovascular risk, with benefits observed in both observational and interventional studies [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba]. I should double-check the strength of evidence; the ADA and AACE assign strong support to Mediterranean-style patterns for diabetes prevention and cardiometabolic risk reduction, which fits prediabetes care goals [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba].

> Next, I should review low-carbohydrate approaches. Low-carbohydrate diets, including ketogenic regimens, can improve A1C and weight in the short term, but effects on lipids vary and long-term superiority over other patterns is not established; thus, they are reasonable when individualized, with attention to fat quality and cardiovascular risk, and should be monitored closely [^46d40745] [^ccd5a93f]. Wait, let me verify the lipid trade-offs; yes, some trials show greater triglyceride reductions but potential increases in LDL on very-low-carb diets, reinforcing the need for individualized risk assessment and follow-up labs [^d356b652].

> I should also consider DASH and plant-predominant patterns. DASH and vegetarian or plant-predominant diets are supported for prediabetes prevention and align with the broader emphasis on whole foods, fiber, and reduced saturated fat; these patterns are reasonable alternatives when culturally acceptable and can be adapted to individual preferences and metabolic targets [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba]. Hold on, I should confirm that these are not just diabetes-treatment recommendations; indeed, prevention guidelines explicitly include these patterns for high-risk individuals, including those with prediabetes [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba].

> Translating this into practical, culturally sensitive implementation is critical. Let me verify the behavior-change framework. SMART goals, motivational interviewing, and structured programs improve adherence; referral to Diabetes Prevention Program–style interventions or comparable group-based programs is recommended, with at least 16 sessions over 6–12 months and ongoing support to sustain behavior change [^91b2866a] [^f254c43f]. I need to ensure I address barriers; culturally tailored content, language-concordant materials, and integration of traditional foods improve engagement, particularly in underserved populations such as South Asian communities, where misinformation and social pressures are common barriers [^818b0532].

> For weight management, I should confirm the dose–response. Weight loss of about 3–5% produces clinically meaningful improvements in glycemia and cardiometabolic risk, with a linear relationship up to roughly 9% for regression to normoglycemia and diabetes prevention; therefore, a realistic initial target is 5% weight loss, scaled to individual BMI and readiness [^521149ad] [^718ecd55]. But wait, what if the patient is not overweight? Even in normal-weight prediabetes, improving diet quality, increasing fiber, and enhancing physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce risk, so advice should be individualized rather than weight-centric alone [^notfound].

> I should confirm physical activity recommendations and their synergy with diet. At least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity plus resistance training 2–3 times weekly is advised, with higher volumes (200–300 minutes/week) often needed for weight maintenance after loss; reducing sedentary time further improves insulin sensitivity and glycemia [^d932ffba] [^97d68cd0]. Hold on, I should verify that these activity targets are endorsed for prediabetes specifically; yes, AACE and ADA prevention guidance explicitly include these targets for prediabetes management [^d932ffba] [^f254c43f].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In older adults, I need to ensure safety and feasibility; shared decision-making and simplified, nutrient-dense meal plans with adequate protein are key, and vitamin D supplementation may be considered in high-risk prediabetes when deficiency is present, alongside lifestyle therapy [^44b9f4ac] [^3ca0fba3]. For adolescents, family-based approaches and addressing developmental barriers improve adherence, and programs should be flexible to sustain interest over time [^dd8e69c9]. In pregnancy or post-GDM, structured MNT and continued lifestyle support reduce progression risk and should be prioritized [^notfound].

> Monitoring and follow-up are essential. I should confirm that people with prediabetes be screened at least annually for progression to diabetes, with more frequent checks if risk is high, and that labs such as fasting glucose, A1C, and a lipid panel guide risk reduction and medication decisions when indicated [^bce9e4e7] [^5f588b34]. Let me reconsider whether early pharmacotherapy has a role; metformin may be considered for high-risk prediabetes, particularly with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², age < 60, or combined IFG/IGT with additional risk factors, but lifestyle remains first-line and should be optimized concurrently [^602a2138] [^1e797267].

> I will now synthesize a concise, actionable recommendation. For adults with prediabetes, prescribe an individualized, whole-food, plant-predominant eating plan using SMART goals, aiming for 5% weight loss if overweight, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate activity plus resistance training, and referral to a structured lifestyle program when available; acceptable patterns include Mediterranean-style, DASH, vegetarian or plant-predominant, or carefully monitored low-carbohydrate approaches, all emphasizing fiber, minimizing refined grains and added sugars, and aligning with cultural preferences and metabolic targets [^91b2866a] [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the highest-quality sources; yes, this synthesis reflects ADA 2025, ACLM 2025, and AACE 2022 guidance and integrates dose–response weight-loss evidence and behavior-change principles [^8f9a1d40] [^91b2866a] [^d932ffba] [^521149ad].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is realistic and sustainable. Emphasize small, achievable changes, self-monitoring, social support, and relapse-prevention strategies; recognize that adherence wanes over time, so ongoing contact and periodic reassessment of goals, barriers, and preferences are necessary to maintain benefit and prevent progression to diabetes [^5050d3cd] [^f254c43f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that a single dietary pattern suits everyone; I should reiterate that no single pattern is superior for all, and success depends on individualization, adherence, and longitudinal support rather than any specific macronutrient ratio alone [^8f9a1d40] [^f254c43f].

For prediabetes, emphasize **individualized, whole-food, plant-predominant eating** [^91b2866a] with 5–10% weight loss [^521149ad] and at least 150 minutes/week of activity [^d932ffba]. No single macronutrient ratio fits all [^8f9a1d40]; prioritize **fiber-rich foods** (≥ 14 g/1,000 kcal) [^ba46140b], limit refined carbs and added sugars [^70f0ae3b], and choose healthy fats (MUFA/PUFA) over saturated/trans fats [^4f6967a5]. Mediterranean, DASH, and low-carb patterns are all acceptable [^f254c43f]; tailor to culture, preferences, and metabolic goals [^275f347a]. Monitor A1C every 6–12 months [^notfound] and refer to an RDN for MNT [^1fe3bfa8].

---

## Core dietary principles

Several **core dietary principles** are consistently recommended for individuals with prediabetes:

- **Individualized nutrition**: Dietary plans should be tailored to individual preferences, cultural background, and metabolic goals [^8f9a1d40] [^275f347a].

- **Whole-food, plant-predominant eating**: Emphasize whole foods, including nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins [^70f0ae3b] [^c1b7cd2d].

- **Caloric intake and weight management**: Aim for modest weight loss (5–10% of initial body weight) [^521149ad] to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce diabetes risk [^7219f64c].

- **Macronutrient distribution**: No specific macronutrient ratio is superior; macronutrient distribution should be individualized based on metabolic goals and preferences [^8f9a1d40] [^d96d3f50].

---

## Recommended dietary patterns

Several **dietary patterns** have been shown to be effective in managing prediabetes:

| **Dietary pattern** | **Key features** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Mediterranean diet | - High in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and olive oil <br/> - Moderate fish intake <br/> - Low in red and processed meats | Strong evidence for reducing diabetes risk and improving glycemic control [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba] |
| DASH diet | - High in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy <br/> - Low in saturated fats, sodium, and added sugars | Effective in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing diabetes risk [^f254c43f] [^d932ffba] |
| Low-carbohydrate diet | - Restricted carbohydrate intake (typically < 45% of total calories) <br/> - Emphasis on protein and healthy fats | Short-term improvements in glycemic control and weight loss; long-term sustainability and cardiovascular effects require monitoring [^46d40745] [^ccd5a93f] |
| Plant-based diet | - Emphasis on plant foods <br/> - Minimal or no animal products | Associated with improved insulin sensitivity and weight management [^notfound] |

---

## Specific dietary recommendations

- **Fiber intake**: Aim for at least 14 grams of fiber per 1,000 calories consumed [^ba46140b] to improve glycemic control and promote satiety [^3735fd30].

- **Carbohydrate management**: Focus on complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index [^4f6967a5]; limit refined carbohydrates and added sugars [^70f0ae3b].

- **Fat intake**: Prioritize monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (e.g. olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish); limit saturated and trans fats [^4f6967a5].

- **Protein intake**: Include lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, legumes, and tofu; distribute protein intake evenly throughout the day [^notfound].

- **Alcohol**: Limit alcohol consumption to moderate levels (≤ 1 drink/day for women, ≤ 2 drinks/day for men) [^922e7dad].

---

## Practical implementation strategies

Effective dietary management of prediabetes requires **practical implementation strategies**:

- **Medical nutrition therapy (MNT)**: Provided by a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) [^1fe3bfa8] to individualize dietary plans and provide ongoing support [^275f347a].

- **Behavioral interventions**: Incorporate behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and problem-solving to enhance adherence [^5050d3cd].

- **Physical activity**: Combine dietary interventions with regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise) [^d932ffba] [^03a6572c].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regularly monitor glycemic parameters (A1C, fasting glucose) and adjust dietary plans as needed [^bce9e4e7].

---

## Barriers and facilitators to adherence

Understanding barriers and facilitators to dietary adherence is essential for **successful management**:

- **Barriers**: Lack of knowledge, cultural differences, time constraints, and limited access to healthy foods [^818b0532].

- **Facilitators**: Education, cultural tailoring, social support, and practical cooking demonstrations [^818b0532].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dietary management of prediabetes should be **individualized**, emphasizing whole foods, weight management, and regular physical activity. Mediterranean, DASH, and low-carbohydrate diets are all effective options, and MNT by an RDN is recommended to optimize adherence and outcomes [^f254c43f] [^1fe3bfa8].

### A prospective observational study on maternal diet pre-and post-GDM diagnosis and pregnancy outcomes in individuals with / without GDM [^f549e093]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

To date, despite the extensive information on the influence of dietary factors on GDM, few studies have assessed the effect of a GDM diagnosis on pregnant individuals' dietary choices. Generally, maximal adherence to dietary recommendations among those with GDM reported in randomized trials ranges from 60–80%. However, limited data are available on adherence to GDM dietary recommendations in routine clinical practice. In New Zealand, 85.9% of individuals with GDM sought evaluation from a dietitian. Although rigorous RCTs can attempt to maximize compliance with dietary interventions for GDM, it remains unclear how much pregnant individuals receiving usual care in the real world context actually modify their dietary choices following a GDM diagnosis.

In China, the diagnosis of GDM is typically based on the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), which is performed in the late second trimester (24–28 weeks of gestation). Once diagnosed with GDM, pregnant individuals receive professional diet and exercise counseling, along with regular monitoring of blood glucose and urine glucose, provided by obstetricians, dietitians, and midwives. If necessary, patients are referred to specialized clinics such as "Obstetric Endocrinology Clinics" or "Gestational Diabetes Clinics" for more targeted interventions. Additionally, various educational materials on GDM, including written information and videos, are provided, along with online consultation services. If blood glucose control through diet and exercise proves insufficient, patients are hospitalized for insulin or other medical treatments to ensure the health and safety of both the mother and baby.

Given the increased incidence of GDM in recent decades, identifying dietary modifications among individuals with GDM in clinical practice can inform targeted dietary interventions. Additionally, exploring whether usual prenatal care outside of research settings can mitigate the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in individuals with GDM provides valuable information for future GDM management.

This study aimed to prospectively assess maternal dietary choices, GDM diagnosis, and pregnancy outcomes in a longitudinal cohort to: (1) Investigate the association between maternal dietary choices during the first and second trimesters and GDM diagnosis, (2) Examine the influence of a GDM diagnosis on individuals' dietary choices, and (3) Compare pregnancy outcomes between individuals with and without GDM.

Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2023). High credibility.

Population-based nutrition and physical activity guidelines — use and scope for practitioners are outlined as follows: When delivering nutrition and physical activity interventions to the public, practitioners should primarily adhere to population-based recommendations such as the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and guidance from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) is considered a global standard. Population-based guidelines normally provide a range of lifestyle behaviors that facilitate positive health outcomes, and for adults without a diagnosed disease, any nutrition advice should adhere to recommendations such as "Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations." Practitioners should not advise outside of the bounds of population-based guidelines for fields in which they are not certified or licensed, and dietitians and exercise practitioners providing advice within their certified/licensed field should individualize population-based recommendations based on screening and through nutrition and physical activity assessment to optimize client adoption and adherence. Many adults in the general population may have risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases, and for adults with pre-diabetes, practitioners may utilize diabetes prevention-specific guidelines concurrent with population-based guidelines; the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans includes guidance for adults with chronic health conditions and disabilities.

### Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward pre-diabetes among the public, patients with pre-diabetes and healthcare professionals: a systematic review [^faf40d6f]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Knowledge

Patients

Six studies investigated the patients' knowledge toward pre-diabetes. Studies reported that up to 93.7% of the individuals were unfamiliar with the terms 'prediabetes', 'impaired fasting glucose', 'impaired glucose tolerance', or 'borderline diabetes'. However, patients' understanding of the risk factors and consequences of pre-diabetes were heterogeneous. Studies from middle-income countries generally reported that one in three patients (range 19.7%–37.5%) understood the risk factors and consequences of pre-diabetes. Conversely, more than half of patients from high-income countries (range 63%–88%) knew about the risk factors and consequences of pre-diabetes.

Most patients could not correctly identify pre-diabetes diagnostic criteria and screening methods. Misinformation on pre-diabetes remains widespread; up to 90% of patients thought that pre-diabetes would present symptoms similar to diabetes. While more than half of the individuals were aware that pre-diabetes could be treated through lifestyle management, many were unaware of what these modifications entailed, in terms of dietary changes and recommended duration of physical activities. Interestingly, only 18.2% understood that weight reduction could help with reversing pre-diabetes, and up to 43% of the individuals believed that pre-diabetes could only be treated with medications.

Healthcare providers

Most healthcare providers had poor knowledge about pre-diabetes, where only 2.8%–42% correctly identified the diagnostic criteria and risk factors for pre-diabetes. Less than half of the healthcare providers could identify recommended lifestyle changes, clinical targets, and pharmacological therapies for patients with pre-diabetes.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^4f6967a5]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: we recommend modifying the dietary habits and adapting the novel proven dietary interventions like medical nutritional therapy for the management of T2DM and CVD (Grade A)

The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial was one of the major trials that evaluated benefits of lifestyle intervention. The study proved no direct benefits of intense lifestyle interventions (dietary restrictions, weight loss, etc.) on the CV mortality. The benefits observed with this study were mostly on glycemic control.

For a strict control of T2DM and its subsequent impact on the CV risk, it is important to look into the glycaemic index (GI = blood glucose response 2 h after intake of 100 g of food ÷ blood glucose response on intake of 100 g glucose) and glycaemic load (GL = carbohydrate content of the item × its GI ÷ 100) of an individual food item. Multiple studies have concluded the beneficial effects of diet with low GI (< 55) on the improvement of T2DM and its complications. Diets with low GL (≤ 10) have also shown benefits in managing T2DM and reducing complications in several studies. Patients with CVDs are advised to reduce the saturated fats intake and improve the mono-unsaturated fat intake to prevent or ameliorate further worsening of the condition.

The novel dietary interventions such as medical nutritional therapy (MNT) mainly target management of blood glucose and CV risk factors by reducing the risk for diabetes-related complications and optimal co-ordination of dietary intake with pharmacological therapies to achieve a favourable outcome. Two basic aspects of MNT include dietary quality and energy restriction. Strategies directed at both dimensions can improve glycaemic control.

MNT not only aims to control blood glucose, but also to improve other co-morbidities such as dyslipidaemia, obesity, and hypertension. MNT can be utilised as a primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention measure in T2DM. Primary prevention measures of MNT are by modifying diets in high-risk individuals (such as pre-diabetes, central obesity etc.) to prolong or prevent the onset of T2DM. Secondary prevention measures aim to achieve tight glycaemic control by dietary modification; in turn, reducing diabetic complications in patients with T2DM. Tertiary prevention measures are to manage diabetes-related complications such as CVDs or renal diseases in those with T2DM. Likewise, patients at risk or history of CVD can also prevent further consequences by modifying diet to one of the four diet patterns that have been evidently proven to be effective in such cases: low fat diet, low carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, and DASH diet (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension diet).

KAS 7: Prescribing a Nutrition Plan for Prevention — In adults with prediabetes or a history of GDM, the action statement says the clinician, HCP, or designee "should prescribe a nutrition plan using SMART goals that is consistent with the individual's cultural background and is framed in food-based advice regarding caloric intake, nutrient needs, and a whole-food, plant-predominant eating plan," a "Strong recommendation based on RCTs and systematic reviews with a preponderance of benefit over harm." The "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A" and "Level of confidence in evidence: High." Benefits include "Prevent progression of prediabetes to T2D, achieve normoglycemia in people with prediabetes, prevent recurrence of GDM, prevent progression of GDM to T2D, dispel nutrition myths and misinformation," with risks/costs such as "Cost of food, a focus on weight loss could be problematic for someone with a disordered eating behavior, time counseling individuals," and a "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm." Practice implications state this KAS aims "to provide practical and evidence-based strategies for implementing a whole-food, plant-predominant eating plan in treating prediabetes, and preventing prediabetes or GDM from progressing to T2D," and that "nutrition, and physical activity should be a frontline approach to treatment for prediabetes."

### Enhanced long-term dietary change and adherence in a nutrigenomics-guided lifestyle intervention compared to a population-based (GLB / DPP) lifestyle intervention for weight management: results from the NOW randomised controlled trial [^36f0f8fc]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that a nutrigenomics weight management intervention can motivate greater long-term dietary change compared to population-based recommendations in one of the most effective public health weight management and diabetes prevention programmes. Notably, this is the first genetic testing behaviour change study to incorporate the TPB and thus control for important confounding factors of behaviour change and is the first study to assess changes in calorie and macronutrient intake resulting from a genetic-based weight management intervention. It is also the first study to assess change in dietary intake when the GLB/DPP programme is extended to patients with overweight/obesity, regardless of having a pre-diabetes diagnosis — a recommended programme expansion by public health officials.

Previous research has assessed change in dietary intake in participants diagnosed with pre-diabetes enrolled in the GLB/DPP programme. Over the course of 12 months, it appears that the participants with pre-diabetes made greater overall dietary changes (−452 calories and −6.6% total fat) compared with the population of adults with overweight/obesity in the NOW trial who received the standard GLB programme (−236 calories and −1.5% total fat), although different tools were used to measure dietary intake, therefore the results cannot be compared with complete accuracy. Theoretical concepts of behaviour change support this finding; the extended parallel process model suggests that if individuals' perceptions about susceptibility to a threat (eg, developing type 2 diabetes) and the magnitude of the threat are high, they are more likely to take action to control the threat (eg, improve their nutrition). Interestingly, the NOW trial GLB+NGx group (with overweight/obesity but not necessarily a pre-diabetes diagnosis) changed their dietary intake to a similar extent as those in the original GLB/DPP cohort, all of whom had a diagnosis of pre-diabetes, whereas the NOW trial standard GLB group made fewer changes to their diet. In comparing these findings to the extended parallel process model, it is possible that the addition of genetic-based nutrition information and advice positively impacted response efficacy (beliefs about the effectiveness of the advice to improve weight management), and elicited greater danger control responses (beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behaviours to manage weight). Future research should explore this concept further. Future research should also assess change in dietary intake in the GLB programme (with and without the addition of nutrigenomics information/advice) in various locations across North America, and with a more ethnically diverse study sample in order to improve generalisability. The current study is primarily generalisable to Caucasian females with overweight and obesity enrolled in a weight management programme. Notably, given the highly pragmatic nature of the NOW trial (table 6), overall, this study has strong external validity.

### Effect of a ketogenic diet versus mediterranean diet on glycated hemoglobin in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the interventional keto-med randomized crossover trial [^e6dd03f1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Consensus has not been reached on what constitutes an optimal diet in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In 2018–2019, both Diabetes UK and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) released nutrition guidelines for preventing and managing diabetes, endorsing an individualized approach and agreeing on several key nutrition recommendations, including: 1) incorporating nonstarchy vegetables; and 2) minimizing added sugars and refined grains. Diabetes UK also emphasized considering food patterns over macronutrient composition and gave the highest rating for the Mediterranean diet for patients with and at risk for T2DM. In contrast, the ADA did not recommend a specific, single dietary pattern, but recommended several, including the Mediterranean diet and low-carbohydrate (low-carb) and very low-carb diets. In addition, for the first time, the ADA suggested reducing overall carbohydrate intake to decrease blood glucose levels and noted that in select adults with T2DM, low- or very low-carb eating patterns were viable approaches.

### Improving the scientific rigour of nutritional recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes: a comprehensive review of the American diabetes association guideline-recommended eating patterns [^eaa57571]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clinical practice guidelines are not new, but they are growing in number. A modern definition of clinical practice guidelines was set forth in 1992 by the Institute of Medicine and updated in 2011: "Clinical practice guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options." 1 Rising alongside the number of clinical practice guidelines are concerns about the process behind their creation. To ensure that guidelines affecting clinical care are created using the most rigorous and unbiased methods possible, multiple organizations have issued standards for evaluating scientific evidence when creating guidelines (Table S1). Despite the availability of standards to improve the development of clinical practice guidelines, there is still wide concern among the scientific community that even the most well‐respected guidelines lack sufficient rigour. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Over half of adults in the United States now have type 2 diabetes (T2D) or prediabetes, 7 and worse, this multifactorial epidemic is now worldwide and shows no signs of slowing, with rates of both T2D and T2D‐related health complications rising. 8 When advising people with T2D on food choices, many healthcare providers rely on nutrition guidelines provided by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and these guidelines influence standard recommendations made around the globe. 9, 10, 11 Given these alarming trends, it is of paramount importance to review the treatment guidelines to ensure they are based on rigorous, accepted scientific methods.

The ADA's approach to the evidence in developing its guidelines has been to employ a grading system to rate the strength of evidence. An "A" rating is given to well‐conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are adequately powered, as well as to meta‐analyses that incorporate quality ratings. "B" ratings are given to well‐conducted cohort studies, "C" ratings are for poorly controlled trials or uncontrolled studies, and a score of "E" is for expert consensus or clinical experience. This approach does not follow any of the widely accepted standards or "guidelines for guidelines" such as Agree II, GRADE, or those from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (Table S1).

### Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward pre-diabetes among the public, patients with pre-diabetes and healthcare professionals: a systematic review [^690812b6]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Pre-diabetes refers to the clinical situation in which blood glucose levels are elevated but do not meet the threshold for diabetes. This includes people with impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. While diagnostic criteria vary, it can broadly be defined as a fasting plasma glucose of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 5.7%–6.4%, or 2-hour plasma glucose of 7.8–11.0 mmol/L. Studies suggest that people with pre-diabetes are at a higher risk of developing complications of diabetes, including cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy and neuropathy.

Currently, 5%–10% of people with pre-diabetes will meet the clinical criteria for diabetes annually, with up to 70% progressing to diabetes within their lifetime. The high prevalence of pre-diabetes is worrying, as these are potential seedbeds for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the coming years. However, there is still a silver lining for those who have pre-diabetes. Current evidence shows that lifestyle interventions to combat obesity and physical inactivity can effectively reduce the risk of progression from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus by up to 58%. In many of these lifestyle intervention programs, patients were routinely trained and monitored by lifestyle 'coaches' to perform intensive diet and exercise regimes to achieve weight loss. These interventions also found an increased life expectancy and protection from the detrimental repercussions of diabetes-related complications such as microvascular and macrovascular diseases, which may persist for up to 10 years.

### Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward pre-diabetes among the public, patients with pre-diabetes and healthcare professionals: a systematic review [^434bb583]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Many HCPs were unfamiliar with the recommended lifestyle modification and clinical targets for their patients. Although HCPs provided advice to their patients with pre-diabetes, few HCPs were aware of or adhered to existing guidelines. This is an essential factor that needs to be addressed as adherence to guidelines can improve patient outcomes. Our findings also noted that referrals to a lifestyle modification program were rare, suggesting the need to increase awareness further. Consultations with carers and patients can be complemented with clinical support tools such as patient decision aids, where HCPs work together with patients to plan their actions for behavior change (eg, when and what kinds of exercises). Realistic goals for achieving a behavior (eg, how much time to spend on exercising a day) or an outcome (eg, weight loss) should be set. Pre-diabetes management is not a 'one size fits all' method, as it should be individualized into practices that can be incorporated into patients' daily lives.

Patients and HCPs were receptive to health promotion and diabetes prevention efforts, showing readiness to provide and receive help in managing pre-diabetes in both groups. However, patients' negative outlook toward living a life with pre-diabetes, mainly due to the concern of developing diabetes and its complication, should be highlighted and addressed while developing pre-diabetes intervention.

The studies described time and resources as common barriers that contributed to the poor practices among patients and HCPs. Environmental restructuring could address these barriers, especially on improving access and resources for lifestyle modifications. At the HCPs level, the load of delivering care for patients with pre-diabetes can be shared across disciplines and involve other healthcare professionals such as pharmacists, nutritionists, and nurses. To improve adherence to evidence-based guidelines, prediabetes-specific guidelines can be incorporated into local protocols of the healthcare settings.

### Enhanced long-term dietary change and adherence in a nutrigenomics-guided lifestyle intervention compared to a population-based (GLB / DPP) lifestyle intervention for weight management: results from the NOW randomised controlled trial [^e0ef8016]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

Table 6
PRECIS-2 scoring tool

In terms of the dietary analyses, while both grams and %kcal are reported in the present study, %kcal is a more accurate comparison between groups given that calorie intakes between groups were not identical. As such, differences in %kcal from macronutrients should be weighted more highly in the interpretation of the overall results compared with grams of nutrients. Given that the %kcal from protein recommendations for the GLB+NGx 'enhanced response' group proved to be challenging to achieve, and that a large proportion of the GLB+NGx group were advised to limit their SFA intake to < 10% kcal to enhance weight loss (table 3), it is not surprising that there was significantly greater dietary adherence to the SFA recommendations in the GLB+NGx group as many participants were focusing on reducing their SFA intake. This would also contribute to the significant reduction in total fat intake in the GLB+NGx group only (in addition to a reduction in unsaturated fat). It was, however, surprising to see minimal change in total fat intake and poor dietary adherence to the total fat recommendations in the standard GLB group at 12-month follow-up since this was the main focus of the standard programme. While clinically meaningful (although not statistically significant) reductions in total fat intake occurred from baseline to 3-month follow-up, these were not sustained after 12 months. As further explained above, it appears individuals with overweight/obesity, but not necessarily having a pre-diabetes diagnosis, have a more difficult time maintaining long-term dietary changes in the standard GLB programme compared with those diagnosed with pre-diabetes. According to the NOW trial findings, the addition of genetic-based dietary advice could help to mitigate this. Indeed, previous research has indicated that weight control is a motivator for the intention to adopt personalised nutrition strategies.

II. TESTING FOR PRE-DIABETES AND DIABETES IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS

Recommendations

Testing to detect pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (Table 3). In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. (B)
If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. (E)
To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, an FPG test or 2-h OGTT (75-g glucose load) or both are appropriate. (B)
An OGTT may be considered in patients with IFG to better define the risk of diabetes. (E)
In those identified with pre-diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. (B)

For many illnesses, there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes, the same tests would be used for "screening" as for diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase and significant clinical risk markers. Diabetes may be identified anywhere along a spectrum of clinical scenarios ranging from a seemingly low-risk individual who happens to have glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual whom the provider tests because of high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. The discussion herein is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in those without symptoms. Testing for diabetes will also detect individuals with pre-diabetes.

A. Testing for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults

Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-third of all people with diabetes may be undiagnosed. Although the effectiveness of early identification of pre-diabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been definitively proven (and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur), pre-diabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate. Both conditions are common, increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens. There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made. Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease. Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes (see Section IV) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see Section VI).

Registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) nutrition intervention for adults with diabetes — The RDN should individualize the nutrition prescription and implement evidence-based guidelines in collaboration with the adult with diabetes, including that a variety of eating patterns are acceptable; a healthful eating plan is encouraged for appropriate-weight persons with diabetes and a reduced energy healthful eating plan is encouraged for overweight and obese persons with diabetes; macronutrient intake composition should be individualized within the appropriate energy intake; education should address carbohydrate management strategies (including fiber, glycemic index, and sweetener recommendations) and the role of protein intake; consumption of a cardio-protective eating pattern within the recommended energy intake is encouraged; advise there is no clear evidence of benefit from vitamin, mineral, and/or herbal supplementation in people who do not have underlying deficiencies; if alcohol is chosen, it should be done in moderation (one drink/day or less for adult women and two drinks/day or less in adult men); encourage an individualized physical activity plan; and educate on self-monitoring of blood glucose and using data to adjust therapy.

Difficulties in setting guidelines

Where dietary guidelines exist (in many settings there are none, or they are adapted from those in developed countries and therefore may not be applicable to the local situation), they vary substantially in whether they are evidence based or opinion pieces, and updated in line with scientific progress or outdated. Their accessibility — both physical availability (eg, through a website or clinic) and comprehensibility — for patients and healthcare professionals varies. They vary also in scope, content, detail, and emphasis on the importance of individualised dietary advice, areas of controversy, and further research needs. The quality of research that informs dietary guidelines also needs greater investment from the scientific community and funders. Moreover, lack of transparency in the development of guidelines and bias in the primary nutritional studies can undermine the development of reliable dietary guidelines; recommendations for their improvement must be heeded.

Dietary advice is fundamental to the management of diabetes. Although ideally such advice should be delivered by a state-registered dietitian, it is more usually delivered by other health professionals. The primary focus for those with type 1 diabetes is carbohydrate counting and insulin adjustment and for the majority of people with type 2 diabetes, weight management is key. Patient-centred care is emphasised for the delivery of dietary advice. It is widely recognised that knowledge alone is not sufficient to induce behaviour change and practical approaches to a variety of behavioural interventions are discussed.

Regarding preventative measures for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, lifestyle modifications, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider screening for and treating modifiable risk factors for CVD in patients with prediabetes, as prediabetes is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Advise an eating pattern known to be effective in preventing T2DM, such as Mediterranean-style, intermittent fasting, or low carbohydrate, in patients with prediabetes.

Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low-carbohydrate and very-low-carbohydrate diets at 1–2 years compared with high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diets — meta-analyses in adults with overweight/obesity and with pre-diabetes/type 2 diabetes — report mixed effects on weight and lipids. In adults with overweight/obesity, Naude et al. (14 randomized controlled trials) found weight WMD −0.48 (−1.44 to 0.49) kg with LDL-C 2.71 (−0.39 to 6.19) mg/dL and HDL-C 1.55 (0.39 to 3.09) mg/dL; Mansoor et al. (11 trials) found weight WMD −2.17 (−3.36 to −0.99) kg with LDL-C 6.19 (0.12 to 12.8) mg/dL and HDL-C 5.41 (3.48 to 7.35) mg/dL; in adults with overweight/obesity with pre-diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes, van Zuuren et al. (2–3 trials) reported weight WMD −0.14 (−1.64 to 1.35) kg with LDL-C 2.32 (−3.09 to 8.12) mg/dL and HDL-C 4.64 (2.71 to 6.57) mg/dL.

This study provides important implications for pre-diabetes management in primary care. Compared with previous research assessing the general adult population, the gap between clinical guidelines regarding lifestyle style change in pre-diabetes treatment and real-world practice was reduced significantly in the overweight and obese population. However, inequitable access to diabetes care presents a major barrier to getting advice about diabetes disease management from a primary care provider. Addressing access to care may improve the dissemination of important lifestyle, diet and disease management information to vulnerable populations with type 2 diabetes. Delivering equitable population-based lifestyle interventions remains challenging in preventing and controlling type 2 diabetes. Primary care providers play an essential role in motivating patients to change their lifestyle to manage pre-diabetes. Patient-centred care has been proposed as a successful approach in diabetes management. Primary care providers should take the opportunity to understand their patients' behaviour and identify barriers to pre-diabetes management. This would help personalise lifestyle intervention delivery, improve the quality of health advice and achieve desired treatment goals.

### Role and importance of high fiber in diabetes management in India [^3735fd30]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

India is facing a triple burden of pre-diabetes, diabetes, and obesity. Unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity have been linked to the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite dietary recommendations, individuals consume inadequate amounts or unsuitable type of dietary fiber (DF) which needs correction. An Expert group attempted to review and report on the role and importance of high DF in the management of T2DM and offer practical guidance on high fiber use in daily diet.

Methodology

Twelve diabetologists and two expert dietitians from India were chosen to ensure diversity of the members both in professional interest and cultural background. The authors convened virtually for one group meeting and actively participated in a detailed discussion. Multiple reviews of the draft document followed by focused teleconference calls & email helped to reach consensus on final recommendations between Aug 2021 and Dec 2021.

Results

Evidence has shown that medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a valuable approach and an essential component of T2DM prevention and management. Studies have shown that fiber rich diabetes nutrition (FDN) has multi-systemic health benefits, including, improvement in glycemic control, reduction in glucose spikes, decrease in hyperinsulinemia, improvement in plasma lipid concentrations and weight management in T2DM patients.

Conclusion

A high fiber diet is vital for people with diabetes and associated conditions. Increasing fiber intake, preferably through food or through dietary supplement, may help. Fiber rich diabetes nutrition (FDN) is recommended in order to prevent and manage T2DM.

Conclusion

Over 75% of US adults with BMI ≥ 25 and pre-diabetes received advice about reducing the risk of diabetes through lifestyle change from their healthcare provider. This is a much greater percentage of persons to be given advice about pre-diabetes lifestyle approaches to pre-diabetes management than for those with normal weight. Moreover, our findings show that providers focused more on the Hispanic patient population who were overweight or obese than their White counterparts. This finding aligns with the greater risk Hispanic patients have of progressing to diabetes when weight is a factor. There is room for improvement to show equity across all weight categories, as racial backgrounds when giving advice about lifestyle change among adults who are overweight or obese with pre-diabetes. Finally, the results show that healthcare provider's advice increased the likelihood of lifestyle-related behavioural change to exercise and diet.

Low-fat and low-carbohydrate dietary approaches in DM — reduced-calorie low-fat diets aid prevention and risk factor control, while low-carbohydrate strategies are safe and can yield short-term improvements. Structured lifestyle interventions that include reduced-calorie low-fat diets in persons with overweight or obesity have been shown to prevent progression from prediabetes to DM, and to lower A1C, BP, and triglycerides in persons with T2D. Low-carbohydrate diets that reduce carbohydrates to 26% to 46% of daily calories and very low–carbohydrate diets that restrict carbohydrates to 20 to 50 grams per day sufficient to induce ketosis are both safe for persons with T2D, and several systematic reviews agree that reduced-carbohydrate diets can produce greater reductions in A1C and body weight compared with low-fat diets in the short term (~3 to 6 months).

### How are health-related behaviours influenced by a diagnosis of pre-diabetes? A meta-narrative review [^c65f97f6]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aim, research questions and objectives

The aim of the study was to inform diabetes prevention policies by exploring how individual perceptions and wider socio-cultural influences shape individual health behaviours in response to a pre-diabetes diagnosis (or equivalent).

The specific research questions were:
A. How do individuals with pre-diabetes understand what it means to be at risk of developing diabetes?
B. Do people believe that their wider socio-cultural environment will affect their ability to make lifestyle changes? If so, in what ways?
C. What are the implications of these findings for the design and delivery of diabetes prevention programmes?

Specifically, we sought to:
Identify primary studies that had explored health-related behaviours in populations at risk of diabetes
Develop a taxonomy of these studies in terms of their epistemological assumptions and methodological approaches
Extract and analyse data on risk perception, health-related lifestyle changes and individual and socio-cultural influences on these
Synthesise findings from studies across disciplines, using seemingly conflicting data to draw out higher-order insights
Draw conclusions on implications for the design and refinement of diabetes prevention programmes

### Baseline characteristics of participants in the pre-diabetes interventions and continued tracking to ease-out diabetes (pre-DICTED) program [^6c25d52e]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a persistent public health issue. The global prevalence of T2D has been steadily increasing in the past three decades, and the number of people worldwide with diabetes, of which T2D cases form an overwhelming majority, is projected to increase from 530 million in 2021 to 780 million by 2045, with an accompanying increase in prevalence from 10.5% to 12.2%. Population aging and improved care and survival of people with diabetes contribute to this growing prevalence, particularly in high-income countries. For low and middle-income countries, these factors are compounded by a shift towards sedentary lifestyles and high-calorie diets in both urban and rural settings. Although prevalence has been increasing, data from multiple high-income countries indicate a stable or declining trend in diabetes incidence since 2010, and diabetes prevention programs involving lifestyle modification have been highlighted as possible contributors to this favorable change. Diabetes prevention programs focus on individuals with pre-diabetes, as they are at a higher risk of developing T2D compared with individuals with normal blood glucose. Importantly, multiple large randomized controlled trials have shown that the risk of T2D is reduced in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) after intervention with lifestyle modification or metformin.

The Pre-Diabetes Interventions and Continued Tracking to Ease-out Diabetes (Pre-DICTED) Program is a diabetes prevention trial in Singapore that aims to compare the diabetes conversion rate over 3 years in overweight or obese individuals with elevated risk of diabetes (impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or IGT) between the intervention group, which receives the community-based stepwise diabetes prevention program with added financial incentives, and the control group, which receives the current standard of care. Similar to the Diabetes Community Lifestyle Improvement Program (D-CLIP), the Pre-DICTED Study uses a stepwise program consisting of group-based lifestyle modification classes and subsequent addition of metformin where necessary, and sets forth weight loss (≥ 5% of baseline weight) and physical activity goals (moderate physical activity ≥ 150 min per week) for intervention participants. However, in contrast with D-CLIP, Pre-DICTED additionally has a maintenance phase where recommendations for physical activity and dietary modification are delivered to intervention group participants via monthly mobile phone text messages. The Pre-DICTED Program also includes financial incentives that are tied to (1) attendance of the lifestyle modification classes, and (2) achievement and maintenance of the weight loss goal (5% of baseline weight).

### Different types of dietary advice for women with gestational diabetes mellitus [^23e991d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary advice is the main strategy for managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). It remains unclear what type of advice is best.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM for improving health outcomes for women and babies.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (8 March 2016), PSANZ's Trials Registry (22 March 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Evidence quality for two comparisons was assessed using GRADE, for primary outcomes for the mother: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; caesarean section; type 2 diabetes mellitus; and child: large-for-gestational age; perinatal mortality; neonatal mortality or morbidity composite; neurosensory disability; secondary outcomes for the mother: induction of labour; perineal trauma; postnatal depression; postnatal weight retention or return to pre-pregnancy weight; and child: hypoglycaemia; childhood/adulthood adiposity; childhood/adulthood type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Main Results

In this update, we included 19 trials randomising 1398 women with GDM, at an overall unclear to moderate risk of bias (10 comparisons). For outcomes assessed using GRADE, downgrading was based on study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Where no findings are reported below for primary outcomes or pre-specified GRADE outcomes, no data were provided by included trials. Primary outcomes Low-moderate glycaemic index (GI) versus moderate-high GI diet (four trials): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.34; two trials, 89 infants; low-quality evidence); severe hypertension or pre-eclampsia (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.86; one trial, 95 women; very low-quality evidence); eclampsia (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14; one trial, 83 women; very low-quality evidence) or caesarean section (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; one trial, 63 women; low-quality evidence). Energy-restricted versus no energy-restricted diet (three trials): no clear differences seen for: large-for-gestational age (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.12; one trial, 123 infants; low-quality evidence); perinatal mortality (no events; two trials, 423 infants; low-quality evidence); pre-eclampsia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.97; one trial, 117 women; low-quality evidence); or caesarean section (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.56; two trials, 420 women; low-quality evidence). DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet versus control diet (three trials): no clear differences observed for: pre-eclampsia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.26; three trials, 136 women); however there were fewer caesarean sections in the DASH diet group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76; two trials, 86 women). Low-carbohydrate versus high-carbohydrate diet (two trials): no clear differences seen for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.95; one trial, 149 infants); perinatal mortality (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.49; one trial, 150 infants); maternal hypertension (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.22; one trial, 150 women); or caesarean section (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.99; two trials, 179 women). High unsaturated fat versus low unsaturated fat diet (two trials): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37; one trial, 27 infants); pre-eclampsia (no cases; one trial, 27 women); hypertension in pregnancy (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.26; one trial, 27 women); caesarean section (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.50; one trial, 27 women); diabetes at one to two weeks (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.45 to 8.94; one trial, 24 women) or four to 13 months postpartum (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.61; one trial, six women). Low-GI versus high-fibre moderate-GI diet (one trial): no clear differences seen for: large-for-gestational age (RR 2.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 13.50; 92 infants); caesarean section (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.03; 92 women); or type 2 diabetes at three months postpartum (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.01; 58 women). Diet recommendation plus diet-related behavioural advice versus diet recommendation only (one trial): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.14; 99 infants); or caesarean section (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.62; 99 women). Soy protein-enriched versus no soy protein diet (one trial): no clear differences seen for: pre-eclampsia (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.03; 68 women); or caesarean section (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.77; 68 women). High-fibre versus standard-fibre diet (one trial): no primary outcomes reported. Ethnic-specific versus standard healthy diet (one trial): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.45; 20 infants); neonatal composite adverse outcome (no events; 20 infants); gestational hypertension (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32; 20 women); or caesarean birth (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.67; 20 women). Secondary outcomes For secondary outcomes assessed using GRADE no differences were observed: between a low-moderate and moderate-high GI diet for induction of labour (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.34; one trial, 63 women; low-quality evidence); or an energy-restricted and no energy-restricted diet for induction of labour (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.53; one trial, 114 women, low-quality evidence) and neonatal hypoglycaemia (average RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.32; two trials, 408 infants; very low-quality evidence). Few other clear differences were observed for reported outcomes. Longer-term health outcomes and health services use and costs were largely not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from 19 trials assessing different types of dietary advice for women with GDM suggests no clear differences for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes assessed using GRADE, except for a possible reduction in caesarean section for women receiving a DASH diet compared with a control diet. Few differences were observed for secondary outcomes. Current evidence is limited by the small number of trials in each comparison, small sample sizes, and variable methodological quality. More evidence is needed to assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM. Future trials should be adequately powered to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes.

### Changes in diet, cardiovascular risk factors and modelled cardiovascular risk following diagnosis of diabetes: 1-year results from the ADDITION-cambridge trial cohort [^23d574b3]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health problem, associated with a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. Patients with diabetes are two to four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those without the disease. Lifestyle behaviours, including diet, are strongly associated with risk of incident diabetes and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dietary modification for weight management and for controlling blood glucose, blood pressure and blood lipid levels, is an important first-line treatment option for newly diagnosed patients. Such individuals will also be given physical activity advice and may be considered for pharmacotherapy. Evidence-informed nutritional guidelines for the management of diabetes from Diabetes UKand the American Diabetes Associationfocus on the reduction of total energy intake, percentage of energy from saturated fat, and sodium intake, alongside increases in fibre, and fruit and vegetable intake. Randomized trials of lifestyle interventions including dietary modification have demonstrated reduced incidence of diabetes in high-risk individualsand improved cardiovascular disease risk factors in those with established diabetes. Although less well established, research also suggests that dietary changes in individuals with newly or recently diagnosed diabetes may be valuable. However, the lack of measurement of diet makes it difficult to quantify the contribution that dietary change made to the beneficial effects observed in these trials.

What's new?

Dietary modification is an important first-line treatment option for clinically diagnosed patients.
Dietary changes in individuals with screen-detected diabetes may also be valuable. However, the lack of measurement of diet in previous trials makes it difficult to quantify the contribution that dietary change can make to cardiovascular risk reduction in this patient group.
Improvements in self-reported dietary behaviour and plasma vitamin C over 1 year in our screen-detected population were associated with small reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors and modelled cardiovascular disease risk, independently of cardio-protective medication and physical activity.
Dietary change may have a role to play in the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk following diagnosis of diabetes.

Population screening for diabetes has been recommended by several national organizations and the National Health Service (NHS) includes assessment of diabetes in its Health Checks programme. Consequently, more individuals will be found earlier in the disease trajectory, where there is little current evidence for treatment recommendations. Furthering our understanding of dietary change and potential cardiovascular disease risk reduction in individuals with screen-detected Type 2 diabetes should inform provision of diabetes care and improve targeting of resources.

### Prediabetes: lifestyle, pharmacotherapy or regulation? [^a2b7291d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The rapidly rising number of people with diabetes worldwide has led to multiple attempts to identify effective means of preventing type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle interventions have shown impressive efficacy in multiple clinical trials of people with impaired glucose tolerance, but, as currently formulated, appear to have very little impact on impaired fasting glucose. Attempts to roll out lifestyle interventions beyond clinical trials have generally recruited too few people to have a chance of influencing the population prevalence of diabetes. Several drugs have also been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes, but until such drugs can be shown to prevent the clinical consequences of diabetes, it is unlikely that guidelines will recommend their widespread use for diabetes prevention. Population-level interventions, including education and regulation, are attractive, as they have the potential to influence a high proportion of the population. Favourable effects of a sugar sweetened beverage tax on consumption are encouraging, but data on its influence on diabetes are not yet available.

### Many Americans have pre-diabetes and should be considered for metformin therapy [^1e797267]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In consideration of the enormous public health impact of diabetes and the evidence of benefit from pharmacological treatment for the prevention of diabetes, the ADA issued a consensus statement recommending preventive treatment in individuals at high risk of developing diabetes, defined as those with more severe pre-diabetes (both IFG and IGT as well as an additional risk factor). To determine the proportion of individuals who would be targeted by such a recommendation, we examined a relatively healthy population without previously diagnosed diabetes (SIGT) and representative samples of the U.S. population (NHANES III and NHANES 2005–2006) and found that one-quarter to one-third had pre-diabetes. Among those with IFG, nearly one-third of subjects met the criteria for consideration of metformin treatment to prevent diabetes in accordance with the recent ADA consensus statement, more than one-half of all of the subjects with IGT qualified, and almost all of those with both IFG and IGT qualified. Overall, 8–9% met the recommended criteria. Assuming that our data are generalizable to the U.S. population, ∼24 million Americans might benefit from pharmacological treatment in addition to lifestyle modification.

Project IMAGE European Evidence-Based Guideline for the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes, 2010 — risk modifiers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) emphasize weight, activity, prediabetes phenotypes, and diet. Reversal of obesity decreases the risk for T2D, and physical activity benefits prevention. In people with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), meta-analyses indicate that individuals with IFG + IGT have substantially increased risk, and over three to five years about 25% progress to diabetes, 25% return to normal glucose tolerance, and 50% remain prediabetic. Dietary guidance notes that weight-loss–promoting patterns reduce T2D risk; low intake of dietary fiber, particularly insoluble cereal fiber, and high glycemic load or high glycemic index are associated with increased risk, while shifting from animal-fat–based to vegetable-rich diets, greater monounsaturated fat intake, and regular moderate consumption of alcohol, fruits and vegetables, nuts, and coffee are associated with lower risk.

While statistical significance varied across studies, both LCD and VLCD have shown the potential to improve lipid profiles, including elevating HDL levels and reducing non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. In Gardner et al.'s study, participants eating a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (WFKD) or a modified Mediterranean diet (Med-Plus) exhibited significant reductions in HbA1c levels. Importantly, the WFKD led to a significantly greater reduction in triglycerides compared to the Mediterranean diet (p = 0.02). Additionally, there was a significant increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations in the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet group compared to a decrease in the Mediterranean diet group (p = 0.01). These findings underscore the impact of dietary choices on the lipid profiles of individuals with prediabetes and T2DM.

Vitamin D — empiric supplementation in high‑risk prediabetes: For adults with high-risk prediabetes, in addition to lifestyle modification, we suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Lifestyle modification must be a routine management component for adults with prediabetes. Trials informing this recommendation primarily related to adults identified as meeting 2 or 3 American Diabetes Association glycemia criteria (fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 2-hour glucose after a 75-gram oral glucose challenge) for prediabetes and those with impaired glucose tolerance. In the trials, vitamin D dosages ranged from 842 to 7543 IU (21 to 189 μg) daily equivalent, with an estimated weighted average of approximately 3500 IU (88 μg) per day, and some trials allowed routine supplements including up to 1000 IU (25 μg) of vitamin D daily.

Maternal dietary assessment

Maternal dietary data were collected by self-administered questionnaire. We employed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) designed to assess food intake over the past 4 weeks. The FFQ is a widely used semi-quantitative tool in nutritional research that typically includes three components: food items, frequency of consumption, and portion size. Although portion size data can enhance accuracy, its collection can be complex and requires specific measurements, which is why there is no consensus on its necessity. Typically, dietary intake is estimated by multiplying frequency of consumption by portion size, but these estimates may not always accurately reflect actual intake.

In our study, the FFQ was organized into nine food groups, in line with the food guide pagoda recommended by the Chinese Nutrition Society. The groups included: (1) cereals and its products; (2) potatoes and its products; (3) vegetables; (4) fruit; (5) livestock and poultry meat; (6) fish, shrimp and shellfish; (7) eggs; (8) soybean and nuts; and (9) milk and milk products. For additional details, please refer to the supplementary file. To reduce respondent burden, we focused on assessing dietary intake frequency rather than portion sizes. Pregnant individuals reported intake frequencies on a 5-point scale: < 1 time per week; 1 ∼ 3 times per week; 4 ∼ 6 times per week; 1 ∼ 2 times per day; and > 2 times per day. Color food atlases were used to help participants recall their daily intake frequencies. The FFQ was evaluated for face validity by three maternal nutrition experts and three research experts in questionnaire development, and a pilot survey (n = 40) showed that the test-retest reliability after 2 weeks was 0.73 ∼ 0.87.

GDM diagnosis

GDM was screened by a 75 g 2-hour OGTT at 24 ∼ 28 weeks gestation and diagnosed according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria with a plasma glucose concentration ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (fasting), ≥ 10.0 mmol/L (1 h after glucose intake), or ≥ 8.5 mmol/L (1 h after glucose intake).

Prediabetes management — recommendations: Prediabetes is a metabolic and vascular disorder, and clinicians should actively treat people with prediabetes to prevent or at least delay progression to T2D and development of CVD complications. In persons with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome and overweight or obesity, clinicians should recommend lifestyle intervention; the Mediterranean diet should be considered to reduce progression to T2D and risk of CVD, and low-fat, vegetarian, and DASH meal patterns can also be considered for prevention of T2D. Clinicians should manage and monitor CVD risk factors in prediabetes and metabolic syndrome, including elevated BP, dyslipidemia, and excessive weight, with the same targets as for a person with T2D. Lifestyle intervention should include physical activity with an ultimate goal of ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate aerobic exercise during 3 to 5 sessions per week, plus resistance training using major muscle groups 2 to 3 times per week, and increasing nonexercise and active leisure activity to reduce sedentary behavior. Obesity medications — phentermine/topiramate ER, liraglutide 3 mg, or weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg — in conjunction with lifestyle therapy should be considered in persons with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome with ABCD.

What was the intervention and comparator?

It is tempting to assume that the PREDIMED trial demonstrated that simply recommending a Mediterranean diet with liberal use of olive oil and nuts to a patient will provide similar benefits to those observed in PREDIMED. However, as an unblinded RCT aimed at achieving an intake differential in two specific dietary patterns (Mediterranean diet vs low-fat) via food-based dietary counselling, it is necessary to closely investigate the intervention and comparator groups. While it may be obvious to state that the effect of the intervention will occur relative to the control group, in most nutrition studies, the control group is exposed to the intervention variable(s) and thus, the intake differential achieved between the control and the intervention will depend on both the baseline nutrient status and the background dietary intakes (ie, throughout follow-up).

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^602a2138]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Based on the results of clinical trials and the known risks of progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes, an ADA Consensus Development Panel concluded that people with IGT and/or IFG should be counseled on lifestyle changes with goals similar to those of the DPP (5–10% weight loss and moderate physical activity of ∼30 min/day). Regarding the more difficult issue of drug therapy for diabetes prevention, the consensus panel felt that metformin should be the only drug considered for use in diabetes prevention. For other drugs, the issues of cost, side effects, and lack of persistence of effect in some studies led the panel to not recommend use for diabetes prevention. Metformin use was recommended only for very-high-risk individuals (those with combined IGT and IFG who are obese and have at least one other risk factor for diabetes) who are under 60 years of age. In addition, the panel highlighted the evidence that in the DPP, metformin was most effective compared with lifestyle in individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and those under age 60 years.

### Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: is it feasible? [^7219f64c]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires the implementation of preventive strategies to halt this trend, tailored to the specific needs of individual regions. Risk factors for T2DM are among the main targets for improving health outcomes and curbing the development of diabetes; excessive weight and obesity are two of the most important risk factors that need to be addressed. A growing body of evidence suggests that subjects with pre-diabetes who lose body weight and increase physical activity can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM, and in some cases, blood glucose levels may return to normal. Several studies have shown that moderate to intensive levels of exercise are effective in reducing both intra-abdominal and total adiposity among obese subjects, both improving cardiovascular risk profile and reducing the risk of T2DM development. These consistent observations have given rise to large-scale randomized controlled trials that use lifestyle intervention (including behavioural strategies for the reinforcement of prescribed changes in nutritional intake, physical activity or both), with or without pharmacological treatment, in populations at high risk of developing T2DM. In this review, large-scale national trials that have focused on the prevention of T2DM are critically evaluated.

### Efficacy of lifestyle weight loss interventions on regression to normoglycemia and progression to type 2 diabetes in individuals with prediabetes: a systematic review and pairwise and dose-response meta-analyses [^521149ad]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current recommendations for weight loss in individuals with prediabetes come from individual trials and are derived from older data.

Objectives

To elucidate the dose-dependent impacts of weight loss on participants with prediabetes to determine the optimal magnitude of weight loss required for the implementation of the most effective diabetes prevention program.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Scopus, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and gray literature sources to September 2023 for randomized trials ≥ 6 mo that evaluated the efficacy of a lifestyle weight loss intervention on participants with prediabetes. We conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analyses to calculate relative and absolute effects. We performed a 1-stage weighted mixed-effects meta-analysis to elucidate the dose-response curves.

Results

Forty-four randomized trials with 14,742 participants with prediabetes [intervention duration range: 6–72 mo (median: 24 mo), mean weight loss range: 1%-9%] were included. Lifestyle weight loss interventions increased regression to normoglycemia by 11/100 participants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8 more, 17 more; risk ratio: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.27, 1.80; n = 20 trials, grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation = moderate], and reduced progression to type 2 diabetes by 8/100 participants (95% CI: 11 fewer, 6 fewer; risk ratio: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.67; n = 37, grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation = moderate). There were no significant or credible differences between subgroups categorized by the type and duration of intervention. Dose-response meta-analyses indicated that the risk of regression to normoglycemia increased, and the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes declined in a linear pattern within the range of weight loss from 1% to 9%.

Conclusions

Over a median duration of 24 mo, with weight loss ranging from 1% to 9%, the relationship between weight loss and the progression to type 2 diabetes, as well as the regression to normoglycemia, follows a linear pattern. Any form of lifestyle weight loss intervention, including diet, exercise, or a combination of both, can have beneficial impacts on participants with prediabetes. This trial was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42023465322.

### Gaps in provider lifestyle counseling and its adherence among obese adults with prediabetes and diabetes in the United States [^4b465790]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Obesity is an epidemic affecting about 40% of the US adult population. Tracking with the obesity epidemic is an increase in the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes. Both pre-diabetes and diabetes are often coexistent with obesity and contribute to an increased total and cardiovascular disease related morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle modification is usually the first step in management among individuals with obesity and/or pre-diabetes or diabetes, but remains an unfulfilled potential by healthcare providers to promote healthier lifestyles in obese patients. We aimed to describe the current patterns of lifestyle counseling (diet, physical activity, and weight loss) and their adherence by patients with obesity in the US using the National Health Interview Survey, 2016–2017. We analyzed these patterns among individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes. We found that, regardless of pre-diabetes or diabetes status, almost 1 in 3 individuals with mild obesity (BMI ≥ 30 & < 35) and 1 in 4 with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35) reported lack of lifestyle counseling from healthcare providers regarding diet or physical activity, and 2 in 3 individuals with any level of obesity reported lack of referral/counsel concerning weight loss programs. Lifestyle counseling and its compliance among obese adults from a contemporary dataset in the US is still suboptimal. This study highlights the gaps in the implementation of the AHA/ACC 2013 guidelines on management of obesity among adults particularly among those with metabolic disease, who would derive the greatest benefit.

This study identified a racial disparity between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites with pre-diabetes related to receiving provider advice about lifestyle change. Overall, Hispanic Americans were more likely to receive lifestyle management advice from their providers. The subgroup analysis indicated that the biggest difference occurred in the advice on diet change, where 66% of Hispanic adults received advice to reduce fat or calories intake vs 46% of non-Hispanic whites (p < 0.001). In the USA, the prevalence of diabetes in Hispanic Americans is 17%, higher than non-Hispanic whites (8%). The higher prevalence of diabetes in Hispanic population might make health professionals more likely to address lifestyle change management to this population with high risk of developing diabetes. Research regarding Western diet acculturation and traditional Hispanic food choices may have influenced the increased likelihood to discuss dietary factors with Hispanic patients. The increased focus on lifestyle advice compared with non-Hispanic white adults may be influenced by provider's perceptions about reported low levels of physical activity in Hispanic Americans.

Background

While initial dietary management immediately after formal diagnosis is an 'accepted' cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a formal and systematic overview of its efficacy and method of delivery is not currently available.

Objectives

To assess the effects of type and frequency of different types of dietary advice for adults with type 2 diabetes.

Search Strategy

We carried out a comprehensive search of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, bibliographies and contacted relevant experts.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials, of six months or longer, in which dietary advice was the main intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

The lead investigator performed all data extraction and quality scoring with duplication being carried out by one of the other six investigators independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main Results

Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. Dietary approaches assessed in this review were low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets, low-calorie (1000 kcal per day) and very-low-calorie (500 kcal per day) diets and modified fat diets. Two trials compared the American Diabetes Association exchange diet with a standard reduced fat diet and five studies assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Two studies assessed the effect of a very-low-calorie diet versus a low-calorie diet. Six studies compared dietary advice with dietary advice plus exercise and three other studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. The studies all measured weight and measures of glycaemic control although not all studies reported these in the articles published. Other outcomes which were measured in these studies included mortality, blood pressure, serum cholesterol (including LDL and HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, maximal exercise capacity and compliance. The results suggest that adoption of regular exercise is a good way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, however all of these studies were at high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes, however the data available indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There is an urgent need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions, at various points during follow-up, although there is a promising study currently underway.

Current guidelines

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has published several recommendations for multicomponent lifestyle and behavioral therapy for adults with obesity, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and prediabetes, and clinical societies have identified several evidence-based recommendations for lifestyle modification for obesity (Table 3). According to the USPSTF, the evidence supports referring all adults with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for both weight reduction and weight maintenance. Intervention components should include nutrition, physical activity, self-monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention — each further discussed in this Advisory.

TABLE 3
Key guidelines for lifestyle modification therapies for individuals with obesity 1.

Although specifics of lifestyle programming for weight reduction and maintenance vary across guidelines, common foundations include a nutrient-dense, reduced-calorie diet; a structured program of physical activity; and behavioral strategies to support lifestyle change. Various dietary patterns have been used with success, with adherence to counseling visits and the selected diet often being the important factors in determining outcomes. Specific nutrient goals can vary by age, sex, and life stage (e.g. infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, lactation, older adulthood) as well as comorbidities or clinical conditions.

Based on existing guidelines and evidence, all individuals who would benefit from obesity treatment, including those prescribed GLP-1s, should be offered or referred for intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for both weight reduction and weight maintenance. The specific parameters can be based on patient-centered shared decision-making, considering each person's stage and severity of disease, risk of progression, and comorbidities; and centered on the individual's values and goals, stage of change, and access to therapies.

### Trends in adherence to recommended physical activity and its effects on cardiometabolic markers in US adults with pre-diabetes [^03a6572c]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Being physically active is one of the most important actions people can do to improve their health. Inadequate physical activity has been regarded as a worldwide public health problem and is responsible for approximately 6%–10% of major non-communicable diseases and 9% of premature mortality in 2008. The USA has the highest economic burdens from physical inactivity, with an associated cost of $24.7 billion in annual health care. The US Department of Health and Human Services released the first edition of the federal Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PAG) in 2008 and updated the second edition in 2018. Both guidelines recommended that adults should engage in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity a week, or an equivalent combination of both. In addition, the second edition of PAG suggests that additional health benefits are gained with moderate-intensity physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 min a week and that adults should reduce sedentary time. However, although the PAG has been released for more than 10 years, the adherence rate to the PAG for aerobic physical activity in US adults has not improved, while the sedentary time has significantly increased from 2007 to 2008 to 2015–2016.

Pre-diabetes refers to a health condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough yet to be diagnosed as diabetes. In the USA, an estimated 88 million adults, which is more than 1 in 3, had pre-diabetes in 2018. Physical exercise helps blood glucose control and is associated with a decreased risk of pre-diabetes, indicating its critical role in slowing down or even preventing disease progression in individuals with pre-diabetes. Understanding the current status and trends in adherence to PAG among individuals with pre-diabetes is critical to informing future intervention and public health policy. However, there is little information about the secular changes in adherence to PAG in US adults with pre-diabetes.

Previous studies have found that physical activity has beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health both in individuals with diabetes and pre-diabetes. Typically, the objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time were significantly associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with pre-diabetes. However, the impact of adherence to PAG on cardiometabolic risk factors in pre-diabetes has not been evaluated. It is unclear to what extent reported adherence to PAG could be inferred in US adults with pre-diabetes.

### Systematic review of the barriers and facilitators to dietary modification in people living with type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes from south Asian ethnic populations [^818b0532]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Lifestyle and dietary modification are effective in the prevention and management of Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). However, South Asian (SA) populations living in Western countries have low adherence rates to healthcare advice and experience poor diabetes control and clinical outcomes compared with the general population. This systematic review aimed to summarise the barriers and facilitators of dietary modification within people from South Asian (SA) ethnicity with T2DM or pre-diabetes.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus generated 3739 articles, of which seven were included. Qualitative and quantitative data were inputted utilising COVIDENCE. Qualitative data were analysed by thematic analysis.

Results

Thematic analysis identified three facilitators: (1) cultural sensitivity, (2) health education and (3) support networks. Barriers include (1) healthcare inequity, (2) cultural insensitivity, (3) social pressures, (4) misconceptions and (5) time constraints. Good access to health care and motivation were the most common facilitators discussed. Misconceptions on T2DM management and cultural insensitivity contributed to the majority of barriers discussed.

Conclusions

Culturally tailored interventions could improve adherence to diet modification in people with T2DM from SA ethnicity. Interventions involving the application of social media to challenge intergenerational stigmas and misinformation, distributing culturally appropriate resources and providing diets tailored to the SA palate could help.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^70f0ae3b]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications, eating patterns, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to ensure that eating patterns emphasize key nutrition principles (inclusion of nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, lean proteins, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and low-fat dairy or nondairy alternatives) and minimize consumption of red meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, sweets, refined grains, processed and ultraprocessed foods in patients with prediabetes or diabetes.

### A systematic approach to treating early metabolic disease and prediabetes [^387b219a]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle diseases require a lifetime of action. Indeed, the impact of metabolic disease on human health begins prior to conception, as the metabolic health of mothers impacts their offspring. The impact of obesity and diabetes globally has escalated over the past 20 years and the projections are ominous as obesity is expected to drive the global prevalence of diabetes to 1.3 billion by 2050. While food supply and societal factors need to be improved, patients cannot wait. Continuing the approach of diet and exercise only for metabolic health is not patient-centered, promotes health disparity, and is illogical as it has failed for over 20 years.

### Baseline characteristics of participants in the pre-diabetes interventions and continued tracking to ease-out diabetes (pre-DICTED) program [^c8b2e268]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

The baseline results indicate that there is heterogeneity in lifestyle risk factors between men and women, as well as between Chinese, Malay and Indian participants. Women were less likely to meet physical activity recommendations compared with men, but they had higher intake of dietary fiber and fresh fruits and lower intake of refined grains, red meat and saturated fat. In the comparison between ethnic groups, Indian participants were the least likely to meet physical activity recommendations, but had higher dietary fiber intake, lower saturated fat intake and lower red meat, poultry and seafood intake than Chinese and Malay participants. These baseline differences in physical activity and dietary intake are generally consistent with prior studies on dietary intake and their cultural determinants, and may suggest a need for a sex/ethnicity-sensitive approach to conducting lifestyle intervention programs.

As a pragmatic trial that aims to replicate the benefits of landmark efficacy trials while conserving healthcare resources, Pre-DICTED offers a common lifestyle modification curriculum for all intervention participants. Whereas landmark explanatory trials such as the US DPP, the Finnish DPS, and the Da Qing IGT and Diabetes Studyprovided lifestyle counseling sessions on an individual basis, the Pre-DICTED Program consists of group-based classes. Although the group-based classes do not provide recommendations tailored to an individual's risk profile, a variety of meal plans and physical activities are provided as examples during the lifestyle modification sessions. Moreover, intervention participants are guided to set their own individual goals during the goal-setting session, and there is flexibility as to how the participants choose to work towards the 5% weight loss goal.

### Dietary fat and diabetes: a consensus view [^72a800c5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There may be no area in nutrition more controversial or subject to more changes in policy than dietary fat recommendations for individuals with diabetes. At one extreme, diets very low in carbohydrates with very high levels of fat were advocated in the early days of diabetes therapy. At the other extreme, the literature in the late 1980s and early 1990s emphasized diets very low in fat and high in carbohydrates. This conference has shown that too much information is missing for a definitive recommendation to be made concerning diet composition for diabetic individuals, but it also has led to the realization that we may now have considerable flexibility in our dietary recommendations for individuals with diabetes.

Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low- and very-low-carbohydrate diets — weight loss in adults with overweight/obesity and in prediabetes/type 2 diabetes: Research has not demonstrated any advantage of a very-low-CHO diet on weight loss at 6 months compared with a calorie-restricted, low-fat diet. Reviews and meta-analyses examined low-CHO, high-fat (LCHF) (> 30% TDE fat) versus high-CHO, low-fat (HCLF) diets (< 30% TDE fat) for 3 to 6 months or 1 to 2 years; participants in both LCHF and HCLF groups achieved clinically meaningful weight loss, but weight loss was significantly greater with LCHF when prescribed diets were hypocaloric, and prescribed ad libitum LCHF diets were hypocaloric with study duration less than 2 years. In prediabetes and T2D, long-term studies showed no significant difference for weight loss between low-CHO and HCLF; at 3 months low-CHO reduced weight versus HCLF (weighted mean difference [WMD] − 1.08 kg, 95% CI: − 1.93, − 0.23, n = 12 studies), with no difference at ≥ 6 months (WMD − 0.14 kg, 95% CI: − 0.94, 0.65, n = 9 studies).

### A practical guide to delivering nutritional advice to people with diabetes [^4549efa9]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Delivering effective dietary advice for people with diabetes goes beyond supplying information and addresses the behavioural and psychosocial determinants of health behaviour change. Adopting new skills and changing their own behaviour is challenging for many healthcare professionals, and there are few education programmes available that specifically address effective consultation skills rather then increasing clinical expertise. Despite these challenges, there are practical strategies that can be incorporated into general practice and most of these strategies are not more time-consuming than standard approaches and are more effective if used appropriately.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^718ecd55]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 — Key guidelines for lifestyle modification therapies for individuals with obesity — The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/The Obesity Society (2013) advise to counsel that lifestyle changes achieving even modest, sustained weight reduction of 3–5% produce clinically meaningful health benefits and to advise/prescribe participation in a comprehensive lifestyle intervention for 6 or more months, including at least 14 sessions over 6 months (Grade IA). The United States Preventive Services Task Force (2018) states to offer or refer all adults with obesity to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions with components that include nutrition, physical activity, self-monitoring, identifying barriers, problem solving, peer support, and relapse prevention (B recommendations). The United States Preventive Services Task Force (2020) recommends offering or referring adults with CVD risk factors, including those with estimated 10-year CVD risk ≥ 7.5%, to behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity (B recommendation). The United States Preventive Services Task Force (2021) advises to screen adults aged 35–70 years who have overweight or obesity for prediabetes and diabetes and to offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions such as lifestyle interventions that focus on diet, physical activity, or both (B recommendation). The Canadian Medical Association notes adults living with obesity should receive individualized medical nutrition therapy provided by a registered dietitian to improve weight outcomes and that adults living with obesity can consider any of multiple medical nutrition therapies to improve health-related outcomes. The European Association for the Study of Obesity states to provide behavioral modifications for all persons with obesity, including nutritional therapy, physical activity, stress reduction, and sleep improvement.

### Improved insulin sensitivity and body composition, irrespective of macronutrient intake, after a 12 month intervention in adolescents with pre-diabetes; RESIST a randomised control trial [^dd8e69c9]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

A strength of the study was the retention rate. After the six month intensive lifestyle intervention, including regular dietary counselling, food hampers to support the prescribed diet, a three month supervised physical activity program and email support, we retained 88% of those recruited. After 12 months, the last six months being a maintenance phase with regular, but limited contact with health professionals, we retained 77%. The challenges of recruitment and retention of adolescents have been previously described. Most (77%) adolescents that dropped out reported lack of interest, highlighting that one program does not suit everyone and alternative approaches to managing adolescents with insulin resistance/pre-diabetes are required. Food preferences are personal; dietary modification may need to be individualised.

3. Recommendations for patients with pre-existing diabetes

3. 1. Preconception information for women with pre-existing diabetes

From adolescence onwards, advise women about the importance of avoiding unplanned pregnancy (B). Inform women and their families about how diabetes affects pregnancy and how pregnancy affects diabetes. Information and advice should cover the following points:

- The impact of poor glycemic control in the course of pregnancy and in the risks for the mother and the fetus.

- The role of diet, weight, and exercise (including weight loss advice for women who have a body mass index above 25 kg/m 2).

- The increased risk of having a baby who is large for gestational age (LGA), increasing the likelihood of birth trauma, induction of labor, and cesarean section.

- The importance of maternal glycemic control during labor and birth and early feeding of the baby to reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia.

- The possibility of transient morbidity (such as hypoglycemia or respiratory distress syndrome) in the baby during the neonatal period, which may require admission to a neonatal unit.

- The need for folic acid supplementation (600 mcg to 5 mg a day) until 12 th gestation week to reduce the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect.

- The risks of hypoglycemia and of hypoglycemia unawareness during pregnancy and the effects of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy on glycemic control.

The need for assessment of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy before, during and after pregnancy, and the risk of its worseningOffer preconception care and advice to women who are planning to become pregnant before they discontinue contraception. Inform them that establishing a good glycemic control before conception and continuing it throughout pregnancy reduces- but does not eliminate - the risks of miscarriage, congenital malformations, stillbirth, and neonatal death (B).

Offer a structured continuous education program that will provide a better understanding of diabetes in pregnancy in what concerns diet, carbohydrate counting, correct insulin dose adjustment and self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), as soon as possible, to women that are planning to become pregnant. Assess the presence of nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression and thyroid dysfunctions in women with diabetes who are contemplating pregnancy, and start its treatment as soon as possible.

Dietary consensus across clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) indicates clear consensus support for consuming fruit, vegetables, legumes/pulses, and whole grains while limiting intake of salt or sodium. Findings from this study did not support popular trends such as low-carbohydrate, high-protein, Paleo, or ketogenic diets, and clinicians should practice caution when communicating with patients interested in adopting these or other dietary patterns inconsistent with most recommendations for chronic disease. The authors state these findings support both the ACLM's dietary statement and its expert consensus that the most effective lifestyle intervention to bring T2D remission is whole, plant-based foods with minimal consumption of meat and other animal products.

Dietary recommendations across clinical practice guidelines — study objectives, scope, and methods — are outlined, stating the primary objective was to conduct a meta-epidemiologic study (with guidelines as the unit of analysis) comparing dietary recommendations from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) developed by governments, major medical professional societies, and large health stakeholder associations for adults with prespecified chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease [CVD], type 2 diabetes [T2D], cancer, autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, digestive diseases, and weight-related conditions). Primary dietary outcomes were dietary patterns, food groups, and food components, with secondary outcomes of macronutrient and micronutrient recommendations, and the report includes an assessment of dietary messaging consistency across CPGs; it did not assess the evidence used to develop CPGs or formally evaluate aspects such as guideline group composition or grading of evidence. Methods used a systematic review approach following the National Academy of Medicine's Standards for Systematic Reviews; a risk-of-bias assessment was not completed per meta-epidemiologic guidelines, results are reported according to those guidelines including an adapted PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, and a protocol was registered on PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021226281). The significance statement notes this is the first study to compare dietary recommendations across current CPGs for multiple major chronic diseases and that guidelines are closely aligned in recommending daily intake of plant sources of food with limited consumption of alcohol and salt or sodium, concluding that clinicians should feel confident making these recommendations in accordance with their respective practice guidelines; background context cites a 2019 analysis in 195 countries attributing more than half of diet-related deaths to nonoptimal intake of whole grains, fruit, and sodium.

### The pre-diabetes risk education and physical activity recommendation and encouragement (PREPARE) programme study: are improvements in glucose regulation sustained at 2 years? [^176f83a6]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether improvements in glucose regulation following the PREPARE structured education programme were sustained at 24 months.

Patients and Methods

Ninety-eight overweight or obese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to receive: (1) advice leaflet, (2) 3-h structured education programme aimed at promoting physical activity, (iii) 3-h structured education with personalized pedometer use. The primary outcome was change in 2-h post-challenge plasma glucose.

Results

Seventy-three (74%) individuals were included for analysis at 24 months; age 65 ± 8 years, BMI 29.3 ± 4.8 kg/m(2), South Asian ethnicity 21%. A statistically significant reduction in 2-h glucose of -1.6 mmol/l (-0.4 to -2.7) was seen in the education-with-pedometer group compared with the control group. There is no significant difference in the education-only group.

Conclusion

Improvements in glucose regulation following a pragmatic group-based structured education with pedometer use were sustained at 24 months.

### Remission of pre-diabetes to normal glucose tolerance in obese adults with high protein versus high carbohydrate diet: randomized control trial [^16d6de12]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Diet compliance is an important factor in macronutrient composition diet studies. Most studies rely on a patient's recall food questionnaire of meals they ate days to weeks before which is generally inaccurate. Strengths of this feeding study are that it was a randomized control trial where all food and daily diet plans were provided to each subject in the HP and HC diet groups at their weekly visit to the CRC along with daily food consumption survey each week for 6 months. This monitoring resulted in > 90% compliance of diet adherence. Our study demonstrates for the first time that strict adherence of dietary intervention is possible and can produce meaningful and reliable results and remission of pre-diabetes. At an additional 6-month follow-up visit after 6 months on the diet study, the subjects that chose to stay on the HP diet plans purchasing their own food and with consultations with the investigators when needed maintained their weight loss and normal glucose levels.

The daily cost of such a diet (HP or HC) was about $13 a day with minimal personnel involvement (except for weekly pick-up of diet supplies). The diet plans are adjustable to the subjects food likes and dislike with a wide variety of choices with different meal plans for each day of the week. Weekly meal plans and initial instructions could be provided to the subject and phone and email consultation provided when needed. By this method, the HP diet plan would allow for a diet care plan to be instituted by primary care physicians and offer an economical means of a nutritional weight loss diet and remission of pre-diabetes in men and women.

Testing for Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes in Asymptomatic Patients

Testing to detect pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes). In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. (B)
If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. (E)
To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, an FPG test or 2-h OGTT (75-g glucose load) or both are appropriate. (B)
An OGTT may be considered in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) to better define the risk of diabetes. (E)
In those identified with pre-diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. (B)

3.1.2 Additional evidence

We identified a post hoc analysis of the Exercise and Nutritional Interventions for Cardiovascular Health (ENCORE) study and an additional RCT, 23, 24 both of which were published prior to the 2018 standards (Table S2). The post hoc analysis by Blumenthal et al 23 compared a usual care diet, which allowed ad libitum energy intake, to the DASH diet alone and to a DASH diet with energy restriction and exercise. The DASH diet + exercise did result in significantly greater improvements in FBG, body fat, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides compared to usual care, but the DASH diet alone did not have any of these significant outcomes compared to usual care. The study also reported a worsening in glycaemic control status (based on glucose tolerance test measures at baseline and end of the intervention) during the study period in participants without T2D or prediabetes in the DASH arm, more than with the control and DASH diet + exercise. 23 The RCT by Paula et al 24 compared the DASH diet + exercise to a diet based on ADA guidelines that did not include exercise. The significance of change from baseline and in a comparison of interventions was mixed; DASH + exercise resulted in a greater reduction in blood pressure but no difference in glycaemic control when compared to usual care; however, the effect of the DASH diet without exercise was unknown. 24

Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Low- and very-low-carbohydrate diets — blood pressure effects in adults — show that a 5% weight loss typically reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 3 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 2 mm Hg, while randomized trial meta-analyses comparing low-carbohydrate (low-CHO) versus high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diets reported mixed findings: no significant SBP difference with a significant DBP reduction (WMD −1.47 mm Hg; 95% CI: −3.44, 0.50; P = 0.14; n = 11 studies; and WMD −1.43 mm Hg; 95% CI: −2.49, −0.37; P = 0.008; n = 11 studies), a significant SBP advantage for low‑CHO (WMD −2.74 mm Hg; 95% CI: −5.27, −0.20; P = 0.03; n = 7 studies) but not DBP, a significant DBP decrease with high‑fat diets (WMD −1.35; 95% CI: −1.79, −0.92; P < .00001; n = 6 studies) but not SBP, and a 6‑month DBP decrease with low‑CHO (WMD −1.91; 95% CI: −3.63, −0.18; P = 0.03; n = 4 studies) without differences past 6 months; a critical review of 12 RCTs noted exceptions favoring HCLF for SBP (−3.03 mm Hg, P = 0.04) and low‑CHO for DBP (−2 mm Hg, P = 0.020), and overall concluded effects were inconsistent in adults with overweight or obesity with and without prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.

### Gut microbiome modulates the effects of a personalised postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet on cardiometabolic markers: a diet intervention in pre-diabetes [^bcd5548d]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

We recently reported the clinical results of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in adults with pre-diabetes that demonstrated beneficial effects of a personalised postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet, which is based on a machine-learning algorithm for predicting personal postprandial glucose responses (PPGR), on primary glycaemic outcomes and other secondary metabolic outcomes, beyond the established metabolic benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet. In the current work, we perform ad hoc analyses aimed at evaluating other exploratory outcomes of the 6-month dietary intervention, including high-resolution assessment of the dietary changes and microbiome compositional changes observed on both arms. We further explore associations between changes in multiple dietary features, microbiome species and metabolic readouts across the cohort (regardless of arm assignment) and evaluate the role of microbiota species in mediating the effects of dietary changes on metabolic outcomes. Finally, we devise machine-learning models trained on dietary changes and baseline clinical data, to predict personalised metabolic responses to dietary modifications and assess features importance for clinical improvement in cardiometabolic markers of blood lipids, glycaemic control and body weight in this RCT setting.

### Effects of a low-carbohydrate dietary intervention on hemoglobin A1c: a randomized clinical trial [^46d40745]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Given its increasing prevalence and high disease burden, prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health priority. Individuals with prediabetes have elevated risk of T2D and other cardiometabolic diseases. Much evidence supports the crucial role of diet in preventing T2D, with most dietary interventions focused on reducing caloric and total fat intake.

Evidence suggests low-to-moderate carbohydrate diets (< 45% energy from carbohydrates) are at least as effective as low-fat diets at promoting weight loss and improving cardiovascular risk factors. In meta-analyses, of trials among individuals with T2D, larger carbohydrate restriction corresponded with larger hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) reductions.

If sustained, interventions that lower HbA 1c in the short-term may lead to T2D prevention, as was observed in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial. To our knowledge, only 2 pilot trials, have assessed glycemic effects of low-carbohydrate diets in participants with prediabetes. One study, only included 4 people with prediabetes, and the otherstudied only a moderately low-carbohydrate intervention (≤ 130 g/d). Given the benefits of low-carbohydrate diets for weight loss in general populations and for glycemic control for diabetes, studying effects of these diets on glycemic biomarkers is warranted among individuals with untreated prediabetes and diabetes.

In this randomized clinical trial, we tested effects of a behavioral intervention promoting a healthy, low-carbohydrate diet compared with usual diet on HbA 1c and metabolic risk factors among adults with untreated HbA 1c of 6.0% to 6.9%. The low-carbohydrate diet promoted was characterized by components thought to improve cardiometabolic health: unsaturated fat and protein, high-fiber foods, and minimal refined carbohydrates. The HbA 1c range was chosen as the lower bound aligns with the World Health Organization lower cutoff point for prediabetes and the upper bound with the less than 7.0% American Diabetes Association HbA 1c target.

### Topics in type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance [^94ed70aa]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Nonetheless, using all the available information, it certainly is possible to identify individuals at increased diabetes risk. Two approaches are taken: 1) direct outreach to large numbers of people for prevention of adverse outcome or 2) case management of smaller numbers of people at much higher risk. In large-group outreach approaches, smoking cessation, healthy eating, and physical activity are typically recommended and the importance of lipid and blood pressure management is emphasized, but glucose measurement and approaches to reduction of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance are not currently recommended by the majority of managed-care programs. In disease management approaches, measures to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemia are limited to management of individuals with existing diabetes. Cardiometabolic risk information is, however, being given to participants in many plans, with priorities for health coaching, health risk appraisal, and incentives, such as discounts on health club membership. Use of case management to oversee treatment plans is less frequently being pursued than what is termed the "medical home" primary care approach of treatment managed and coordinated by an individual physician. Health care providers are offered lipid, blood pressure, and preventative health service guidelines, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines are not typically stressed, and O'Connor suggested that "guidelines are increasingly being viewed as irrelevant." Rather, "payment for performance" initiatives are more "front and center," he said, and assistance in coordination of care infrequently addresses pre-diabetes. Medical directors feel that they do not have sufficient resources for such efforts and believe that "there is an evidence problem" and are hampered by limited information systems, although O'Conor suggested that once diabetes is diagnosed, obesity, A1C, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and aspirin use all improve, "so when you activate these systems… you can get a lot done." A missing tool is the electronic medical record, which could be readily used to identify individuals at high risk and could incorporate linked patient "portals" or proactive "e-visits," for which providers could be offered reimbursement, and either simple alerts or more complex decision-support tools to allow physician-directed interventions. The surveyed health plan directors indicated that complicated screening tests (which they apparently consider to include glucose tolerance testing) are less likely to be used.

### Obesity and weight management for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^97d68cd0]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Dietary interventions and programs — High levels of physical activity (200–300 min/week) are emphasized for weight management. Some commercial and proprietary weight loss programs have shown promising weight loss results; however, results vary across programs, most lack evidence of effectiveness, many do not satisfy guideline recommendations, and some promote unscientific and possibly dangerous practices. Structured, very-low-calorie eating patterns, typically 800–1,000 kcal/day, may increase the pace and/or magnitude of initial weight loss and glycemic improvement compared with standard behavioral interventions, but such intensive nutritional interventions should be provided only by trained and experienced professionals in medical settings with close ongoing monitoring and integration with behavioral support and counseling, and only for a short term (generally up to 3 months). Due to the high risk of complications, such intensive interventions should be prescribed only to carefully selected individuals.

### Definition of intervention points in prediabetes [^6668fc94]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

With respect to clinical phenotype and pathophysiology, prediabetes is akin to diabetes. Prediabetes is prevalent in the global population, and those affected are at high risk of progression to overt diabetes, and also at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progression to diabetes can occur because of worsening insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, or both, but the timecourse can be non-linear and, therefore, unpredictable. Intervention-by lifestyle modification, glucose-lowering drugs, or a combination-can postpone deterioration of glucose control, but effects of intervention are variable and can be transient. Furthermore, to what extent interventions can reduce cardiovascular risk is uncertain. Lifestyle intervention mainly hinges on weight loss; as such, risk of failure in the long-term is high, and implementation at the community level is difficult. The ideal candidate for intervention is an individual with prediabetes-identified by targeted screening-with many well documented cardiovascular risk factors, and who is highly motivated to initiate and maintain multifactorial risk-control using a personalised mix of lifestyle-adaptation and pharmacological treatment.
