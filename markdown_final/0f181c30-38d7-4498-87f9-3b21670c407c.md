## Question

How is thoracic outlet syndrome treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is treated, organized by subtype and including when to use conservative care versus surgery, how to select surgical approaches, and how to manage vascular complications and postoperative care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about accurate classification and diagnostic criteria because management hinges on the compressed structure. Then, I should verify first-line nonoperative management for neurogenic TOS and define failure thresholds. Next, I will evaluate surgical indications and the evidence supporting decompression. After that, I need to compare operative approaches, including open, endoscopic, and robotic techniques. Then, I will address type-specific algorithms for venous and arterial TOS, including anticoagulation, thrombolysis or thrombectomy, decompression, and adjunct endovascular decisions. Finally, I will consider postoperative rehabilitation, special populations such as athletes and pediatrics, and strategies for recurrence or failed prior surgery, making sure to self-check claims against guideline and trial data throughout [^112H9CNS] [^113nJcLd].

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework and classification because if I misclassify, the entire treatment algorithm could drift off course. TOS encompasses neurogenic (brachial plexus compression), venous (subclavian vein), and arterial (subclavian artery) syndromes, with neurogenic being by far the most common and vascular forms less frequent; diagnosis is primarily clinical, augmented by targeted imaging when vascular compromise is suspected and standardized criteria for NTOS per SVS reporting standards help reduce heterogeneity in care and outcome assessment [^112H9CNS] [^113nJcLd] [^113DQzSH] [^111UsBF7].

> Wait, let me verify the initial management for neurogenic TOS before I discuss surgery, because escalating prematurely is a common pitfall. For NTOS, specialized physical or hand therapy focused on posture correction, scalene stretching, and shoulder girdle strengthening is first-line; anesthetic or botulinum toxin scalene injections can assist diagnosis and provide short-term relief while sometimes predicting surgical responders, and a structured conservative trial over about 3–6 months is typical unless there is progressive neurologic deficit or intolerable functional loss, with athletes often needing sport-specific rehabilitation elements to return to prior levels [^112H9CNS] [^111CKZ1E] [^112hN2om] [^116GpVp3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on indications for surgery until I align them with consensus criteria. Surgical decompression is considered when a well-conducted conservative program fails, when symptoms are severe or function-limiting, or when there is objective deficit or proven vascular compromise; importantly, the STOPNTOS randomized trial demonstrated that transaxillary decompression produced significantly better short-term disability scores than continued conservative care in refractory NTOS, with all conservatively managed participants ultimately requesting surgery, which supports the benefit of decompression in carefully selected NTOS patients [^112H9CNS] [^117TxuKY].

> Let me consider the core operative principle next, and I should confirm whether rib resection is truly necessary or if scalene division alone suffices. The overarching goal is complete decompression of the thoracic outlet, most commonly achieved with first rib resection combined with anterior and often middle scalenectomy to create space in the scalene and costoclavicular triangles; incomplete resection or retained rib/scalene elements are well-documented causes of failure, and physiologic work suggests that pressures in the costoclavicular space fall meaningfully only once the first rib is removed, supporting FRR as a key step for durable relief [^1116zAuz] [^113bczX4] [^112Mp1ep] [^111tA2is].

> I should double-check the choice of surgical approach because exposure, complication profiles, and the target pathology differ by TOS type. The transaxillary route has a long track record and provides direct access to the first rib, the supraclavicular approach offers excellent visualization of the brachial plexus and is often preferred when extensive neurolysis is needed, and for venous TOS the infraclavicular approach increasingly facilitates optimal exposure of the subclavian vein in a shallower field with favorable patency and symptom resolution in contemporary series; minimally invasive options include VATS and a transthoracic robotic approach that improve visualization and may reduce morbidity, although selection should be individualized to anatomy, surgeon expertise, and TOS subtype [^115xB2sG] [^1158wor5] [^1113VS9n] [^111JH2Zn] [^115y6rR7] [^113AGWTH].

> Next, I should review venous TOS (effort thrombosis/Paget-Schroetter) because timing and sequencing of therapies critically affect outcomes. In the acute phase, prompt anticoagulation is standard, with catheter-directed thrombolysis considered for fresh clot in low-bleeding-risk patients, and mechanical or aspiration thrombectomy is an alternative or adjunct when lysis is undesirable; however, definitive treatment requires thoracic outlet decompression to address the anatomic lesion because recurrence and loss of patency are common with anticoagulation or thrombolysis alone, and residual stenosis is often managed with balloon angioplasty via venography either at the time of FRR or 2–4 weeks later, while routine early stenting is generally avoided given external compression and fracture risks despite selected series showing high assisted patency with reinterventions [^114gPSKN] [^112yJgid] [^115YHE6w] [^114LNa6p] [^111s5aG3].

> But wait, what if the presentation is arterial TOS; I need to ensure I do not misapply venous algorithms. For aTOS, operative intervention is usually indicated given the risk of ischemia, and decompression with at least first rib resection is mandatory; if there is intimal injury, mural thrombus, or aneurysm, arterial reconstruction with bypass or interposition graft is indicated, stenting should be avoided due to persistent extrinsic compression, and distal embolization requires embolectomy and often lytic catheter placement and systemic anticoagulation during the acute event [^112qLXt4] [^113z4VAV].

> I will now examine postoperative management and rehabilitation because outcomes hinge on careful follow-through. Early mobilization with supervised passive and assisted shoulder motion starts immediately, advancing to structured therapy over about 6–12 weeks, and for venous TOS anticoagulation is commonly continued for 3–6 months with follow-up imaging such as duplex at 6 months to assess patency and selective CT venography as needed, while centers vary on whether to perform completion venography intraoperatively or schedule it 2–4 weeks postoperatively for angioplasty of residual lesions [^115YHE6w] [^111UsBF7] [^114LNa6p].

> I need to check implications for special populations because athletes and children can follow different trajectories. Overhead athletes are at increased risk for vTOS and also present with NTOS; many collegiate athletes can be managed successfully without surgery through dedicated therapy, although selected cases still require decompression to return to sport, and in pediatrics a conservative-first strategy remains standard with transaxillary decompression showing excellent long-term outcomes in small series when surgery is needed [^116GpVp3] [^113UJGEM] [^112phEGh].

> Hold on, I should verify how to manage recurrences and failures, including what to look for on re-evaluation. Persistent or recurrent symptoms are often due to retained or residual first rib segments, residual or reconstituted scalene muscle, or dense scarring around the plexus, and targeted redo procedures can be effective when the diagnosis is sound; strategies include removal of remaining rib or rib remnants and, in anatomically complete prior decompressions with recurrent NTOS, selective reoperative brachial plexus neurolysis, with reports emphasizing the technical challenges and the importance of meticulous primary decompression to minimize the need for reoperation [^112Mp1ep] [^115M3qZc] [^116jhPKh] [^111w3vEA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that "surgical resection is curative" based on minimally invasive series; I should correct that to reflect the broader evidence base. While small VATS cohorts report high symptom resolution, these are uncontrolled and low-credibility series, whereas consensus statements and the STOPNTOS randomized trial support that surgery benefits appropriately selected NTOS patients but do not justify calling it universally curative; durability depends on accurate diagnosis, complete decompression, rehab adherence, and vigilant follow-up to address residual venous lesions or recurrent neural compression, so I will temper that claim accordingly [^115y6rR7] [^112H9CNS] [^117TxuKY].

Treatment options for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) [^113bczX4] are tailored to the subtype and symptom severity, with **conservative therapy first** [^117TxuKY] [^113nJcLd] and **surgery reserved for refractory or vascular cases** [^112qLXt4] [^114gPSKN].

- **Neurogenic TOS**: Start with physical therapy, posture correction, and activity modification [^112H9CNS]; consider botulinum toxin or local anesthetic injections for short-term relief or diagnostic purposes [^111CKZ1E]. Surgery (first rib resection with scalenectomy) is indicated for persistent symptoms or progressive neurologic deficits [^117TxuKY] [^113bczX4].

- **Venous TOS**: Acute thrombosis requires anticoagulation and catheter-directed thrombolysis, followed by surgical decompression (first rib resection) to prevent recurrence [^115xB2sG]; endovascular stenting is reserved for residual stenosis [^111dyCyQ] [^111s5aG3].

- **Arterial TOS**: Surgical decompression with arterial reconstruction is the standard due to ischemic risk [^112qLXt4]; endovascular stenting is generally avoided because of external compression [^112H9CNS].

- **Minimally invasive options**: Robotic [^111JH2Zn] or VATS [^115y6rR7] first rib resection offers reduced morbidity and faster recovery in selected patients.

- **Postoperative care**: Emphasize physical therapy [^112H9CNS], pain management, and regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence or complications [^115YHE6w].

Overall, **conservative management is first-line** for neurogenic TOS [^117TxuKY] [^113nJcLd], whereas venous and arterial TOS generally require surgical intervention after initial medical stabilization [^112qLXt4] [^115xB2sG].

### Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: A primer for hand and peripheral nerve surgeons [^111CKZ1E]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is a complex condition commonly misunderstood. Historically, much of this confusion has arisen due to its grouping with other diagnoses that share only an anatomic location. Modern understanding emphasizes the role of small unmyelinated C-type pain and sympathetic fibers. Diagnosis is primarily clinical after ruling out other common conditions.

Hand therapy is usually the first-line treatment with variable success. Local anesthetic, botulinum toxins, or steroid injections can aid in diagnosis and offer short-term relief. Although surgery can yield results that are reliable, it is technically challenging, and the preferred surgical approach remains a matter of debate. Despite limitations in diagnosis and treatment, recognition and successful management of this condition can be highly impactful for the patient.

### Totally endoscopic (VATS) first rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome [^115y6rR7]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) causes neurologic symptoms in 95% of cases and vascular symptoms in 5% of cases. Surgical resection is curative. Endoscopic-assisted transaxillary first rib resection has been previously reported. In this study, we report a totally endoscopic video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach using tailored endoscopic instruments.

- **Methods**: Ten patients (8 women; average age, 32.3 ± 5.6 years) with TOS underwent VATS first rib resection following the failure of symptom improvement with physiotherapy. Symptoms were unilateral neurogenic (n = 7), bilateral neurogenic (n = 2), and bilateral arterial compression (n = 1). Three standard VATS ports were utilized. The parietal pleura and periosteum overlying the first rib were stripped, avoiding injury to the neurovascular bundle. The rib was transected with an endoscopic rib cutter and resected completely in a piecemeal fashion using endoscopic bone nibblers. All periosteal remnants were trimmed, releasing the neurovascular bundle completely.

- **Results**: Patients were discharged within 72 hours following surgery. One patient had the contralateral side treated 18 months later, and another patient is awaiting the second surgery. At follow-up, 9 patients had complete resolution of their main symptoms. One patient with neurogenic TOS developed mild functional and sensational loss of the non-dominant hand that improved within 8 months with physiotherapy.

- **Conclusions**: VATS first rib resection for TOS provides, unlike the classic approaches, a superior, magnified, and well-illuminated view.

### Transthoracic robotic first and cervical rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome [^111JH2Zn]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a musculoskeletal condition in which the brachial plexus is dynamically compressed within the scalene triangle, an anatomic space bordered by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib. In some cases, an offending cervical rib is present. Traditional surgical approaches to first rib resection and scalenectomy are limited by exposure, require retraction of neurovascular structures, and result in morbidity.

- **Methods**: We describe a novel transthoracic robotic approach to first/cervical rib resection that overcomes these limitations and review its early clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Robotic first rib resection (FRR) is crystallized into 12 distinct steps, each with detailed video commentary. Nuances specific to neurogenic and venous TOS cases are provided. Published data supports decreased surgical morbidity of robotic FRR compared with open cases.

- **Conclusions**: Robotic FRR offers advantages over traditional operative approaches, including improved exposure and elimination of retraction of neurovascular structures, resulting in improved safety.

### Surgical management of post-thrombotic syndrome in chronic venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^111dyCyQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) is considered chronic when symptoms and venous stenosis or occlusion persist for more than three months after an initial primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis event. Many patients with chronic VTOS receive conservative treatment. However, a subset of these patients will experience persistent post-thrombotic syndrome symptoms due to underlying causative anatomy. This study presents the results of a treatment during the same admission consisting of transaxillary thoracic outlet decompression (TA-TOD), external venolysis, and, if necessary, treatment of residual intraluminal lesions with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for chronic VTOS.

All patients presenting from January 2015 to December 2019 with chronic VTOS and post-thrombotic syndrome complaints were evaluated. Patients with some degree of patency on venography or a chronic occlusion that could be recanalized using PTA preoperatively underwent TA-TOD, external venolysis, and immediate venography. Low-pressure diagnostic balloon inflation after first rib resection was used to identify residual lesions not evident by venography. If found, PTA was performed. Stent placement was reserved for patients with complaints due to residual lesions that were not effectively treated by PTA.

A total of 40 patients with chronic VTOS were evaluated, of whom 36 were treated according to the protocol. The remaining four patients, who had a chronic occlusion that could not be recanalized preoperatively, were excluded.

### A review of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome [^112qLXt4]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition in which anatomic abnormalities in the thoracic outlet cause compression of the subclavian or, less commonly, axillary artery. Patients are usually younger and typically have an anatomic abnormality causing the compression. The condition usually goes undiagnosed until patients present with signs of acute or chronic hand or arm ischemia. The workup of this condition includes a thorough history and physical examination, a chest X-ray to identify potential anatomic abnormalities, and arterial imaging, such as computed tomographic angiography or duplex, to identify arterial abnormalities.

Patients will usually require operative intervention due to their symptomatic presentation. Intervention should always include decompression of the thoracic outlet with at least a first-rib resection and any other structures causing external compression. If the artery is identified to have intimal damage, mural thrombus, or is aneurysmal, then arterial reconstruction is warranted. Stenting should be avoided due to external compression.

In patients with symptoms of embolization, a combination of embolectomy, lytic catheter placement, and/or therapeutic anticoagulation should be performed. Typically, patients have excellent outcomes, with resolution of symptoms and high patency of the bypass graft, although patients with distal embolization may require finger amputation.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^115YHE6w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Recently, we have begun to routinely perform a venogram either concomitantly with the rib resection or scheduled for 2 to 4 weeks after the operation, at which time additional angioplasty may be performed if needed. Patients are typically discharged on anticoagulation for 3 to 6 months. Follow-up typically involves a wound and symptom check visit at 3 to 4 weeks and a 6-month visit with a duplex ultrasound examination to assess vein patency. For patients whose veins are not well characterized on duplex, a computed tomography venogram is obtained. Patients are also referred to and are closely followed by a specialized physical therapist.

### Successful endovascular thrombectomy with the ClotTriever System for acute subclavian vein thrombosis in venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^114gPSKN]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). High credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) is a rare condition resulting from compression of the subclavian vein (SV), most commonly at the costoclavicular junction. SV compression can be intermittent or result in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occlusion. Upper extremity DVT in the setting of VTOS typically occurs in younger adults after repetitive excessive arm activity and can be referred to as effort thrombosis or Paget-Schroetter syndrome. Characteristic symptoms of effort thrombosis occur due to venous obstruction and include sudden arm swelling, cyanosis, pain, and mild paresthesia. Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment are the most important predictors of patient outcomes.

Standard treatment of upper extremity DVT is anticoagulation, while catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) can be considered in patients with severe symptoms and low bleeding risk who are likely to benefit from thrombolysis. More recently, other advanced catheter-based treatments including mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and aspiration thrombectomy (AT) have been studied for the treatment of upper extremity DVT as an alternative to CDT. After DVT removal, definitive treatment requires surgical decompression to resolve the underlying pathology, as recurrence of symptoms and loss of patency occurs in approximately half of patients treated with anticoagulation and CDT alone.

The ClotTriever System (Inari Medical, Irvine, CA) is a new MT system used for the treatment of DVT, approved by the US FDA and CE Mark in 2017. In the last few years, it has been used for lower and upper DVT mostly due to its efficacy in removing thrombi.

### First rib resection in thoracic outlet syndrome [^113bczX4]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) present with exercise-induced upper extremity paresthesia. Neurogenic TOS is the most common type, characterized by compression of the brachial nerve plexus against a tight thoracic outlet. Although rare, vascular compromise can occur due to thoracic outlet pressure against the subclavian artery or, more commonly, the subclavian vein. This article reviews the pathophysiology of TOS and describes several effective surgical interventions. Complete first rib resection with surgical decompression is an essential part of the treatment for TOS. First rib resection via a supraclavicular or a preferred transaxillary route should be considered when conservative modalities provide no symptom improvement.

### Special issue: Abstracts of the 11th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology, Helsinki, Finland [^111iNpWA]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Background and aims: Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), first described by Peet et al. in 1956, refers to symptoms caused by the compression of the neurovascular bundle within the thoracic outlet, which extends from the supraclavicular fossa to the axilla between the clavicle and first rib. Various approaches to a first rib resection, including supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and trans-axillary, offer distinct advantages and limitations. This report presents a minimally invasive infraclavicular approach to a first rib resection that improves visualization and access to the posterior first rib while allowing for neurovascular protection.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patient outcomes of TOS patients who received the minimally invasive infraclavicular approach to a first rib resection from 2020 through 2023. We assessed both intraoperative and postoperative metrics including blood loss, complications, fluids, pain, weakness, and numbness.

Results: Thirteen patients underwent the minimally invasive first rib resection procedure performed exclusively by the presenting surgeon. Intraoperative results showed mean blood loss to be 59.1 cc, 1.3 L of crystalloid fluid, and 3 minor complications. Postoperative outcomes demonstrated that numbness improved in 85% (11 of 13) of patients. VAS neck and arm pain scores decreased by 15% and 30%, respectively. Additionally, upper extremi

### Diagnosis and management of thoracic outlet syndrome in athletes [^116GpVp3]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The physical demands of sports can place patients at an elevated risk of use-related pathologies, including thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Overhead athletes, in particular (e.g. baseball and football players, swimmers, divers, and weightlifters), often subject their subclavian vessels and brachial plexuses to repetitive trauma, resulting in venous effort thrombosis, arterial occlusions, brachial plexopathy, and more. This patient population is at higher risk for Paget-Schroetter syndrome, or effort thrombosis, although neurogenic TOS (nTOS) is still the predominant form of the disease among all groups.

First-rib resection is almost always recommended for vascular TOS in a young, active population, although a surgical benefit for patients with nTOS is less clear. Practitioners specializing in upper extremity disorders should take care to differentiate TOS from other repetitive use-related disorders, including shoulder orthopedic injuries and nerve entrapments at other areas of the neck and arm, as TOS is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

For nTOS, physical therapy is a cornerstone of diagnosis, along with the response to injections. Most patients first undergo some period of non-operative management with intense physical therapy and training before proceeding with rib resection. It is particularly essential for ensuring that athletes can return to their baseline levels of flexibility, strength, and stamina in the upper extremity. Botulinum toxin and lidocaine injections in the anterior scalene muscle might predict which patients will likely benefit from first-rib resection.

### Anomalous first thoracic rib as a cause of thoracic outlet syndrome with upper trunk symptoms: A case report [^1156fDr2]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is an uncommon cause of upper extremity neuropathy resulting from either neurogenic or vascular compromise in the thoracic outlet. Congenital anomalies as the cause of this disease process represent a minority of cases, and the literature regarding their surgical management is still evolving.

- **Case report**: A 42-year-old female without any relevant history presented to a clinic for evaluation of worsening neuropathic symptoms in the upper left extremity. The initial physical exam was unremarkable, and MRI identified an anomalous first rib, but no abnormality of the brachial plexus. The patient was managed conservatively for almost four years before symptoms became debilitating. Physical examination at that time found atrophy and weakness in the muscles supplied by the upper trunk of the brachial plexus, and CT demonstrated anomalies of the bone and brachial plexus not apparent on previous MRI. Neurolysis with local resection of the abnormal bone led to successful resolution of the patient's symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: Identification of a rare congenital anomaly allowed for a precise surgical treatment of the condition. The importance of careful selection of modality and review of imaging in diagnosis and operative planning is discussed.

### Measurement of outlet pressures favors rib resection for decompression of thoracic outlet syndrome [^111tA2is]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

When conservative therapy for thoracic outlet syndrome fails, scalenectomy with or without first-rib resection (FRR) is the treatment of choice. We measured pressure in the costoclavicular space before and after FRR at the time of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome release to evaluate whether FRR is required to completely decompress the costoclavicular space.

- **Methods**: Using a supraclavicular exposure for anterior-middle scalenectomy with FRR, costoclavicular space pressures were measured using a balloon catheter with the patient's arm in a neutral anatomic position. Secondarily, the arm was abducted and externally rotated. Pressures were recorded in both arm positions before scalenectomy, after scalenectomy, and after FRR. A paired Student's t-test was used to compare differences in group means for paired samples. Patient-reported outcomes were reported using the Derkash classification and the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (qDASH) questionnaire.

- **Results**: Fifteen patients (16 cases) surgically treated for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome were included in this retrospective study. There was no significant difference in pressure change between arm positions before scalenectomy (161.56 ± 71.65 mm Hg difference) or after scalenectomy (148.5 ± 80.24 mm Hg difference). There was a significant difference in pressure change between post-scalenectomy and post-FRR arm positions; the mean pressure change between arm positions after FRR was 50.56 ± 40.28 mm Hg. The mean postoperative qDASH score was 20 ± 23.2. All patients reported improvement in symptoms and functional status.

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^111s5aG3]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Surgical management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is based upon resection of the first rib. However, the optimal method to treat any residual venous scarring remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate a single quaternary centre's early and mid-term outcomes following endovascular reconstruction of the axillo-subclavian vein using dedicated venous stents in patients with vTOS.

- **Methodology**: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital who underwent upper limb deep venous stenting as an adjunct in the treatment of vTOS. All patients between 2012 and 2017 were included. Stent patency was assessed with duplex ultrasonography. All re-interventions and their indications were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 24 limbs in 21 patients (13 female, median age 44 years) were treated with dedicated venous stents between 2012 and 2017. All patients had resection of their first rib using a transaxillary approach. Nine patients initially presented with an acute DVT and underwent thrombolysis. In three of these patients, a venous stent was placed before rib resection following completion of lysis. For the remainder, the median time for stent placement following surgery was 64 days. Median follow-up from stent insertion was 50 months. Primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency at 24 months was 55%, 95%, and 100% respectively, with one patient lost during follow-up. There were no major complications. A total of 14 re-interventions were performed on these patients. Three patients reported residual symptoms following stent placement.

### First rib fix: The venography timing dilemma [^114LNa6p]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Management strategies for venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) continue to evolve and undergo refinement as we strive for optimal outcomes for our patients. The debate over the timing of venograms in conjunction with first rib resection (FRR) underscores the nuanced approach required for treating vTOS, as we continue to seek the best practices for assessing symptoms, therapy, and recurrence.

Over the years, the debate has persisted on whether catheter-directed thrombolysis or anticoagulation alone is required before decompression with FRR and scalenectomy. Equally contested is the use of venography and subclavian vein angioplasty. Although some experts advocate for venography at the time of thoracic outlet decompression, our institution recommends performing this procedure 2 to 4 weeks after surgery. The lack of high-quality evidence and randomized controlled trials leaves clinicians uncertain about the most effective and advantageous timing for venography and FRR. This uncertainty highlights the need for further research to establish evidence-based guidelines and enhance patient outcomes.

DiMuzio et al. describe success with intraoperative venograms immediately after FRR. Their study includes 51 patients with varying completion venography categorized from no stenosis to remaining complete occlusion. Patients with residual stenosis and occlusions were treated with balloon angioplasty. Symptomatic relief was seen in 86% of patients, but it did not correlate with intraoperative venogram classification. Patency rates were 97% at 1 year. Schneider et al. noted that 60% of their patients experienced significant improvements post-procedure.

### Thirty-day outcomes following surgical decompression of thoracic outlet syndrome [^115Sf6bx]. Hand (2019). Low credibility.

Surgical thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) management involves decompression of the neurovascular structures by releasing the anterior and/or middle scalene muscles, resection of the first and/or cervical ribs, or a combination. Various surgical approaches — transaxillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and transthoracic — have been used, with varying rates of complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate early postoperative outcomes following surgical decompression for TOS. We hypothesized that first and/or cervical rib resection would be associated with increased 30-day complications and health care utilization.

- **Methods**: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was reviewed for all TOS cases of brachial plexus surgical decompression in the region of the thoracic inlet from 2005 to 2013.

- **Results**: There were 225 patients (68% females; mean age: 36.4 years ± 12.1; 26% body mass index [BMI] ⩾ 30). There were 205 (91%) patients who underwent first and/or cervical rib resection (± scalenectomy), and 20 (9%) underwent rib-sparing scalenectomy. Compared with rib-sparing scalenectomy, rib resection was associated with longer operative time and hospital stays (P < .001). In the 30 days postoperatively, 8 patients developed complications (rib-scalenectomy, n = 7). Only patients with rib resection returned to the operating room (n = 10) or were readmitted (n = 9).

- **Conclusions**: Early postoperative complications are infrequent after TOS decompression. Rib resection is associated with longer surgical times and hospital stays.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^1158wor5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although the optimal approach for thoracic outlet decompression continues to be debated, our experience with managing VTOS supports the popularization of the infraclavicular (IC) approach. Our results highlight the efficacy and safety of IC rib resection, as demonstrated by our 96% overall patency rate and 93% symptom resolution, alongside overall low morbidity.

In the initial years of our experience, the transaxillary (TA) approach was the preferred method for managing patients with VTOS. Although these cases were successful with only minor complications, our group opted to shift toward IC rib resections due to their capability to provide optimal exposure of the subclavian vein in the costoclavicular space, where the pathology lies. This approach also provides access to the vein more medially and in a shallower surgical field, improving the ease and quality of venolysis and facilitating open repair of the vein when necessary. In addition, the IC approach may confer some benefit in terms of complications.

Although studies comparing IC rib resections with other commonly used approaches have demonstrated similar vein patency and symptom resolution across all modalities, the reported complication rates in patients undergoing rib resection via an IC approach tend to be lower. However, no direct comparison between all three commonly used approaches exists. This is particularly evident in the rate of brachial plexus/nerve injuries after rib resections. The supraclavicular (SC), TA, and posterior clavicular (PC) approaches have been associated with nerve injury rates around 3%, 5%, and 6%, respectively. Notably, nerve injury is a rarely observed complication with the IC approach.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^115xB2sG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is caused by compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular space, which may lead to vein thrombosis. Treatment includes thoracic outlet decompression with or without venolysis. However, given its relatively low prevalence, the existing literature is limited. Here, we report our single-institution experience in the treatment of vTOS.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of all patients who underwent rib resection for vTOS at our institution from 2007 to 2022. Demographics, procedural details, and perioperative and long-term outcomes were reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of 76 patients were identified. The mean age was 36 years. Swelling was the most common symptom (93%), followed by pain (6.6%). Ninety percent of patients had associated deep vein thrombosis, with 99% of these patients starting anticoagulation preoperatively. A total of 91% of patients underwent rib resection via the infraclavicular approach, 2% via the paraclavicular approach (due to a neurogenic component), and 7% via the transaxillary approach. Eighty-three percent of patients had endovascular intervention before or at the time of the rib resection, with catheter-directed thrombolysis (87%), angioplasty (71%), and rheolytic thrombectomy (57%) being the most common interventions. The median time from endovascular intervention to rib resection was 14 days, with 25% at the same admission. The median postoperative stay was 3 days (2–5 days). There was no perioperative mortality or nerve injury. Fourteen percent of patients had…

### Percutaneous thrombectomy in the management of early rethrombosis in venous thoracic outlet syndrome: two case reports [^112yJgid]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Low credibility.

Historically, effort thrombosis was treated with anticoagulation alone, and the results have been disappointing. Catheter-directed thrombolysis has shown nearly 100% success in fresh clots if treatment is initiated within a few days of onset of symptoms; otherwise, it has been successful in 62 to 84% of the cases.

Different pharmacomechanical thrombectomy devices have also been successfully used for the treatment of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. When there is a need to avoid or minimize exposure to rtPA, aspiration and mechanical thrombectomy systems can aspirate thrombus without the use of rtPA, resulting in decreased bleeding risk. Kosai described a case of Paget-Schroetter syndrome treated with the Aspirex thrombectomy device.

The feasibility and efficacy of aspiration thrombectomy prior to thoracic outlet surgery in Paget-Schroetter syndrome was recently demonstrated in Teter's study. One-third of patients, primarily treated with the Indigo continuous aspiration mechanical thrombectomy system, avoided additional catheter-directed thrombolysis exposure. Only three out of sixteen patients required additional overnight thrombolytic therapy.

There are limited data regarding endovascular treatment of early rethrombosis after surgical decompression in Paget-Schroetter syndrome, when thrombolysis is contraindicated. Shneider described a case of successful recanalization of a rethrombosed subclavian vein 3 days after operative intervention.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome: Pattern of clinical success after operative decompression [^111opMZZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of clinical results in patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (N-TOS) following operative decompression and longitudinal follow-up.

- **Methods**: From May 1994 to December 2002, 254 operative sides in 185 patients with N-TOS were treated by the same operative protocol. The primary procedure involved transaxillary first rib resection and the lower part of scalenectomy, with or without a subsequent upper part of scalenectomy using a supraclavicular approach for patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms. This retrospective cohort study included 38 men and 147 women, aged 19 to 80 years (mean age, 40 years). The evaluation considered primary success, defined as uninterrupted success with no additional procedure required, and secondary success, defined as success maintained by a secondary operation after primary failure. Success was defined as ≥ 50% symptomatic improvement as judged by the patient using a 10-point scale or a return to preoperative work status.

- **Results**: The follow-up period ranged from 2 to 76 months (mean, 25 months). Eighty sides underwent a secondary operation due to primary clinical failure. No technical failures or deaths occurred ≤ 30 days post-operation. The complication rate was 4% (13 out of 334 operations), including 7 pneumothoraxes, 3 subclavian vein injuries, 1 nerve injury, 1 internal mammary artery injury, and 1 suture granuloma. Of the 254 operative sides, primary success was achieved in 46% (118 out of 254) and secondary success in 64% (163 out of 254). Most primary failures (90%, 122 out of 136) and secondary failures (66%, 23 out of 35) occurred during follow-up.

### Vascular thoracic outlet syndrome [^113z4VAV]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Two distinct terms are used to describe vascular thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) depending on which structure is predominantly affected: venous TOS (due to subclavian vein compression) and arterial TOS (due to subclavian artery compression). Although the venous and arterial subtypes of TOS affect only 3% and less than 1% of all TOS patients respectively, the diagnostic and management approaches to venous and arterial TOS have undergone considerable evolution due to the recent emergence of minimally invasive endovascular techniques such as catheter-directed arterial and venous thrombolysis, and balloon angioplasty.

In this review, we discuss the anatomical factors, etiology, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation of vascular TOS patients. In addition, we use the most up-to-date observational evidence available at the time of writing to provide a contemporary approach to the diagnosis and management of venous TOS and arterial TOS patients.

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^1126gDhL]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) occurs due to an anatomical narrowing of the costoclavicular triangle through which the axillo-subclavian vein passes. One variant of this condition is Paget–Schroetter syndrome (PSS) or effort-induced thrombosis of the subclavian vein, which has an incidence of 1–2 per 100,000 people and was first described in 1875. The narrowing of the costo-clavicular space may not be sufficient to cause venous thrombosis, but repetitive movement into provocative positions, such as abduction and external rotation of the upper limb, causes repeated compression-decompression of the axillo-subclavian vein. The resulting chronic microtrauma to the vessel leads to hypertrophy of the venous intima and inflammation, resulting in stenosis and thrombosis of the axillo-subclavian vein.

At the time of writing, there are no well-conducted randomized controlled trials that specifically look at PSS interventions and their outcomes, with the majority of evidence coming from case series. Although it is a rare presentation, the condition typically affects young people and can be debilitating, especially if the dominant arm is affected. Clinical experience suggests that without recanalizing the axillary vein and removing the precipitant anatomical defect, patients are subject to variable rates of re-thrombosis, which can be significant. With the inclusion of modern endovascular technologies, removal of thrombus in the acute setting with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is possible and generally accepted.

### Posterior upper rib excision for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome — feasibility and early outcomes [^111w3vEA]. Operative Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

There are several surgical treatment options for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (n-TOS). However, the first rib has been shown to be the common denominator of all TOS forms, and the degree of its resection has been shown to correlate with long-term success.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate the feasibility of posterior upper rib excision (PURE) and report early outcomes.

- **Methods**: Nine patients presented with signs and symptoms of n-TOS. Preoperative evaluation involved physical and neurological examination, arm visual analog score (VAS), cervical X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine, and brachial plexus MRI. All patients were operated on at a single institution by a single surgeon. Postoperatively, clinical and radiological data were collected.

- **Results**: There were 2 men and 7 women in the study with 10 procedures performed. The age range was 18 to 45, with a mean age of 36.6 years. The mean preoperative arm visual analog scale score was 7.8. The patients underwent posterior upper rib excision (PURE) by a single surgeon, with one patient having bilateral surgery. The causes of TOS were fibrous bands, enlarged C7 transverse processes, narrow scalene triangle, and accessory ribs. All patients improved after surgery in terms of arm pain and quality of life. The postoperative mean visual analog scale score was 1.1 at 6 months. Additionally, neurological examination was normal at 6 months postoperatively, and all patients returned to their previous full-time jobs.

- **Conclusion**: Posterior upper rib excision is a feasible surgical option for n-TOS.

### Trends in the surgical management of thoracic outlet syndrome [^1116zAuz]. Hand (2024). High credibility.

The operative treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) varies in the United States and may differ due to the specialty training of the provider. This study aimed to identify the procedures primarily performed by specialty, the characteristics of patients presenting for different neurogenic TOS surgical interventions, and the safety of TOS surgery.

The methods involved identifying patients treated for neurogenic TOS between 2016 and 2018 from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). Information was collected on patient characteristics, surgeon details, intraoperative variables, and complication outcomes. Patient cohorts were stratified by the type of operative intervention and treating specialty.

Results indicated that transthoracic first rib resection was the most common procedure for TOS relief (46.1%), followed by division of the scalene muscles with rib resection (23.9%), and brachial plexus exploration with decompression (19.4%). Vascular surgeons performed 87% of TOS repairs. The thirty-day complication rate was 3.5%. The addition of scalenectomy to first rib resection was common, resulting in increased operative time but not increasing the early complication rate or readmission rate.

The conclusion shows that patient characteristics and dispositions are similar across various TOS operative approaches. All major surgical treatments for TOS exhibit low complication rates. Transthoracic first rib resection performed by vascular surgeons remains the most common surgical treatment for TOS patients in the United States.

### Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome and controversies in diagnosis and management [^112hN2om]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Compression of the neurovascular structures at the level of the scalene triangle and pectoralis minor space is rare, but increasing awareness and understanding are allowing for the treatment of more individuals than in the past. We outlined the recognition, preoperative evaluation, and treatment of patients with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. Recent work has illustrated the role of imaging and centrality of the physical examination on the diagnosis. However, a fuller understanding of the spatial biomechanics of the shoulder, scalene triangle, and pectoralis minor musculotendinous complex has shown that, although physical therapy is a mainstay of treatment, a poor response to physical therapy with a sound diagnosis should not preclude decompression.

- **Modes of failure**: Surgical decompression stresses the importance of full resection of the anterior scalene muscle and all posterior rib impinging elements to minimize the risk of recurrence of symptoms.

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is a rare but critical cause of disability of the upper extremity. Modern understanding of the pathophysiology and evaluation has led to a sounder diagnosis. Although physical therapy is a mainstay, surgical decompression remains the gold standard to preserve and recover the function of the upper extremity. Understanding these principles will be central to further developments in the treatment of this patient population.

### Surgical treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome: Effect and results of surgery [^114aCMPH]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Due to the difficulty in diagnosis and the variety of treatment options, the debate on thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) has persisted. Our aim is to report on our surgical experience.

- **Methods**: Forty-seven patients with thoracic outlet syndrome underwent surgery between 1985 and 2000. The mean age was 37.9 years (range, 17 to 58 years) with a female/male ratio of 41/6. The most frequent symptom was paresthesia (72.3%). Seventeen patients (36%) exhibited bilateral symptoms. Of the total, 89.3% (42 cases) were identified with neurologic thoracic outlet syndrome, while 10.7% (five cases) were vascular. Lower plexus (C8-T1/ulnar nerve) compression was present in 36 patients, and upper plexus (C5-C7/median nerve) compression affected 6 patients. Additional diagnostic procedures included Doppler ultrasonography in 11 patients, angiography in 8, and lymph node scintigraphy in 1 patient. Primary surgical indications were the persistence of symptoms after conservative therapy and reduced ulnar nerve conduction velocity (< 60 m/s).

- **Results**: A total of 55 operations were conducted on the 47 patients. Resections of the first rib (59.6%) and cervical ribs (21.3%) were the most common surgeries performed. The mean ulnar nerve conduction velocity improved from a preoperative 54.8 m/s (range, 43 to 68 m/s) to a postoperative 69.4 m/s (range, 47 to 70 m/s) (p < 0.05). The morbidity rate was 17% (8 of 47), with no significant difference observed between transaxillary and supraclavicular incisions. No brachial plexus injuries occurred, and the most frequent cause of morbidity was incisional pain. Two reoperations were necessary due to recurrences. Follow-up averaged 4.6 years, with favorable outcomes observed in 75% of lower plexus cases and 50% of upper plexus cases.

### Infraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression compared to supraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression for the management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^1113VS9n]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) requires surgical decompression, often combined with catheter-directed thrombolysis and venoplasty. Surgical options include transaxillary, supraclavicular, or infraclavicular approaches to first rib resection. The optimal method, however, has yet to be defined. This study aims to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent infraclavicular versus supraclavicular surgical decompression for VTOS.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients who underwent surgical management for VTOS from December 2010 to November 2017 was performed. During the study period, supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches were chosen according to surgeon preference. Patient demographics, pre- and post-decompression interventions, and perioperative outcomes for each group of patients were analyzed.

- **Results**: Thirty patients underwent surgical management for VTOS, with 15 (50%) undergoing infraclavicular decompression and 15 (50%) supraclavicular decompression. The mean age of patients was 32.1 ± 13.6 years, and 80% were male. Twenty-six patients (86.7%) presented with thrombotic VTOS. Acute axillosubclavian vein thrombosis was present in 20 (76.9%) of these patients, with 10 patients in each group. Subacute or chronic thrombosis was encountered in the remaining 6 (23%) patients, comprising 2 patients in the infraclavicular group and 4 in the supraclavicular group. Preoperative thrombolysis was utilized in 7 (46.7%) and 6 (40%) patients in the infraclavicular and supraclavicular groups, respectively [P = 1.00].

### Evolving strategies for the management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome [^1173f172]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Traditional management of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (VTOS) has involved catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) followed by transaxillary or paraclavicular (PC) first rib resection. More recently, an infraclavicular (IC) approach for first rib resection, along with five other strategies, has been adopted to treat these patients. We report our evolving experience with the treatment of acute VTOS.

- **Methods**: We reviewed our prospectively maintained database to identify patients treated for VTOS. Our strategy includes CDT with pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, IC first rib resection during the same hospitalization, and subclavian vein angioplasty immediately after rib resection. Postoperatively, a sequential compression device was applied to the affected arm, and low-dose heparin was administered through the ipsilateral venous sheath. Antiplatelet therapy was prescribed for 6 weeks and anticoagulation for 6 months. Our strategy evolved from a PC to an IC approach, considering that the added morbidity of the supraclavicular approach, to allow excision of the posterior portion of the rib, may provide no additional benefit for VTOS compared with arterial or neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome.

- **Results**: There were 51 patients who underwent first rib resection for VTOS, with 11 (22%) through a PC approach and 40 (78%) through an IC approach. The average age was 36 years (range, 16–63 years), and the majority were female (36 [71%]). The right subclavian vein was involved in the majority of cases (36 [71%]). All patients underwent preoperative CDT, with 40 (78%) treated at our hospital and 11 (22%) elsewhere. Fifty patients (98%) underwent subclavian vein angioplasty immediately after rib resection.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome: A review [^111UsBF7]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a rare condition, with an occurrence rate of 1–3 per 100,000, caused by neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet and presents with arm pain and swelling, arm fatigue, paresthesias, weakness, and discoloration of the hand. TOS can be classified as neurogenic, arterial, or venous based on the compressed structures.

Patients may develop TOS secondary to congenital abnormalities such as cervical ribs or fibrous bands originating from a cervical rib, leading to an objectively verifiable form of TOS. However, the diagnosis of TOS is often made in the presence of symptoms with physical examination findings, which is referred to as disputed TOS. TOS is not a diagnosis of exclusion; there should be evidence of a physical anomaly that can be corrected. In patients with an identifiable narrowing of the thoracic outlet and/or symptoms with a high probability of thoracic outlet neurovascular compression, the diagnosis of TOS can be established through history, physical examination maneuvers, and imaging.

Neck trauma or repeated work stress can lead to scalene muscle scarring or dislodging of a congenital cervical rib, which can compress the brachial plexus. Nonsurgical treatment options include anti-inflammatory medication, weight loss, physical therapy/strengthening exercises, and botulinum toxin injections. The most common surgical treatments include brachial plexus decompression, neurolysis, and scalenotomy with or without first rib resection.

Patients undergoing surgical treatment for TOS should be seen postoperatively to begin passive/assisted mobilization of the shoulder. By 8 weeks postoperatively, further management should be considered to aid recovery.

### Reporting standards of the Society for Vascular Surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome: Executive summary [^112H9CNS]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a group of disorders characterized by compression at the thoracic outlet, affecting the brachial plexus, the subclavian vein, and the subclavian artery. This results in neurogenic (NTOS), venous (VTOS), and arterial (ATOS) thoracic outlet syndromes, respectively. Although these are distinct entities, they may coexist and overlap. The treatment of NTOS has been hindered by inconsistent definitions, diagnostic challenges, uncertainties regarding treatment options, and a lack of consistent outcome measures.

The Committee has defined NTOS as present when at least three of the following criteria are met:

- **Signs and symptoms of pathology at the thoracic outlet**: Pain and/or tenderness present.
- **Signs and symptoms of nerve compression**: Distal neurologic changes, often exacerbated with arms overhead or dangling.
- **Absence of other pathology**: No other conditions potentially explaining the symptoms.
- **Positive response to a properly conducted scalene muscle test injection**.

Reporting standards for workup, treatment, and assessment of results are provided for NTOS, VTOS, and ATOS. The primary aim is to establish consistency in diagnosis, treatment descriptions, and results assessment, thereby facilitating the presentation of more valuable data.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome part I: Systematic review of the literature and consensus on anatomy, diagnosis, and classification of thoracic outlet syndrome by the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies' Section of Peripheral Nerve Surgery [^113nJcLd]. Neurosurgery (2022). High credibility.

Although numerous articles have been published not only on the classification of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) but also on diagnostic standards, timing, and type of surgical intervention, there still remains some controversy because of the lack of level 1 evidence. So far, attempts to generate uniform reporting standards have not yielded conclusive results.

The objective of this study is to systematically review the body of evidence and reach a consensus among neurosurgeons experienced in TOS regarding anatomy, diagnosis, and classification.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search on PubMed/MEDLINE was performed on February 13, 2021, yielding 2853 results. Abstracts were screened and classified. Recommendations were developed in a meeting held online on February 10, 2021, and refined according to the Delphi consensus method.

- **Results**: Six randomized controlled trials (on surgical, conservative, and injection therapies), four "guideline" articles (on imaging and reporting standards), five observational studies (on diagnostics, hierarchic designs of physiotherapy vs. surgery, and quality of life outcomes), and six meta-analyses were identified. The European Association of Neurosurgical Societies' section of peripheral nerve surgery established 18 statements regarding anatomy, diagnosis, and classification of TOS, with agreement levels of 98.4% (± 3.0).

- **Conclusion**: Due to the lack of level 1 evidence, consensus statements on anatomy, diagnosis, and classification of TOS from experts of the section of peripheral nerve surgery of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies were developed.

### Diagnosis of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome based on the clinical status [^113ieiMi]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

At our institute, we devised a clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Our approach assisted in accurate diagnosis and detection of patients likely to benefit from surgical treatment. The purposes of this study were to propose our diagnostic approach to neurogenic TOS and to describe the outcomes of surgical and conservative treatment.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 91) who were suspected to have neurogenic TOS and underwent a routine clinical protocol from January 2012 to January 2018 were reviewed. Through the clinical protocol, diagnoses of "true neurologic TOS", "symptomatic TOS", and "not likely TOS" were made. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score were used to assess the treatment outcomes. Satisfaction with surgery was assessed according to the Derkash classification as excellent, good, fair, or poor.

- **Results**: Among 91 patients with presumed neurogenic TOS, 25 patients were classified as "true neurologic TOS", 61 patients as "symptomatic TOS", and five patients as "not likely TOS". Nineteen patients underwent supraclavicular decompression of the brachial plexus, with a mean age at the time of surgery of 36.4 years. The VAS average pain score improved from 3.6 to 0.8, and the DASH score improved from 38.4 to 17.1. According to the Derkash classification, ten patients (53%) rated their recovery as excellent, four (21%) as good, and five (26%) as fair. Sixty-seven patients underwent conservative treatment. At the last follow-up visit, their VAS and DASH scores were assessed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria imaging in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome [^113DQzSH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical entity characterized by compression of the neurovascular bundle and may be associated with additional findings such as venous thrombosis, arterial stenosis, or neurologic symptoms. The goal of imaging is to localize the site of compression, the compressing structure, and the compressed organ or vessel while excluding common mimics.

A literature review is provided of indications for diagnostic imaging, with discussion of potential limitations and benefits of the respective modalities. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

In this document, we provided guidelines for the use of various imaging modalities for the assessment of thoracic outlet syndrome.

### Dedicated venous stent placement across the thoracic outlet: Will novel venous stents transform axillosubclavian vein thrombosis treatment paradigm [^112azkQ5]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Low credibility.

Endovascular stenting is widely accepted as the standard treatment for central venous obstruction syndromes such as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome due to its demonstrated clinical efficacy and improved patient outcomes. However, its application in axillosubclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT) has been limited due to concerns about stent compression within the thoracic outlet. This report aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the off-label use of dedicated venous stents — engineered with enhanced mechanical features — as an alternative endovascular approach for the treatment of ASVT.

- **Methods**: Thirty-eight patients (43 affected limbs) with symptomatic ASVT and no prior treatment or surgical decompression underwent endovascular placement of dedicated venous stents across the thoracic outlet with Abre Venous Stents (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland), Venovo Venous Stents (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), or Vici Venous Stents (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). Stents were extended peripherally to the subclavian or axillary veins and centrally to the brachiocephalic vein or SVC. Technical success was defined as successful stent deployment across the costoclavicular space, and clinical success as symptomatic improvement.

- **Results**: Stent placement was technically successful in all 43 limbs (100%), with clinical improvement observed in 97.4% of patients. The one patient without clinical improvement experienced early thrombosis of the stent, requiring mechanical thrombectomy and additional stenting. Follow-up CT venography at a mean of 301.3 days demonstrated high primary patency rates.

### Reoperative brachial plexus neurolysis after previous anatomically complete supraclavicular decompression for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: A 10-year single-center case series [^115M3qZc]. Operative Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

Each patient met clinical diagnostic criteria for NTOS as developed by the Consortium for Outcomes Research and Education on Thoracic Outlet Syndrome and the SVS reporting standards. Presenting symptoms typically consisted of pain, numbness, and paresthesia affecting the neck and upper extremity, with characteristic physical examination findings of localizing tenderness and reproduction of upper extremity symptoms on palpation over the supraclavicular space and during provocative maneuvers. The level of functional disability was assessed using the 11-item version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) survey instrument, validated for various upper extremity disorders, including NTOS. All patients underwent initial conservative treatment with NTOS-specific physical therapy and pain management approaches.

Reoperative surgical treatment was offered to patients with a sound clinical diagnosis of reNTOS, significant functional disability, and insufficient symptom improvement with physical therapy and pain management. Throughout the study period, this consisted of supraclavicular re-exploration by a single senior surgeon, with complete external neurolysis of all 5 nerve roots and 3 trunks of the brachial plexus. In many patients, adjunctive subcoracoid re-exploration with brachial plexus neurolysis was also performed through a separate deltopectoral groove incision, including pectoralis minor tenotomy if not performed previously.

### Epidemiology of thoracic outlet syndrome [^116tWTjQ]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) describes a complex disease process with three anatomic variations, each with its own individual characteristics. Understanding the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of TOS is challenging for many providers. For this reason, the establishment of comprehensive care models and expert leadership by dedicated vascular surgeons with TOS experience has been invaluable.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^116YMEAB]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

This study explores the management strategies and outcomes associated with venous thoracic outlet decompression. The transition to the infraclavicular approach is emphasized as a significant advancement in surgical technique. The infraclavicular approach offers enhanced visualization and accessibility compared to traditional methods, potentially improving patient outcomes.

- **Patient selection**: Careful patient selection is crucial for optimal results. Factors such as age, severity of symptoms, and previous interventions should be considered.
- **Surgical technique**: The infraclavicular approach is described in detail, highlighting its advantages in reducing surgery time and minimizing complications.
- **Postoperative care**: Effective postoperative care, including monitoring for complications and facilitating rehabilitation, is essential for recovery.
- **Outcomes**: Clinical outcomes are favorable, with a high rate of symptomatic relief and minimal incidence of postoperative complications.

In conclusion, the transition to an infraclavicular approach in venous thoracic outlet decompression appears to offer significant benefits in terms of patient outcomes and procedural efficiency. Further studies are recommended to validate these findings in broader patient populations.

### Long-term outcomes of nonoperative and surgical management of Paget-Schroetter syndrome [^111aZ2kR]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS) is an effort-induced subclavian vein thrombosis and can be classified as a separate entity within venous thoracic outlet syndromes (vTOS). PSS can be treated nonoperatively, surgically, or by a combination of treatments. Nonoperative treatment options include anticoagulation (AC), catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), or other comparable catheter-based therapies. Surgical therapy aims to prevent recurrence of thrombosis and consists of decompression of the subclavian vein by resection of the first rib after patency is restored with AC or CDT.

Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal management of PSS. Published reports are predominantly retrospective in design and are limited by short follow-up and/or not well-documented functional outcomes. Therefore, we investigated the long-term functional outcomes of both nonoperative and surgically treated patients with PSS.

### Outcomes of surgical paraclavicular thoracic outlet decompression [^115NdNPc]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a constellation of signs and symptoms caused by compression of the neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet. These structures include the brachial plexus, the subclavian vein, and the subclavian artery, resulting in neurogenic (NTOS), venous (VTOS), and arterial (ATOS) types of TOS, respectively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of paraclavicular surgical decompression for TOS.

- **Methods**: A prospective analysis of patients who underwent surgical decompression for TOS at a newly established center was performed. Diagnosis of TOS was based on clinical history, a physical examination, and additional diagnostic studies. The indication for surgery in patients diagnosed with NTOS was the presence of persistent symptoms following a trial of physical therapy. Primary outcomes were assessed according to Derkash's classification as excellent, good, fair, and poor. Secondary outcomes included mortality, complications, and duration of hospital stay.

- **Results**: Between August 2004 and June 2011, 40 paraclavicular decompression procedures were performed on 36 patients (16 men) with TOS. The mean age was 36.5 years (range: 15–68). Bilateral decompression was performed on 4 patients. The types were NTOS (n = 19; 48%), VTOS (n = 16; 40%), and ATOS (n = 5; 12%). In addition to pain, the most common presenting symptom was numbness in NTOS, swelling in VTOS, and coolness in ATOS. A history of trauma was present in 22.2%. Two patients suffered from recurrent symptoms after previous transaxillary first rib resection for VTOS.

### Thoracic outlet syndrome [^117QPckC]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a well-described disorder caused by thoracic outlet compression of the brachial plexus and/or the subclavian vessels. Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is the most common manifestation, presenting with pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and vasomotor changes of the upper extremity. Vascular complications of thoracic outlet syndrome are uncommon and include thromboembolic phenomena and swelling. The clinical presentation is highly variable, and no reproducible study exists to confirm the diagnosis; instead, the diagnosis is based on a physician's judgment following a meticulous history and physical examination. Both nonsurgical and surgical treatment methods are available for thoracic outlet syndrome. Whereas nonsurgical management appears to be effective in some persons, surgical treatment has been shown to provide predictable long-term cure rates for carefully selected patients. In addition, physicians who do not regularly treat patients with thoracic outlet syndrome may not have an accurate view of this disorder, its treatment, or the possible success rate of treatment.

### Evaluation and treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome during the global pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 [^113ZxUug]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The global SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a reduction in non-emergency treatment for various disorders. This report summarizes conclusions from an international multidisciplinary consensus group assembled to address the evaluation and treatment of patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), a group of conditions characterized by extrinsic compression of the neurovascular structures serving the upper extremity. The following recommendations were developed concerning the three defined types of TOS (neurogenic, venous, and arterial) and the three phases of pandemic response (preparatory, urgent with limited resources, and emergency with complete diversion of resources).

- **Neurogenic TOS**: In-person evaluation and treatment (interventional or surgical) are generally postponed during all pandemic phases. Instead, telephone/telemedicine visits and at-home physical therapy exercises are recommended when feasible.
- **Venous TOS**: Presenting with acute upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome), this is managed primarily with anticoagulation. Percutaneous interventions for venous TOS (thrombolysis) may be considered in early phases (I and II), with surgical treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve. Catheter-based interventions may also be considered for selected patients with central subclavian vein obstruction and threatened hemodialysis access in all pandemic phases, with definitive surgical treatment postponed.
- **Arterial TOS**: Evaluation and surgical treatment should be reserved for limb-threatening situations, such as acute upper extremity ischemia.

### Surgical treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome in pediatrics [^112phEGh]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition that occurs when the cervical neurovascular bundle becomes compressed at one of the three narrow areas of the thoraco-cervico-axillary region. Conservative management is the first line of treatment, and patients who do not respond to it should be treated surgically. This review aims to present our experience with the surgical management of TOS in pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of all patients with TOS operated on at our hospital between 2001 and 2020. We collected all demographic data, clinical features, imaging data, type of operation performed, intraoperative findings, complications, and recurrence.

- **Results**: We operated on 9 patients within the study period. The median age at surgery was 14 (7 to 17) years. A transaxillary approach was used in 7 patients and a supraclavicular approach in 2. There was only one minor intraoperative complication (violation of the pleural space), and there were no postoperative complications. The median length of stay was 3 (2 to 4) days. All patients were extubated in the operating room. Two patients developed symptoms on the contralateral side; one of these underwent a successful contralateral transaxillary Roos operation. The follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 20 years. All patients are asymptomatic.

- **Conclusion**: We believe that the Roos operation is a safe and effective treatment with excellent long-term outcomes for children with TOS who fail conservative management.

### Outcome following surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome [^117Bo9hs]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) relies heavily on subjective rather than objective assessment criteria. Subsequently, published results after surgical decompression vary considerably. This study aimed to use a symptom-based, patient-directed questionnaire to assess the outcome after decompression for TOS.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients who underwent decompression procedures were identified from a prospectively maintained vascular database. Patient records were analyzed for details regarding initial presentation, investigation, type of procedure used for decompression, and management. Outcome questionnaires were sent to all identified patients to provide a patient-based outcome measure.

- **Results**: Eighty-four percent of patients responded. In 90% of these patients, there was an improvement in symptoms post-surgery, with a median follow-up of 43 months. The results were not influenced by the procedure or approach used.

- **Conclusion**: Surgery remains an effective tool in the management of TOS. A simple patient-directed questionnaire, as used in this study, could assist in the standardization of outcome assessment.

### Trans-axillary thoracic outlet decompression [^115sWnAD]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) comprises a group of conditions believed to arise from the compression of neurovascular structures leading to the upper extremity. Diagnosing TOS is challenging, and surgical treatment presents its own difficulties. Numerous surgical techniques have been reported for the treatment of TOS in the literature, with many showing reasonable to good outcomes. This variety complicates decisions for surgeons on which techniques to utilize. Our aim was to describe the rationale, techniques, and outcomes associated with the surgical treatment of TOS.

Most patients at our center are primarily treated using a trans-axillary approach. We will elaborate on the technical details of performing trans-axillary thoracic outlet decompression, emphasizing the steps during surgery, which are illustrated with videos. We focused on the concept of performing a trans-axillary thoracic outlet decompression in primary cases. Institutional data on the outcomes of this surgical approach are also briefly described.

### Redo surgery for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome is useful [^112CE98B]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Surgery for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) has shown good outcomes in numerous case series. However, 5% to 30% of patients experience persistent or recurrent symptoms, often due to incomplete first rib resection, reattachment of residual scalene muscle, fibrous scarring around the brachial plexus, or an incorrect NTOS diagnosis. In cases with a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or persistent NTOS, not responding to conservative measures, a secondary procedure may be considered. This study reports the results of redo thoracic outlet decompression surgery through the supraclavicular approach (SC-REDO-TOD) for persistent or recurrent NTOS.

A retrospective review of a prospective database was performed, including every patient referred from September 2016 to January 2020. In SC-REDO-TOD, the procedure involves complete (cartilage-cartilage) resection of the first rib, addressing any bony and fibrous anomalies, complete anterior and middle scalenectomy, and comprehensive neurolysis of the brachial plexus, ensuring full anatomical decompression. Clinical outcomes were assessed using questionnaires, including the Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Cervico-Brachial Symptoms Questionnaire (CBSQ), and the Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) Disability scale.

In total, 45 patients underwent SC-REDO-TOD. The median duration of hospital admission post-surgery was 1.41 days (interquartile range, 1.00 day). Of these, 30 patients (66.66%) had recurrent NTOS, and 15 patients (33.33%) had persistent NTOS. Postoperative complications were observed.

### Management and outcomes of venous thoracic outlet decompression: A transition to the infraclavicular approach [^1156gNvZ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

With the continued implementation and increased comfort with endovascular interventions, we have also experienced an evolution in our approach to addressing residual subclavian stenosis after lysis. Among the patients in our cohort, a total of 10 underwent vein patching or reconstruction; however, since 2014, only one patient underwent vein patching. This reflects a shift from aggressively addressing luminal narrowing during decompression toward opting to evaluate vessel stenosis either immediately after rib resection or within 2 to 4 weeks during routine venography before intervening. At that time, any residual stenosis can be adequately addressed through angioplasty, yielding excellent results.

This procedure was performed in 22% of our overall patient population, and we have seen no indication of differing patency rates in this group compared with our earlier experiences in patients undergoing vein patch or reconstruction. This aligns with results by other groups demonstrating the usefulness of angioplasty in this setting. Similarly, we have opted to minimize stent placement. Although we were more likely to place stents (total of five patients) for significant residual stenosis in our earlier experience, we have since opted to preferentially perform angioplasty and let the vein settle on anticoagulation before committing to stents.

As a result, since 2013, no stents have been placed in the management of acute vTOS. This is likely the preferred approach, as stent fractures and re-thrombosis have been reported after subclavian vein stenting. Furthermore, the use of routine veno…

### Occurrence, management, and outcome of thoracic outlet syndrome in a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I conference [^113UJGEM]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS; neurovascular compression at the thoracic outlet) is a disabling condition affecting the upper extremities. Athletes are at risk of developing TOS, and prior reports of TOS in athletes have been largely restricted to single-center experiences. No data at the level of a National Athletic Conference have been reported previously, so our objective was to describe the epidemiology of TOS in a National Collegiate Athletic Association division I conference.

Athletes with TOS were identified in the prospectively maintained Pacific 12 Health Analytics Program Database from 2016 to 2022. Data included demographics, sports, treatments, and outcomes. Subcategories of TOS, specifically neurogenic TOS (NTOS) and venous TOS (VTOS), were identified.

In the 7-year period studied, 15,609 athletes (6874 men and 8735 women) playing 21 sports were registered. The average age was 19.3 years (men, 18.9; women, 19.5). TOS was identified in 76 athletes (0.48%): 7 with VTOS (9.2%) and 69 with NTOS (90.8%). These athletes included 30 (39.5%) men and 46 (60.5%) women. TOS was found in 2.6% of tennis players, 1.3% of softball players, and 1.3% of rowers. Most TOS patients (96.0%) were managed without surgery, and 84.9% experienced a resolution of symptoms with physical therapy, testing, and medication. Of the 14.5% of athletes who required surgery, 72.7% experienced resolution of their symptoms postoperatively.

Overall symptom resolution was noted in 81.6% of cases (79.7% NTOS and 100% VTOS; p = 0.19). An unrestricted return to competition was noted in 80.6% of patients managed without surgical intervention.

### Percutaneous thrombectomy in the management of early rethrombosis in venous thoracic outlet syndrome: two case reports [^114NuNcE]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Low credibility.

Venous thoracic outlet syndrome resulting in upper limb deep venous thrombosis is known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome or effort thrombosis. A general treatment algorithm includes catheter-directed thrombolysis followed by surgical thoracic outlet decompression. There are limited data regarding endovascular treatment of rethrombosis presenting early after the surgery.

- **Case presentation**: Two cases of early rethrombosis successfully treated with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy by two different techniques are described. In both cases, rethrombosis was diagnosed soon after thrombolysis and first rib resection with scalenectomy. After 12 months, both patients remain symptom-free, with patent subclavian veins confirmed by duplex ultrasonography.

- **Conclusion**: Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices may offer a safe treatment option for patients with rethrombosis after thoracic outlet surgery, even when thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated.

### Outcomes of venous bypass combined with thoracic outlet decompression for treatment of upper extremity central venous occlusion [^117UQ4Yo]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Upper extremity central venous stenosis results from a variety of environmental and anatomic conditions, including venous thoracic outlet syndrome, the presence of device leads or catheters, and the turbulence created by the presence of arteriovenous fistulas or grafts. In cases of total occlusion, especially at the bony costoclavicular junction, options for endovascular treatment and open venous reconstruction are limited, and bypass grafting may be needed. We describe our experience with venous bypass combined with thoracic outlet decompression in a cohort of symptomatic patients with subclavian vein occlusion.

- **Methods**: A prospectively collected database was queried for patients treated for central venous obstructive disease with venous bypass in the setting of both symptomatic venous thoracic outlet syndrome and ipsilateral arteriovenous access from July 2012 to December 2017. All but one patient presented with arm swelling and had either failed to respond to or were unsuitable for endovenous therapy. One patient desired elective removal of a venous stent because of pain and anxiety. Operative procedures were performed at the discretion of the operating surgeon.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients (eight men; average age, 42 years) underwent open thoracic outlet decompression with first rib resection (n = 11) or claviculectomy (n = 4). Indication for treatment was dialysis-associated venous outlet obstruction in five, effort thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) in seven, and presence of a venous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead in one.

### Surgery versus continued conservative treatment for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: The first randomised clinical trial (STOPNTOS trial) [^117TxuKY]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is one of the most controversial clinical entities in medicine. Several major case series have shown promising results of surgery; however, solid scientific evidence is lacking. The aim of this trial was to objectify the effect of thoracic outlet decompression (TOD).

- **Methods**: A single-center, high-volume, tertiary TOS center conducted a non-blinded randomised controlled trial with a parallel group design. Patients with a diagnosis of NTOS refractory to conservative therapy were randomised to one of two intervention arms, receiving either a transaxillary thoracic outlet decompression (TA-TOD) or continued conservative treatment. After three months, the conservatively treated group was also offered a TA-TOD. The primary outcome was the change in Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire score. Secondary outcomes were changes in the Cervical Brachial Symptoms Questionnaire (CBSQ), TOS disability scale, and quality of life scores. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, and at three, six, and 12 months after inclusion.

- **Results**: Fifty patients were enrolled in this trial: 25 in the TA-TOD group and 25 in the continued conservative treatment group. Follow-up was completed in 24 and 22 patients, respectively. At three months, there was a statistically significant difference in DASH scores (TA-TOD: mean 45.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 38.08–52.21; conservative treatment: mean 64.92, 95% CI 57.54–72.30; p < .001). All patients in the conservative treatment group applied for surgery three months after randomisation.

### Robotic-assisted first rib resection: Our experience and review of the literature [^113AGWTH]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) comprises a constellation of signs and symptoms resulting from the neurologic and vascular compression of the brachial plexus and subclavian vasculature, respectively. Surgical decompression of the neurovascular structures is often indicated to alleviate TOS. We report here our robotic surgical approach and experience for the resection of the first rib.

Between July 2014 and January 2017, 17 patients underwent robotic-assisted first rib resection at our institution. This included nine women and eight men, with a mean age of 45 ± 11 years. Among them, eight patients were treated for neurogenic TOS and nine for venous TOS. There were no complications or conversions to open surgery. The mean operative time was 113.2 ± 55.3 minutes, and the length of stay was a mean of 1.8 ± 1.9 days. The length of rib resected measured 5.8 ± 0.5 cm.

- **Anticoagulation treatment**: For the venous TOS cohort, Xarelto was administered for a mean duration of 5.1 ± 1.8 months.

Short-term follow-up (mean of 10.3 ± 4.9 days) showed symptom resolution in all patients, with patent vasculature on venogram for the entire venous TOS cohort. Further follow-up at two months and six months revealed that all patients remained symptom-free. Based on our institution's experience with the robotic-assisted approach to first rib resection, we feel that it is a feasible method that could be added to the armamentarium of the thoracic surgeon.

### Remaining or residual first ribs are the cause of recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome [^112Mp1ep]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (NTOS) is not always successful. Treatment plans can be challenging in patients presenting with recurrent symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes in this patient subset who underwent operative intervention to remove a remaining or residual first rib due to thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)-related symptoms.

- **Methods**: Data on 15 patients who presented with previous scalenectomy, brachial plexus lysis, or first rib resection and scalenectomy (FRRS) with a residual rib present on chest radiograph from 2004 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database, with approval from the Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins Hospital. Patients were classified as having a remaining first rib if they presented with recurrent NTOS symptoms, had previously undergone scalenectomy and/or brachial plexus lysis alone to decompress the thoracic outlet, and exhibited an intact first rib on chest X-ray. Patients were classified as having a remnant rib if they presented with recurrent symptoms of NTOS, had previously undergone a first rib resection at another institution, and exhibited an anterior or posterior first rib on chest X-ray. Demographic and clinical characteristics along with postoperative outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: Different precipitating events reaggravated symptoms in 12 patients. Events included car accidents (n = 4), work-related repetitive movements (n = 5), lifting heavy objects (n = 2), and repetitive injury (n = 1).

### Early outcomes using dedicated venous stents in the upper limb of patients with venous thoracic outlet syndrome: A single centre experience [^116Q6qdR]. CVIR Endovascular (2019). Low credibility.

Our study has demonstrated relief of symptoms in 88% of patients during follow-up. In 1993, Machleder published an algorithm for treating vTOS with early CDT and rib resection. He demonstrated that 93% of patients with patent axillo-subclavian veins after first rib resection were symptom-free at a mean follow-up of 3.1 years and that only 64% were symptom-free if the vein had occluded [Machleder]. Our results are comparable to Machleder's and highlight the importance of achieving venous patency with reconstruction and strict follow-up.

There are several limitations of this study, including the retrospective data collection, small sample size, and limited follow-up time. The small numbers found in this study are not uncommon in other literature regarding vTOS. However, this lack of power makes it difficult to reach firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of adjunctive venous thoracic outlet stenting. Multicenter, prospective trials over a longer period are therefore needed to fully evaluate the impact of this proposed management strategy. Although there is no evidence available for the optimal management of vTOS, our study demonstrates that our treatment algorithm involving adjunctive venous stenting should be considered in selected patients.

### Variability in electrodiagnostic findings associated with neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome [^114bxoW7]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

Twelve patients underwent surgical treatment. One patient (Patient 1) was only recently referred for surgical intervention at the time of writing this article. Patient 4 had very severe atrophy and weakness of the hand muscles, and it was decided not to perform surgery as this was unlikely to result in improvement.

The median time of post-surgery follow-up was 12 months. All surgically treated patients experienced an improvement in their symptoms, mostly relief of pain and sensory symptoms.

### Reoperative brachial plexus neurolysis after previous anatomically complete supraclavicular decompression for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: A 10-year single-center case series [^112yLUpX]. Operative Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

The main strengths of this study are that all patients underwent a standardized treatment strategy with favorable and sustained outcomes. Additionally, all patients were followed with quantitative outcome measures to allow more accurate comparisons between groups and over time. One limitation of this study is the uncertainty regarding whether, during long-term follow-up after reoperation, some patients might have experienced re-symptoms or required secondary operations elsewhere after our last recorded office visit. However, we feel that this is unlikely, given that most of the patients in this series continued long-term follow-up with our center.

Another limitation is the lack of detailed data on the time course and trajectory of re-symptoms after primary operations, which indicates a valuable direction for future research. Given that the study focused on patients who had undergone reoperations for re-NTOS, we were unable to comprehensively analyze factors that might have contributed to recurrence after primary operations. We also could not assess nonoperative methods of treatment for re-symptoms that might have been successful in avoiding the need for surgery. These important questions would need to be addressed more specifically in a prospectively designed study.

Finally, it remains important to reiterate that reoperations for NTOS are technically challenging and likely to carry greater risks for nerve and/or vascular injury than primary operations.

### Reoperative brachial plexus neurolysis after previous anatomically complete supraclavicular decompression for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome: A 10-year single-center case series [^116jhPKh]. Operative Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion - Key results in the context of relevant literature**: Although reported outcomes are excellent for contemporary surgical treatment of NTOS, up to 30% of patients can be expected to have persistent symptoms or develop later recurrence. In a previously published study, we reported excellent outcomes for reoperations that were performed for reNTOS after procedures carried out at other institutions. These operative findings frequently included residual scalene muscle and first rib remnants. In this study, we assessed the separate and more homogeneous population of patients with reNTOS who had previously undergone anatomically complete supraclavicular decompression at our institution, where the reoperative procedure solely consisted of brachial plexus neurolysis.

The initial success of the previous primary operations was reflected by a mean improvement in QuickDASH scores of 27.6 ± 2.0 (45.1% ± 3.1%), with 74 of 85 patients (87%) rating their outcomes as good or excellent. We estimated the recurrence rate after previous primary operations to be 5.6%, which compares favorably with other studies. We also found that the mean time interval from the previous primary operation to reoperation for recurrence was approximately 2.5 years. These observations reinforce the necessity for long-term follow-up and careful assessment of reSymptoms in all patients who have undergone surgical treatment for NTOS. Notably, the incidence of reNTOS is often not described in studies focusing on short-term and mid-term results of surgery.
