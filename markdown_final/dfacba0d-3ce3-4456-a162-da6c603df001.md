Micoplasma treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing the two species and their clinical contexts. Then, I should verify diagnostic challenges and how they shape treatment decisions. Next, I will review first-line therapies and resistance patterns for M. pneumoniae, followed by M. genitalium. After that, I need to check special populations and stewardship considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stepwise treatment algorithms and note evidence gaps that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and their usual presentations. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a respiratory pathogen causing atypical pneumonia and bronchitis, with extrapulmonary manifestations in some cases, whereas Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted pathogen causing urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease and is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes in women. I should double-check that both lack a cell wall, rendering beta-lactams ineffective, which will anchor antibiotic choices later [^114CRiC3] [^117DTFvX].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pitfalls before jumping to treatment. For M. pneumoniae, carriage in asymptomatic children complicates PCR interpretation, and serology can reflect prior infection. Thus, distinguishing infection from colonization is challenging in real time, which means empiric therapy decisions often hinge on clinical probability rather than definitive etiologic proof, especially outside research settings [^115JEo4K] [^112SYcA1] [^114CRiC3]. For M. genitalium, NAAT is the diagnostic standard, but resistance testing availability varies. Where available, it materially improves outcomes via resistance-guided therapy, which I will return to shortly [^112xrqM1] [^1179kzeg].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for M. pneumoniae. Macrolides are the usual first-line agents in children because tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones carry age-related safety concerns. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin are reasonable options, with azithromycin commonly used for convenience, though I should confirm that macrolide resistance is rising globally and can prolong fever and hospitalization when present [^111gebmQ] [^113QHDVm] [^116J2jiS]. Hold on, I should verify the resistance landscape: in the US, macrolide resistance remains under about 10% on average, but pockets up to 80% have been reported, whereas East Asia often sees 80–90% resistance, so local epidemiology matters for empiric choices and counseling on expected clinical course [^116J2jiS] [^111JyMXR] [^112MgPPC].

> Next, I should review alternatives for macrolide-resistant or macrolide-refractory M. pneumoniae. Tetracyclines, particularly doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones are effective alternatives; observational pediatric data suggest faster defervescence with doxycycline in MRMP, and network meta-analyses indicate broadly comparable efficacy among tetracyclines and quinolones, with minocycline ranking highly for clinical response and cough improvement, though pediatric safety data remain limited and heterogeneous [^115oa4xn] [^113Agwp4] [^116y9Umk]. But wait, what if the child is under 8 years old? I need to ensure we balance risks: tetracycline-associated tooth discoloration and quinolone-associated musculoskeletal adverse effects are the main concerns, so shared decision-making and local resistance prevalence should guide whether to escalate beyond macrolides in young children with refractory disease [^111gebmQ].

> Let me consider adjunctive therapies for refractory M. pneumoniae. Systemic corticosteroids can shorten fever duration and hospital stay in macrolide-refractory cases, likely by attenuating host immunopathology; meta-analyses show meaningful reductions in fever and length of stay, and cost-utility modeling suggests economic advantage when added to antibiotics in persistent cases, though optimal dosing and patient selection remain unsettled [^112NDnvu] [^1123wpsF] [^1137vJHL]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: adult data are less consistent, so steroids should be reserved for carefully selected pediatric cases with clear refractory features after a reasonable macrolide trial, ideally in consultation with pediatric infectious diseases [^116xpw2W].

> I should double-check the evidence base for macrolide efficacy in pediatric M. pneumoniae. Systematic reviews and Cochrane analyses have struggled to demonstrate clear benefit due to diagnostic limitations and heterogeneity, yet large retrospective cohorts associate macrolide use with shorter length of stay, and guideline bodies still endorse macrolides for suspected atypical CAP in school-aged children. This discrepancy likely reflects the difficulty of proving etiologic benefit amid carriage and coinfections rather than true ineffectiveness [^117LUVay] [^115aH8fm] [^116MeHtK] [^111sa4KA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded antibiotics are ineffective; that would be too strong — current guidance still supports macrolides as first-line while acknowledging evidence limitations and the need for better diagnostics [^111sa4KA].

> Now, I will examine M. genitalium treatment, and I need to ensure I anchor this to resistance-guided therapy. The 2021 CDC guidance moved away from single-dose azithromycin due to rising resistance and now recommends a two-stage approach: doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days to reduce organism load, followed by azithromycin if macrolide-susceptible or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days if macrolide-resistant; where resistance testing is unavailable, sequential doxycycline then moxifloxacin is advised, with cure rates exceeding 90% in resistance-guided strategies [^112xrqM1] [^111b8n2A]. Hold on, I should verify the historical context: single-dose azithromycin efficacy has fallen to roughly 60–70% in contemporary cohorts, explaining the guideline shift and reinforcing the need to avoid monotherapy [^116LUFxF].

> Let me review partner management and special situations for M. genitalium. Sexual partners within the prior 90 days should be notified and treated using the same resistance-aware principles. For complicated infection or treatment failure, moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 10–14 days is recommended, and in persistent cases, a test of cure 3–4 weeks after therapy is reasonable, especially if resistance testing was not performed or moxifloxacin was not used [^114iHM6L] [^113h8fiP] [^112xrqM1]. I should confirm that screening asymptomatic individuals is not recommended due to unclear sequelae and the risk of driving resistance, aligning with CDC's risk–benefit assessment [^1173hMPr].

> Next, I should review special populations and safety. For children with M. pneumoniae, macrolides remain first-line. Tetracyclines are generally avoided under age 8 and fluoroquinolones are typically avoided in children due to musculoskeletal risks, though these may be considered in select refractory cases after weighing risks and benefits and local resistance patterns [^111gebmQ] [^112MgPPC]. For pregnant patients, I need to ensure we avoid tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. Macrolides are preferred for M. pneumoniae, and for M. genitalium, azithromycin-based regimens are used with caution given resistance, with close follow-up and partner management to mitigate retreatment needs [^111gebmQ] [^112xrqM1].

> I should confirm stewardship and public health considerations. Both pathogens underscore the harms of empiric macrolide monotherapy in the absence of susceptibility support; for M. genitalium, resistance-guided therapy reduces selection of resistance and improves cure, and for M. pneumoniae, avoiding unnecessary macrolides in viral upper respiratory infections helps preserve activity for those who truly need it, especially as resistance varies geographically and can surge during epidemics [^111b8n2A] [^111gebmQ] [^112MgPPC]. Hold on, I should verify that asymptomatic screening for M. genitalium is discouraged to prevent overtreatment and resistance amplification, which is consistent with current guidance [^1173hMPr].

> Let me synthesize practical algorithms while keeping the uncertainties visible. For suspected M. pneumoniae in a school-aged child with compatible atypical pneumonia, start a macrolide such as azithromycin; if fever persists beyond 48–72 hours or clinical deterioration occurs, evaluate for macrolide resistance and consider switching to doxycycline if age 8 or older or to a fluoroquinolone in older adolescents, adding corticosteroids for refractory cases with significant inflammatory markers and clinical compromise, and adjust based on local MRMP prevalence and patient-specific risks [^111sa4KA] [^112MgPPC] [^112NDnvu]. For suspected M. genitalium in a symptomatic patient, use doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, then add azithromycin if macrolide-susceptible or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days if macrolide-resistant or if resistance status is unknown, and arrange partner treatment and counseling; consider test of cure only in selected scenarios as above [^112xrqM1] [^111b8n2A].

> Finally, I need to ensure I flag evidence gaps and future directions. Better diagnostics to distinguish M. pneumoniae infection from carriage are urgently needed to clarify who benefits from antibiotics, and prospective trials of macrolides, tetracyclines, and adjunctive corticosteroids in pediatrics are warranted. For M. genitalium, broader access to resistance testing and new agents are critical as moxifloxacin resistance emerges and third-line options like oral chloramphenicol remain anecdotal [^114CRiC3] [^112xrqM1] [^112xG5sV]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance emphasizes individualized therapy based on local resistance and patient factors, which it does, reinforcing the need for ongoing surveillance and clinician education [^111gebmQ] [^112xrqM1].

Treatment of Mycoplasma infections depends on the species and resistance profile. For **M. pneumoniae**, macrolides are first-line [^111gebmQ]; use tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones if macrolide resistance is suspected or confirmed [^114MSieU] [^113Agwp4]. For **M. genitalium**, use resistance-guided therapy: doxycycline followed by azithromycin if macrolide-susceptible, or moxifloxacin if macrolide-resistant [^112xrqM1] [^111b8n2A] [^114iHM6L]. Avoid beta-lactams because Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall [^112MgPPC]. Monitor for adverse effects, especially with fluoroquinolones, and consider a test of cure 3–4 weeks after therapy in persistent or complicated cases [^112xrqM1].

## Treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections

### First-line therapy

Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) are **first-line** for M. pneumoniae pneumonia [^111gebmQ]; azithromycin is preferred for its convenience and tolerability [^notfound].

---

### Alternative therapy

Use **tetracyclines (doxycycline)** or **fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)** when macrolide resistance is suspected or confirmed [^114MSieU] [^113av2Be]. Doxycycline is often favored for its efficacy and safety in older children and adults [^notfound].

---

### Adjunctive therapy

Consider **corticosteroids** for severe or refractory cases, particularly with macrolide-resistant strains, to reduce inflammation and improve clinical outcomes [^112NDnvu] [^1123wpsF].

---

## Treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections

### Resistance-guided therapy (RGT)

- **Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** is given first to reduce bacterial load [^112xrqM1] [^111b8n2A].
- **If macrolide-susceptible**: Follow with azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose, then 500 mg orally once daily for 2 additional days [^112xrqM1] [^114iHM6L].
- **If macrolide-resistant**: Follow with moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7–10 days [^112xrqM1] [^114iHM6L].

---

### Alternative regimens

If **resistance testing is unavailable**, use doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin as above [^112xrqM1] [^111b8n2A]. For **complicated infections**, such as PID or epididymitis, treat with moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days [^113h8fiP] [^115kupvE].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Avoid beta-lactams**: Mycoplasma lacks a cell wall; beta-lactams are ineffective [^112MgPPC].
- **Monitor adverse effects**: Fluoroquinolones can cause gastrointestinal upset, CNS effects, and QT prolongation; use cautiously in patients with risk factors [^notfound].
- **Test of cure**: Consider in persistent or complicated cases 3–4 weeks after therapy [^notfound].

## Treatment of Mycoplasma infections

| **Species** | **First-line therapy** | **Alternative therapy** | **Adjunctive therapy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| M. pneumoniae | Macrolides (azithromycin) | Doxycycline, fluoroquinolones | Corticosteroids (severe cases) |
| M. genitalium | Doxycycline → azithromycin (if susceptible) | Doxycycline → moxifloxacin (if resistant) | None routinely |

---

Effective treatment of Mycoplasma infections requires **species-specific, resistance-guided regimens** [^112xrqM1], with macrolides for M. pneumoniae and sequential therapy for M. genitalium; avoid beta-lactams and monitor for adverse effects [^112MgPPC].

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^114LjwMv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

The second challenge is the therapeutic gap. In Japan, the therapeutic efficacy of tosufloxacin and minocycline has been demonstrated in several studies. However, because of side effects and the development of new resistant strains, empirical treatment for MRMP, especially in endemic areas, is the subject of an ongoing debate. In addition, delayed effective antimicrobial treatment for M. pneumoniae has been found to be related to immune reaction, which may lead to prolonged or extrapulmonary disease. Macrolide resistance is one of the significant risk factors for delayed effective treatment. This finding partially explains why patients with MRMP infections showed a trend of more extrapulmonary manifestations or consolidation in 2 studies. Some randomized controlled trials indicated a positive effect on early corticosteroid treatment whether or not there was macrolide resistance. However, a retrospective study of a large database in Japan did not support this viewpoint. A well-designed randomized trial or meta-analysis should be considered to clarify the role of corticosteroids. In conclusion, the management of M. pneumoniae infection might need to be reappraised.

### An unusual and difficult to detect cause of infection in two trauma patients [^112ua8gn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding optimal antimicrobial selection is limited by lack of standardized methods and clinical breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Additionally, clinical data on the treatment of these organisms are limited to case reports and series, with limited data on clinical or microbiological response. Beta-lactam antibiotics and vancomycin are inactive because they target the cell wall. Myoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. are generally susceptible to agents that inhibit protein synthesis. Fluoroquinolones, which are bactericidal against mycoplasmas should be considered for empiric treatment. Doxycycline should also be considered, although resistance may be increasing. It is reasonable to use combination therapy (eg, moxifloxacin and doxycycline).

Tests of Cure

Tests of cure are undertaken to confirm pathogen eradication, preventing transmission and reinfection. Because NAATs detect both viable and nonviable DNA/RNA, explicit time frames for tests of cure have been outlined, ranging from 7–14 days after therapy for pharyngeal gonorrhea to ≈28 days for chlamydia in pregnant persons. Macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium infections are cleared relatively quickly after azithromycin therapy; when tests of cure are performed, the timeframe is similar to that for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Australian guidelines recommend a test of cure 14–21 days after treatment.

Benefits of Tests of Cure

The primary benefit of tests of cure is verifying that the organism has been successfully eradicated, which is key for pathogens that cause serious sequelae, particularly during asymptomatic infection. Because M. genitalium sometimes recrudesces after symptoms resolve, a test of cure would identify the need for additional therapy earlier, in turn reducing the risk of infecting sex partners, potentially with resistant strains not detected initially or selected during treatment. Finally, patients might appreciate confirmation that they are cured and not contagious.

Harms of Tests of Cure

A positive test of cure indicates either treatment failure or reinfection. Cases of reinfection are usually retreated with the same antibiotic, whereas cases of treatment failure are typically treated with an alternative antibiotic. When the risk for long-term sequelae is high, the benefit of assuring eradication outweighs the harm of additional antibiotic pressure. When the risk for sequelae is low or uncertain, the potential harm of additional antibiotics might outweigh the benefit of confirming eradication. Despite some evidence that M. genitalium can result in adverse sequelae in women, numerous outstanding questions about natural history remain. These questions include uncertainty over the frequency of upper reproductive tract sequelae, frequency of spontaneous clearance, clinical significance of asymptomatic infections, and transmission risk with low organism load that persists after treatment. Given these outstanding questions, the benefit of tests of cure is currently unknown. The 2021 CDC treatment guidelines only recommend tests of cure when resistance testing is not available and moxifloxacin cannot be used.

Which Antimicrobial Therapies Should Be Used against M. genitalium?

Azithromycin (1 g, 1 dose) was recommended over doxycycline (100 mg 2×/d for 7 days) for M. genitalium in the 2015 treatment guidelines. Moxifloxacin was recommended for azithromycin treatment failures. The 2021 guidelines removed single-dose azithromycin from recommended therapies, primarily because of increasing antimicrobial resistance.

### A diagnostic host-specific transcriptome response for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia to guide pediatric patient treatment [^111BptZf]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mycoplasma pneumoniae commonly causes respiratory infections in children and young adults, presenting with clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to pneumonia. M. pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia. The incidence of M. pneumoniae pneumonia is uncertain and is typically described as endemic, marked by cyclic epidemics occurring every 3 to 5 years. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with associated non-pharmaceutical interventions, had a significant impact on the circulation of respiratory pathogens, including M. pneumoniae. A global surveillance network noted a decrease in M. pneumoniae detection from April 2020 to March 2021. Despite a resurgence in other pathogens, M. pneumoniae infections remained low until March 2022–23. Concerns about a potential upsurge in mycoplasma infections have arisen due to waning herd immunity. Recent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae infections have been reported during the last months in different European countries, including Spain, Denmark, France, and the Netherlands(see also). In November 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an increase in outpatient consultations and hospitalizations for M. pneumoniae pneumonia in China since May, along with rises in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and influenza virus cases since October.

### Clinical care of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection… [^111gebmQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most Mycoplasma pneumoniaeinfections are self-limiting.
- Healthcare providers routinely treat pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniaewith antibiotics.
- Some strains of M. pneumoniaemay be resistant to macrolides. Treatment options Healthcare providers can treat M. pneumoniae infections with the following classes of antibiotics:

- Macrolides
- Tetracycline
- Fluoroquinolones. Treatment recommendations Take the age of the patient and local antibiotic resistance patterns into consideration. Macrolides Tetracyclines Fluoroquinolones Healthcare providers shouldn't prescribe tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones for young children under normal circumstances. Macrolides are generally considered the treatment of choice. However, consider using a second-line antibiotic regimen to treat patients with suspected or confirmed M. pneumoniae infection who aren't improving on macrolides.

Consider potential adverse effects in children and pregnant women when using fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines. Promote the judicious use of antibiotics and minimize the risk of antibiotic resistance by not prescribing antibiotics unless indicated by clinical or laboratory evidence. Antibiotic resistance Resistance to macrolides emerged in M. pneumoniae in the early 2000s. There is global variability, but it has remained under 10% in United States.

### The efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of genital Mycoplasma genitalium: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LUFxF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is associated with nongonococcal urethritis in men and cervicitis in women. Current guidelines recommend treatment with 1 gram of azithromycin; however, treatment failure has increasingly been reported. This meta-analysis estimates treatment efficacy following treatment with 1 gram of azithromycin.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched for articles published to the end of February 2015 using the following search terms: (Mycoplasma genitalium) AND (azithromycin OR zithromax OR [treatment efficacy]). Studies were included if they were English language, had participants aged ≥ 12 years diagnosed with urogenital MG, and had microbial cure measured within 12 months of treatment. Treatment efficacy was measured as microbial cure at last follow-up after treatment.

Results

A total of 21 studies, including 1490 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most studies were observational, with only 5 controlled trials identified. The random-effects pooled microbial cure was 77.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71.1%-83.4%; I² = 80.8%, P < .01). For the 12 studies conducted prior to 2009, pooled microbial cure was 85.3% (CI, 82.3%-88.3%; I² = 19.7%, P = 0.25); for the 9 studies conducted since the beginning of 2009, pooled microbial cure was 67.0% (CI, 57.0%-76.9%; I² = 80.9%, P < .01).

Conclusions

The efficacy of a single dose of 1 gram of azithromycin for the treatment of urogenital MG has decreased to approach 60%. Even though most of the available evidence is based on observational studies that have considerable variability in sample size and timing of microbial cure, this low efficacy is of considerable concern. It is vital that new treatment options for MG are investigated.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^111m47AQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review of the evidence was guided by 2 types of key questions (Table): informational questions outlining data published since the 2015 update to the CDC treatment guidelines and discussion questions outlining how the evidence should inform guidelines. We identified articles published in English since the 2015 treatment guidelines (January 1, 2015–November 30, 2021) by using the search terms mycoplasma AND genitalium OR M. genitalium to search PubMed. One investigator (L.E.M.) reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for inclusion. All authors verified included papers. In this article, we focus on new evidence on disease syndromes and antibiotic therapy and the implications for testing and treatment strategies.

### Update in epidemiology and management of Mycoplasma genitalium infections [^1179kzeg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a frequent cause of urogenital syndromes in men and women and is associated with adverse sequelae in women. M genitalium also infects the rectum, and may cause proctitis, but rarely infects the pharynx. Diagnosis requires nucleic acid amplification testing. Antibiotic resistance is widespread: more than half of infections are resistant to macrolides and fluoroquinolone resistance is increasing. Resistance-guided therapy is recommended for symptomatic patients, involving initial treatment with doxycycline to reduce organism load followed by azithromycin for macrolide-sensitive infections or moxifloxacin for macrolide-resistant infections. Neither screening nor tests of cure are recommended in asymptomatic persons.

### Effectiveness and safety of tetracyclines and quinolones in people with: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116y9Umk]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

The escalating resistance of Mycoplasma pneumoniae to macrolides has become a significant global health concern, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although tetracyclines and quinolones have been proposed as alternative therapeutic options, concerns regarding age-specific safety issues and the lack of consensus in recommendations across various national guidelines prevail. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to ascertain the most efficacious interventions for second-line treatment of M. pneumoniae infection while considering the age-specific safety issues associated with these interventions.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and WanFang Data, from inception up to November 11th, 2023. Studies of quinolones or tetracyclines for the treatment of people with M. pneumoniae infection were collected and screened by reading published reports, with any type of study included, and no individual patient-level data requested. A systematic review and direct meta-analysis compared the efficacy of tetracyclines and quinolones regarding time to defervescence (TTD) and the rates of fever disappearance within 24 h and 48 h of antibiotic administration, for managing M. pneumoniae infection. Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was employed to indirectly assess the relative effectiveness of different interventions in people with M. pneumoniae infection and the safety profile of medication in paediatric patients. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023478383.

Findings

The systematic review and direct meta-analysis included a total of 4 articles involving 246 patients, while the NMA encompassed 85 articles involving a substantial cohort of 7095 patients. The NMA measured the effectiveness across all ages and included 7043 patients, with a mean age of 37.80 ± 3.91 years. Of the 85 included studies, 14 (16.5%) were at low risk of bias, 71 (83.5%) were at moderate risk, and no studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. In the direct meta-analysis, no statistically significant differences were found between tetracyclines and quinolones concerning TTD (mean difference: −0.40, 95% CI: −1.43 to 0.63; I² = 0%), fever disappearance rate within 24 h of antibiotic administration (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.08–1.79; I² = 58%), and fever disappearance rate within 48 h of antibiotic administration (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.30–3.98; I² = 59%). However, the comprehensive NMA analysis of clinical response (in 70 studies; n = 6143 patients), shortening of TTD (in 52 studies; n = 4363 patients), shortening length of cough relief or disappearance (in 39 studies; n = 3235 patients), fever disappearance rate at 48 h (in four studies; n = 418 patients) revealed that minocycline exhibited the most favourable outcomes across these various parameters, and the analysis of fever disappearance rate at 24 h (in three studies; n = 145 patients) revealed that levofloxacin may be the most effective, as indicated by the rank probabilities and surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) value. Moxifloxacin ranked second in clinical response and in shortening the length of cough relief or disappearance, and third in shortening TTD. Notably, when evaluating the occurrence of adverse reactions in paediatric patients (in four studies; n = 239 children), levofloxacin was associated with the highest SUCRA value rankings for the rate of adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that tetracyclines and quinolones may be equally effective. Based on the age of participants in the included studies, minocycline may be the most effective intervention for children over eight years of age when all preventive measures are considered, whereas moxifloxacin may benefit people under eight years of age. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the limited number of studies and patients included, and the heterogeneity between included studies. Based on a limited number of studies in children, levofloxacin is likely to have one of the highest rates of adverse reactions. The majority of the studies included in the NMA were from the Asian region, and more randomised controlled trials comparing different therapeutic strategies in patients with M. pneumoniae are warranted. This comparative study provides clinical pharmacists and clinicians with important information to enable them to make informed decisions about treatment options, considering drug efficacy and safety.

### Stroke in two children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. A causal or casual relationship? [^116p1y4D]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

We report on 2 children who had a stroke biologically related to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Invasion of the central nervous system and an immune mechanism represent 2 pathogenesis pathways. Prompt macrolide therapy does not prevent stroke, but immediate and aggressive immunosuppressive treatment seems to help recovery.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, outpatient regimens, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer macrolides in pediatric patients (primarily school-aged and adolescent patients) evaluated in an outpatient setting with findings compatible with CAP caused by atypical pathogens. Obtain laboratory testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae if available in a clinically relevant time frame.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^116Lt3UM]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

IMMUNOMODULATORY TREATMENT

Given high rates of macrolide resistance and the occurrence of macrolide refractory M. pneumoniae infections, immunomodulatory treatment is a relevant treatment option. Indeed, immunopathology is known to enhance disease, especially in severe M. pneumoniae infections. There is sufficient evidence that adding steroids in refractory M. pneumoniae pulmonary infections is beneficial, although there is limited evidence for the exact dose and duration. During the 2023–2024 resurgence, there are no new studies in children that provide more evidence for immunosuppressive treatment during severe M. pneumoniae infection, however a study in adults found that adjunctive corticosteroid treatment shortened duration of fever.

Introduction

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial respiratory infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Most M. pneumoniae infections are mild, although some patients develop pneumonia requiring hospitalization. M. pneumoniae infections affect all age groups; however, the highest percentages of cases have historically been reported among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years. Previous studies have estimated that M. pneumoniae accounts for approximately 10%–30% of hospitalized pediatric CAP cases. No vaccine is available to prevent M. pneumoniae infection. Macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin are the first-line treatment for infection. * Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infections are widespread in some regions of the world but remain relatively uncommon in the United States, accounting for < 10% of cases.

Historically, M. pneumoniae infections have increased approximately every 3–5 years, which mathematical modeling suggests is due, in part, to changes in predominant strain types and associated increases in susceptible populations resulting from waning immunity after infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, M. pneumoniae infections were rarely detected. In 2023, M. pneumoniae infections increased in other countries but remained low in the United States. M. pneumoniae infections in the United States began to increase sharply in April 2024, as indicated by an increase in the percentage of positive test results and syndromic surveillance data from emergency departments. † This report describes the epidemiology of M. pneumoniae and characterizes infections among patients aged ≤ 18 years (referred to as children in this report) discharged from pediatric hospitals during 2024 compared with previous years.

### Azithromycin (Zmax) [^117WJs9q]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Zmax is indicated for the treatment with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. [See CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]

Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae, in patients appropriate for oral therapy. Pediatric use in this indication is based on extrapolation of adult efficacy. [See USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)]

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Zmax and other antibacterial drugs, Zmax should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to Zmax. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)] Therapy with Zmax may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once the results become available, antimicrobial therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

Zmax is a macrolide antimicrobial indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria:

Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults (1)
Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and children 6 months and older (1)

### Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae, United States [^116JDjAm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Macrolides are the preferred treatment for infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children. Since 2000, macrolide resistance has developed in Asia and has now been reported from many parts of the world. This resistance is of a high level and has been associated with longer duration of fever, cough, and hospital stay and the need to switch to alternative antimicrobial agents. Scant information is available about the prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) in the United States, and no organized ongoing surveillance exists.

### Azithromycin [^111oSX9d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

1.1 Adult Patients

Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.
Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.
Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus agalactiae.
Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials, the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established.

1.2 Pediatric Patients

[see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]

Acute otitis media (> 6 months of age) caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Community-acquired pneumonia (> 6 months of age) due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy.
Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (> 2 years of age) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following:

patients with cystic fibrosis,
patients with nosocomial infections,
patients with known or suspected bacteremia,
patients requiring hospitalization,
elderly or debilitated patients, or
patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness (including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia).

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children: carriage, pathogenesis, and antibiotic resistance [^115JEo4K]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Both the diagnosis and treatment of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children are currently facing two main challenges: a relatively high carriage in asymptomatic children, and a worldwide increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP). This review focuses on the scientific and clinical implications of these crucial issues.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have indicated that the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in the upper respiratory tract is similar among asymptomatic, healthy children and children with a symptomatic respiratory tract infection, and that current diagnostic procedures for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between bacterial carriage and infection. It is therefore possible that the burden of M. pneumoniae-associated disease is overestimated. Another phenomenon that has an important impact on the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections is the rapid worldwide emergence of MRMP isolates.

Summary

The current diagnostic procedures for M. pneumoniae cannot discern between bacterial carriage and infection in a clinically relevant time frame. It is therefore imperative that these procedures be modified such as to unambiguously detect symptomatic M. pneumoniae infections. Moreover, the emergence of MRMP necessitates the application of methods to detect macrolide resistance as well as the implementation of restrictive policies regarding the use of macrolides.

### Efficacy of antimicrobial therapy for Mycoplasma genitalium infections [^1176YXfM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium has been causally linked with nongonococcal urethritis in men and cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, and infertility in women, yet treatment has proven challenging. To inform treatment recommendations, we reviewed English-language studies describing antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance-associated mutations, and clinical efficacy of antibiotic therapy, identified via a systematic search of PubMed supplemented by expert referral. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from some contemporary isolates exhibited high-level susceptibility to most macrolides and quinolones, and moderate susceptibility to most tetracyclines, whereas other contemporary isolates had high MICs to the same antibiotics. Randomized trials demonstrated poor efficacy of doxycycline and better, but declining, efficacy of single-dose azithromycin therapy. Treatment failures after extended doses of azithromycin similarly increased, and circulating macrolide resistance was present in high levels in several areas. Moxifloxacin remains the most effective therapy, but treatment failures and quinolone resistance are emerging. Surveillance of M. genitalium prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns is urgently needed.

### Treatment of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children: a meta-analysis of macrolides versus tetracyclines [^114s7efK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The global prevalence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) pneumonia infections, particularly in children, is on the rise. It is imperative to assess the clinical efficacies of alternative antibiotics such as tetracyclines to ensure effective treatment, mitigate antibiotic resistance, enhance clinical outcomes, and minimize the spread of resistant strains among MRMP-infected children. The objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacies of macrolides and tetracyclines in treating MRMP pneumonia in children.

Methods

We systematically searched the literature to identify comparative studies that examined the clinical outcomes of macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics in children with MRMP pneumonia. We conducted a meta-analysis of the mean duration of fever, hospital stay duration, therapeutic efficacies, and time to defervescence to compare macrolides and tetracyclines.

Results

Eleven studies involving 1143 patients compared the clinical efficacies of macrolides and tetracyclines in children with MRMP pneumonia. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, and Korea, and the outcomes of febrile days, hospital stay duration, therapeutic efficacy, and time to defervescence were analyzed. The macrolides studied were azithromycin and clarithromycin, whereas the tetracyclines included minocycline and doxycycline. The pooled estimate of 5 studies showed that the mean duration of febrile days and hospital stay was longer in the macrolides group than tetracycline group [weighted mean difference = 1.64 days, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68–2.59, weighted mean difference = 1.22 days, 95% CI: 0.82–1.62, respectively]. The therapeutic efficacy was significantly lower in the macrolide group than in the tetracycline group (odds ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.20–0.57).

Conclusions

The clinical efficacy of tetracycline treatment was superior to that of macrolide treatment in children with MRMP pneumonia. However, further research is required to validate these findings and inform evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.

### About Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection… [^114CRiC3]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Bacteria called Mycoplasma pneumoniaecan cause respiratory tract infections.
- These infections are generally mild but sometimes can be severe.
- Most will recover without medicine, but some people need antibiotics to get better.
- Call a healthcare provider about difficulty breathing or symptoms that concern you. Symptoms It can take 1 to 4 weeks for symptoms to appear after someone's been exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms can last for several weeks. Some infected people may have no symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of infection. Complications While uncommon, serious complications can occur that require hospital care. M.

pneumoniae infections can cause or make the following conditions worse:

- Asthma attacks or new asthma symptoms
- Encephalitis
- Hemolytic anemia
- Renal dysfunction
- Serious pneumonia
- Skin disorders like Stevens-Johnson syndrome or mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis. Seek care for these symptoms Seek medical care if you or your child has persistent or worsening symptoms of M. pneumoniae infection, such as wheezing, especially if at risk of developing severe disease. Always seek medical care right away if you or your child is having difficulty breathing. Diagnosis There's no quick way to test for M. pneumoniae infections, unlike some other respiratory illnesses. Instead, healthcare providers often examine the patient and look for signs. They may order a chest x-ray to see if the patient has pneumonia. Most healthcare providers don't test for M.

pneumoniae infection. If they do, they'll collect a specimen and send it to a lab. The types of specimens that can be collected include: Most common: A swab from the nose or throat Least common: Blood. Treatment and recovery Most people with a mild M. pneumoniae infection will recover on their own without medicine. Ask about symptom relief Healthcare providers can use several types of antibiotics to treat people with pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae. Some M. pneumoniae are resistant to some antibiotics used for treatment. CDC has information on the potential danger of antibiotic resistance and how to prevent it.

### Mycoplasma genitalium as a sexually transmitted infection: implications for screening, testing, and treatment [^113WkAMK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

The evidence that Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted pathogen is virtually incontrovertible based on both the concordance rates among partners and on DNA typing showing the same sequence type among partners in contrast to unrelated M genitalium positive patients. The implications that this has for the screening, testing, and treatment of patients is less certain however. Which tests are the most sensitive and specific, what samples are most appropriate, who should be tested, what treatment is best and how should partners be managed?

### Efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of macrolide refractory Mycoplasma pneumonia in children: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115vYVrj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 were used for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The Population-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome (PICO) question used for our search strategy was: "Does use of glucocorticoids help improve the outcome of MRMP in children?"

Search strategy

We performed a systematic search utilizing a protocol designed by two independent medical librarians (D.W.S. and M.L) specifically for this study with 10 electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Core journal (Korean, Japanese, and Chinese Journal) Full-text Database. The search encompassed articles published from January, 1990 to March 8, 2018. We used search terms listed in Additional file 1 to search PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and database of core countries. We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

The first screening was executed by two independent reviewers (H.S.K. and I.S.S.) who evaluated the titles and abstracts obtained from the search. Records were managed using Endnote (version X8; Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). From this initial screening, articles that did not focus on glucocorticoid use in MRMP and review articles were immediately excluded. After initial exclusion process, full texts of the remaining articles were reviewed independently by two authors (H.S.K. and I.S.S.) to determine whether any articles met the predetermined eligibility criteria described in the next section. Disagreements between the two reviewers regarding the inclusion or exclusion of particular studies were settled by consultation with a third reviewer (Y.J.L.).

Eligibility

The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) randomized control trial (RCT) which compare the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on to macrolide alone in children with MRMP, (2) MRMP which was diagnosed with serology or polymerase chain reaction, and that refractories were defined clinically, (3) only included children < 18 years of age, and (4) outcome measures with hospital days, fever duration, and level of C-reactive protein (CRP) change. Review articles, published abstracts without full-text publications, and case-study reports with 10 participants or less were excluded. Our search strategy included non-English articles in our initial search results. Non-English articles were then translated and included for evaluation.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children: a pro / con discussion [^112LWS1z]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen of increasing clinical interest as cases have recently risen in the United States and worldwide following a period of reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. While most cases are mild, Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and cannot be reliably distinguished from other common causes of CAP based solely on features of clinical presentation or imaging. However, testing to confirm a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae, when it is suspected, can be logistically challenging in some clinical settings. It also remains unclear which patients with M. pneumoniae CAP benefit from antibiotic treatment, raising the question of whether treatment should be offered, particularly when the diagnosis is not confirmed. This pro/con discussion explores the available data to support or refute routine testing and empiric antibiotic treatment for M. pneumoniae.

### Efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of macrolide refractory Mycoplasma pneumonia in children: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1123wpsF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis identified and assessed RCTs on the use of glucocorticoids in children with MRMP. We specifically investigated effects of glucocorticoids on fever duration, length of hospital stay, and CRP level after treatment in comparison with conventional macrolide therapy. Results revealed positive effects of glucocorticoid treatment on all outcome measures.

M. pneumoniae is a common pathogen causing community acquired pneumonia. The clinical course of M. pneumoniae infection is diverse, ranging from self-limiting to severe pneumonia with extra-pulmonary complications. Macrolide is considered the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. In adults, one study reported that prednisone treatment for 7 days in patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to hospital can shorten time to clinical stability without increase in complications. However, another study reported that glucocorticoid use did not show any benefits in children. Pulmonary injury associated with severe mycoplasma pneumonia could be caused by host immune response rather than by direct microbial damage. Overly active cell-mediated immunity and cytokine responses play a significant role in MRMP. Severe M. pneumoniae infections and MRMP show similar laboratory findings with severe acute respiratory syndrome such as increased levels of non-specific markers of inflammation such as serum CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. Since MRMP can be considered as an immune-mediated disease, use of immune modulatory therapy could seem rational. For cases with MRMP infection, secondary treatment options are limited due to adverse effects of tetracycline or fluoroquinolones, especially in children. The use of systemic steroids, in addition to antimicrobial therapy, to diminish host immune response in MRMP has been used in children and demonstrated satisfactory effects. Glucocorticoids have shown to improve clinical features and reduce lung injury in children and adults. The use of glucocorticoids in M. pneumoniae infection showed reduced lung histopathologic score by reducing cytokines and decreasing inflammatory response ultimately leading to lower mortality. Therefore, glucocorticoids have been considered suitable as adjunctive therapy to macrolide therapy. Although previous studies have reported the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of severe MRMP, treatment protocols varied from oral prednisolone of 1 mg/kg/day to intravenous methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days. These variable treatment protocols are due to the lack of guidelines for glucocorticoids treatment in severe MRMP to date.

### Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for inpatients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia [^116xpw2W]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that adjunctive treatment with either low-dose or high-dose corticosteroids may not be beneficial in patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Based on these findings, clinicians should be more careful if they use corticosteroids to treat adult inpatients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia.

### Macrolide therapy and outcomes in a multicenter cohort of children hospitalized with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia [^116MeHtK]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in childhood. Few studies have addressed the association of antimicrobial treatment and outcomes.

Objective

To determine whether macrolide therapy is associated with improved outcomes among children hospitalized with M. pneumoniae pneumonia.

Design

Multicenter retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Thirty-six children's hospitals which contribute data to the Pediatric Health Information System.

Patients

Children 6–18 years of age discharged with a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia.

Main Exposure

Initial macrolide therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

Length of stay (LOS), all-cause readmissions, and asthma-related hospitalizations.

Results

Empiric macrolide therapy was administered to 405 (58.7%) of 690 patients. The median LOS was 3 days (interquartile range, 2–6 days). Eight (1.2%) patients were readmitted within 28 days, and 160 (23.2%) were readmitted within 15 months of index discharge. Ninety-five (13.7%) patients were hospitalized for asthma within 15 months of index discharge. Empiric macrolide therapy was associated with a 32% shorter overall LOS (adjusted beta-coefficient, -0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.59 to -0.17). Macrolide therapy was not associated with all-cause readmission at 28 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI: 0.22–5.78) or 15 months (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.59–1.70) or with asthma-related hospitalizations at 15 months (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.36–1.97).

Conclusion

In this large multicenter study of children hospitalized with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, empiric macrolide therapy was associated with a shorter hospital LOS. Macrolide therapy was not associated with 28-day or 15-month hospital readmission.

### Elimination of Mycoplasma from leukemia-lymphoma cell lines using antibiotics [^1161soH9]. Leukemia (2002). Low credibility.

Mycoplasmal contamination of cell culture systems continues to present major problems for basic research and for manufacturing of bioproducts. Previous work suggested that certain antibiotics have strong anti-mycoplasma properties and raised the prospect that the technically rather simple antibiotic treatment may be an appropriate means for mycoplasma eradication. We have developed and validated an effective strategy to eliminate mycoplasma from chronically infected cell cultures using antibiotics which have shown strong activity against these contaminants. Here, we describe our experience with the treatment of 123 consecutive mycoplasma-positive leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, comparing five different antibiotic regimens (in total 433 treatments). We optimized the antibiotic dose schedules and the duration of treatments. The various antibiotic treatments which were employed in parallel had a high efficacy, as 71% to 86% of the infected cultures were cleansed. Treatment failure may result from the resistance of the mycoplasmas to antibiotic therapy and the inability of the eukaryotic cells to survive the cytotoxic effects of the antibiotics. Resistance to mycoplasma eradication was observed in 3% to 20% of the cultures. Loss of the cell culture caused by cytotoxicity was seen in 3% to 11% of the treatments. With regard to the overall outcome, 96% of the cell lines were rendered mycoplasma-free with at least one of the antibiotic treatments and were permanently cured. In conclusion, antibiotic treatment represents the most practical and efficient option to cleanse mycoplasma-positive cell lines.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections secondary to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children [^115BR2jf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is widely recognised as an important cause of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. Pulmonary manifestations are typically tracheobronchitis or pneumonia but M. pneumoniae is also implicated in wheezing episodes in both asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals. Although antibiotics are used to treat LRTIs, a review of several major textbooks offers conflicting advice for using antibiotics in the management of M. pneumoniae LRTI in children.

Objectives

To determine whether antibiotics are effective in the treatment of childhood LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae infections acquired in the community.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to February week 5, 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to March 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics commonly used for treating M. pneumoniae (i.e. macrolide, tetracycline or quinolone classes) versus placebo, or antibiotics from any other class in the treatment of children under 18 years of age with community-acquired LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and assessed methodological quality. We extracted and analysed relevant data separately. We resolved disagreements by consensus.

Main Results

A total of 1912 children were enrolled from seven studies. Data interpretation was limited by the inability to extract data that referred to children with M. pneumoniae. In most studies, clinical response did not differ between children randomised to a macrolide antibiotic and children randomised to a non-macrolide antibiotic. In one controlled study (of children with recurrent respiratory infections, whose acute LRTI was associated with Mycoplasma, Chlamydia or both by polymerase chain reaction, and/or paired sera) 100% of children treated with azithromycin had clinical resolution of their illness compared to 77% not treated with azithromycin at one month.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to draw any specific conclusions about the efficacy of antibiotics for this condition in children (although one trial suggests macrolides may be efficacious in some children with LRTI secondary to Mycoplasma). The use of antibiotics has to be balanced with possible adverse events. There is still a need for high quality, double-blinded RCTs to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics for LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae in children.

### Mycoplasma genitalium: should we treat and how? [^114btdfY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is associated with acute and chronic urethritis in men. Existing data on infection in women are limited and inconsistent but suggest that M. genitalium is associated with urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and possibly female infertility. Data are inconclusive regarding the role of M. genitalium in adverse pregnancy outcomes and ectopic pregnancy. Available data suggest that azithromycin is superior to doxycycline in treating M. genitalium infection. However, azithromycin-resistant infections have been reported in 3 continents, and the proportion of azithromycin-resistant M. genitalium infection is unknown. Moxifloxacin is the only drug that currently seems to uniformly eradicate M. genitalium. Detection of M. genitalium is hampered by the absence of a commercially available diagnostic test. Persons with persistent pelvic inflammatory disease or clinically significant persistent urethritis or cervicitis should be tested for M. genitalium, if possible. Infected persons who have not previously received azithromycin should receive that drug. Persons in whom azithromycin therapy fails should be treated with moxifloxicin.

### Macrolide and occult infection in asthma [^115YyHrN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A small percentage of asthma exacerbations are linked with infection by an atypical bacterium, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. These bacteria also have been proposed to cause occult chronic lower airway inflammation and to initiate nonatopic asthma in adults. Consequently, the logical procedure would be to eliminate these pathogens as soon and as thoroughly as possible using antibiotics. Nonetheless, antibiotics are not recommended even for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations except as needed for comorbid conditions. These discrepancies highlight the need to define the role, if any, of antimicrobials that are active against atypical pathogens, mainly macrolides, but also tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, in the treatment of asthma.

Recent Findings

Macrolides are antibiotics with both antimicrobial and antiinflammatory activities. Some studies have documented that these agents could be useful in the treatment of occult infection in asthma because of their antimicrobial activity against atypical pathogens. They could also lead to reduction of the airways inflammation by decreasing the transcription of mRNA for a variety of cytokines and inhibiting interleukin-8 release by eosinophils, and therefore improvement of symptoms and pulmonary function. These effects are not caused by bronchodilation, elevation of serum theophylline level, or steroid-sparing mechanism.

Summary

The available clinical evidence seems to support use of macrolides in the treatment of asthma because of their antimicrobial activity. However, studies that may confirm this hypothesis are scarce and with limited scientific value because of their open, uncontrolled design.

### The role of macrolides in severe community-acquired pneumonia and the potential impact of macrolide-resistant mycoplamsa pneumoniae [^114SvGcP]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Define the utility of adjunctive macrolide therapy in patients with more severe forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Recent Findings

Guidelines recommend adjunctive macrolide therapy as an option for patients with CAP, admitted to the hospital. A large data set collected both retrospectively and prospectively, including several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that adjunctive macrolide therapy can reduce mortality and improve outcomes in patients with severe CAP, more effectively than other alternative therapies. This effect appears to be most evident in those with severe illness and appears to be independent of direct antimicrobial effects and may be a result of the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. A recent RCT, the ACCESS study, showed a clinical benefit of macrolides in severe CAP patients, but this may have been the result of a reversal of infection-related immunoparalysis. Macrolides appear to be valuable for patients with more severe CAP, but their therapeutic value is being challenged by the recent emergence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae; however, the optimal therapy for this pathogen still needs to be defined.

Summary

New evidence has further advanced the role of macrolides as preferred adjunctive therapy for patients with severe CAP.

### Global trends in the proportion of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MgPPC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children, accounting for approximately 30% to 40% of cases. Some cases of M pneumoniae infection have been considered as a self-limiting disease, whereas other cases of M pneumoniae infection have led to poor clinical outcomes with serious complications. Mycoplasma pneumoniae lacks a cell wall and is thus resistant to antibiotics targeting the cell walls. Because antibiotics targeting cell walls are not an option for treating M pneumoniae infection, antibiotic treatment options for M pneumoniae infections include those that play a role in the disruption of protein synthesis (eg, macrolides and tetracyclines) and in the inhibition of DNA replication (eg, fluoroquinolones). However, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones have limited use for children because of the lack of information on the safety in this population. Therefore, macrolides have been the first choice for treating M pneumoniae infection in children.

However, accumulating evidence suggests that the prevalence of refractory M pneumoniae pneumonia has been increasing. Refractory M pneumoniae pneumonia has been associated with difficult-to-treat M pneumoniae infection, increased long-term complications, and increased medical costs with decreased quality of life. Macrolide resistance of M pneumoniae is one of the possible causes of refractory M pneumoniae pneumonia, although asymptomatic cases of macrolide-resistant M pneumoniae (MRMP) infection have rarely been reported. Macrolide resistance is caused by variants in the V region of the 23S rRNA gene, which codes for the binding site of macrolides in the M pneumoniae ribosome. Debate exists as to whether there are differences in clinical features, including the severity of pneumonia, between patients with MRMP infection and those with macrolide-sensitive M pneumoniae (MSMP) infecton. Some studies have reported no differences in clinical characteristics between the 2 groups, whereas other studies have reported longer fever duration, more severe clinical courses, and increased risk of intensive care unit admission among patients with MRMP infection compared with patients with MSMP infection. The detection of MRMP can occur during treatment with macrolides among patients initially infected with MSMP. Coinfection cases with MSMP and MRMP have rarely been reported, indicating the advent of MRMP due to macrolide treatment for M pneumoniae infection.

### Distribution of macrolide resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in urogenital tract specimens from women enrolled in a US clinical study cohort [^113QHDVm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen that confers increased risk for adverse reproductive and sexual health outcomes, including nongonococcal urethritis in men and preterm birth, infertility, vaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Diagnosis of infection has been difficult since M. genitalium has fastidious culture requirements and slow growth in vitro. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are now the primary tools for detecting the organism in clinical specimens obtained from infected persons.

In the research setting, use of NAATs has provided an understanding of the epidemiology of M. genitalium infection, revealing prevalence estimates often similar to or exceeding those of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in low-risk populations as well as in persons at higher risk for contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The recent advent of clinically validated, in vitro, diagnostic NAATs provides for sensitive methods for detecting M. genitalium in specimens collected from various urogenital sites in symptomatic women, including urine samples as well as swab specimens from cervical and vaginal epithelia.

Since Mycoplasma spp. lack a cell wall, bacteriostatic antimicrobial agents form the basis for treating M. genitalium infections. The semisynthetic macrolide azithromycin has been the first-line treatment for M. genitalium infection due to its advantageous pharmacokinetic properties for treating intracellular bacterial infections, but resistance to the drug has been increasing steadily due to drug-induced mutations in M. genitalium ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically at base positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23S subunit. To avoid treatment failure and selection of resistant strains in vivo, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidelines now recommend testing M. genitalium NAAT–positive specimens from symptomatic patients for the presence of these macrolide-resistance–mediating mutations (MRMs) prior to initiation of treatment.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^1173hMPr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Screening

Screening at-risk women for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recommended in the United States because infections are frequently asymptomatic; robust data exist on risk for sequelae from untreated infections; effective treatment is readily available; and, for chlamydia, data from a randomized trial demonstrated decreased risk for PID in persons screened and treated. M. genitalium meets only 1 of these criteria: infections are frequently asymptomatic (≈30%–60% in clinic populations). Data on the risk for sequelae from untreated M. genitalium infections in women are less robust than data for chlamydia. Prospective studies of sequelae in women are limited, challenging our ability to infer cause. No evidence of adverse sequelae in men exists, although such data are sparse. Given the high rates of macrolide resistance and the advent of fluoroquinolone treatment failures, effective treatment is not readily available for all infected persons (see section on antimicrobial therapies). Finally, randomized controlled trials evaluating whether screening and treatment of M. genitalium infections could prevent PID and perinatal complications are costly; to date, none have been undertaken despite the articulated need. Some population subgroups have higher risk for PID, and screening and treatment in those subgroups might yield greater benefit, but this possibility has not been assessed.

Benefits of Screening for M. genitalium

Screening and effectively treating asymptomatic persons for M. genitalium could theoretically reduce transmission and population-level prevalence. However, reductions in prevalence after implementing screening programs for sexually transmitted infections do not always occur, as demonstrated by increasing chlamydia prevalence in the United States. This increase has been offset by some declines in PID, although PID rates have slightly increased in recent years. If identified infections could be effectively treated while minimizing the selection of resistance, screening could reduce the likelihood of transmitted resistance, leading to subsequent reductions in the population-level prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

Harms of Screening for M. genitalium

If asymptomatic infections do not cause sequelae, screening and treating will result in unnecessary antibiotic exposure. On an individual level, antibiotics might disrupt a person's microbiota and lead to other health conditions, and adverse effects associated with antibiotics are occasionally serious. On a population level, more widespread antibiotic use speeds the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance, and multidrug-resistant M. genitalium infections are often refractory to treatment. Anecdotal reports suggest that treatment-refractory infections can lead to anxiety and depression that would not occur in the absence of screening. Consistent with earlier assessments, screening asymptomatic persons for M. genitalium is not recommended in the 2021 CDC Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^111nwbdL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

M. genitalium is now an established sexually transmitted infection that poses substantial challenges for developing optimal testing and treatment approaches. Antimicrobial resistance has grown rapidly, and untreatable infections have begun to appear. New antimicrobial drugs and better antimicrobial stewardship of existing antibiotics are urgently needed. Resistance-guided therapy is a vital tool to reduce antibiotic pressure and maintain the efficacy of existing antimicrobials. However, only some diagnostic tests incorporate the detection of antimicrobial resistance, limiting our ability to use this tool. Concerns about the rapid spread of resistance have led to recommendations to limit testing and treatment for M. genitalium infections to patients with symptoms. Rigorous and adequately powered clinical trials of screening and treatment of M. genitalium in women are critically needed. Without a better understanding of the natural history of infection, particularly the risk for sequelae, the benefits and harms of testing and treatment approaches cannot be truly weighed.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^115u89gu]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting older and medically vulnerable people. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual CAP incidence ranges between 22–80/10,000 persons. A broad range of pathogens cause CAP, including bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics and supportive care are the main treatments for bacterial CAP; most clinically treated cases do not have the causative pathogen identified, so most treatment is empirical. In the UK and Northern Europe, where most S. pneumoniae remain penicillin susceptible, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment principally targeting S. pneumoniae, e.g. oral penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin, is often effective. However, concerns about other pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and S. aureus, which may not respond to such treatment, can lead to use of broader-spectrum beta-lactams, with macrolides/doxycycline also added to cover 'atypical' infections such as Mycoplasma.

Current guidelines recommend amoxicillin for low/moderate-severity CAP, ± a macrolide if atypical infection is suspected in moderate-severity cases, and co-amoxiclav + a macrolide for high-severity CAP. Broader-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for severe disease, to ensure less common, but more resistant, pathogens are treated, given the greater potential for adverse outcomes. However, concern about resistance and prior community treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, can lead to use of co-amoxiclav and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams in non-severe CAP presenting to hospital. Use and over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), more side effects, and increased Clostridioides difficile infections. Understanding when narrower-spectrum antibiotics can safely be used could help mitigate AMR development.

While population-based studies and clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for CAP, none have directly compared the treatment outcomes between amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, the two most commonly used antibiotics for CAP in the UK. We used electronic healthcare records (EHR) from a large UK teaching hospital group to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with CAP treated with either amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be safely used more widely.

### Paediatric critical illness associated with respiratory infection: a single-centre, retrospective cohort study [^115yhgmG]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

Our results would argue that routine surveillance for Mycoplasma in school-aged children with pneumonia should be considered, as others have suggested. Our findings are consistent with other studies that demonstrated that M. pneumoniae is found commonly in school-aged children with CAP, including children admitted to the intensive care unit. The incidence of M. pneumoniae infection does vary widely by location and season, and so we cannot exclude the possibility that the prevalence observed in our study was higher than those in years before or after. An older iteration of the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) guidelines for the management of CAP (circa 2011) recommended routine use of azithromycin for all children with 'severe' pneumonia because of the possibility of 'atypical infection', though diagnostic testing to identify atypical pathogens was not suggested or even mentioned. One might question whether this practice would represent appropriate antimicrobial stewardship, given that the majority of severe paediatric CAP is likely to be caused by S. pneumoniae. The CPS guidelines were later revised in 2015 and no longer recommend routine treatment with macrolides. They state that atypical pneumonia should be suspected in children with 'subacute, nonsevere pneumonia, presenting with features such as prominent cough, minimal leukocytosis, and a nonlobar infiltrate' and that azithromycin is recommended 'for suspected or proven Mycoplasma or Chlamydia pneumoniae '. Unfortunately, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that these symptoms and signs cannot reliably identify atypical pneumonia, and so it seems likely that many clinicians may not consider the possibility that M. pneumoniae may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of critically ill children with respiratory compromise. Based on our data, we would suggest that clinicians be aware that a reasonable proportion of school-aged children with CAP admitted to the PICU may have an active M. pneumoniae infection and would recommend empiric treatment with anti- Mycoplasma agents (eg, macrolides, doxycycline and fluoroquinolones) until diagnostic (molecular) testing results are available. Of course, we cannot be certain of the therapeutic benefit of antibacterials targeting M. pneumoniae; one systematic review found no clear difference in outcomes between children treated with Mycoplasma- active agents and those without. Furthermore, the detection of Mycoplasma in the respiratory tract does not prove causation, as coinfections have been shown to be commonand some investigators have documented high rates of PCR positivity in control persons(although others have not); some investigators have identified novel serological tests that can confirm active infection. We would agree with other authors who have suggested that specific anti- Mycoplasma treatment might yield significant benefit, especially for those with severe disease, and have called for the execution of a randomised treatment trial. However, until results of a definitive treatment trial are available, we feel that the potential benefit of treating critically ill children with Mycoplasma detected in respiratory symptoms outweighs the potential antimicrobial stewardship harms of this strategy.

### Effectiveness and safety of tetracyclines and quinolones in people with: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116frXNS]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted according to the Cochrane recommendations, and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for network meta-analyses. The study protocol was defined and registered prior to study initiation at the PROSPERO database (Registration Number CRD42023478383).

Two authors (FC and JL) independently searched PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and WanFang Data, which were used to collect relevant studies regarding data on the effectiveness of quinolones and tetracyclines in treating patients with M. pneumoniae infection, as well as data on the safety of M. pneumoniae in children. Considering the age-specific safety issues of quinolones and tetracyclines, safety-related studies were limited to children, and studies of efficacy were included in the general population regardless of age. The last search was updated to November 11th, 2023, to identify studies published since our initial search. There are no restrictions on the type of research. When the results of a study were reported in multiple publications, we included the study with the richest and most recent findings. We also searched the literature lists of relevant systematic reviews on quinolones or tetracyclines for the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections in patients and manually searched the references included in the reviews for additional access to relevant literature. The search terms were: "quinolones", "tetracyclines", "macrolides", "ciprofloxacin", "levofloxacin", "moxifloxacin", "tosufloxacin", "doxycycline", "minocycline", "chlortetracycline", "oxytetracycline", " mycoplasma ", " mycoplasma pneumoniae ", etc. In order to maximise the number of papers found, we searched using both MeSH and free-text terms without any language restrictions. The complete search strategies for all databases are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

Resistance-Guided Therapy

Where diagnostic assays that can detect macrolide resistance mutations are available, sequential resistance-guided therapy is feasible and results in higher cure rates. Under sequential resistance-guided therapy, initial empiric treatment with doxycycline is followed by a second antibiotic (either azithromycin or moxifloxacin) on the basis of the pathogen's susceptibility profile. Tetracycline resistance in M. genitalium develops infrequently, and treatment with doxycycline reduces the organism load, subsequently limiting development of resistance to the second antibiotic. In Australia, where this approach was developed, macrolide-susceptible infections are treated with high-dose azithromycin (1 g, then 500 mg/d for 3 days) after the initial doxycycline regimen, whereas macrolide-resistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin (400 mg/d for 7 days) after the initial doxycycline regimen. In a setting where macrolide resistance was high (> 70%) and quinolone resistance moderate (13%–22%), cure rates for doxycycline followed by azithromycin were 95.4% and 92.0% for doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin; selection for macrolide resistance occurred in only 4.6%. Given high macrolide resistance in the United States, the 2021 CDC treatment guidelines recommend resistance-guided therapy where possible and sequential treatment with doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin when resistance testing is not available.

PID Treatment

Recommended outpatient PID treatment in the 2015 CDC treatment guidelines consisted of antimicrobial drugs for empiric treatment of gonorrhea and chlamydia (a cephalosporin and doxycycline). This regimen had limited effectiveness against M. genitalium; cure rates were as low as 56%. More recent data demonstrated cure rates of ≈95% for PID treatment regimens that incorporated metronidazole, regardless of whether the regimen included azithromycin or moxifloxacin. Similarly, persistent cervical M. genitalium infections were significantly less common among patients receiving a PID regimen with metronidazole than in patients not taking metronidazole. Metronidazole targets anaerobes and is thought to lack activity against M. genitalium, suggesting that eradicating anaerobes might enhance M. genitalium clearance. However, this hypothesis has not yet been evaluated.

### Mycoplasma hominis meningitis in an extremely preterm newborn: a case report [^116sJNCu]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment options for Mycoplasma Hominis meningitis and its duration remains unclear. Due to the rarity of this infection in neonates, the current recommendations are based on clinical experiences and in-vitro susceptibility test results.

Mycoplasma Hominis has shown susceptibility to Chloramphenicol, Tetracyclines, Lincosamide and Fluoroquinolones in in-vitro testing. Fluoroquinolones have been used in past to treat neonatal mycoplasma hominins meningitis successfully. Moxifloxacin, a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is preferred because of its ability to concentrate in CSF and its bactericidal effects in CNS infections. Although there are cases which were successfully treated with Moxifloxacin monotherapy, there is a risk of development of resistance with fluoroquinolones during treatment. Our literature search revealed only two reported cases of neonates who were given Moxifloxacin in combination with another antibiotic for Mycoplasma Hominis meningitis (Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of neonates treated with combination therapy (Moxifloxacin and another antibiotic) for Mycoplasma Hominis CNS infection

Evidence from previously published cases show that 28% neonates with Mycoplasma Hominis CNS infection died whereas 34% had some CNS complications and 28% cases developed some neurological sequelae mostly hemiparesis. In our case, treatment with a combination therapy of Moxifloxacin and Doxycycline resulted in significant clinical and laboratory improvement in terms of negative CSF culture after 48 hours of initiating this regimen and decreased WBC count and protein in subsequent CSF analysis. Our patient was discharged home with a normal neurological examination and stable ventriculomegaly. His neurodevelopmental follow up at six months of age showed normal neurological findings.

It is important to consider Mycoplasma Hominis as a potential cause for neonatal meningitis in infants particularly those with previous colonization with this rare but devastating species. Our case demonstrates effective eradication of Mycoplasma Hominis with a combination therapy of Moxifloxacin and Doxycycline. However, further research is required to understand the pharmacokinetics of these antibiotics to establish optimal dosing and duration for effective treatment of CNS infections with Mycoplasma Hominis.

### Efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of macrolide refractory Mycoplasma pneumonia in children: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113av2Be]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) is one of the major pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia and bronchitis in children. Treatment of M. pneumoniae -related respiratory infection is based on symptomatic treatment with antibiotics. Macrolides have been used as first line treatment. However, macrolide-refractory M. pneumoniae (MRMP) strains are increasing abruptly, particularly in East Asian countries including Korea, Japan, and China.

Most patients with MRMP do not show improvement of fever when they are treated with macrolides. Some may develop refractory or severe clinical course that requires additional treatment. Treatment for MRMP includes tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and systemic glucocorticoids.

Secondary antibiotics such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are considered as effective alternatives in the treatment of MRMP. However, they are of limited use due to safety-concerns of teeth discoloration and musculoskeletal toxicity, particularly in children. Glucocorticoids can be also considered as alternative treatment options due to two reason. First, the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae infection is associated with amplified host immune response and virulence of M. pneumoniae. Second, adverse effects of glucocorticoids have been well established. Further risk is not likely to be added in the treatment of MRMP. However, previous studies on the effect of glucocorticoids have shown conflicting results.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of glucocorticoids for treatment of MRMP in children through systematic review and meta-analysis.

### Infections in sickle cell disease [^111dmDXd]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma spp.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a small bacterium, lacking a cell wall, which is a common respiratory pathogen in all populations, accounting for 10–40% of all cases of community-acquired pneumonia. In SCD, a serological diagnosis of mycoplasma infection is found in approximately 9% of all cases of ACS, and 12% of ACS cases occurring in children under 5 years old. Case reports suggest that mycoplasma may cause a particularly severe form of ACS, with prolonged fever lasting more than 7 days, pleuritic pain and pleural effusions. M. pneumoniae accounts for most mycoplasma infections in ACS, although M. hominis and M. tuberculosis also occur. Mycoplasma infections do not respond to penicillin-based antibiotics and treatment with a macrolide is necessary.

Treatment of respiratory bacterial infections in sickle cell disease

Respiratory bacterial infections are a serious threat to patients with SCD, both because of their reduced immunity and because of the potential of respiratory complications to cause hypoxia and exacerbate hemolysis and vaso-occlusion, with rapid clinical deterioration. Treatment and investigation require multidisciplinary management, including the involvement of microbiology, critical care and respiratory medicine colleagues. The management of ACS includes the routine use of parenteral antibiotics, typically including a broad-spectrum penicillin or cephalosporin, with a macrolide to cover atypical organisms.

Routine immunization remains one of the most effective defense strategies against respiratory bacterial infections in SCD, as part of the childhood immunization schedule (Table 1). Vaccine uptake however, has been reported to vary widely geographically (46–95%)and further work is needed to ascertain response to vaccines in SCD. Hydroxycarbamide therapy has been shown to reduce episodes of ACS and infective complications in SCD and to inhibit progression of pneumococcal disease in a murine model. Penicillin prophylaxis (or erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin) protects against pneumococcal infection, although the duration of prophylaxis varies between countries. The impact of education and infection prevention and control measures are likely to be important, particularly in low-resource settings.

We describe the novel use of oral chloramphenicol for treatment-resistant Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) infection in a 20-year-old heterosexual cisgender male presenting with recurrent symptomatic non-gonococcal urethritis. M. genitalium urethritis is an increasingly common clinical conundrum in sexual health clinics and in cases of second-line treatment failure (such as moxifloxacin), UK and international guidelines struggle to make recommendations for third-line treatments. As shown in our case, the evidence base for third-line treatments is lacking, with poor success rates, and may be poorly tolerated. Here we demonstrate the novel use of a well-tolerated oral antimicrobial, chloramphenicol, resulting in rapid microbiological and clinical cure in treatment-resistant M. genitalium urethritis.

### Antibiotics in childhood pneumonia [^1158qBEX]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common global childhood illnesses. The diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical judgement and radiological and laboratory investigations. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important cause of childhood community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus) and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma and Chlamydia) are likely pathogens in younger and older children in developed countries. In the minority of cases only, the actual organism is isolated to guide treatment. Antibiotics effective against the expected bacterial pathogens should be instituted where necessary. The route and duration of antibiotic therapy, the role of emerging pathogens and the impact of pneumococcal resistance and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines are also discussed.

### Effectiveness and safety of tetracyclines and quinolones in people with: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1124WZEz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mycoplasma pneumoniae has exhibited global dissemination, with an incidence rate of 8.61% worldwide from 2017 to 2020. The withdrawal of non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) measures after the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the resurgence of M. pneumoniae infection. Increasing evidence shows that the prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection is growing, with a global trend towards a high prevalence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) strains in particular. M. pneumoniae resistance rates are 80–90% in Asia, and up to 26% have been reported in some parts of Europe and the United States. The prevalence of MRMP strains is alarmingly high, often leading to serious extrapulmonary diseases that are life-threatening and difficult to treat, and are associated with heightened disease burden, diminished quality of life, and increased mortality.

With the increasing rate of MRMP resistance, many guidelines recommend quinolones and tetracyclines as alternative treatments for MRMP infection. However, age-specific safety issues have caused uncertainty and hesitation about the optimal dosing regimen. For example, quinolones have cartilage erosion hazards, and tetracyclines may cause permanent staining of teeth and transient anostosis in children. Some guidelines recommend inconsistent alternative treatment options. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) supports doxycycline, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin as second-line antibiotics for treating M. pneumoniae infections. However, the Chinese guidelines recommend new tetracyclines and quinolones for the treatment of MRMP infection, and the recommendations for specific drugs are still unclear. Beyond this, although certain data indicate that tetracyclines may be more effective than tosufloxacin in fever disappearance at 48 h in patients with MRMP infection, there is inadequate evidence to establish the superiority of either group. This means that clinical pharmacists may lack sufficient high-quality evidence to assist clinicians in making comparisons and decisions.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^111aS12X]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent advances in Mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostics, and treatment, since the 2023–2024 global resurgence of M. pneumoniae following the COVID-19 pandemic has provided new insights.

Recent Findings

The remarkably prolonged reduction of M. pneumoniae infections during COVID-19-related nonpharmaceutical interventions has shed new light on M. pneumoniae transmission, both on an individual and a global level. M. pneumoniae epidemiology showed striking differences in comparison with other respiratory pathogens, including RSV and pneumococcus. We discuss the possible mechanisms behind the delayed resurgence, including waning immunity and the persistence of M. pneumoniae reservoirs. There have been contrasting reports on disease severity with notable differences in severity between children and adults, with young adults showing marked vulnerability. The inability of M. pneumoniae diagnostic tests to differentiate between infection and carriage poses a continuing challenge: in daily clinical practice as well as in the interpretation of study results. Furthermore, several studies report safety and utility for tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones as treatment alternatives to macrolide antibiotics.

Summary

The global resurgence of M. pneumoniae following COVID-19 pandemic restrictions has provided a unique opportunity to study its epidemiology and pathophysiology, which has advanced our understanding of M. pneumoniae infections in children.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections [^112svW2D]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a frequent cause of community-acquired respiratory infections in children and adults. Although the organism is felt to be the most frequent 'atypical' pathogen responsible for community-acquired pneumonia in adults, the prevalence of M. pneumoniae varies greatly from study to study, depending on the population and the diagnostic methods used. Recent studies have found the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in adults with pneumonia to range from 1.9 to over 30%. M. pneumoniae is also a frequent cause of outbreaks of respiratory disease in institutional settings. However, the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection is hampered by the lack of standardized, rapid, specific methods. This problem was illustrated by the results of an investigation of an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infection in a federal training facility. Accurate diagnosis required a combination of polymerase chain reaction and serology, as IgM antibodies were not present early in the course of the infection in many patients. Several papers evaluating various serological and polymerase chain reaction assays were published during the period of this review. An assessment of the actual performance of these tests was also hampered by the lack of standardized comparative methods. M. pneumoniae is susceptible in vitro to macrolides, tetracyclines and quinolone antibiotics; however, data are limited on the microbiological efficacy of these agents. Several pneumonia treatment studies were published during this period, practically all of them based the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection on serology; different methods and criteria were used in each study, and thus the microbiological efficacy could not be assessed. The Infectious Disease Society of America recently stated in their revised Practice Guidelines for the Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults that, as there were no diagnostic tests available that reliably and rapidly detect M. pneumoniae, therapy must usually be empirical.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae-an emerging extra-pulmonary pathogen [^117GCDVr]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma is a well-recognised pathogen that colonises mucosal surfaces of humans and animals. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infects the upper and lower respiratory tracts of children and adults, leading to a wide range of respiratory and non-respiratory clinical conditions. M. pneumoniae infection is frequently considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with respiratory illnesses, and is commonly managed empirically with macrolides and fluoroquinolones. This contrasts with patients who present with non-respiratory symptoms in the context of a recent or current unrecognised M. pneumoniae infection, for whom this pathogen is rarely considered in the initial differential diagnosis. This review considers the microbiological, epidemiological, pathogenic and clinical features of this frequent pathogen that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory and non-respiratory infections.

### Corticosteroids for the treatment of respiratory infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children: a cost-utility analysis [^1137vJHL]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increasing evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in community-acquired pneumonia in children. More economic evaluations incorporating the new evidence and in the pediatric population are needed to know the efficiency of this treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the cost utility of the use of corticosteroids as adjuvant treatment for children with Mycoplasma pneumonia.

Methods

A decision tree model was used to estimate the cost and quality adjusted life years (QALY) associated with cost-effectiveness as an adjunct treatment for children with Mycoplasma pneumonia with persistent signs after standard treatment with macrolide drugs for ≥ 1 week. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Results

The QALYs per person estimated in the model for those treatments were 0.92 with corticosteroids plus antibiotics and 0.91 with antibiotics. The total costs per person were US$965 for corticosteroids plus antibiotics and US$1271 for antibiotics. This position of absolute dominance of corticosteroids plus antibiotics over antibiotics makes it unnecessary to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

Conclusion

Corticosteroids are cost-effective as an adjunct treatment for children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia with persistent signs after standard treatment with macrolide drugs for ≥ 1 week. Our evidence should motivate the evaluation of this treatment in other countries.

### Macrolides in children with community-acquired pneumonia: panacea or placebo? [^111WPJaf]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Pneumonia, most often caused by a respiratory virus, is common in childhood. Mycoplasma pneumoniae also is detected frequently, particularly in older children in the era of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination. Despite recommendations for β-lactam antibiotics, macrolide antibiotics, including erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin, are prescribed frequently to children with acute lower respiratory infection. However, the significance of detecting "atypical" pathogens, including M pneumoniae, in children remains contentious. Considering the potential for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of macrolides, our understanding of the role of these drugs in acute and chronic infections and in inflammatory conditions is changing. Some observational data have revealed improved outcomes in adults and children with pneumonia who are prescribed macrolides, although its widespread use has led to increases in macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. Clinical trials to define the role of macrolides in pediatric acute respiratory infection must be prioritized.

### Effectiveness and safety of tetracyclines and quinolones in people with: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113Agwp4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The escalating resistance of Mycoplasma pneumoniae to macrolides has become a significant global health concern, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although tetracyclines and quinolones have been proposed as alternative therapeutic options, concerns regarding age-specific safety issues and the lack of consensus in recommendations across various national guidelines prevail. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to ascertain the most efficacious interventions for second-line treatment of M. pneumoniae infection while considering the age-specific safety issues associated with these interventions.

Methods

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis we searched PubMed, Embase, CNKI, and WanFang Data, from inception up to November 11th, 2023. Studies of quinolones or tetracyclines for the treatment of people with M. pneumoniae infection were collected and screened by reading published reports, with any type of study included, and no individual patient-level data requested. A systematic review and direct meta-analysis compared the efficacy of tetracyclines and quinolones regarding time to defervescence (TTD) and the rates of fever disappearance within 24 h and 48 h of antibiotic administration, for managing M. pneumoniae infection. Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was employed to indirectly assess the relative effectiveness of different interventions in people with M. pneumoniae infection and the safety profile of medication in paediatric patients. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023478383.

Findings

The systematic review and direct meta-analysis included a total of 4 articles involving 246 patients, while the NMA encompassed 85 articles involving a substantial cohort of 7095 patients. The NMA measured the effectiveness across all ages and included 7043 patients, with a mean age of 37.80 ± 3.91 years. Of the 85 included studies, 14 (16.5%) were at low risk of bias, 71 (83.5%) were at moderate risk, and no studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. In the direct meta-analysis, no statistically significant differences were found between tetracyclines and quinolones concerning TTD (mean difference: -0.40, 95% CI: -1.43 to 0.63; I² = 0%), fever disappearance rate within 24 h of antibiotic administration (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.08–1.79; I² = 58%), and fever disappearance rate within 48 h of antibiotic administration (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.30–3.98; I² = 59%). However, the comprehensive NMA analysis of clinical response (in 70 studies; n = 6143 patients), shortening of TTD (in 52 studies; n = 4363 patients), shortening length of cough relief or disappearance (in 39 studies; n = 3235 patients), fever disappearance rate at 48 h (in four studies; n = 418 patients) revealed that minocycline exhibited the most favourable outcomes across these various parameters, and the analysis of fever disappearance rate at 24 h (in three studies; n = 145 patients) revealed that levofloxacin may be the most effective, as indicated by the rank probabilities and surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) value. Moxifloxacin ranked second in clinical response and in shortening the length of cough relief or disappearance, and third in shortening TTD. Notably, when evaluating the occurrence of adverse reactions in paediatric patients (in four studies; n = 239 children), levofloxacin was associated with the highest SUCRA value rankings for the rate of adverse events.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that tetracyclines and quinolones may be equally effective. Based on the age of participants in the included studies, minocycline may be the most effective intervention for children over eight years of age when all preventive measures are considered, whereas moxifloxacin may benefit people under eight years of age. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, given the limited number of studies and patients included, and the heterogeneity between included studies. Based on a limited number of studies in children, levofloxacin is likely to have one of the highest rates of adverse reactions. The majority of the studies included in the NMA were from the Asian region, and more randomised controlled trials comparing different therapeutic strategies in patients with M. pneumoniae are warranted. This comparative study provides clinical pharmacists and clinicians with important information to enable them to make informed decisions about treatment options, considering drug efficacy and safety.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^111aN9AT]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections in children. M. pneumoniae is a member of the bacterial class of Mollicutes and can be divided into two subtypes. Although M. pneumoniae is a well known cause of atypical pneumonia in children, the incidence of M. pneumoniae infections in adults is less clear. Apart from pulmonary disease, which is the main burden of M. pneumoniae infection, M. pneumoniae can lead to extrapulmonary manifestations, most notably mucocutaneus and neurological disease. M. pneumoniae infections occur in a distinct pattern of upsurges every 1–5 years. Crowding leads to increased rates of transmission, for instance within families, schools, army barracks or residential healthcare institutions. Diagnosing M. pneumoniae infections can be challenging as the interpretation of positive PCR results for M. pneumoniae in upper respiratory tract samples is complicated by the presence of upper respiratory tract carriage. Upper respiratory tract carriage can occur in children, in particular during M. pneumoniae upsurges, when it can reach a prevalence up to 50%. Furthermore, M. pneumoniae serology can be positive due to previous M. pneumoniae infection, hindering decision-making based on test results of acute phase single-sample serology. Due to the absence of a cell wall, options for antibiotic treatment in M. pneumoniae infections are limited to macrolides, tetracyclines and/or fluoroquinolones. Macrolides are first choice for antibiotic treatment in children, given the potential side effects of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones in young children. Macrolide resistance is a growing concern, in particularly in East Asia, where the prevalence of macrolide resistance amongst M. pneumoniae isolates ranges up to 90%.

Many key features of M. pneumoniae epidemiology, diagnostics and treatment are still unknown. In this review, we will describe recent advances in our understanding of M. pneumoniae pathophysiology and disease characteristics in children. We will especially focus on the 2023–2024 global resurgence of M. pneumoniae, as this was the first M. pneumoniae outbreak after the COVID-19 epidemic. The impact on M. pneumoniae epidemiology by social distancing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented because of the COVID-19 epidemic, has provided new insights.

### Efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of macrolide refractory Mycoplasma pneumonia in children: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112NDnvu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia in children. Although the rate of macrolide-refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) has increased, systemic glucocorticoids as a treatment option has not been validated yet. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on in the treatment of MRMP in children through systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Data sources A systematic literature search was conducted using ten electronic bibliographic databases including English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese languages, up to March 8, 2018. Study selection The study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist and selected randomized control trials which compared the efficacy of glucocorticoids add-on to macrolide in the treatment of MRMP in children. Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted: primary outcomes as hospital days, fever duration, and change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and main analysis was performed through meta-analysis with random effects model.

Results

Twenty-four unique randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The mean length of hospital stay in glucocorticoids treatment group was significantly shorter than that in conventional macrolide-treatment group (Weighted mean difference (WMD) = -4.03days). The mean length of fever duration was significantly shorter in the glucocorticoid treatment group in comparison with the conventional treatment group (WMD = -3.32days). Level of CRP after treatment was significantly lower in the glucocorticoid treatment group than that in the conventional treatment group (WMD = -16.03). Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis showed no significant improvement in heterogeneity. As limitations of the study, most of the studies included were from a single country and we were unable to control for heterogeneity across interventions, lack of standardized measures, and different time points of assessments across studies.

Conclusions

Glucocorticoid add-on treatment for MRMP can significantly shorten the duration of fever and hospital stay and decrease the level of CRP. These results should be confirmed by adequately powered studies in the future.

### Is activity against "atypical" pathogens necessary in the treatment protocols for community-acquired pneumonia? Issues with combination therapy [^115HnUNv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The "atypical pathogens" reviewed include Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophilia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Urinary antigen tests are the most frequently used tests for Legionella species and show good specificity and reasonable sensitivity. For M. pneumoniae, detection of immunoglobulin M, used for the past decade, has substantially improved diagnostic specificity and has simplified testing. For C. pneumoniae, there is no consensus on a simplified test that can be commonly used, and the reported results, with the use of tests that have not been well validated for diagnostic accuracy, show great variation in prevalence. With regard to therapeutic trials, 3 meta-analyses have recently addressed the issue of clinical outcome with or without antibiotics directed against atypical pathogens (macrolides or fluoroquinolones vs. beta-lactam agents). These analyses have not been able to demonstrate any clinical benefit, except in a subset analysis of infections caused by L. pneumophila. Nevertheless, multiple studies from the 1950s and 1960s supported a clinical benefit of tetracycline or erythromycin treatment for infections caused by M. pneumoniae. The largest uncontrolled review of antibiotic treatment for hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia demonstrated a clear benefit from the use of macrolides plus cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, compared with the use of beta-lactams alone, although these data support a potential role for atypical agents, because other potential explanations make drawing conclusions difficult. With regard to future studies, it is noted that the standard of care in the United States, Canada, and some other countries is routine use of agents to treat infection with atypical pathogens, which makes the conduct of controlled trials to address these issues ethically difficult and practically impossible. Additional limitations are the difficulty in diagnostic testing for C. pneumoniae and the importance of rapid institution of therapy for patients severely ill enough to require hospitalization. These observations introduce substantial ethical and logistical barriers to studies of specific agents, except by retrospective analyses.

### Rapid defervescence after doxycycline treatment of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae-associated community-acquired pneumonia in children [^115oa4xn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We did a retrospective review of children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection hospitalized from March 2010 to March 2013. Mycoplasma-resistant M. pneumoniae constituted 70% of the total M. pneumoniae-associated community-acquired pneumonia. Doxycycline was significantly more effective than macrolide for treatment of Mycoplasma-resistant M. pneumoniae-associated community-acquired pneumonia in terms of achievement of rapid defervescence within 24 hours.

### What explains anorectal Chlamydia infection in women? Implications of a mathematical model for test and treatment strategies [^1115Z6Fo]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

We estimated the relative impact of routine universal testing on reducing chlamydia prevalence to be almost double that of universal doxycycline treatment. An important factor that influences the impact of universal anorectal testing is the proportion of single anal infections. There is uncertainty around the prevalence of single anal infections in women, resulting in published estimates ranging between 4% and 25%. In the model, the anorectal prevalence is slightly higher than the data (but still within the CIs), resulting in a slightly higher percentage of single anorectal infections (22%). However, this is well within the ranges published in the literature. Moreover, it is questionable if universal anorectal testing is feasible in practice since it would be costly to test all female STI clinic visitors on both anatomic locations. Future studies should include economic evaluations of the clinical impact of the interventions aimed at anorectal infections, taking into account the possibility that long-term complications such as infertility and ectopic pregnancies are averted by interrupting autoinoculation and thereby preventing repeated urogenital infections.

There is ongoing debate about the type of treatment for urogenital chlamydia infections, but a recent RCT did not find evidence that azithromycin was non-inferior to doxycycline in treating urogenital chlamydia. We showed that introducing doxycycline as the standard treatment for urogenital chlamydia only slightly reduced chlamydia prevalence in STI clinic visitors compared with continuation of azithromycin. It should be noted that the limited reduction in chlamydia prevalence was found when anorectal infections were already treated with doxycycline in the standard of care. When azithromycin is the standard of care for treating anorectal infections (as in the USA), a larger impact on reducing prevalence by introducing doxycycline treatment is expected. In both cases, introducing doxycycline as the standard treatment for chlamydia infections might still be beneficial on the individual level by preventing complications or the development of antimicrobial resistance against Mycoplasma genitalium. The largest impact of universal doxycycline treatment on reducing chlamydia prevalence was found for low values of the azithromycin effectiveness in clearing anorectal infections, highlighting the need for RCTs to determine treatment efficacies for anorectal chlamydia.

### Erythema multiforme [^115UAroo]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, though it can also be "idiopathic". The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected, alone or in combination with other mucosal/cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization. A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is crucial to conduct proper workup and management. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be immediately ruled out because of the need of antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment and will be detailed in this review as well as the etiologic treatment. Lastly, the management of persistent or recurrent erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse, but breakthrough treatments have been reported successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^11217NZk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

To summarize recent advances in Mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostics, and treatment, since the 2023–2024 global resurgence of M. pneumoniae following the COVID-19 pandemic has provided new insights.

Recent findings

The remarkably prolonged reduction of M. pneumoniae infections during COVID-19-related nonpharmaceutical interventions has shed new light on M. pneumoniae transmission, both on an individual and a global level. M. pneumoniae epidemiology showed striking differences in comparison with other respiratory pathogens, including RSV and pneumococcus. We discuss the possible mechanisms behind the delayed resurgence, including waning immunity and the persistence of M. pneumoniae reservoirs. There have been contrasting reports on disease severity with notable differences in severity between children and adults, with young adults showing marked vulnerability. The inability of M. pneumoniae diagnostic tests to differentiate between infection and carriage poses a continuing challenge: in daily clinical practice as well as in the interpretation of study results. Furthermore, several studies report safety and utility for tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones as treatment alternatives to macrolide antibiotics.

Summary

The global resurgence of M. pneumoniae following COVID-19 pandemic restrictions has provided a unique opportunity to study its epidemiology and pathophysiology, which has advanced our understanding of M. pneumoniae infections in children.

### Maternal origins of neonatal infections: what Do obstetrician-gynecologist should / could Do? [^115XEBqz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neonatal infections are responsible for 20% of neonatal deaths yearly. In this review, we focused on the origins of the commoner neonatal infections, and we define the role of obstetricians. Regarding group B Streptococcus, a key measure for the prevention of neonatal infection is the vaginal-rectal culture screening at term pregnancy. Intravenous penicillin is the first-line prophylaxis at the start of labor, with intravenous ampicillin as an alternative. First-generation cephalosporins or clindamycin are recommended in case of penicillin allergy. Concerning urinary tract infections (UTIs), guidelines recommend complete urinalysis and urine culture in the first trimester of pregnancy for the screening of asymptomatic bacteriuria. For lower UTIs, guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as first-choice antibiotic. Amoxicillin or cefalexin are second-line antibiotics. For upper UTIs, guidelines recommend cephalexin per os as first line. Candida spp. colonization affects 20% of pregnant women; however, congenital fetal candidosis and Candida amnionitis are rare. First-line treatment in case of symptomatic vaginitis during pregnancy or asymptomatic colonization during the third trimester is vaginal clotrimazole. Fluconazole is not approved in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. Genital mycoplasmas colonization during pregnancy is usually asymptomatic and associated with bacterial vaginosis. Colonization is related to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pneumonia, chorioamnionitis, and sepsis. Macrolides are the first-line treatment along with lactobacillus supplementation. In cases of preterm premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor, ceftriaxone, clarithromycin, and metronidazole are required to prevent intra-amniotic infection. Intra-amniotic infection affects 1 to 5% of deliveries at term and one-third of preterm ones and is associated with perinatal death, early-onset neonatal sepsis, RDS, BPD, pneumonia, meningitis, and prematurity-related diseases. Guidelines recommend a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin, and in case of caesarean section, an additional dose of clindamycin or metronidazole is required. In conclusion, obstetricians should be aware that the treatment of maternal infection during pregnancy can prevent potentially lethal infections in the newborn. KEY POINTS: · Part of neonatal infections starts from maternal infections that must be treated during pregnancy. · Streptococcus group B and asymptomatic bacteriuria should be investigated in pregnancy and treated. · Mycoplasma and ureaplasma vaginal colonization during pregnancy is related to negative neonatal outcomes.

### Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia [^1118nbHE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

A high prevalence rate of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) has been reported in Asia. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of macrolide resistance on the manifestations and clinical judgment during M. pneumoniae infections. We found no difference in clinical severity between MRMP and macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MSMP) infections. However, in the pooled data, patients infected with MRMP had a longer febrile period (1.71 days), length of hospital stay (1.61 day), antibiotic drug courses (2.93 days), and defervescence time after macrolide treatment (2.04 days) compared with patients infected with MSMP. The risk of fever lasting for > 48 hours after macrolide treatment was also significantly increased (OR 21.24), and an increased proportion of patients was changed to second-line treatment (OR 4.42). Our findings indicate diagnostic and therapeutic challenges after the emergence of MRMP. More precise diagnostic tools and clearly defined treatment should be appraised in the future.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1174pxsj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

Mycoplasma genitalium

M. genitalium causes symptomatic and asymptomatic urethritis among men and is the etiology of approximately 15%–20% of NGU, 20%–25% of nonchlamydial NGU, and 40% of persistent or recurrent urethritis. Infection with C. trachomatis is common in selected geographic areas, although M. genitalium is often the sole pathogen. Data are insufficient to implicate M. genitalium infection with chronic complications among men (e.g. epididymitis, prostatitis, or infertility). The consequences of asymptomatic infection with M. genitalium among men are unknown.

Among women, M. genitalium has been associated with cervicitis, PID, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, and infertility, with an approximately twofold increase in the risk for these outcomes among women infected with M. genitalium. M. genitalium infections among women are also frequently asymptomatic, and the consequences associated with asymptomatic M. genitalium infection are unknown.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^1133Xjmq]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CHALLENGES FOR M. PNEUMONIAE TREATMENT: MACROLIDE RESISTANCE

Notably, there are no trials demonstrating clinical efficacy of macrolides in children with M. pneumoniae infection, which is related to the diagnostic issues described above. However, promising studies are underway, such as a trial aiming to show macrolide efficacy in patients who screened positive for M. pneumoniae using a M. pneumoniae -specific IgM point-of-care assay and will retrospectively be verified by specific PCR and IgM ASC ELISpot. Diagnostic accuracy in these types of trials ideally will be monitored in a research setting using M. pneumoniae- specific IgG seroconversion or IgM ASC ELISpot. With a diagnostic test that at least substantially enriches for patients with M. pneumoniae infection studies could demonstrate macrolide efficacy. In patients with probable or proven M. pneumoniae infection, macrolide antibiotics are first-line treatment, since M. pneumoniae is intrinsically resistant to beta lactam antibiotics because of its lack of a cell wall. Macrolide resistance amongst M. pneumoniae isolates remains high, in particular in East-Asia. Several regional studies demonstrate a prevalence of macrolide resistance up to 90% in China. In contrast to reports from Asia, recent studies in Germany and the USA continue to find low levels of macrolide resistance. Mutation analyses show that A2063G is the predominant cause of macrolide resistance, albeit that macrolide resistance testing is biased since it is almost only performed on genotype level. Culturing M. pneumoniae, and subsequent phenotypical antibiotic resistance testing, is usually not achievable and culture-based studies are thus lacking. The predominance of A2063G mutation can also be explained by the fact that this single point mutation is sufficient for macrolide resistance and can easily arise, particularly in the context of low macrolide concentration, that is just above MIC, which readily occurs in macrolides with long half-life such as azithromycin. At this point there is little evidence to suggest macrolide resistance has changed during the resurgence.

### Azithromycin monohydrate (azithromycin) [^111Q6UkA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Azithromycin for injection is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.

Azithromycin for injection is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria:

Community-acquired pneumonia in adults (1.1)
Pelvic inflammatory disease (1.2)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. (1.3)

1.1 Community-Acquired Pneumonia

due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients who require initial intravenous therapy.

1.2 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

due to Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma hominis in patients who require initial intravenous therapy. If anaerobic microorganisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, an antimicrobial agent with anaerobic activity should be administered in combination with azithromycin for injection.

Azithromycin for injection should be followed by azithromycin by the oral route as required [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

1.3 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections – does treatment help? [^112SYcA1]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTI's), especially in children. While severe M. pneumoniae infections are generally treated with antibiotics, the diagnosis as well as treatment of these infections should be reconsidered in the light of recent clinical findings. First, M. pneumoniae was found to be carried in the upper respiratory tract of a relatively high percentage of healthy, asymptomatic children. Clearly, this complicates the diagnosis of a suspected M. pneumoniae RTI and, thus, the decision when to initiate treatment. A complication in the treatment of these infections is that data on the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of M. pneumoniae RTI's are sparse and derived exclusively from comparative studies. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence about the efficacy of antibiotics for M. pneumoniae lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children. Due to side effects associated with the use of tetracyclines and quinolones in children, only macrolides can be used to treat M. pneumoniae infections in young patients. The general applicability of macrolides, however, is currently threatened by the worldwide increase in macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains. Finally, limited evidence is available that corticosteroids might have an additional benefit in the treatment of M. pneumoniae infections. In this review, the current issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of M. pneumoniae infections will be discussed.

### Things that could be Mycoplasma pneumoniae [^112EtwH9]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

M. pneumoniae infection gives rise to a wide variety of manifestations. The pathogenesis of secondary manifestations is not always known. Some depend on the direct invasion of M. pneumoniae and others on the indirect effect of M. pneumoniae through pathological immune responses, for instance autoreactive antibodies in Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Diagnosis remains challenging with currently available diagnostic tests, because they do not demonstrate a causal relation due to M. pneumoniae asymptomatic carriage or previous infection. The mainstay of treatment is macrolide antibiotics, but the role of additional immunomodulation therapy is unclear. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of the different manifestations should guide strategies for diagnosis and treatment.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^115YE7k6]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Infection — although organisms such as Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, chlamydia, Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus have been identified more frequently in women with sporadic miscarriages, there are no convincing data that infections cause RPL; therefore there are no clear indications for routine testing for these organisms in the RPL evaluation, and given the lack of prospective studies linking any infectious agent to recurrent early pregnancy loss, any use of antibiotics is not supported by the evidence.

### Atypical pathogens and respiratory tract infections [^112KT3ri]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The atypical respiratory pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila are now recognised as a significant cause of acute respiratory-tract infections, implicated in community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, and less frequently, upper respiratory-tract infections. Chronic infection with C. pneumoniae is common among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may also play a role in the natural history of asthma, including exacerbations. The lack of a gold standard for diagnosis of these pathogens still handicaps the current understanding of their true prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory infections. While molecular diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, offer improvements in sensitivity, specificity and rapidity over culture and serology, the need remains for a consistent and reproducible diagnostic technique, available to all microbiology laboratories. Current treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia recognise the importance of atypical respiratory pathogens in its aetiology, for which macrolides are considered suitable first-line agents. The value of atypical coverage in antibiotic therapy for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and exacerbations of asthma is less clear, while there is no evidence to suggest that atypical pathogens should be covered in antibiotic treatment of upper respiratory-tract infections.

### A diagnostic host-specific transcriptome response for Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia to guide pediatric patient treatment [^112b8rm9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia in children and young adults. Its lack of a cell wall makes it resistant to beta-lactams, which are the first-line treatment for typical pneumonia. Current diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have low specificity, leading clinicians to administer empirical antibiotics. Using a LASSO regression simulation approach and blood microarray data from 107 children with pneumonia (including 30 M. pneumoniae) we identify eight different transcriptomic signatures, ranging from 3–10 transcripts, that differentiate mycoplasma pneumonia from other bacterial/viral pneumonias with high accuracy (AUC: 0.84–0.95). Additionally, we demonstrate that existing signatures for broadly distinguishing viral/bacterial infections and viral/bacterial pneumonias are ineffective in distinguishing M. pneumoniae from viral pneumonia. The new signatures are successfully validated in an independent RNAseq cohort of children with pneumonia, demonstrating their robustness. The high sensibility of these signatures presents a valuable opportunity to guide the treatment and management of M. pneumoniae pneumonia patients.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men [^116dBvGy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasmagenitalium is one of the major causes of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) worldwide but an uncommon sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the general population. The risk of sexual transmission is probably lower than for Chlamydia trachomatis. Infection in men is usually asymptomatic and it is likely that most men resolve infection without developing disease. The incubation period for NGU caused by Mycoplasma genitalium is probably longer than for NGU caused by C. trachomatis. The clinical characteristics of symptomatic NGU have not been shown to identify the pathogen specific etiology. Effective treatment of men and their sexual partner(s) is complicated as macrolide antimicrobial resistance is now common in many countries, conceivably due to the widespread use of azithromycin 1 g to treat STIs and the limited availability of diagnostic tests for M. genitalium. Improved outcomes in men with NGU and better antimicrobial stewardship are likely to arise from the introduction of diagnostic M. genitalium nucleic acid amplification testing including antimicrobial resistance testing in men with symptoms of NGU as well as in their current sexual partner(s). The cost effectiveness of these approaches needs further evaluation. The evidence that M. genitalium causes epididymo-orchitis, proctitis, and reactive arthritis and facilitates human immunodeficiency virus transmission in men is weak, although biologically plausible. In the absence of randomized controlled trials demonstrating cost effectiveness, screening of asymptomatic men cannot be recommended.

### Efficacy of glucocorticoids for the treatment of macrolide refractory Mycoplasma pneumonia in children: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114CX87G]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The estimated mean effect of glucocorticoid add-on treatment on hospital days, fever duration, and change in C-reactive protein (CRP) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted or calculated for the 24 studies included in the meta-analysis with Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom). Random-effects model was used for studies included in the analysis.

Heterogeneity was calculated using I² statistic. The I² statistic threshold should always be interpreted with care. A rough estimate of 25% denotes low heterogeneity while 50% denotes moderate heterogeneity, and 75% denotes high heterogeneity. We conducted sensitivity analyses when heterogeneity was noted. This was performed by removing a study from the analysis to determine changes in I² values and assess which studies play a significant role resulting in heterogeneity. To assess the risk of publication bias, we used funnel plots for visual inspection, and Egger test and trim-and-fill method were performed for statistical identifying. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.3) and Review Manager 5.3.

### Macrolide-resistant in children: emphasis on the United States [^111JyMXR]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies regarding infections caused by macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been reported in the last years in the United States, where the prevalence is approximately 10% but may range from 3% to even 80%. Macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae may be associated with prolonged fever, hospital stay, and complications. Suspicion should be raised by non-response to macrolides, and detection can be achieved through routine reflexive testing of M. pneumoniae -positive specimens with a polymerase-chain reaction assay that rapidly predicts macrolide resistance. After timely initiation of an alternative antibiotic, prompt resolution of the disease is likely in most cases. This review summarizes current US data, offers some suggestions, and identifies knowledge gaps on this infection.

### Resurgence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children: emerging challenges and opportunities [^116Ce4fD]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The 2023–2024 resurgence of M. pneumoniae followed the lifting of COVID-19 NPIs and has provided valuable insights in M. pneumoniae epidemiology. Studies on disease severity yielded mixed results, without showing strong evidence that M. pneumoniae infections generally were more severe compared to previous upsurges. The delayed resurgence compared to other respiratory pathogens may be due to a combination of factors such as viral interactions, bacterial carriage dynamics, and most likely to intrinsic characteristics of M. pneumoniae, including its slow generation time. Challenges in diagnosing M. pneumoniae persist due to carriage and limitations in current diagnostic tools. Treatment remains complicated by macrolide resistance, particularly in East Asia, though tetracyclines and quinolones are emerging as useful alternatives for children.

Many challenges remain, in particular the urgent need for improved diagnostic tests that can identify patients with M. pneumoniae infection that would benefit from antibiotic treatment and predict disease severity. Furthermore, more studies are needed to define the exact role of immunomodulatory treatment, and it in what subset of patients might benefit from these interventions. International collaboration during the 2023–2024 resurgence has proven to be pivotal in advancing our understanding of M. pneumoniae infection in children. To address the remaining challenges, the scientific community again needs to join efforts to answer these critical questions and improve the health of children with M. pneumoniae infection.

Study selection

Two reviewers (H.S.K. and I.S.S.) independently screened titles and abstracts of the studies identified in our systematic search. Studies focusing on MRMP were included after review of abstracts. Full texts from included studies were reviewed to evaluate for eligibility. Reference lists of selected studies and previous reviews were also examined to determine any relevant publications overlooked by the electronic search. Disagreements between the two reviewers in the selection of particular studies were settled after discussion with a third reviewer (Y.J.L.).

Risk of bias assessment

Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool was used by the two reviewers (H.S.K. and I.S.S.) who independently evaluated the risk of bias in included studies. Risk of bias was determined as hi, low or unclear by evaluating random sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Disagreements between the two reviewers regarding the risk of bias assessment of particular studies were settled after discussion with a third reviewer (Y.J.L.).

Data extraction

Two reviewers (H.S.K. and I.S.S.) used a structured form to extract data from each eligible study. Data extracted from each study could be characterized as characteristics of the sample, intervention details, and measurement of outcomes. Disagreements between the two reviewers regarding the data extraction of particular studies were settled by consultation with a third reviewer (Y.J.L.). Primary outcomes of the current study were hospital days, fever duration, and change in CRP.

### Treatment of Mycoplasma pneumonia: a systematic review [^117LUVay]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Children with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection (CA-LRTI) commonly receive antibiotics for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The objective was to evaluate the effect of treating M. pneumoniae in children with CA-LRTI.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliography review. A search was conducted by using Medical Subject Headings terms related to CA-LRTI and M. pneumoniae and was not restricted by language. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of children #17 years old with confirmed M. pneumoniae and a diagnosis of CA-LRTI; each must have also compared treatment regimens with and without spectrum of activity against M. pneumoniae. Data extraction and quality assessment were completed independently by multiple reviewers before arriving at a consensus. Data were pooled using a random effects model.

Results

Sixteen articles detailing 17 studies were included. The most commonly selected primary outcome was symptomatic improvement. Nine studies examined M. pneumoniae treatment in CA-LRTI secondary to M. pneumoniae, and 5 RCTs met criteria for meta-analysis. The suggested pooled risk difference of 0.12 (95% confidence interval, 20.04 to 0.20) favoring treatment was not significantly different and demonstrated significant heterogeneity. Limitations included substantial bias and subjective outcomes within the individual studies, difficulty interpreting testing modalities, and the inability to correct for mixed infections or timing of intervention.

Conclusions

We identified insufficient evidence to support or refute treatment of M. pneumoniae in CA-LRTI. These data highlight the need for well-designed, prospective RCTs assessing the effect of treating M. pneumoniae in CA-LRTI.
