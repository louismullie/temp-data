## Question

What are the first-line treatments for metastatic breast cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended first-line treatments for metastatic breast cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the foundational principle that metastatic disease is treated primarily with systemic therapy rather than surgery. Then, I should verify the critical role of biomarker testing, including repeat receptor status and PD-L1 in triple-negative disease. Next, I will categorize by HR/HER2 status to select first-line systemic regimens. After that, I need to check the approach to the intact primary tumor and local therapy, and how to integrate local control when appropriate. Finally, I should consider special scenarios such as visceral crisis, oligometastatic disease, and survivorship monitoring principles, while continuously cross-checking guideline categories and strength of recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle before getting lost in subtype specifics: metastatic breast cancer is a systemic disease, so systemic therapy is the foundation and local therapy is reserved for selected indications rather than as first-line management of the primary tumor, with all NCCN recommendations in this domain generally categorized as 2A unless otherwise noted, which supports broad applicability with expert consensus despite variable evidence levels [^114BXDJh] [^1167Gvph] [^115sUF3C].

> Wait, let me verify biomarker testing details because receptor discordance can misguide therapy; NCCN recommends repeating ER, PR, and HER2 on metastatic tissue when available, and I initially thought discordance was rare, but I should correct that — discordance rates are clinically meaningful, ranging from roughly 3–60% for ER shifts and about 0.7–11% for HER2, which is exactly why re-testing is advised to ensure the first-line systemic choice matches current biology, especially if prior results were negative or unknown and the clinical course suggests hormone responsiveness [^116oH6T3].

> For HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic disease, I should confirm the default first-line strategy; hold on, I need to ensure we are not conflating endocrine-sensitive and endocrine-resistant settings — NCCN and ASCO align that in the absence of visceral crisis or proven endocrine resistance, endocrine therapy is preferred over chemotherapy, and the preferred first-line is an aromatase inhibitor combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, which carries a category 1 designation for defined postmenopausal and appropriately ovarian-suppressed premenopausal patients, reflecting strong evidence and consensus [^114Y44rN] [^1172evhv] [^112DCD4x].

> Let me consider sequencing if CDK4/6 therapy is contraindicated or not accessible; in that case, endocrine monotherapy remains acceptable, but I should double-check the timing relative to prior adjuvant endocrine exposure — if progression occurred during or within 12 months of adjuvant endocrine therapy, a different endocrine backbone and/or targeted partner is advised, and in truly endocrine-resistant or visceral-crisis presentations, chemotherapy becomes appropriate with careful attention to patient preferences and performance status [^114Y44rN] [^116TzkDY].

> Next, I will examine HER2-positive disease; the first-line standard is dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus a taxane unless taxanes are contraindicated, which ASCO explicitly recommends as a strong, evidence-based approach with high-quality data supporting improved outcomes, and I should confirm that endocrine therapy alone is generally insufficient here except in narrowly selected HR+/HER2+ cases after multidisciplinary discussion [^116oFper] [^115SQjN5] [^114aXAVx].

> Hold on, I should verify how we integrate HR positivity when both HR and HER2 are positive; NCCN allows that in select HR+/HER2+ patients, endocrine therapy alone may be considered, but that is the exception, and for most, HER2-targeted combination therapy remains the backbone with endocrine therapy layered or sequenced based on clinical context and patient preference, which reinforces that dual HER2 inhibition plus chemotherapy is the prevailing first-line norm [^111pW7uU] [^114aXAVx].

> For triple-negative metastatic disease, I need to ensure PD-L1 status is checked using the 22C3 assay with CPS scoring because it guides first-line immunotherapy; if PD-L1 is positive, first-line pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy improves survival and is recommended by SITC and aligned with regulatory approvals, whereas if PD-L1 is negative or testing is not available, chemotherapy remains the mainstay and sequential single agents are generally preferred in the absence of rapid progression or visceral crisis [^1151NHPo] [^114fGLcp] [^116XnmYg].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with an intact primary tumor; I should clarify that surgery of the primary is not standard first-line in de novo stage IV disease, and prospective data, including JCOG1017/PRIM-BC, have not demonstrated a survival advantage for primary tumor resection after systemic therapy, though local control benefits may exist, so local therapy is individualized for palliation, symptom control, or impending complications, and should be timed after initial systemic control and discussed in a multidisciplinary setting [^114BXDJh] [^1125Q48N].

> Let me reconsider oligometastatic disease, because I almost implied curative intent broadly; the literature suggests a small subset with limited metastases may benefit from aggressive multidisciplinary therapy including surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy, but high-quality randomized evidence is limited and NCCN notes that ablative metastasis-directed RT has not yet proven to extend overall survival, so such approaches should be considered within trials or highly selected contexts with careful staging and follow-up plans [^1168bAkc] [^113HtExX].

> I should confirm how to monitor response and define progression; NCCN emphasizes integrating symptoms, exam, labs, and imaging using consistent modalities over time, applying RECIST or WHO principles, and reassessing value, toxicity, performance status, and patient preferences at each step, which is crucial because treatment is continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity and then transitioned to alternative systemic therapy or supportive care as appropriate [^1175EqpG] [^116LgtF4] [^116Xke3w].

> Finally, I need to ensure survivorship and supportive care are embedded early; early palliative care involvement, management of treatment-related toxicities, psychosocial support, and advance care planning are recommended, and I should double-check that this includes attention to cardiac monitoring with anthracyclines or HER2-targeted agents, lifestyle counseling, and structured symptom surveillance to maintain quality of life throughout multiple lines of therapy [^116qkmHh] [^1175EqpG].

First-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is **systemic therapy tailored to HR/HER2 status** [^114h6bmG] and **visceral crisis** [^116TzkDY], with endocrine therapy preferred for HR+/HER2− disease [^112DCD4x] and chemotherapy for triple-negative or symptomatic disease [^116Xke3w]. Local therapy is reserved for palliation or complications [^114BXDJh], and **biomarker testing** [^116oH6T3] and **shared decision-making** [^1175EqpG] are essential.

---

## Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) disease

- **Endocrine therapy**: Preferred first-line for most patients without visceral crisis [^112DCD4x]; options include aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant, or tamoxifen [^1172evhv].

- **CDK4/6 inhibitors**: Combined with endocrine therapy (e.g. palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) [^1172evhv] for improved progression-free survival [^notfound].

- **Ovarian suppression**: For premenopausal patients [^114Y44rN].

- **Chemotherapy**: Consider for visceral crisis or endocrine resistance [^116XnmYg].

---

## HER2-positive disease

- **Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane**: Standard first-line regimen [^116oFper] [^115SQjN5].

- **Endocrine therapy**: Consider with HER2-targeted therapy for HR+/HER2+ disease [^111pW7uU].

- **Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)**: For progression after trastuzumab-based therapy [^notfound].

---

## Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)

- **Chemotherapy**: Backbone of first-line therapy (e.g. taxanes, anthracyclines, platinum agents) [^notfound].

- **Immunotherapy**: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for PD-L1–positive tumors [^1151NHPo].

- **Platinum agents**: Consider for BRCA1/2-mutated tumors [^notfound].

---

## Local therapy considerations

Local therapy (surgery or radiation) is reserved for **palliation** [^114BXDJh] or impending complications, and routine resection of the primary tumor is not recommended [^115J1sgg].

---

## Biomarker testing and monitoring

Biomarker testing should include **repeat ER/PR and HER2 testing** [^116oH6T3] on metastatic tissue due to potential discordance, and **monitoring** should assess symptoms, labs, and imaging to guide therapy adjustments [^1175EqpG].

---

## Patient-specific factors

Patient-specific factors should guide therapy selection, including **age, comorbidities, performance status, and preferences** [^116Xke3w]. Shared decision-making ensures alignment with patient goals and tolerance [^116Xke3w].

---

First-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is **systemic therapy tailored to HR/HER2 status** [^114h6bmG] and **visceral crisis**, with endocrine therapy for HR+/HER2− disease [^112DCD4x], chemotherapy for triple-negative or symptomatic disease [^116Xke3w], and HER2-targeted therapy for HER2+ disease [^116oFper]. Local therapy is reserved for palliation or complications [^114BXDJh], and biomarker testing [^116oH6T3] and shared decision-making are essential [^1175EqpG].

Management of the intact primary tumor in women presenting with stage IV breast cancer has classically been determined by the presence or absence of symptoms. However, multiple retrospective reviews completed over the past decade suggest a survival advantage with resection of the intact, asymptomatic primary tumor in these women. These reviews are not without bias, and recently completed randomized trials do not support a significant survival benefit, although local control benefits may exist. Completion of ongoing trials is needed to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the merit of primary tumor resection for local control and survival. Until unbiased data are available, local therapy for the asymptomatic primary cannot be routinely recommended, but may be considered in selected individuals, with multidisciplinary input, when systemic disease is well controlled.

### Surgical management of de novo stage IV breast cancer [^11372uzB]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The natural history of stage IV breast cancer is changing, with diagnosis when the disease burden is lower and better drugs translating into longer survival. Nevertheless, a small but constant fraction of women present with de novo stage IV disease and an intact primary tumor. The management of the primary site in this setting has classically been determined by the presence of symptoms, but this approach has been questioned based on multiple retrospective reviews reported over the past decade that suggested a survival advantage for women whose intact primary tumor is resected. These reviews are necessarily biased, as younger women with lower disease burden and more favorable biological features were offered surgery, but they led to several randomized trials to test the value of local therapy for the primary tumor in the face of distant disease. Preliminary results from 2 of these do not support a significant survival benefit, although local control benefits may exist. Completion of ongoing trials is needed to reach a definitive conclusion regarding the merit of primary tumor resection for local control and survival. Until unbiased data are available, local therapy for asymptomatic primary tumors cannot be recommended in the expectation of a survival benefit.

Systemic therapy for stage IV or recurrent metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer — endocrine therapy sequencing is outlined as follows: Patients with stage IV or recurrent disease characterized by HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors with no visceral crisis are treated with endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy in combination with targeted agents, and patients whose disease progresses after a year from the end of adjuvant endocrine-based therapy and those who present with de novo stage IV/metastatic breast cancer are eligible for first-line endocrine therapies. Patients whose disease responds to an endocrine-based therapy should receive additional endocrine therapy at disease progression, and for disease progression on or within 12 months of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy or for disease progression on first-line endocrine therapy for metastatic disease, patients are eligible for second-line endocrine therapy either as monotherapy or in combination with a targeted agent; the optimal sequence for endocrine therapy is not well defined and the choice would depend on previous tolerance of treatment and patient preference. The NCCN Panel recommends that patients with HR-positive disease should have adequate ovarian suppression/ablation and then be treated in the same way as postmenopausal patients.

### Operative management in stage IV breast cancer [^112tQJRP]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, surgical therapy for primary breast lesions in stage IV breast cancer has been reserved for palliation. Several retrospective studies have suggested a possible survival benefit with surgical resection of the primary tumor in patients with distant metastases. However, evidence from prospective, randomized controlled trials suggest that locoregional control provides no clear survival advantage for patients with stage IV breast cancer. Future areas of inquiry include identification of subsets of patients who may derive a survival benefit from locoregional control.

### Role of operative management in stage IV Breast cancer [^116BExPj]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The role of operative therapy in stage IV breast cancer continues to evolve with advances in therapy and improvements in survival among this population. Traditionally surgery was performed with palliative intent to alleviate symptoms related to the intact breast primary. Several retrospective studies have challenged this paradigm, demonstrating survival advantage with surgery in de novo metastatic disease. Prospective studies are ongoing and maturing data. A comprehensive approach to local therapy following systemic therapy may be beneficial to achieve improved survival outcome associated with stage IV- no evidence of disease and to decrease local failure in inflammatory breast cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteria stage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^116MpEys]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Women newly diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer have an early-stage disease that can be effectively treated. Evidence provides little justification for performing imaging to exclude metastasis in asymptomatic women with stage I breast cancer. No differences have been found in survival or quality of life in women regardless of whether they underwent initial workup for metastatic disease. These women generally prefer intensive follow-up to detect an early recurrence. However, survival rates do not differ between women who obtain intensive screening and surveillance, with imaging and laboratory studies, and women who undergo testing only as a result of development of symptoms or findings on clinical examinations. In addition, quality of life is similar for women who undergo intensive surveillance compared with those who do not. American Society of Clinical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that annual mammography is the only imaging examination that should be performed to detect a localized breast recurrence in asymptomatic patients. Additional imaging may be needed if the patient has locoregional symptoms. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review by the panel include extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. When evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® stage I breast cancer: initial workup and surveillance for local recurrence and distant metastases in asymptomatic women [^114CxG2b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

As the proportion of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer increases, the role of imaging for staging and surveillance purposes is considered. National and international guidelines discourage the use of staging imaging for asymptomatic patients newly diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast cancer, even if there is nodal involvement, as unnecessary imaging can delay care and affect outcomes. In asymptomatic patients with a history of stage I breast cancer that received treatment for curative intent, there is no role for imaging to screen for distant recurrences. However, routine surveillance with an annual mammogram is the only imaging test that should be performed to detect an in-breast recurrence or a new primary breast cancer in women with a history of stage I breast cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Alternative therapy used as primary treatment for breast cancer negatively impacts outcomes [^111tvHuw]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has escalated over the past decade, despite the fact that clinical studies validating the efficacy of CAM remain sparse. Clinicians frequently encounter patients who reject standard treatment, but data on outcomes of patients choosing CAM as primary treatment for breast cancer are also lacking.

Materials and Methods

Breast cancer patients who refused/delayed standard treatments in favor of alternative therapies were identified in a community surgical practice over a 10-year period. A retrospective chart review was performed with telephone interviews when possible. Estimated 10-year survival given recommended treatment was calculated.

Results

A total of 61 patients was identified; median age was 53. Median follow-up was 54 months. Patients were stratified into 2 subgroups: those who omitted/delayed surgery (SSG, n = 26) and those who were nonadherent to adjuvant therapy recommendations (ASG, n = 35). In the SSG, 96.2% experienced disease progression; 50% died of disease. Mean stage at initial presentation was II; mean stage at re-presentation after primary treatment with alternative therapies was IV. Disease progression occurred in 86.2% of those in the ASG; 20% died of disease. The mean 10-year survival calculated for those omitting surgery was 69.5%; observed survival for this group was 36.4% at a median follow-up of 33 months.

Conclusions

Alternative therapies used as primary treatment for breast cancer are associated with disease progression and increased risk of recurrence and death. Diminished outcomes are more profound in those delaying/omitting surgery. Reviewing these results with our patients may help bridge the gap between CAM and standard treatments.

### International guidelines for management of metastatic breast cancer: can metastatic breast cancer be cured? [^1168bAkc]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is a heterogeneous disease that has a variety of different clinical scenarios, ranging from solitary metastatic lesions to diffuse and multiple organ involvement. Overall, survival of patients with MBC is slowly but steadily improving — the risk of death is decreasing by 1%–2% each year. The greatest improvement is most probably related to the development and widespread availability of modern systemic therapies. In addition, modern diagnostic tools allow the detection of early metastatic disease, which may be more responsive to treatment than late metastatic disease. However, earlier diagnosis of metastatic disease may also result in a lead time bias, falsely increasing the survival times of these patients.

A distinctive subset of MBC patients who are most likely to gain substantial benefit from an intensified multidisciplinary therapeutic approach is represented by "oligometastatic" disease, which is characterized by solitary or few detectable metastatic lesions that are usually limited to a single organ. This population of "potentially curable" stage IV disease is estimated to be 1%–10% of newly diagnosed MBC patients. The existing guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO] Clinical Recommendations) list surgery, radiation, and regional chemotherapy as possible therapeutic options in patients with localized metastatic disease.

The European School of Oncology–Metastatic Breast Cancer (ESO–MBC) Task Force addressed the management of these patients in its first consensus recommendations, stating: "A small but very important subset of MBC patients, for example those with a solitary metastatic lesion, can achieve complete remission and a long survival. A more aggressive and multidisciplinary approach should be considered for these selected patients. A clinical trial addressing this specific situation is needed".

At the European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC)-6, held in Berlin in March of 2008, the second public session on MBC guidelines addressed the controversial issue: "Can metastatic breast cancer be cured?" Historically, such an approach was not considered worthwhile because most patients' disease subsequently recurred because of undetected additional microscopic metastatic foci. The promising results of recent series of MBC patients undergoing "curative" surgery or radiotherapy both for primary tumor and distant metastases and the long-term survival achieved with modern systemic therapies raised justified interest and renewed the discussion on this complex topic. However, the value of such strategies has not been tested in prospective randomized trials and is not well recognized. In this commentary, the available data supporting the local (surgery and radiotherapy) and chemotherapy options, possibly associated with cure in MBC, are presented and discussed in detail.

### Time to treatment: measuring quality breast cancer care [^115h5Jvp]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To optimize breast cancer care, several organizations have crafted guidelines to define best practices for treating breast cancer. In addition to recommended therapies, 'timeliness of treatment' has been proposed as a quality metric. Our study evaluates time to surgical treatment and its effect on overall survival (OS).

Methods

The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was used to identify women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2004 and 2012. Time from diagnosis to surgical treatment was calculated and grouped according to predetermined time intervals. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess patient and treatment factors related to OS.

Results

Overall, 420,792 patients initially treated with surgery were identified. Increased time to surgical treatment > 12 weeks was associated with decreased OS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.20]. When stratified by pathologic stage, stage I patients treated at 8 to < 12 weeks (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02–1.13) and > 12 weeks (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11–1.28), as well as stage II patients treated at > 12 weeks (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08–1.25), had decreased OS compared with patients treated at < 4 weeks. Other variables associated with decreased survival were treatment at a community cancer program, Medicaid or Medicare insurance, Black race, increasing age, mastectomy, moderately and poorly differentiated tumor grade, increasing T and N stage, and higher Charlson Index Group.

Conclusion

The survival benefit of expedited time to initial surgical treatment varies by stage and appears to have the greatest impact in early-stage disease. Prior to establishing standard metrics, further quantification of the impact on patient outcomes is needed.

### Breast cancer treatment [^115XmyqC]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, and the second most common cause of death from cancer in women in the United States. Risk assessment tools can identify the risk of breast cancer, and patients at high risk may be candidates for risk-reducing medications. The choice of medication varies with menopausal status. Breast cancer treatment depends on the stage. Stage 0 is ductal carcinoma in situ, which is noninvasive but progresses to invasive cancer in up to 40% of patients. Ductal carcinoma in situ is treated with lumpectomy and radiation or with mastectomy. If ductal carcinoma in situ is estrogen receptor-positive, patients may also receive endocrine therapy. Early invasive stages (I, IIa, IIb) and locally advanced stages (IIIa, IIIb, IIIc) are nonmetastatic and have three treatment phases. The preoperative phase uses systemic endocrine or immunotherapies when tumors express estrogen, progesterone, or ERBB2 receptors. Preoperative chemotherapy may also be used and is the only option when tumors have none of those three receptors. There are two options for the surgical phase with similar survival rates; a lumpectomy with radiation if the tumor can be excised completely with good cosmetic results, or a mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is also performed when there is suspected nodal disease. The postoperative phase includes radiation, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women should also be offered postoperative bisphosphonates. Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Treatment goals include improving the length and quality of life.

### Primary tumour resection plus systemic therapy versus systemic therapy alone in metastatic breast cancer (JCOG1017, PRIM-BC): a randomised clinical trial [^1125Q48N]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

De novo stage IV breast cancer accounts for approximately 6% of all newly diagnosed breast cancer cases. Standard treatment includes chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and/or radiation therapy. Primary tumour resection (PTR) is not considered a curative treatment but is sometimes performed to prevent uncontrolled chest wall disease. Some retrospective studies have suggested that PTR may improve survival in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer. However, these studies have limitations, such as patient selection bias, differences in the timing of surgery, and variations in systemic therapy. Several prospective studies have investigated this question, but their results remain controversial. It is still unclear whether PTR improves survival for any patients or whether there might be a specific subgroup that could benefit. Furthermore, there is ongoing debate about the best timing for PTR and the most effective use of systemic therapy before and after surgery. On the other hand, for patients with only a few metastatic lesions (oligometastasis), there is growing interest in an aggressive treatment approach that includes both PTR and local treatment for metastatic sites. This strategy is being actively studied in clinical trials worldwide, as it may lead to improved survival outcomes.

This trial was conducted to assess the impact of PTR after initial systemic therapy on overall survival compared to systemic therapy alone in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer. Because patients with cancers that do not respond well to initial systemic therapy have a high risk of tumour progression during the perioperative period, only those who responded to systemic therapy were included in the randomisation.

### Strategies for the management of early-stage breast cancer in older women [^115Ef7Xv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Older patients with breast cancer (aged ≥ 65 years) are often undertreated with both locoregional and systemic therapies and have been shown to have higher breast cancer-specific mortality. These patients are also excluded from most clinical trials; therefore, treatment recommendations are extrapolated from younger populations. The data that do exist, however, show that older patients usually tolerate and respond well to conventional treatments. When selecting treatments for breast cancer, age should not be the chief consideration; comorbidities and functional status are also important, as is life expectancy. For patients with an estimated survival of less than 5 years, aggressive treatment may be discouraged; however, if the estimated survival is 5 years or more, treatment according to recurrence risk is recommended. In the curative setting, undertreatment should be avoided.

### Assessing breast cancer diagnosis and management in Ghana per the global breast cancer initiative key performance indicators [^116X8NRk]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The WHO's Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) described three key performance indicators (KPIs) to reduce breast cancer deaths worldwide. We assessed the management of breast cancer in Ghana against the GBCI KPIs to inform necessary steps for system-wide improvement.

Methods

We reviewed patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021 calendar year at Ghana's second largest tertiary hospital. Relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records to determine the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis, duration to confirm diagnosis from initial presentation, and proportion of patients completing recommended treatment without abandonment. Data were presented as descriptive statistics and compared with GBCI KPI benchmarks.

Results

Of 319 patients undergoing biopsy of suspicious breast lesions, 243 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Most (98.7%) were female, with a median age of 49 years and median symptom duration of 24 weeks. Diagnosis was confirmed for all patients within 31 days of initial presentation. Only 22 of 214 patients (10.3%) undergoing staging were diagnosed as early breast cancer (stage I or II), 50% at stage III, and 39.3% at stage IV. Forty-five of 139 patients (32.4%) initiating recommended treatment completed without abandonment, and 45 of 243 patients (18.5%) with a confirmed breast cancer completed recommended treatment without abandonment.

Conclusion

Ghana met the GBCI KPI for timely diagnosis (< 60 days of presentation) but fell short in early detection (≥ 60% early breast cancer) and treatment completion without abandonment (> 80%). Our findings provide baseline data for planning system-wide improvements toward the GBCI's goal of reducing breast cancer mortality by 2.5% annually.

Principles of survivorship for those living with advanced or metastatic breast cancer — Patients should receive multidisciplinary and interprofessional care that seeks to prevent and manage morbidities associated with breast cancer or its treatment. Encourage patients to promptly report any new or worsening symptoms. A comprehensive evaluation is essential, as these symptoms could indicate disease progression, treatment effects, or other unrelated medical issues. Address all treatment options at each progression, including the option of supportive care alone or hospice care, as appropriate in patients with stage IV disease. Early involvement of a palliative care team should be considered to provide advance care planning, goals of care discussions, care transitions, psychosocial support, and management of cancer and therapy-related symptoms. Lifestyle and psychosocial support include cardiac monitoring for patients treated with anthracyclines or HER2-targeted therapy, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a physically active lifestyle and a healthy diet whenever possible; consider age- and gender-appropriate cancer and preventive health screenings, individualized according to the patient prognosis. Screen for anxiety, fear of progression, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to cancer and its treatment. Treatment goals, survivorship issues, and the specific roles of each provider should be communicated to the patient, and living will/end-of-life planning should be discussed. For any patients with sexual health concerns or for fertility and birth control in premenopausal patients, see BINV-C. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Is breast cancer the same disease in Asian and Western countries? [^11711nTg]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment

Modified radical mastectomy was performed most frequently in the 1990s, but its use has decreased from 79.7% in 1996 to 54% in 2006. The use of breast-conserving therapy has been rapidly increasing, from 18.7% in 1996 to 42.6% in 2006. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been used with increasing frequency. The rate of reconstruction after mastectomy is 8.5%.

Survival

From 1993 to 2002, a total of 49,417 cases were analyzed, 46,355 of which were invasive cancer and 2,819 of which were noninvasive.

The 5-year survival rate for invasive breast cancer was 80.3%; 10-year survival was 70.3%. For DCIS, the 5-year survival rate was 99%. The increase in survival may be due to the increase of early breast cancer detection and better treatments. The 5-year survival rate for Korea is similar to that of Japan but lower than that of United States.

Sweden

Data collection and incidence estimates

Data on patients treated for breast cancer are gathered through the oncologic centers in six geographical regions and reported to the Swedish Cancer Register. Details regarding diagnosis, actual treatment details, and pathology and adjuvant treatment are available for each region. Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare is responsible for official statistics. Breast cancer in Sweden accounts for 30% of all female cancers, and 0.2% of all male cancers. The annual increase in breast cancer is 1.5% over a 20-year period and 1.6 for a 10-year period.

Screening and methods of detection

In Sweden, screening is offered to women between the ages of 40 and 74 where the regional county makes decisions on age groups 40–49 and 70–74. Screening compliance is approximately 65–80%, and is lower in urban areas and higher in rural areas. Self-examination or exams performed by healthcare workers is not recommended.

AJCC stage of initial presentation

In the Stockholm Gotland region in 2006, 1,524 new cases of breast cancer were registered. There were 1,385 cases of invasive carcinomas and 139 non invasive. Fifty-six percent of the invasive cancers were stage I, 37% stage II, 5% stage III, and 2% stage IV.

### Assessing the rate and quality of breast cancer treatment following initial diagnosis [^117FcQ9s]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Care guidelines recommend specific treatment pathways for early-stage breast cancer, but real-world adherence may vary due to institutional workflow and system-level limitations. This study examined rates of guideline-concordant care (GCC) at a single academic medical center over 5 years and evaluated differences by stage, patient demographics and time frame involving the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all women diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage 0-III breast cancer at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center between September 1, 2019, and September 1, 2024. GCC was defined according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as mastectomy alone, lumpectomy with radiation, or lumpectomy alone in patients ≥ 70. Demographic and clinical data were extracted, and rates of GCC were assessed by stage, race, insurance type, and for variance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results

Among 1455 patients diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer, 981 (67.4%) received some form of treatment, and 515 (35.4%) received GCC. Stage II patients had the lowest rate of GCC (28.7%). Rates of GCC remained stable before and after April 2020, though total diagnoses declined. Black patients had the highest rate of GCC (52.1%), while Asian/Pacific Islander patients had the lowest (21.9%). No clear relationship was observed between insurance type or ZIP code-based income and GCC receipt.

Conclusions

Most patients diagnosed with breast cancer received treatment, but fewer than half met criteria for GCC. Differences in GCC rate by stage and race suggest both institutional and patient-level barriers to standard care. System improvements aimed at strengthening coordination between diagnosis and treatment may help increase adherence to guideline-based breast cancer care.

### Impact of 18F-FDG PET, PET / CT, and PET / MRI on staging and management as an initial staging modality in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Wzvsu]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The use of 18 F-FDG PET, PET/CT, or PET/MRI substantially impacted clinical staging and management in newly diagnosed breast cancer. The pooled proportions of changes in staging and management were 25% and 18%, respectively. Intermodality and intention-to-treat changes constituted approximately 70% of the overall changes in treatment. Therefore, PET imaging may deserve routine clinical use for initial staging of breast cancer. Younger age and a higher proportion of patients with clinical stage III to IV and histologic grade II to III were significantly associated with a greater proportion of changes in stage or management after PET/CT.

### International guidelines for management of metastatic breast cancer: combination vs sequential single-agent chemotherapy [^116XnmYg]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2009). Low credibility.

Compared with treatment options for early-stage breast cancer, few data exist regarding the optimal use of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The choice of using a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapies vs sequential single agents is controversial. At the 6th European Breast Cancer Conference, the European School of Oncology Metastatic Breast Cancer Task Force convened an open debate on the relative benefits of combination vs sequential therapy. Based on the available data, the Task Force recommends sequential monotherapy as the preferred choice in advanced disease, in the absence of rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, or the need for rapid symptom and/or disease control. Patient- and disease-related factors should be used to choose between combination and sequential single-agent chemotherapy for MBC. Additional research is needed to determine the impact of therapy on patient-rated quality of life and to identify predictive factors that can be used to guide therapy.

### Cancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2025 [^116aNACw]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment and survival

The most common treatment among women with early stage (I or II) breast cancer is breast‐conserving surgery (BCS) with adjuvant radiotherapy (50%), although nearly one third of patients (32%) undergo mastectomy (Figure 5). By comparison, 61% of women with stage III breast cancer undergo mastectomy with or without radiotherapy, most of whom also receive chemotherapy. The most common treatment for metastatic disease (stage IV) is chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy (64%). Endocrine (hormonal) therapy is a cornerstone of treatment for hormone receptor‐positive breast cancers, with about four in five women (81%) with these tumors receiving it across all stages (Figure 6). However, the utilization is lower among Black women, with a more pronounced disparity observed in those with stage III disease (65% vs. 74% in White women). Lower initiation and adherence rates largely drive the underuse of endocrine therapy in Black women. For example, Black women were less likely to report full adherence to endocrine therapy 2 years after diagnosis (75% vs. 83% for White women; p < .001) and experienced more treatment‐related side effects.

METHODS

Decision Tree

We developed treatment decision trees for first-line chemotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy (ET), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy using TreeAgePro2018for Basic, Core, Enhanced, and Maximalservices outlined in the NCCN RSG. Basic and Core guidelines are based on stage, hormone receptor, and performance status, whereas Enhanced incorporates HER2, and Maximal includes multigene signatures and programmed death ligand-1 expression. We considered only first-course treatment (either adjuvant or metastatic) for each modality. We define need as medically indicated by the NCCN RSG.

NCCN recommendations are category-based, relating to the strength of evidence and consensus (Data Supplement). We modeled category 1 recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy and HER2 therapies, category 2A for metastatic chemotherapy, and category 1, 2A, and 2B for ET.

To determine the proportion of patients in each decision branch, we extracted data from SEER, or best available evidence in the absence of SEER data (Data Supplement). Because of a paucity of data in LMICs, we assume that histologic and patient characteristics and stage of distribution are the same in all income settings. The implications of a constant stage distribution are described and modeled elsewhere.

Each country was assigned a resource group based on World Bank Development Classification 2018income levels (Low-income [L] — Basic; Low-middle [LM] — Core; Upper-middle [UM] — Enhanced; High-income [H] — Maximal). We extracted BC incidence by country in 2018 and projected to 2040 based on linear population growth from Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN). We then multiplied each country-level incidence by the appropriate income-based RSG tree to estimate the need for treatment by country. We then pooled all country-level estimates to provide global need estimates.

Preferred Treatment Regimens

We extracted the preferred first-line chemotherapy, immunotherapy, HER2, and ET for each setting and resource level from NCCN RSG (Data Supplement). We assumed that single-agent chemotherapy for metastatic disease is preferred, and that recommended adjuvant and metastatic regimens are used with equal probability. We excluded NCCN recommended treatments not commonly used as a first-line therapy. We assume that if used, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are given for 5 years. We assume that the available treatment options do not change over time. A complete list of model assumptions is found in the Data Supplement.

### Matched pair analyses of stage IV breast cancer with or without resection of primary breast site [^114YFvW4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Reports demonstrate improved survival of stage IV breast cancer patients with primary cancer resection. This may result from selection for surgery, rather than biological processes.

Methods

We performed matched-pair analysis that minimized potential bias in selecting surgery for primary cancer. Chart review was also performed of 5-year survivors to assess selection bias affecting breast surgery.

Results

19,464 breast cancer patients were identified; 808 (4.2%) were stage IV: 622 were analyzed after eliminating wrong diagnoses or staging, and limiting patients to Massachusetts residents. Matched-pair analysis narrowed or eliminated apparent survival benefit associated with primary site surgery in several comparisons. When the impact of the sequence of systemic and surgical treatments was studied in stage IV patients, 90% 2-year survival occurred in patients receiving chemotherapy first, in contrast to receiving chemotherapy simultaneously with or after surgery, suggesting selection for delayed surgery after excellent response to initial chemotherapy. In bone metastases, the 2-year survival advantage occurred with chemotherapy before surgery; no difference in survival with or without surgery occurred when these treatments were simultaneous. Among 5-year survivors, frequency of primary site surgery after excellent response to systemic therapy, breast surgery in stage III patients incorrectly classified as stage IV, and frequency of oligo metastases all indicated selection bias.

Conclusions

Case selection bias in primary breast cancer resection in state IV patients may explain most, if not all, the apparent survival advantage of such surgery.

### International guidelines for management of metastatic breast cancer: can metastatic breast cancer be cured? [^111RLD6r]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The presented data, overall, seem to suggest the possibility of a curative, multidisciplinary therapeutic approach for at least a fraction of patients with limited MBC. Definitive evidence from controlled prospective randomized trials is missing; available data are coming essentially from retrospective series, most with relatively few patients enrolled.

Because patients who are potentially eligible for this therapeutic strategy represent only 1%–3% of the total MBC population, a large global collaboration is needed to confirm its impact on long-term survival or cure and to ensure adequate statistical power and strength of the results. Enrolled patients must have comparable clinical and biological characteristics, extent of staging, and frequency of monitoring to avoid selection biases and stage migration, which can substantially affect the outcome.

The clinical consequences of confirming this hypothesis would be considerable. First, it would suggest that a selected subset of MBC patients should be approached with curative, not palliative, intent. Second, the current minimalistic postoperative monitoring should be revised to allow early diagnosis of low-burden disease relapse. The crucial issue of follow-up and its consequences will be addressed in detail by the Task Force in a separate manuscript. As a consequence, a rigorous economic evaluation would also be required to calculate the cost to benefit ratio and the assessment of personal and social impact of this shift in the management of MBC patients.

New predictive markers of sensitivity to selected therapies and innovative evaluation criteria to assess long-term treatment efficacy will be the essential prerequisites to address the biological complexity and heterogeneity of MBC. The ultimate goal is to optimize the efficacy of individualized therapeutic strategies.

Very importantly, all available treatment options should be discussed with the individual patient with a clear explanation of the risk to benefit ratio. It is also important to recognize that the definition of "breast cancer survivor" has evolved and is subject to different interpretations. In the past, survivor was almost exclusively used to describe someone who was free of disease 5–10 years after diagnosis. More recently, it has become a dynamic concept that affirms the potential for quality living after a breast cancer diagnosis, therefore also including maximizing health and well-being if recurrence occurs and while living with metastatic disease.

Based on the available data, the ESO–MBC Task Force retains its original recommendation statement: "A small but very important subset of MBC patients, for example, those with a solitary metastatic lesion, can achieve complete remission and a long survival. A more aggressive and multidisciplinary approach should be considered for these selected patients. A clinical trial addressing this specific situation is needed".

### Impact of 18F-FDG PET, PET / CT, and PET / MRI on staging and management as an initial staging modality in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LaWKb]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of 18F-FDG PET, PET/CT, and PET/MRI on staging and management during the initial staging of breast cancer.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and KoreaMed databases until March 2020 to identify studies that reported the proportion of breast cancer patients whose clinical stage or management were changed after PET scans. The proportion of changes was pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup and metaregression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity.

Results

We included 29 studies (4276 patients). The pooled proportions of changes in stage and management were 25% (95% confidence interval, 21%-30%) and 18% (95% CI, 14%-23%), respectively. When stage changes were stratified according to initial stage, the pooled proportions were 11% (95% CI, 3%-22%) in stage I, 20% (95% CI, 16%-24%) in stage II, and 34% (95% CI, 27%-42%) in stage III. The relative proportions of intermodality and intention-to-treat changes were 74% and 70%, respectively. Using metaregression analyses, the mean age and the proportion of initial stage III to IV and histologic grade II to III were significant factors affecting the heterogeneity in changes in stage or management.

Conclusions

Currently available literature suggests that the use of 18F-FDG PET, PET/CT, or PET/MRI leads to significant modification of staging and treatment in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Therefore, there may be a role for routine clinical use of PET imaging for the initial staging of breast cancer.

Recurrent/Stage IV breast cancer — receptor testing and endocrine therapy: Determination of HR status (ER and PR) and HER2 status should be repeated in all cases when diagnostic tissue is obtained, because ER and PR assays may be falsely negative or falsely positive and discordance between the primary and metastatic tumors has been reported. The discordance rates are in the range of 3.4% to 60% for ER-negative to ER-positive; 7.2% to 31% for ER-positive to ER-negative; and 0.7% to 11% for HER2. The NCCN Panel recommends that re-testing the receptor status of recurrent disease be performed, especially in cases when it was previously unknown, originally negative, or not overexpressed, and for patients with clinical courses consistent with HR–positive breast cancer, or with prior positive HR results, a course of endocrine therapy is reasonable regardless of whether the receptor assay is repeated or the result of the most recent HR assay.

### Phase II trial of brain MRI surveillance in stage IV breast cancer [^112fwWZx]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening of asymptomatic stage IV breast cancer with brain MRIs is currently not recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines. The incidence of asymptomatic brain metastasis is not well documented.

Methods

The study is designed as a single arm, phase II trial, with the goal of investigating surveillance brain MRIs in neurologically asymptomatic patients with metastatic breast cancer. Breast cancer patients were classified into triple negative (TN), HER2+, and hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2-. Patients underwent a surveillance brain MRI and a second brain MRI at 6 months if the baseline MRI was negative. Asymptomatic, stage IV breast cancer patients, ECOG ≤ 2, and life expectancy ≥ 6 months were eligible. The primary objective was to determine the frequency of asymptomatic brain metastasis in metastatic breast cancer. Clinical trial information: NCT05115474.

Results

A total of 101 patients completed the surveillance brain MRI including 40 HR+/HER2-, 33 HER2+, and 28 TN patients. The overall frequency of brain metastasis on initial surveillance brain MRI was 14% (n = 14) with rates of 18%, 15%, and 10% in TN, HER2+, and HR+/HER2- patients, respectively. Following the 6-month MRI, the cumulative rates of brain metastasis increased to 25% in TN, 24% in HER2+, and 23% in HR+/HER2- patients.

Conclusions

The highest frequency of brain metastases at baseline was in TN and HER2+ breast cancer. Following the 6-month MRI, the cumulative frequency was approximately a quarter across all subtypes. These results warrant confirmatory trials to refine brain MRI surveillance recommendations for neurologically asymptomatic stage IV breast cancer.

### Time to treatment initiation for breast cancer during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic [^112agFYv]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Even before COVID-19, time from breast cancer diagnosis to treatment initiation had increased by approximately 10 days in the last decade. This potentially puts the 275,000 women who are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States every year at risk of inferior outcomes. Delays in treatment of breast cancer have been linked with increased mortality, such that each 60-day delay in surgery was shown to be associated with a 26% increased risk of death because of breast cancer among patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer. - This finding helped drive development of time-based quality metric and guideline recommendations for receipt of chemotherapy and radiation following early-stage breast cancer diagnosis.

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant pressures on healthcare system resources and treatment decisions at the provider and patient level. This has led to growing concern that delays in diagnosis and care will result in thousands of excess cancer deaths over the next several years. - As a result, several organizations have published consensus guidelines for management of breast cancer during the pandemic, aiming to preserve hospital resources for patients being treated for COVID-19 by deferring breast cancer treatments without significantly compromising the outcomes and quality of care for individuals with breast cancer.

Data regarding the impact of the pandemic on volume of patient with breast cancer, time to treatment initiation (TTI), stage at presentation, and treatment sequence are urgently needed. However, these are not readily available from national databases without substantial delay. To meet this need, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patients receiving care for newly diagnosed breast cancer at a large academic center via collection of current patient-level data. We hypothesized that TTI would be longer in the 2020 COVID-19 era compared with our 2018 comparator cohort.

### Second and subsequent lines of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: what did we learn in the last two decades? [^115VcUf8]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Despite almost 30 years of clinical cancer research, the true impact of second and subsequent lines of chemotherapy on the outcome of metastatic breast cancer patients, especially on the duration of survival, is still unknown. In the virtually incurable metastatic setting, issues like quality of life and patients' preferences gain particular relevance. At the turn of the century, in-depth rethinking of the design of clinical trials run in this challenging disease setting appears to be warranted.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^115NDa59]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer has historically been a disease for which immunotherapy was largely unavailable. Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has demonstrated efficacy, including longer progression-free survival and increased overall survival in subsets of patients. Based on clinical benefit in randomized trials, ICIs in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of some patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC have been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding options for patients. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the optimal chemotherapy backbone for immunotherapy, appropriate biomarker-based selection of patients for treatment, the optimal strategy for immunotherapy treatment in earlier stage disease, and potential use in histological subtypes other than TNBC. To provide guidance to the oncology community on these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG). The expert panel drew upon the published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of immunotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer, including diagnostic testing, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and patient quality of life (QOL) considerations. The evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations in this CPG are intended to give guidance to cancer care providers treating patients with breast cancer.

Breast Cancer Presentation by Stage for Selected Regions

Anatomic diagnosis is central to the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies at the individual patient level. Histopathologic evaluation assigns subtype and grade and identifies secondary prognostic features and molecular signals that predict prognosis and the choice of therapy for cancer. Pathology and laboratory medicine services face substantial implementation challenges in resource-constrained settings. Those include insufficient human capacity; inadequate infrastructure; inadequate consumables; inadequate education and training; and inadequate quality, standards, and accreditation. Therefore, recommendations on the basis of subtype identification should take into consideration the fact that accurate diagnostics might not be available in Basic settings and should help oncologists treat patients accordingly. The same limitations apply when considering surgical and radiation therapy services. However, there is extreme heterogeneity in access to these services in limited resource settings.

Different regions of the world, both among and within countries, have variable access to diagnosis and treatment of BC. In addition, patients' access to medicines may change quickly. Patients with MBC ideally require the care of specialists including medical oncologists who have extensive training. However, outside of specialized centers within High-HDI regions, there is a paucity of specialty training with few clinicians available to skillfully manage these patients. Some of the presumptions inherent in this guideline include that chemotherapy is not available in Basic settings (Table 4). As a result of these disparities, the ASCO Resource–Stratified Guideline Advisory Group chose MBC as a priority topic for guideline development.

Diagnosis, Staging, and Treatment Capacities by Setting

ASCO has established a process for the development of resource-stratified guidelines, which includes mixed methods of evidence-based guideline development, adaptation of the clinical practice guidelines of other organizations, and formal expert consensus. This article summarizes the results of that process and presents resource-stratified recommendations (see the Results section).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^1175EqpG]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Invasive Breast Cancer — principles of monitoring metastatic disease — monitoring of patient symptoms and cancer burden during treatment of metastatic breast cancer is important to determine whether the treatment is providing benefit and that the patient does not have toxicity from an ineffective therapy. Monitoring includes periodic assessment of varied combinations of symptoms, physical examination, routine laboratory tests, imaging studies, and blood biomarkers where appropriate, and results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease. Sometimes, this information may be contradictory, and clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Unequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, and progression of disease may be identified through evidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Institutional validation of breast cancer treatment guidelines [^117Nd768]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Several groups have developed clinical guidelines for the management of breast cancer, yet little data exist regarding their validation. Therefore, we examined the effect of published National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for invasive breast cancer on survival, quality of life (QOL), and hospital cost. From 260 consecutive breast cancer patients, 129 patients were identified for analysis: 93 patients (72%) were treated according to the guidelines (NCCN+), while the treatment of 36 patients (28%), with a similar stage distribution, deviated from the guidelines (NCCN-). Patients were excluded from analysis with a diagnosis of carcinoma in situ, inflammatory cancer, stage IV disease, and comorbid conditions that affected treatment. The 5-year survival was 87.6% for the NCCN+ patients versus 83.3% for NCCN- patients (P = 0.319 by Kaplan-Meier). Twelve QOL parameters were evaluated using a Likert-type scale (1 = severe and 5 = none). NCCN+ patients had a cumulative QOL score of 4.18 ± 0.08 versus 4.24 ± 0.14 for NCCN- patients (P = 0.745). Treatment-related costs were $20,300 ± 1800 for NCCN+ patients versus $59,700 ± 25,200 for NCCN- patients (P = 0.016 by t test). Although deviation from NCCN breast cancer guidelines had no effect on perceived quality of life or survival, there was a significant decrease in cost in the NCCN+ group. These findings suggest that adherence to NCCN guidelines can significantly reduce the cost of breast cancer care without adversely affecting either survival or quality of life.

### Survival in patients with HR + / HER2-metastatic breast cancer treated with initial endocrine therapy versus initial chemotherapy. A French population-based study [^1136xUYH]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, representing almost a quarter of all cancer cases in females in Europe and worldwideand causing > 12 thousand deaths in France in 2018.

Thanks to detection at an earlier stage and the development of better treatments over the past decades, survival has continued to improve in both non-metastaticand metastatic breast cancers (MBC), – which nonetheless remain incurable.

Treatment recommendations ought to be made on an individual basis and consider hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. Indeed, the luminal subtype (HR+/HER2−) represents about 70% of all breast cancers. Some studies have shown that, even though no difference was found between chemotherapy (CT) or endocrine therapy (ET) in terms of survival, ET is a better choice since it is less toxic. Some clinical trials showed good progression-free survival (PFS) for ET alone and an increase in PFS for ET in association with targeted therapies. – According to international guidelines, ET should be the preferred option in luminal MBC, even in the presence of visceral disease, unless there is a visceral crisis or proof of endocrine resistance. –

Despite these data, some recent studies have shown that guidelines are not always followed in daily practice and that medical practices vary considerably. – However, to date, none of these studies has been done using population-based data.

In this population-based study, which takes into account all of the women living in Cote d'Or (Côte d'Or Breast and Gynaecological Cancer Registry), we investigated the effect of the first-line treatment (ET or CT) on PFS and overall survival (OS) in luminal MBC patients.

All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated. NCCN categories of preference are defined as: Preferred intervention — interventions that are based on superior efficacy, safety, and evidence; and, when appropriate, affordability; Other recommended intervention — other interventions that may be somewhat less efficacious, more toxic, or based on less mature data; or significantly less affordable for similar outcomes; and Useful in certain circumstances — other interventions that may be used for selected patient populations (defined with recommendation). All recommendations are considered appropriate.

### First-line treatment options for patients with HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer: the impact of modern adjuvant chemotherapy [^1163ZtFU]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

The management of early breast cancer has evolved rapidly in recent years. Consequently, the range of first-line treatment options for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is becoming increasingly complicated and therapy depends on a complex interaction of tumor, patient, and physician variables. Arguably one of the most important factors determining choice of first-line chemotherapy is prior adjuvant therapy. We have reviewed data from large, randomized clinical trials to identify the most effective regimens and help clinicians to select first-line treatment based on previous adjuvant therapy. In this review we provide recommendations on the most appropriate first-line therapy according to the type of previous adjuvant therapy. With such a wide array of treatment options available, none is likely to become the gold-standard first-line treatment for MBC. Furthermore, as increasing emphasis is placed on the quality as well as the duration of survival after development of MBC, treatment decisions should take into account tumor characteristics, toxicity, convenience, potential impact on quality of life, and patient preference, in addition to robust efficacy data.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^116LgtF4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer — monitoring metastatic disease: Monitoring the treatment of metastatic breast cancer involves integrating several different forms of information to decide on treatment effectiveness and toxicity, including direct observations and patient-reported symptoms, performance status, change in weight, physical examination, laboratory tests (alkaline phosphatase, liver function, blood counts, calcium), radiographic and functional imaging, and tumor biomarkers; results are generally classified as response, continued response to treatment, stable disease, uncertainty regarding disease status, or progression of disease, and clinical judgment with patient input is critical. The NCCN Panel recommends using widely accepted criteria such as the RECIST criteria and the WHO criteria and recommends using the same method of response assessment over time; for example, an abnormality initially found on diagnostic CT scan of the chest should be monitored with repeat diagnostic CT scans of the chest. The optimal frequency of testing is uncertain and primarily based on monitoring strategies used in breast cancer clinical trials, and the Principles of Monitoring Metastatic Disease table outlines general recommendations for baseline assessments before new therapy, for monitoring cytotoxic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and for assessment when there is evidence of progression.

### Follow-up strategies for women treated for early breast cancer [^115W92xA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Follow-up examinations are commonly performed after primary treatment for women with breast cancer. They are used to detect recurrences at an early (asymptomatic) stage. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up for distant metastases on mortality, morbidity and quality of life in women treated for stage I, II or III breast cancer.

Search Methods

For this 2014 review update, we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (4 July 2014), MEDLINE (4 July 2014), Embase (4 July 2014), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (4 July 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov (4 July 2014). References from retrieved articles were also checked.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of different policies of follow-up after primary treatment were reviewed for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility for inclusion in the review and risk of bias. Data were pooled in an individual patient data meta-analysis for the two RCTs testing the effectiveness of different follow-up schemes. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, tumour size and lymph node status.

Main Results

Since 2000, one new trial has been published; the updated review now includes five RCTs involving 4023 women with breast cancer (clinical stage I, II or III). Two trials involving 2563 women compared follow-up based on clinical visits and mammography with a more intensive scheme including radiological and laboratory tests. After pooling the data, no significant differences in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.15, two studies, 2563 participants, high-quality evidence), or disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.00, two studies, 2563 participants, low-quality evidence) emerged. No differences in overall survival and disease-free survival emerged in subgroup analyses according to patient age, tumour size and lymph node status before primary treatment. In 1999, 10-year follow-up data became available for one trial of these trials, and no significant differences in overall survival were found. No difference was noted in quality of life measures (one study, 639 participants, high-quality evidence). The new included trial, together with a previously included trial involving 1264 women compared follow-up performed by a hospital-based specialist versus follow-up performed by general practitioners. No significant differences were noted in overall survival (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.78, one study, 968 participants, moderate-quality evidence), time to detection of recurrence (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.47, two studies, 1264 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and quality of life (one study, 356 participants, high-quality evidence). Patient satisfaction was greater among patients treated by general practitioners. One RCT involving 196 women compared regularly scheduled follow-up visits versus less frequent visits restricted to the time of mammography. No significant differences emerged in interim use of telephone and frequency of general practitioners's consultations.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review of RCTs conducted almost 20 years ago suggests that follow-up programs based on regular physical examinations and yearly mammography alone are as effective as more intensive approaches based on regular performance of laboratory and instrumental tests in terms of timeliness of recurrence detection, overall survival and quality of life. In two RCTs, follow-up care performed by trained and not trained general practitioners working in an organised practice setting had comparable effectiveness to that delivered by hospital-based specialists in terms of overall survival, recurrence detection, and quality of life.

Hormone therapy

Treatment with adjuvant tamoxifen is beneficial, despite its side effects, irrespective of the patients' age, if the tumour expresses oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). Tamoxifen should not be prescribed to women with tumours that do not express oestrogen receptors (standard, level of evidence: A). The optimal duration for adjuvant hormone therapy with tamoxifen is 5 years at a dose of 20 mg day −1 (standard, level of evidence: A). Patients treated with tamoxifen should have regular gynaecological clinical examinations (recommendation, expert agreement). Additional examinations are not necessary in the absence of symptoms.

Neoadjuvant treatment with antioestrogens can be used in elderly women with slowly evolving hormone-sensitive tumours (option, level of evidence: B1). This should be followed when possible by optimal locoregional treatment (option, expert agreement). At present, antioestrogens cannot be considered as standard neoadjuvant treatment for initially operable tumours.

Hormone therapy can be administered for different reasons, depending on the patients' age:
suppression of ovarian function in women with ovarian activity and/or as an antioestrogen,
antioestrogenic therapy in postmenopausal women.

In postmenopausal women, the combination of chemotherapy with an antioestrogen significantly improves progression-free survival and overall survival (standard, level of evidence: A). The ratio of efficacy (overall or recurrence-free survival) and risk (toxicity) should be considered when taking the decision to prescribe this combination. The efficacy/risk ratio favours treatment in women with major metastatic risk factors (recommendation, expert agreement).

Other hormone therapy (progestogens, aromatase inhibitors) should not be considered as adjuvant treatments except in the setting of a randomised clinical trial (standard).

### Breast cancer treatment in clinical practice compared to best evidence and practice guidelines [^111jrEXG]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

There is sparse evidence on community practice patterns in treating women with breast cancer. This study compared care of women with breast cancer with evidence from meta-analyses and US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines. Records of 4395 women with breast cancer were abstracted from practices of 19 surgeon oncologists in six specialty practices in the Philadelphia region during 1995–1999. Patients were followed through December 2001. Low-frequency data were obtained on all patients. All other data were from a random sample of 464 women, minimum of 50 patients per practice. Actual care provided was compared to NCCN guidelines and results of meta-analyses. Fewer than half the women received treatments reflecting meta-analysis results or NCCN guidelines, by disease stage/TNM status. Adherence to either standard varied from 0% for LCIS to 87% for stages IIA or IIB node positive. There are multiple interactive reasons for low adherence to guidelines or meta-analyses results, including insufficient health system supports to clinicians, inadequate organisation and delivery systems and ineffective continuing medical education. The paucity of written information from patient records on physician/patient interactions limits the understanding of treatment decisions.

Adjuvant therapy (Figure 14)

Figure 14
Operable tumour–adjuvant treatment.

The aim of adjuvant therapy is to reduce the risk of metastatic recurrence and thus improve survival. Risk factors for metastatic recurrence should be assessed during the initial examination and from the histopathological examination of surgical specimens. Adjuvant therapy should not replace optimal locoregional treatment. The patient's menopausal status and the tumour hormone receptor status should be used in the selection of one of the reference treatments: hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy.

### Treatment of metastatic breast cancer: second line and beyond [^114ym2kz]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Increasing use of standard chemotherapy, especially anthracycline- and taxane-based therapies, in early-stage breast cancer has led to a corresponding increase in heavily pretreated and/or treatment-resistant cases of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Thus, second and later lines of MBC therapy frequently involve the clinically challenging picture of progressive disease and limited treatment options. While several prognostic factors have been identified to aid treatment selection in MBC patients, treatment is palliative and aimed at prolonging survival, controlling symptoms, and maximizing patients' quality of life. No globally accepted standard exists for meeting these goals, and treatment patterns vary according to region. The list of available agents for the treatment of MBC is increasing with newer chemotherapeutic agents and molecular-targeted therapies. Within recent years, several single-agent and combination chemotherapy regimens have been shown to improve progression-free survival and reduce symptoms of disease in clinical studies in patients with resistant and/or heavily pretreated MBC. However, at present, the demonstrated benefits of these medical interventions have usually not included extension of overall survival times. It is hoped that in the near future, ongoing refinements to treatment approaches used in second-line settings and beyond will allow meaningful improvements in symptom control and survival in MBC.

### Watson for oncology and breast cancer treatment recommendations: agreement with an expert multidisciplinary tumor board [^114XfCiH]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Breast cancer oncologists are challenged to personalize care with rapidly changing scientific evidence, drug approvals, and treatment guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) have the potential to help address this challenge. We report here the results of examining the level of agreement (concordance) between treatment recommendations made by the AI CDSS Watson for Oncology (WFO) and a multidisciplinary tumor board for breast cancer.

Patients and Methods

Treatment recommendations were provided for 638 breast cancers between 2014 and 2016 at the Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Center, Bengaluru, India. WFO provided treatment recommendations for the identical cases in 2016. A blinded second review was carried out by the center's tumor board in 2016 for all cases in which there was not agreement, to account for treatments and guidelines not available before 2016. Treatment recommendations were considered concordant if the tumor board recommendations were designated 'recommended' or 'for consideration' by WFO.

Results

Treatment concordance between WFO and the multidisciplinary tumor board occurred in 93% of breast cancer cases. Subgroup analysis found that patients with stage I or IV disease were less likely to be concordant than patients with stage II or III disease. Increasing age was found to have a major impact on concordance. Concordance declined significantly (P ≤ 0.02; P < 0.001) in all age groups compared with patients < 45years of age, except for the age group 55–64 years. Receptor status was not found to affect concordance.

Conclusion

Treatment recommendations made by WFO and the tumor board were highly concordant for breast cancer cases examined. Breast cancer stage and patient age had significant influence on concordance, while receptor status alone did not. This study demonstrates that the AI clinical decision-support system WFO may be a helpful tool for breast cancer treatment decision making, especially at centers where expert breast cancer resources are limited.

### Systemic therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114aXAVx]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

HER2-targeted therapy for advanced breast cancer — first-line recommendations state that "Clinicians should recommend HER2-targeted therapy-based combinations for first-line treatment, except for highly selected patients with ER+ or PgR+ and HER2-positive disease for whom clinicians may use endocrine therapy alone". Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong. Additionally, "Clinicians should recommend the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane for first-line treatment, unless the patient has a contraindication to taxanes". Type: Evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy, after breast-conserving surgery, ASTRO 2024 guidelines recommend to offer partial-breast irradiation as an alternative to whole-breast irradiation in patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer with all of the following:

- grade 1–2 disease

- ER+ histology

- age ≥ 40 years

- tumor size ≤ 2 cm.

### Immunotherapy for early breast cancer: too soon, too superficial, or just right? [^114khNsw]. Annals of Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Immunotherapy emerged as a new treatment modality for breast cancer, and its use is approved in combination with chemotherapy for first-line therapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer overexpressing PD-L1. As immune checkpoint inhibitors alone have modest clinical activity in advanced breast cancer, there is a growing interest in combinatorial modalities, and particularly for their rapid development in the early disease setting. The plethora of ongoing immunotherapy trials in early breast cancer comes at a time when solid data in advanced disease are still imperfect. This review offers a perspective on the efforts to establish the efficacy and safety of immunotherapeutic agents in early breast cancer.

METHODS

Guideline Development Process

This formal consensus-based guideline product was developed by an international, multidisciplinary Expert Panel, which included two patient representatives and an ASCO guidelines staff member with health research methodology expertise (Appendix Table A 1). The Expert Panel met via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline, which was then circulated for external review and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for editorial review and consideration for publication.

This guideline adaptation was also informed by the ADAPTE methodology and consensus methodology together as an alternative to de novo guideline development for this guideline. Adaptation of guidelines is considered by ASCO in selected circumstances when one or more quality guidelines from other organizations already exist on the same topic. The objective of the ADAPTE process is to take advantage of existing guidelines to enhance efficient production, reduce duplication, and promote the local uptake of quality guideline recommendations.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^1151NHPo]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Panel recommendations — PD-L1 and biomarker testing in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): For patients being considered for pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, tumor tissue should be tested for PD-L1 by the PD-L1 IVD 22C3 pharmDx assay and scored by the CPS system, until PD-L1 assays are harmonized (LE: 2). PD-L1 testing is not recommended for patients with early-stage breast cancer at this time (LE: 2). PD-L1 testing should be performed on the metastatic tumor, if available, but testing on primary tumor is acceptable (LE: 2), and when considering metastatic sites to test for PD-L1, it is preferable to prioritize extrahepatic sites or the primary tumor, if available. PD-L1 testing should not be performed on fine needle aspirated cell-block specimens or decalcified bone. Stromal TIL assessment in primary lesions is prognostic in early TNBC and HER2+ breast cancer (LE: 1); but has not been validated to direct clinical decision-making for chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Biomarker assessment, including repeat receptor profiles (ER/PR/HER2) and PD-L1 status as well as NGS should be considered at first relapse (LE: 3).

HER2 and Immunotherapy Need

HER2 therapies are recommended in 12% of patients in Enhanced and Maximal, and none in Basic and Core settings. Merging these data with GLOBOCAN cancer incidence, almost 9% of all patients with BC in 2018 have an indication for HER2 therapies, but only 8% in 2040 because of rising incidence in L and LM countries. The absolute number of patients recommended HER2 therapies increases from 183,943 to 224,131 between 2018 and 2040 because of population growth (Table 1). First-course immunotherapy for metastatic triple-negative BC is only recommended in the Maximal setting and is indicated in 0.2% of patients in 2018 (3,946 persons).
