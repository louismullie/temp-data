## Question

Carcinomatosis leptomeningea por imagen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about leptomeningeal carcinomatosis imaging, specifically MRI features, diagnostic performance, protocol recommendations, pitfalls, and how imaging integrates with CSF analysis and clinical assessment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the core MRI patterns and their anatomical distribution. Next, I will examine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, including false positives and negatives. After that, I need to check guideline-recommended MRI protocols and sequences. Then, I should integrate imaging with CSF cytology and clinical evaluation, including special scenarios like anti-angiogenic therapy. Finally, I will consider prognostic implications and synthesize a practical diagnostic approach with caveats and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical context. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, also called leptomeningeal metastasis or neoplastic meningitis, is the diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges by malignant cells, most commonly from breast, lung, or melanoma, with dissemination throughout the CSF pathways and frequent multifocal neurologic deficits; prognosis is historically poor, though modern therapies are shifting outcomes in selected subgroups [^da555053] [^6792c112].

> I will now examine the core MRI patterns. Wait, let me verify the classic appearances: linear or nodular leptomeningeal enhancement coating sulci, cisterns, cranial nerves, and spinal roots; ependymal ventricular surface enhancement; and clumped cauda equina enhancement, often with communicating hydrocephalus from impaired CSF flow; these patterns reflect both adherent plaques on pial surfaces and free-floating cells in CSF, which explains the diffuse, multifocal nature on imaging [^1813cf6c] [^f439787c] [^62568bb7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic performance. I initially thought MRI sensitivity approached 80–90%, but wait, I should double-check; sensitivity varies widely with field strength, sequences, and disease burden, and a normal MRI does not exclude leptomeningeal disease, with reports ranging from roughly 50–80% sensitivity and substantial false negatives, particularly for non-enhancing or microscopic disease; specificity is limited because leptomeningeal enhancement is nonspecific and can reflect infection, inflammation, prior surgery, or low CSF pressure, so imaging alone cannot confirm the diagnosis without corroboration [^810b7d75] [^8b73b225] [^1813cf6c].

> Next, I should review guideline-recommended MRI protocols. I need to ensure I cite the exact sequences: brain MRI should include axial T1, FLAIR, DWI, T2, and post-gadolinium 3D T1 and 3D FLAIR; spinal MRI should include post-gadolinium sagittal T1 and, when indicated, pre-contrast sagittal T1 and fat-suppressed T2 with axial T1 post-contrast of regions of interest; 3D isotropic voxels around 1 mm with reformats at 3 mm improve detection of small deposits and enable reproducible assessments across timepoints [^64094e08] [^462b45d9] [^ea249be8].

> Let me consider special MRI techniques and pitfalls. Black-blood 3D fast spin-echo T1 post-contrast can improve sensitivity compared with conventional 3D GRE or 2D SE, and post-contrast FLAIR increases sensitivity for subtle leptomeningeal enhancement; however, enhancement can be blunted by anti-angiogenic agents like bevacizumab, so a negative MRI in that context should prompt CSF confirmation rather than reassurance [^affc3c8a] [^b3d95a55] [^ff4683fb].

> I should confirm how imaging integrates with CSF analysis. CSF cytology remains the diagnostic gold standard but has limited sensitivity on a single tap, rising with repeated sampling and larger volumes; thus, a negative cytology with a positive MRI is not uncommon, and discordance requires clinical judgment and often repeat CSF or alternative modalities such as CSF circulating tumor DNA or circulating tumor cells when available; importantly, lumbar puncture should follow spine MRI to avoid post–LP enhancement confounding imaging interpretation [^60d28bac] [^8b73b225] [^ef0b66b1].

> But wait, what if the patient is on immunotherapy or has immune-related neurologic adverse events. I need to ensure we differentiate LM from immune-related meningitis or polyradiculopathy, which can mimic LM clinically and radiographically; in such cases, CSF analysis and careful correlation with timing of immune therapy, serologies, and electrophysiology help avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment [^64a63c26] [^ddd22244].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications tied to imaging. Let me verify: in NSCLC cohorts, MRI-positive versus MRI-negative LMC did not show a clear overall survival difference globally, but in the subset dying of CNS causes, MRI negativity correlated with longer survival, suggesting MRI burden tracks CNS-specific outcomes; broader series also associate higher imaging burden with worse prognosis, reinforcing the value of MRI for staging and prognostication even if it does not independently confirm the diagnosis [^aaec3e6f] [^ef18bad9].

> I will now synthesize a practical diagnostic approach. Suspect LM in patients with breast, lung, or melanoma and multifocal neurologic signs; perform contrast-enhanced brain and total spine MRI with the recommended 3D sequences; if MRI is positive, proceed to CSF cytology with optimized conditions and consider repeat LP if negative but suspicion remains; if MRI is negative but suspicion is high, repeat CSF and consider CSF liquid biopsy; integrate neurologic examination and, when appropriate, CSF flow studies before intrathecal therapy to detect compartmentalization that would impair drug distribution [^7847fc03] [^d36d1e93] [^ac32cb6d].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and response assessment. Given the dynamic nature of LM, repeat neuroaxis MRI every 6–12 weeks and at clinical progression is advised, ideally using standardized MRI protocols and, where feasible, centralized review or trained local neuroradiologists to improve reproducibility; RANO and EORTC efforts support simplified imaging scorecards and multimodal response assessment combining clinical status, CSF, and MRI, though these tools still require prospective validation [^110bea25] [^ea249be8] [^4df31a99].

La carcinomatosis leptomeníngea por imagen se diagnostica por **RM con gadolinio** [^64094e08] como el método de elección, mostrando realce leptomeníngeo lineal o nodular en sulcos, cisternas basales, nervios craneales y raíces de la cauda equina [^1813cf6c]. La RM espinal con gadolinio [^462b45d9] es esencial para detectar afectación cauda equina y raíces nerviosas [^aaec3e6f]. La CT tiene menor sensibilidad y se reserva para contraindicaciones a la RM o para evaluar hueso y dura [^1813cf6c]. La RM puede ser falsa negativa en fases tempranas o con baja carga tumoral, por lo que un resultado negativo no descarta la enfermedad y requiere correlación clínica y análisis de LCR [^810b7d75] [^8b73b225]. El diagnóstico definitivo requiere citología positiva o hallazgos radiológicos compatibles con clínica y LCR anormal [^41771b63].

- **Calcificaciones o metástasis óseas**: útiles para evaluar extensión local [^notfound].

---

## Sensibilidad y especificidad de la RM

La RM con gadolinio tiene una **sensibilidad variable** según la carga tumoral y la técnica utilizada, con reportes entre 50% y 80% [^notfound]. Su especificidad también es limitada, ya que el realce leptomeníngeo puede observarse en otras condiciones como meningitis, sarcoidosis, vasculitis o después de punción lumbar [^8b73b225].

---

## Limitaciones y desafíos diagnósticos

- **Falsos negativos**: la RM puede ser normal en fases tempranas o con baja carga tumoral, por lo que un resultado negativo no descarta la enfermedad [^810b7d75].

- **Falsos positivos**: el realce leptomeníngeo no es específico y puede confundirse con otras patologías inflamatorias o infecciosas [^8b73b225].

- **Varibilidad interobservador**: la interpretación subjetiva de los hallazgos puede dificultar el diagnóstico [^ea249be8].

## Papel de la RM espinal

La RM espinal con gadolinio es **esencial** para detectar la afectación de la cauda equina y raíces nerviosas, frecuentemente involucradas en la CLM [^462b45d9]. Esta modalidad permite una mejor planificación terapéutica y seguimiento de la respuesta al tratamiento [^notfound].

---

## Guías clínicas y recomendaciones

Las guías clínicas actuales recomiendan la RM con gadolinio como el **estudio de imagen preferido** para la evaluación de la CLM, tanto en el diagnóstico inicial como en el seguimiento [^7847fc03]. La RM espinal debe realizarse en todos los casos sospechados para una completa evaluación de la enfermedad [^462b45d9].

---

## Conclusión

La carcinomatosis leptomeníngea por imagen se diagnostica principalmente por RM con gadolinio, que muestra realce leptomeníngeo lineal o nodular en cerebro y médula espinal. La RM espinal es **crucial** para detectar afectación de la cauda equina y raíces nerviosas. La CT tiene menor sensibilidad y se reserva para casos específicos. Un resultado negativo no descarta la enfermedad, por lo que el diagnóstico definitivo requiere correlación clínica y análisis de LCR [^41771b63].

Therapeutic Advances in Leptomeningeal Disease

Current clinical practice is dominated by the poor outcome of LM. The primary goals are therefore symptomatic management by surgical and/or radiation-based therapies followed by intrathecal and/or systemic chemotherapy (Table 2). Due to the lack of large randomized controlled clinical trials, evidence-based treatment recommendations in LM are limited. In absence of prospectively validated criteria, assessment of treatment response can also be challenging. To address this issue, a Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) workgroup proposed criteria for LM response to treatment which combines neurologic examination, CSF analysis, and MRI findings. The original RANO proposal for response criteria provided a scorecard for radiographic assessment of LM with points assigned for presence of subarachnoid or ventricular nodules, leptomeningeal enhancement, and cranial nerve enhancement to characterize brain and spine involvement while noting parenchymal and epidural involvement. Due to discordant scoring noted upon review of MRIs from 22 patients with LM, a simplified scorecard noting the presence or absence of subarachnoid/ventricular nodules and leptomeningeal linear enhancement in the brain and the spine was proposed, but needs further validation. European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) have jointly issued practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of LM.EANO-ESMO guidelines provide a treatment algorithm based on patient's prognosis, presence of concurrent brain metastases, and state of extracranial disease.

Overview of Commonly Employed Treatments for Leptomeningeal Disease

Surgical Therapy

Surgical resection of metastatic lesions is not within the standard treatment protocol of LM. Neurosurgical intervention can be needed, however through the management of obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. Treating hydrocephalus from LM can include high volume lumbar puncture for symptomatic relief and placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) systems if needed for longer-term relief. Despite short overall survival, VPS placement is an effective palliative measure, with peritoneal carcinomatosis an extremely rare complication.

### Leptomeningeal metastatic disease: new frontiers and future directions [^6792c112]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastatic disease (LMD), encompassing entities of 'meningeal carcinomatosis', neoplastic meningitis' and 'leukaemic/lymphomatous meningitis', arises secondary to the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells from extracranial and certain intracranial malignancies into the leptomeninges and cerebrospinal fluid. The clinical burden of LMD has been increasing secondary to more sensitive diagnostics, aggressive local therapies for discrete brain metastases, and improved management of extracranial disease with targeted and immunotherapeutic agents, resulting in improved survival. However, owing to drug delivery challenges and the unique microenvironment of LMD, novel therapies against systemic disease have not yet translated into improved outcomes for these patients. Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are common, response assessment remains challenging, and the prognosis associated with this disease of whole neuroaxis remains extremely poor. The dearth of effective therapies is further challenged by the difficulties in studying this dynamic disease state. In this Review, a multidisciplinary group of experts describe the emerging evidence and areas of active investigation in LMD and provide directed recommendations for future research. Drawing upon paradigm-changing advances in mechanistic science, computational approaches, and trial design, the authors discuss domain-specific and cross-disciplinary strategies for optimizing the clinical and translational research landscape for LMD. Advances in diagnostics, multi-agent intrathecal therapies, cell-based therapies, immunotherapies, proton craniospinal irradiation and ongoing clinical trials offer hope for improving outcomes for patients with LMD.

### Association of MRI findings with clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from non-small cell lung cancer [^aaec3e6f]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) is helpful for diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) and localizing LMC symptoms. Goal of this study is how MRI findings of LMC are associated with clinical characteristics or prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods

We retrospectively collected data on 283 patients with LMC from NSCLC, adenocarcinoma based on cerebrospinal fluid cytology. All patients had brain MRI with gadolinium enhancement at LMC diagnosis, and spinal MRI was performed at the physician's discretion. We evaluated the prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) of all patients and subgroup of patients with central nervous system cause of death.

Results

Two-hundred sixteen patients (76%) had definite or suggestive LMC findings and 67 had negative findings on brain MRI. Of the 37 patients who presented with cauda equina syndrome, 35 (95%) exhibited typical spinal MRI findings. Median OS of all patients was 3.65 months (95% confidence interval, 3.06–4.18). There was no significant difference in median OS between MRI-negative and MRI-positive groups (4.31 vs. 3.48 months, p = 0.711), whereas negative MRI finding showed longer median OS significantly in a subgroup of 77 patients with a central nervous system cause of death (p = 0.035). Considering clinical characteristics, progressive systemic disease, and altered mentality were significant prognostic factors associated with poor OS, whereas presenting symptom of headache with nausea/vomiting, intra-CSF chemotherapy, WBRT after LMC diagnosis, and concurrent RTKi treatment were significant for favorable OS in multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

Positive MRI findings suggests heavier disease burden than negative MRI findings in patients with LMC who died of a central nervous system cause. Spinal MRI findings in patients with LMC correlate with cauda equina symptoms.

Treatment of Leptomeningeal Disease

Given the challenges of LMD diagnosis, it is not surprising that there are few prospective, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the treatment of LMD. Therefore, clinicians and patients approach treatment decisions with limited data, balancing side effects with potential benefits to symptom burden and survival. Surgery and radiation have primarily palliative roles that can improve quality of life in select patients. The use of systemic therapy has historically been hampered by limited CNS penetration and activity. However, with the emergence of novel, molecular targeting agents and immunotherapy, there has been an expansion of pharmacologic options associated with improved survival outcomes. These agents can be administered as monotherapy, in combination with one another, or in combination with radiation therapy and/or surgical intervention. Treatment decisions should be based on a thoughtful balance of underlying tumor histology, presence of molecular targets, clinical performance status, and patient preference given that current treatments for solid tumor LMD are not curative.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) is a rare and potentially lethal complication of cancer that occurs when cancer cells spread to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, known as the leptomeninges. The cancer cells can spread to the leptomeninges through the bloodstream or via direct extension from a nearby tumour. They are resistant to most chemotherapy options due to this being a 'sanctuary' site where they are protected by the limited filtration across the blood brain barrier.

LMC can cause a range of neurological symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, altered sensorium, memory loss and difficulty speaking or walking. The non-specificity of these symptoms could initially be mistaken for other conditions, making LMC challenging to diagnose. If left untreated, LMC can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening complications. Diagnosis of LMC is typically made using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and imaging modalities.

Leptomeningeal metastases — diagnosis can be established by CSF cytology, characteristic imaging plus clinical findings, or compatible symptoms with suggestive CSF. The criteria are listed as "CSF positive for tumor cells or Positive radiologic findings with supportive clinical findings or Signs and symptoms with suggestive CSF in a patient known to have a malignancy". The page clarifies what constitutes suggestive CSF: "Suggestive CSF includes high white blood cell (WBC) count, low glucose, and high protein".

### Leptomeningeal metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer and current landscape of treatments [^12a11a8e]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC), is a devastating complication of metastatic cancer that occurs when neoplastic cells invade the meningeal space. Diagnosis of LM remains challenging given the heterogeneous signs and symptoms at presentation and requires thorough neurological examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and MRI of the brain and spine with gadolinium. Detecting neoplastic cells in the CSF is the gold standard for diagnosing leptomeningeal metastases; however, it has low sensitivity and may require multiple CSF samples. New emerging technologies, such as liquid biopsy of CSF, have increased sensitivity and specificity for detecting circulating tumor cells in CSF. The management of LM in patients with NSCLC requires an individualized multidisciplinary approach. Treatment options include surgery for ventricular shunt placement, radiation therapy to bulky or symptomatic disease sites, systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, molecularly targeted agents, and, more recently, immunotherapy. Targeting actionable mutations in LM from NSCLC, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangement inhibitors, has shown encouraging results in terms of disease control and survival. Although there are limited data regarding the use of immunotherapy in LM, immunotherapy has produced promising results in several case reports. In this review, we focused on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment strategies, with a special emphasis on novel agents, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy of LM in patients with NSCLC.

### Treatment pattern and outcomes of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in India-a retrospective study [^cd89a190]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

LMC is observed in approximately 10% of patients with solid tumour cancer. Breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma are three malignancies commonly associated with LMC. With recent developments in systemic therapies, there is a significant improvement in the extracranial control of the above three mentioned malignancies. As a result of this improvement in extracranial control, there is an increase in relapse seen in sanctuary sites such as the central nervous system. In general, there is an increase in incidence of both brain parenchymal lesions as well as LMC. It is hypothesised that in addition to improvement in systemic control and prolonged survival, a combination of other factors like improved imaging techniques and a lower threshold for initiating diagnostic work-up have led to increase the incidence and prevalence of LMC. Median time between diagnosis of systemic cancer and diagnosis of LMC is around 1–2 years. Developments in management of leptomeningeal metastasis of solid tumours majorly include systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal therapy and irradiation. However, impact of these management modalities on prognosis currently varies widely. LMC has a dismal prognosis and hence there is a need for improvement in outcomes. Till now, only few randomised trials were conducted and previous observational studies are mostly retrospective. Also, very limited literature is available from India and other low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). The applicability of retrospective studies' from high-income countries in LMIC is questionable and warrants further review. The advances in systemic treatment in solid tumours that have led to improved outcomes have become inaccessible to a large proportion of patients in India and other LMICs. We aimed to understand the current prevalence of LMC and management in India. Hence, we did a retrospective country-wide analysis to determine the pattern of care and outcomes in solid tumour patients with LMC.

### Treatment pattern and outcomes of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in India-a retrospective study [^41ec735b]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

This data indicates that despite a substantial proportion of patients having targetable driver mutations, outcomes of LMC remain dismal in LMIC. This suggests that the current treatment landscape in LMICs is insufficient to adequately treat leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as outcomes have remained low even in those with targetable mutations. There is a need for the development of new treatment options like CNS-penetrating immunotherapy acknowledging that the evidence of existing treatment modalities like radiotherapy (RT) does suggest that it improves outcomes however this is scant and unsubstantiated at this point in time.

Another important facet is the cost-effectiveness of early screening modalities to screen for and identify LMC before symptoms with solid tumours in LMICs. A high percentage of LMC is seen only at autopsy compared the reported numbers with a definitive diagnosis coupled with the poor prognosis from leptomeningeal carcinomatosis suggests that early, widespread and periodic screening would very likely play a role in lowering mortality from it. However, on the other hand, the high-cost burden of this screening via imaging modalities coupled with the barrier of financial access to effective CNS-penetrating therapy raises the question of the feasibility of this strategy in LMICs. The optimal strategy lies somewhere on this spectrum where cheaper, more easily accessible screening strategies with good sensitivity would allow a smaller number to require the resource-burdening confirmatory test of high specificity to allow the most fertile situation for shared decision making of treatment between patient and doctor.

The strength of the current study is the multicentric real-world data across multiple primary tumours. The study also had few limitations, viz. treatment algorithms were heterogeneous and very few patients had exposure to 3rd generation TKIs. Unfortunately, we have not collected data on progression-free survival. The data generation for the current study was possible because of wide collaboration between clinicians at different centres. Thus, clinicians could have had differing protocols for follow-up procedures and timing. Due to this, we did not gather data on progression-free survival (PFS) as we could not maintain uniformity for reliable PFS data.

LMC has a grave prognosis and nearly one-third of the patients are treated with the best supportive care due to dismal prognosis. Intrathecal therapy, though part of guidelines, is administered in only 39% of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. IT therapy and lung primary are associated with relatively improved outcomes. This data can serve as a benchmark for further improvement to facilitate studies for further improving the outcomes.

Methods

Study population and data collection

This study is a retrospective analysis that included adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center (PMCC) between 2007 and 2021 with a confirmed diagnosis of GEC, from which we identified patients with disease metastatic to the brain or leptomeninges. The data were collected from the electronic medical record into the Gastroesophageal Database using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) and the study was approved by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (REB) - CAPCR ID (REB ID 20–5884). - and adhered to the data confidentiality and privacy policy of the International Credential Evaluation Service.

For each included patient, the clinical staging was determined using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC 6) staging manual, given the retrospective nature of this cohort. This study included adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and proximal stomach, categorized respectively as types I, II, and III using the Siewert classification. In addition, pure squamous cell carcinomas were also included, while neuroendocrine, and undifferentiated carcinomas were excluded. Two patients were found concomitantly with both brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and they were included in the LMC group analysis.

Patient characteristics, including age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS), were recorded. Tumor characteristics, including date of diagnosis, number of brain metastases, number and location(s) of extracranial metastases, clinical staging, and HER2 status, were also noted.

All patients diagnosed with brain metastasis underwent neurological imaging as part of their evaluation for neurological symptoms and confirmation of CNS metastasis. In our study, the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was established by utilizing neuroimaging findings and/or cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Neuroimaging features included linear and/or nodular enhancement of the leptomeninges, cranial nerves, and spinal nerve roots. In cases where clinical symptoms suggested leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, but neuroimaging results were negative, patients underwent a lumbar puncture. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis confirmation revealed distinctive abnormalities, such as elevated protein levels, an increased count of nucleated cells, decreased glucose, and notably, the identification of neoplastic cells.

### Leptomeningeal metastases from solid malignancy: a review [^61db885f]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LMM) consist of diffuse involvement of the leptomeninges by infiltrating cancer cells. In solid tumors, the most frequent primary sites are lung and breast cancers, two tumors where the incidence of LMM is apparently increasing. Careful neurological examination is required to demonstrate multifocal involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), cranial nerves, and spinal roots, which constitute the clinical hallmark of the disease. Cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) analysis is almost always abnormal but only a positive cytology or demonstration of intrathecal synthesis of tumor markers is diagnostic. T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced sequence of the entire neuraxis (brain and spine) plays an important role in supporting the diagnosis, demonstrating the involved sites and guiding treatment. Radionuclide CSF flow studies detect CSF compartmentalization and are useful for treatment planning. Standard therapy relies mainly on focal irradiation and intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy. Studies using other therapeutic approaches such as new biological or cytotoxic compounds are ongoing. The overall prognosis remains grim and quality of life should remain the priority when deciding which treatment option to apply. However, a sub-group of patients, tentatively defined here, may benefit from an aggressive treatment.

### Novel approaches to treating leptomeningeal metastases [^0dd8d9cc]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastasis is a devastating complication of the central nervous system in patients with late-stage solid or hematological cancers. Leptomeningeal metastasis results from the multifocal seeding of the leptomeninges by malignant cancer cells. Although central nervous system metastasis usually presents in patients with widely disseminated and progressive late-stage cancer, malignant cells may spread to the cerebrospinal fluid during earlier disease stages in particularly aggressive cancers. Treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis is largely palliative but will often provide stabilization and protection from further neurological deterioration and improve quality of life. There is a need to raise awareness of the impact of leptomeningeal metastases on cancer patients and its known and putative biological basis. Novel diagnostic approaches include identification of biomarkers that may stratify the risk for developing leptomeningeal metastasis. Current therapies can be used more effectively while waiting for advanced treatments to be developed.

### Novel methods to diagnose leptomeningeal metastases in breast cancer [^3f424627]. Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) in breast cancer patients are rare but often accompanied by devastating neurological symptoms and carry a very poor prognosis, even if treated. To date, two diagnostic methods are clinically used to diagnose LM: gadolinium MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord and cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Both techniques are, however, hampered by limited sensitivities, often leading to a long diagnostic process requiring repeated lumbar punctures and MRI examinations. To improve the detection rate of LM, numerous studies have assessed new techniques. In this review, we present the current workup to diagnose LM, set out an overview of novel techniques to diagnose LM, and give recommendations for future research.

### Treatment pattern and outcomes of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in India-a retrospective study [^117691e7]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

A significant proportion of patients (> 50%) have presented in ECOG PS 2–4 state. This reflects the pattern of practice of Indian oncologists where limited scanning of the brain and CSF axis is performed due to constraints of resources. Multiple guidelines, including National comprehensive cancer network (NCCN), suggest that imaging of the brain needs to be performed in NSCLC stage IV. However brain imaging is rarely done due to less accessibility to MRI and its associated cost. Further, this information often does not influence the treatment decisions as irrespective of presence or absence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, CNS penetrating tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) cannot be selected due to their prohibitively high cost. Hence multiple oncologists choose to scan the neural axis or do a CSF examination only when the patient is symptomatic. This is reflected also in the fact that all patients in the current study already had CNS symptoms. Similar experience was reported by Abraham and colleagues in breast cancerwhere nearly all patients were symptomatic with headache (47%), vomiting (47%), diplopia (20%), and seizure (20%) being the most common symptoms. In a large experience from prospective studies in NSCLC, the symptoms of leptomeningeal disease were symptoms of altered higher mental functions (48.4%) or seizures and Headache and dizziness (32.2%). Similar experience was published from Kochi, where the commonest presenting features were headache, vomiting, loss of consciousness, cranial nerve palsies and seizures.

The treatment pattern suggested that a significant proportion of patients were offered the best supportive care in our study. This is in line with multiple guidelines suggesting that poor PS patients or patients with uncontrolled progressive disease should be offered the best supportive care. The survival in this group of patients is dismal as seen in our study where the median OS in patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 3–4 (ECOG PS 3–4) was 29 days and in patients with the extracranial progressive disease was 64 days. Hence it is imperative that these patients are diagnosed early in the disease course. Probably, following guidelines and doing imaging to detect CNS involvement might lead to improvement in outcomes however that presents its own challenges in LMICs. While prevalence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis has been seen to be around 3–7% with solid tumours, its incidence is often 15–20% on autopsy suggesting a large number of these are being missed owing to delayed imaging and/or poor survival before CNS symptoms become evident.

### Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy versus leptomeningeal disease following ipilimumab [^ddd22244]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, whether idiopathic or related to Ipilimumab or other immunomodulatory agents, may have similar clinical presentation, making it difficult to distinguish them. MRI is usually the initial study in patients presenting with signs/symptoms of spinal involvement. The finding of involvement of nerve roots, usually in a smooth, non-nodular fashion, with sparing of the surface of the cord should raise suspicion of an autoimmune, inflammatory process. Since immunomodulatory treatment may improve the course of this condition, more aggressive evaluation, such as NCS and CSF studies and evaluation by a neurologist are recommended. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies whether causally related to malignancy, immunotherapy, or not are complex and recommended treatments differ. Further studies in this area are clearly warranted.

We agree with the above proposals and the need for further optimization of these response assessment criteria. We also caution against the use of abbreviated MRI scans with limited series, often prioritized in the clinical setting to maximize efficiency, due to the inferior resolution quality that prevents adequate radiologic interpretation, particularly for spine imaging. Imaging advances such as deep learning reconstruction, undersampling, and other acceleration techniques should be leveraged to acquire the high-quality and 3D images necessary in clinically feasible times.

While the findings of leptomeningeal enhancement in a patient with cancer are commonly the result of metastatic disease, CSF sampling may be necessary to differentiate LM from other radiologic mimics such as immune checkpoint-inhibitor-associated Guillain Barré syndromeor early cerebral ischemia. However, the concept of "radiographic-only" LM is a true clinical entity, with potentially different biology and prognosis compared to CSF-positive disease and discussed further in "Diagnostic Methods: Liquid Biopsy". Clinicians should also be mindful of the impairment of tumor-associated contrast enhancement with the concurrent use of anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, and thus pursue confirmatory CSF sampling in such patients with "negative" imaging but signs or symptoms of LM.

Abstract

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are increasingly becoming recognized as a treatable, yet generally incurable, complication of advanced cancer. As modern cancer therapeutics have prolonged the lives of patients with metastatic cancer, specifically in patients with parenchymal brain metastases, treatment options, and clinical research protocols for patients with LM from solid tumors have similarly evolved to improve survival within specific populations. Recent expansions in clinical investigation, early diagnosis, and drug development have given rise to new unanswered questions. These include leptomeningeal metastasis biology and preferred animal modeling, epidemiology in the modern cancer population, ensuring validation and accessibility of newer leptomeningeal metastasis diagnostics, best clinical practices with multimodality treatment options, clinical trial design and standardization of response assessments, and avenues worthy of further research. An international group of multi-disciplinary experts in the research and management of LM, supported by the Society for Neuro-Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology, were assembled to reach a consensus opinion on these pressing topics and provide a roadmap for future directions. Our hope is that these recommendations will accelerate collaboration and progress in the field of LM and serve as a platform for further discussion and patient advocacy.

Leptomeningeal metastases — definition, incidence, origins, dissemination, symptoms, and prognosis are summarized. Leptomeningeal metastasis or neoplastic meningitis refers to malignant cells' multifocal seeding of the leptomeninges and is known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or carcinomatosis meningitis when the cells originate from a solid tumor; when related to systemic lymphoma it is called lymphomatous meningitis, and when associated with leukemia it is termed leukemic meningitis. Leptomeningeal metastasis occurs in approximately 5% of patients with cancer, with most cases arising from breast cancers, lung cancers, and melanoma; tumor cells gain access to the leptomeninges by hematogenous dissemination, lymphatic spread, or direct extension and, once in the CSF, are disseminated throughout the neuraxis by the constant flow of CSF. Common symptoms depend on location of involvement and can include spinal cord-related pain, focal motor or sensory dysfunction, bowel/bladder dysfunction, and ventricular system signs such as headache, nausea/vomiting, and confusion; the median survival is typically 2 to 4 months, survival may be extended by early detection and intervention, and the underlying tumor type can have some impact on OS.

Diagnostic Advances in Leptomeningeal Metastasis

Classically, LM is diagnosed on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF cytology. Cranial LM involvement can be identified on MRI as contrast enhancement along cranial nerves and the leptomeninges, particularly in the cerebellar folia (Figure 1).LM within the spinal cord can be identified as enhancement along the spinal cord or clumping enhancement of the cauda equine. However, MRI imaging has significant limitations. Radiographic findings may not correlate with symptoms, may be difficult to distinguish pachymeningeal from leptomeningeal disease, and a normal craniospinal MRI does not exclude a diagnosis of LM. In addition, leptomeningeal enhancement noted on MRI is nonspecific and carries a broad differential including inflammatory conditions such as neurosarcoidosis and infections such as human T-lymphotropic virus.

CSF profile is often abnormal in LM with lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose representing the most frequently observed, but nonspecific findings.CSF cytology allows for direct visualization and identification of neoplastic cells, representing an important tool for diagnosing LM. However, sensitivity from a single CSF sample is low. Results of CSF cytology can be inconclusive, with occasional isolation of "atypical" or "suspicious" cells that are not definitively neoplastic. Multiple CSF samples may be required to improve yield with sensitivity increasing from 60% on first lumbar puncture to 85% and 90% on second and third CSF cytology analyses respectively.

False-negative radiographic imaging and cytology analysis can lead to additional invasive testing such as repeated CSF sampling or leptomeningeal biopsy while delaying diagnosis and treatment. In addition, neither neuroaxis imaging nor CSF cytology can provide information about tumor molecular genetics. Knowledge of the molecular makeup of malignant cells in the leptomeninges is indispensable in the era of emerging targeted treatments. Emerging technologies utilizing analysis of CSF circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) provide an opportunity for tumor analysis via liquid biopsies (Table 1).

Introduction

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) refers to the spread of malignant cells to the leptomeninges, subarachnoid space, and other cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. The majority of LMD arises from solid tumors originating outside the central nervous system (CNS), although primary CNS tumors can also infiltrate the leptomeningeal space. The rate of known LMD in cancer patients is approximately 5%, with case series suggesting an incidence of asymptomatic or undiagnosed LMD in up to 20% of solid-tumor patients at the time of autopsy.

The incidence of LMD varies by primary cancer type and is most commonly found in breast, lung, and melanoma patients. The majority of patients with LMD have coexisting parenchymal brain metastases (BrM), but up to 42% of LMD is diagnosed in the absence of parenchymal involvement. LMD has been associated with advanced malignancy and very poor prognosis, with median survival in historical cohorts ranging from 1 month without therapy to 3–6 months with radiation and chemotherapy. However, the era of targeted therapy has fundamentally changed the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for BrM and LMD patients; some novel therapies have extended median survival in certain types of LMD beyond 1 year.

In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of LMD arising from systemic solid tumors, lymphoma/leukemias, and primary brain tumors. We highlight recent advances and discuss opportunities for progress in the coming years.

Leptomeningeal metastases — patient evaluation and CSF diagnosis: Patients present with signs and symptoms ranging from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion of the brain or spinal cord, alteration of the local blood supply, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways leading to increased intracranial pressure, or interference with normal brain function. Patients should have a physical examination with a careful neurologic evaluation, and MRI of the brain and spine should also be performed for accurate staging, particularly if the patient is a candidate for active treatment. A definitive diagnosis is most commonly made by CSF analysis via lumbar puncture if it is safe for the patient, and CSF protein is typically increased with possible pleocytosis or decreased glucose levels and ultimately positive CSF cytology for tumor cells. Assessment of circulating tumor cells increases the sensitivity of tumor cell detection in CSF, is now CLIA-approved in some states, and should be done when it is available. CSF cytology testing has approximately 50% sensitivity with the first lumbar puncture, and up to 90% sensitivity after repeated CSF analyses in affected patients, and clinicians should be aware that lumbar punctures may be contraindicated in patients with anticoagulation, thrombocytopenia, or bulky intracranial disease.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM), long regarded as an advanced complication of solid malignancies, have strategically evaded durable treatment options for decades. The ambiguous processes which facilitate cancer cell dissemination to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and survival in such hypoxic, nutrient-sparse conditions have led to challenges in curbing the growth of metastases within the leptomeninges relative to other intracranial and extracranial sites. Faced with widespread therapeutic nihilism and limited expert consensus on optimal diagnostic and management strategies, this disease state has historically led to significant neurologic morbidity and rapid mortality for those afflicted. However, as modern oncologic care has prolonged the lives of patients with cancer and improved early diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) progression, this previously described "rare" stage of malignancy is now being observed in as many as 1 in 5 patients with certain high-risk cancer molecular subtypes. Paralleling this rise in LM diagnosis is a greater scientific understanding of cancer cell biology in the leptomeningeal space and the development of innovative treatment options that challenge the historical survival benchmark of 2–4 months in patients with leptomeningeal tumor dissemination.

To effectively meet the demands of rapidly expanding therapeutic options and diagnostic algorithms in this space, the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) have facilitated a platform for international expert discussion and consensus on the topics of LM biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, management, clinical research, and future directions (Table 1). The aim of this consensus statement is to consolidate the modern state of LM innovation into cohesive recommendations for best clinical and research practices, with attention to critical unresolved questions and topics worthy of focused collaborative investigation.

Assessment of Treatment Response

Evaluating treatment response in LMD is an ongoing challenge and may contribute to LMD patients being excluded from clinical trials. Existing randomized trials utilize a variety of primary endpoints including mOS, PFS, neurological response rate, and time to neurologic response rate. The complexity in standardizing LMD outcomes can be demonstrated by the difficulty the RANO LM working group has had in establishing a standard outcome measure. In 2017, the RANO Leptomeningeal Metastases Working Group published a consensus on treatment response for LMD, recommending consideration of CSF cytology, contrast enhancing MRI of the neuroaxis, and detailed neurological evaluation at regular intervals. Just 2 years later, in 2019, the same group published a paper subtitled "lack of feasibility and clinical utility and a revised proposal", highlighting the difficulty in standardizing treatment response evaluation for LMD. In October 2022, the RANO LMD committee and EORTC brain tumor group released a new imaging scorecard. To date, none of these response criteria have been validated in a prospective interventional study of LMD. In fact, the recent pembrolizumab study by Brastianos et al. specifically chose not to use a surrogate endpoint, but chose to focus on overall survival. As the sensitivity and specificity of the CSF liquid biopsy technologies become more defined, we anticipate that these will be incorporated into a comprehensive and clinically useful response criteria that includes imaging, CSF studies, clinical exam, and survival. In the meantime, we advocate that patients with LMD continue to be included in clinical trials, either in exploratory or CNS cohorts.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a devastating complication of solid and liquid systemic and central nervous system malignant neoplasms. Leptomeningeal disease occurs in 4% to 15% of solid tumors and in 7% to 15% of liquid malignant neoplasmsand results in progressive neurologic dysfunction, culminating in death after 4 to 6 weeks for untreated patients. Leptomeningeal disease is typically diagnosed via identification of malignant cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), most commonly obtained via lumbar puncture or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt access.

Cerebrospinal fluid cytologic analysis, the currently most reliable diagnostic method, has a sensitivity of only approximately 75% and is known to produce persistently negative results in approximately 10% of patients. Methods have been proposed to limit the rate of false-negative cytologic results. Sampling near the anatomical location of LMD has been shown to improve the sensitivity of cytologic analyses. In addition, several studies have shown the use of repeated lumbar punctures to decrease false-negative cytologic diagnoses. False-negative rates of cytologic findings are also reduced by increasing the volume of CSF acquired, although this approach is often not clinically feasible. Other methods, including neurologic examination and neuroimaging, are similarly known to lack sensitivity in the diagnosis of LMD. Given the rapid progression of LMD, there is an important unmet clinical need for a more sensitive diagnostic test.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a potential alternative to cytologic analysis, lacks specificity, and an incorrect diagnosis of LMD by imaging alone may result in unnecessary treatments and patient harm and may reduce the ability to study new treatments objectively. Current clinical trial designs, for LMD are based on positive CSF cytologic findings because MRI has poor specificity. Many conditions may result in enhancing leptomeninges on MRI scans, which may lead to an incorrect diagnosis (eg, recent lumbar puncture, adjacent parenchymal tumor [PT], direct extension of PT to the cortical surface, radiation therapy, neurologic surgery, infection, and low intracranial pressure). The direct observation of tumor cells in the CSF is confirmatory of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. However, CSF cytologic analysis is limited by poor sensitivity. In clinical practice, this limitation leads to a delay in diagnosis and treatment and a barrier to clinical trial enrollment.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis presenting as catatonia [^0c29761c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lung cancer is a common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Cancer molecular profiling of somatic mutations in lung cancer helps both predict the underlying biology and identify therapeutic targets. c-ROS proto-oncogene 1 receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) rearranged lung cancer is a rare molecular subtype of lung cancer that is associated with central nervous system metastases and amenable to targeted therapy. We present a case of a patient with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a ROS1 rearrangement who acutely presented with catatonia while on targeted treatment. A full diagnostic workup revealed that the acute decline was secondary to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC). This case report describes the diagnostic workup for this atypical presentation of LMC and the subsequent treatment strategies. This case challenges the traditional paradigm that patients admitted with cancer-related decline are not candidates for systemic therapy and highlights the key role of collaboration with the oncology team.

Carcinomatous meningitis

Carcinomatous meningitis occurs in approximately 5% of lung cancer patients, usually late in the course of the disease. Carcinomatous meningitis carries a poor prognosis with a high morbidity and survival ranging from weeks if untreated and up to 8 months with timely treatment. Haematogenous dissemination is the most common mechanism of leptomeningeal tumour spread, but direct tumour extension from bone and brain lesions, and perivascular or perineural spread may also occur. Symptoms of carcinomatous meningitis are myriad and include symptoms of cranial neuropathy, symptoms indicative of cerebral hemisphere involvement and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root involvement.

Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology remains the "gold standard" in confirming the diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis, contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended to localise the disease sites before lumbar puncture or to support the diagnosis in suspected cases with negative cytology findings. MRI may also demonstrate findings that may be a contra-indication for lumbar puncture, as well as associated abnormalities such as parenchymal metastases. Typical findings on MRI of carcinomatous meningitis are ependymal, leptomeningeal and dural enhancement (Fig. 9). Ependymal enhancement is characterised by a marked linear enhancement along the ventricular walls. Dural enhancement occurs adjacent to the inner table of the skull and does not extend into the sulci or cisterns. Leptomeningeal enhancement follows the pial surface of the brain and fills the subarachnoid spaces of the sulci and cisterns. This enhancement pattern is often described as having a "gyriform" or "serpentine" appearance. Furthermore, enhancement of cranial nerves, small superficial metastases in the sulci and ventricular dilatation in the setting of communicating hydrocephalus may be observed. Specifically, in the spinal canal, nodular enhancement, often in the cauda equina, is a key finding suggesting carcinomatous meningitis (Fig. 10). Treatment should be guided by a multidisciplinary approach and includes surgery (ventriculo-peritoneal shunt or Ommaya reservoir placement), radiation therapy to high burden sites and both intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy.

### Leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors: a Society for Neuro-oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology consensus review on clinical management and future directions [^ea249be8]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The standardization of neurologic imaging of LM represents a much-needed but controversial topic. Unlike parenchymal brain metastases and extracranial metastases that are more easily defined as target and non-target lesions that may be longitudinally measured, LM represent a more nebulous disease state to quantify. The RANO Leptomeningeal Metastasis committee (LANO), in an effort to standardize LM measurements across research protocols, published a consensus proposal for multimodality LM response assessments in clinical trials, which includes complementary evaluations of the neurologic examination, CSF cytologic changes, and imaging responses. This consensus statement proposed a reproducible imaging scorecard as well as a working guideline for neuraxial MRI protocols, including the use of 1.5 and 3T MRI scanners only, consistency in MRI scanners at baseline and follow-up examination, 3D T1 post-contrast images with isotropic 1 mm voxels to allow for 3-dimensional reformatting of both brain and spine series, and a reformatted slice thickness of 3 mm to enhance detection of small deposits. The RANO working group also discussed the potential value of post-contrast T2-weighted images to better capture non-enhancing and superficial leptomeningeal deposits, though have refrained at this time from recommending this sequence for routine assessments.

Following the publication of the original LANO proposal for LM therapeutic response criteria, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) brain tumor group sought to explore feasibility of the LANO MRI scorecard, finding that neither neuro-oncologists nor neuroradiologists reached acceptable interobserver agreement, due in part to scorecard complexity and lack of systematic user training. A revised, simplified MRI scorecard was proposed, with improved, yet still moderate, agreement for overall response assessment (Kappa = 0.44) by a joint EORTC-RANO validation study. Standardization of MRI protocols, central imaging review, and sufficient training of local MRI assessments, ideally by board-certified neuroradiologists, were proposed as paths towards better interrater reliability and reproducibility.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in leptomeningeal disease with or without brain metastasis: insights from an explorative data analysis of the charitéLMD registry [^8a140f52]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This work contributes to the growing body of literature advocating for a more nuanced understanding of LMD and the need for entity-specific treatment approaches to enhance patient care. The study emphasizes the necessity of prospective, interdisciplinary, multi-center registries to better capture the complexity and heterogeneity of LMD patient populations and treatment responses, ultimately guiding more effective and personalized yet standardized and timely therapeutic interventions. The significant prognostic impact of the primary tumor type at LMD diagnosis warrants prospective entity-specific trials.

### Leptomeningeal metastases: new opportunities in the modern era [^f69c4768]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) represent an aggressive, advanced stage of cancer with substantial neurologic morbidity and a grim survival of 2–5 months. Also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or neoplastic meningitis, LM occurs when cancer cells gain access to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, either through hematogenous dissemination via the choroid plexus, retrograde venous extension, or direct seeding from parenchymal metastases across the glia limitans. Upon entry, LM adopts two phenotypic states: adherent plaques to the brain and spinal cord visualized with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and free-floating cells within the spinal fluid detected via CSF cytology. As such, diagnosis and surveillance of LM require full neuraxial MRI and CSF analysis to fully stage the burden of disease. The estimated incidence of LM from systemic malignancies is approximately 5–20% based on population and autopsy data; the true incidence of LM is likely higher owing to insensitivity of CSF cytology and asymptomatic leptomeningeal seeding.

Conventional treatment of LM includes intrathecal chemotherapy for those with adequate performance status, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) to cranial disease and/or involved-field radiation therapy (RT) to disease of the spinal cord and cauda equina, and systemic chemotherapies with adequate central nervous system (CNS) penetration (Fig. 1). Symptoms referrable to increased intracranial pressure can be ameliorated with palliative ventriculoperitoneal shunting. For those without abnormal CSF flow dynamics, commonly used intrathecal therapy options include methotrexate, thiotepa, and topotecan. No single intrathecal chemotherapy has emerged as providing a significant survival benefit, and their use is associated with increased neurotoxicity risk.

### Serum exosomal miRNA contributes to the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis [^55bc6faa]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is complication of advanced tumor, caused by cancer cells involvement of the leptomeninges. Among solid tumors, patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are most commonly occur meningeal carcinomatosis. About 3–8% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop LC, and the incidence of LC appears to be increasing, possibly due to advances in diagnostic and treatment techniques that have led to more NSCLC patients achieving long-term survival, allowing LC to develop. The prognosis for LC is extremely poor. The median OS for untreated LC patients is only 4–6 weeks. One reason for the dismal prognosis of LC could be the delay in treatment due to untimely diagnosis. Therefore, the diagnosis of LC without delay is considered crucial.

However, underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of LC are common. LC diagnosis could be challenging. This is due to the frequently nonspecific symptoms of LC and the lack of sensitivity of currently diagnostic techniques. There are two diagnostic methods used in clinical diagnosis of LC: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, these two techniques are of limited sensitivity and often require repeated lumbar puncture and MRI. It is urgent to find new diagnostic methods to improve the detection rate of LC.

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles with a diameter of 40 to 160 nm, which have been proved to be useful as biomarkers for cancer early detection, early diagnosis, prognosis prediction. Exosomes be used as tools for intercellular material and information exchange to transfer information molecules proteins, lipids, DNA, RNA and other molecular information between cells. miRNAs are enriched in exosomes and play vital roles in gene regulation. Exosomal miRNAs play key players in the occurrence and development of lung cancer and have been studied as diagnostic biomarkers for lung cancer metastasis.

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the exosomal miRNA profiles of patients with LC and then their diagnostic potential was evaluated. Subsequently, the specifically enriched miRNAs were tested individually or in different combinations for their feasibility as diagnostic markers for LC.

Diagnostic Methods

Radiology

LM are often, but not universally, detected on neuraxial contrast-enhanced imaging, appearing as linear or nodular deposits coating cranial and spinal nerves, cerebral sulci, cerebellar folia, and spinal cord (Figure 2). Leptomeningeal deposits may either be diffuse or focal. Brain and total spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality over computed topography scans due to superior resolution. Consistent radiographic measurement of LM is fraught with challenges, however, due to (1) ill-defined and often small (< 5 mm) deposits, (2) inter-scan variability due to thick 2D image slices, gaps, and patient positioning, (3) appearance of at times non-enhancing disease visible only on T2-weighted images, and (4) technical differences between MRIs performed across facilities.

Epidemiology

The incidence of LM is challenging to quantify. Large-scale population and autopsy-based analyses provide an estimation of brain metastase incidence per cancer subtype. However, reliable data on the most basic epidemiologic features of LM (eg, incidence, survival, and cause of death) are lacking because such encompassing surveys have not been conducted specifically for LM, and those that exist utilize relatively insensitive diagnostic criteria which have often been inconsistently applied. Smaller institutional reviews and autopsy studies have quoted the incidence of LM in advanced malignancies to approximate 9%–25% for small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, 5%–20% for breast cancer, and 6%–18% for melanoma.

Even more elusive is the prognosis of LM stratified by factors such as age, tumor histology, molecular features, and clinical characteristics. Among patients with brain metastases and despite improving treatments for CNS dissemination, the presence of LM remains an independent predictor of inferior survival. Studies addressing the vital questions of treatment and prophylaxis of LM depend on high-quality data not only about incidence and outcome, but also how these endpoints are modified by common and prognostically important variables. A "historical median survival" of 2–4 months has been applied to all patients with newly diagnosed LM, and has served, often inappropriately, as a survival benchmark for many clinical trials in this patient population. However, despite the generally incurable nature of LM, modern therapeutics have introduced more heterogeneity in leptomeningeal progression-free and overall survival, with certain patient populations far exceeding this historical survival estimate. Consequently, prognostic discussions with patients and the design of clinical trials should not rely on an outdated "one size fits all" survival estimate, and large, contemporary population-based data are needed to provide more granularity to this topic.

In recent years, the diagnosis and management of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis have gained increased attention as patients with neoplasms live longer and the condition becomes more common. Conclusive hallmarks of this disease have yet to be identified. We report and discuss a case of massive invasion of the cerebral leptomeninges by neoplastic cells from a malignant melanoma in a shoulder. Symptoms of cerebral dysfunction were the first indication of neoplasm. The onset of symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging, and patient death all occurred within a brief time span. To our knowledge, this is the first case of meningeal melanomatosis in a patient not treated with chemotherapeutic drugs in which the radiologic evidence is virtually synchronous with direct anatomic observation. Thus the images provided with this report may be of use in the radiographic diagnosis of cerebrospinal metastatic colonization.

In conclusion, our results show that treatment of patients with LMD with combined ipilimumab and nivolumab can demonstrate both intra- and extracranial clinical activity leading to extended overall survival compared to historical controls. The safety profile of this combined regimen was similar to previous reports and did not demonstrate excessive neurological or autoimmune toxicity. Further study of ICI in patients with LMD is needed in larger patient populations and in combination with other therapeutic modalities such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis: retrospective review of a large series… [^ef18bad9]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with a solid tumor and LMC confirmed by CSF -positive cytology, diagnosed at our institution between January 2013 and November 2020. Clinical, imaging and cytologic data were collected. We used multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for age and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status to test the prognostic impact of clinical and treatment-related variables. Results: A total of 73 patients with LMC were identified, 75% female. The most common cancers were breast, lung, and melanoma. Most patients presented with intracranial hypertension, followed by cerebellar symptoms, radiculopathy, cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and other.

More than half of patients had evidence of leptomeningeal involvement only, while 25% of patients had known central nervous system metastases and 19% were diagnosed simultaneously with CNS metastases. Median time from primary tumor diagnosis to LMC was 32 months. Median overall survival was 1. 57 months, with 15% of patients alive at 6 months. Patients with gynecological and lung cancer had the best mOS, and patients with melanoma had the worst mOS. mOS in patients with evidence of meningeal involvement by MRI was 41 days, compared to 71. 5 days in patients with a negative MRI. Conclusions: In this large series of patients diagnosed with LMC based on positive CSF cytology, the outcome was poor.

Absence of leptomeningeal involvement by MRI and switching to a new treatment regimen were associated with a better outcome, likely reflecting tumor burden and patient selection. LMC will likely become more common as systemic treatment options and imaging improve and effective treatment options are an urgent and yet unmet need.

### Cerebrospinal fluid analysis [^0607b79e]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a diagnostic tool for many conditions affecting the central nervous system. Urgent indications for lumbar puncture include suspected central nervous system infection or subarachnoid hemorrhage. CSF analysis is not necessarily diagnostic but can be useful in the evaluation of other neurologic conditions, such as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and malignancy. Bacterial meningitis has a high mortality rate and characteristic effects on CSF white blood cell counts, CSF protein levels, and the CSF:serum glucose ratio. CSF culture can identify causative organisms and antibiotic sensitivities. Viral meningitis can present similarly to bacterial meningitis but usually has a low mortality rate. Adjunctive tests such as CSF lactate measurement, latex agglutination, and polymerase chain reaction testing can help differentiate between bacterial and viral causes of meningitis. Immunocompromised patients may have meningitis caused by tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, or fungal or parasitic infections. Subarachnoid hemorrhage has a high mortality rate, and rapid diagnosis is key to improve outcomes. Computed tomography of the head is nearly 100% sensitive for subarachnoid hemorrhage in the first six hours after symptom onset, but CSF analysis may be required if there is a delay in presentation or if imaging findings are equivocal. Xanthochromia and an elevated red blood cell count are characteristic CSF findings in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can mimic central nervous system infection. It has a poor prognosis, and large-volume CSF cytology is diagnostic.

### Leptomeningeal metastasis [^2cae99fe]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Leptomeningeal metastasis occurs in approximately 5% of all patients with cancer. This review summarizes recent literature regarding methods of diagnosis and treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis.

Recent Findings

Staging of leptomeningeal metastasis should include contrast-enhanced brain and spine MRI, and though controversial, radionuclide cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow study. Treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis often requires involved-field radiotherapy to bulky or symptomatic disease sites as well as intra-CSF and systemic chemotherapy. The use of high-dose systemic therapy may benefit patients with leptomeningeal metastasis and obviate the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy. Intra-CSF drug therapy primarily utilizes one of three chemotherapeutic agents [i.e. methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside (both free and liposomal) and thio-tetraethylenepentamine] administered by a variety of schedules either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Novel intra-CSF agents increasingly utilized in the treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis are targeted mAbs such as rituximab and trastuzumab.

Summary

Although treatment of leptomeningeal metastasis is palliative with median patient survival of 2–3 months, treatment may afford stabilization and protection from further neurologic deterioration in patients with leptomeningeal metastasis.

### Retrospective study of leptomeningeal metastasis: unveiling the indolent and rapid progression phases [^eb28f7c8]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a severe cancer complication with poor prognosis and inconsistent treatment. Most studies are from Western countries, limiting understanding of LM in the Chinese population. This study aims to explore LM characteristics in Chinese patients and develop tailored treatment strategies.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 103 Chinese LM patients, all confirmed by CSF cytology, from 2015 to 2024. Data on demographics, medical history, imaging, and follow-up were gathered. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan - Meier method, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed, and patients were stratified into risk groups based on these factors.

Results

The median age was 54.99 ± 11.18 years, with 53.4% being female. Lung cancer was the primary tumor in 76.7% of patients. Headache was the most common symptom. The median survival was 441 days. Primary tumor site, CSF tumor cell proportion, and asymptomatic status at diagnosis were independent prognostic factors. The nomogram's C - index was 0.81. We identified two distinct groups of LM patients with markedly different characteristics, which we designated as the indolent and rapid progression phases of LM.

Conclusions

The clinical characteristics of LM patients with positive CSF cytology at the center were described, with a longer median survival than previously reported. The developed nomogram demonstrated potential clinical predictive value. Two distinct LM patient groups were identified: the indolent and rapid progression phases, which hold significant clinical relevance.

### Radiation therapy in the management of leptomeningeal disease from solid tumors [^a03abf32]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is the spread of malignancy into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled leptomeningeal space surrounding the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS). Although 20% to 30% of patients with metastatic disease and neurologic symptoms harbor LMD at autopsy, LMD is clinically detected in only 5% to 10% of patients with solid tumors. The incidence of LMD varies with histology, with lung and breast cancers being most commonly associated with LMD (5%-25%), followed by melanoma (6%-18%) and gastrointestinal malignancies (4%-14%). Mutation status may also relate to LMD risk, particularly for the epidermal growth factor receptor family of mutations. The incidence of clinically detected LMD is thought to be rising because of a combination of improved imaging techniquesand improved control of extra-CNS disease (ECD).

The page cautions: "Caution is indicated in patients who are anticoagulated, thrombocytopenic, or who have a bulky intracranial mass". It adds, "When available, assessment of CSF-tDNA increases sensitivity of tumor cell detection and assessment of response to treatment", and "Opening pressure should be recorded and consideration should be made of palliative CSF diversion for symptomatic benefit or hydrocephalus". In immunotherapy settings, "CSF sampling rather than just MRI enhancement is suggested as evidence of leptomeningeal metastases, in order to exclude immune-related aseptic meningitis". For cytology sampling, "If CSF is not positive for tumor cells, a second lumbar puncture is sometimes helpful. This is a volume-dependent test, and ideally ≥ 10 mL should be sent for cytologic analysis".

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma [^c504be18]. Head & Neck (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is an uncommon neoplasm characterized by local extension and an aggressive course. Treatment often includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery, although the optimal strategy remains unclear. Here, we present the first reported case of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis from SNUC.

Methods and Results

A 28-year-old man with rapidly progressive headaches, congestion, and exophthalmos was found to have a nasal mass. Biopsy revealed sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. He had a transient response to chemotherapy followed by a sustained response to concurrent chemoradiation. At the completion of radiation, he developed subtle neurologic findings and MRI revealed diffuse, bulky leptomeningeal spread. He was able to receive only a single fraction of external beam radiation to his spinal axis before his disease rapidly progressed, leading to respiratory failure and death.

Conclusions

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma can be associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, which can lead to a fulminant clinical course.

### Metastatic disease of the brain: extra-axial metastases (skull, dura, leptomeningeal) and tumour spread [^2a26b103]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Extra-axial intracranial metastases may arise through several situations. Hematogenous spread to the meninges is the most frequent cause. Direct extension from contiguous extra-cranial neoplasms, secondary invasion of the meninges by calvarium and skull base metastases, and migration along perineural or perivascular structures are less common. Leptomeningeal invasion gives rise to tumour cell dissemination by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), eventually leading to neoplastic coating of brain surfaces. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is complementary to CSF examinations and can be invaluable, detecting up to 50% of false-negative lumbar punctures. MR findings range from diffuse linear leptomeningeal enhancement to multiple enhancing extra-axial nodules, obstructive communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Both calvarial and epidural metastases infrequently transgress the dura, which acts as a barrier against tumour spread. Radionuclide bone studies are still a valuable screening test to detect bone metastases. With computed tomography (CT) and MR, bone metastases extending intracranially and primary dural metastases show the characteristic biconvex shape, usually associated with brain displacement away from the inner table. Although CT is better in detecting skull base erosion, MR is more sensitive and provides more detailed information about dural involvement. Perineural and perivascular spread from head and neck neoplasms require thin-section contrast-enhanced MR.

### Leptomeningeal metastases: a RANO proposal for response criteria [^4df31a99]. Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) currently lack standardization with respect to response assessment. A Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group with expertise in LM developed a consensus proposal for evaluating patients treated for this disease. Three basic elements in assessing response in LM are proposed: a standardized neurological examination, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cytology or flow cytometry, and radiographic evaluation. The group recommends that all patients enrolling in clinical trials undergo CSF analysis (cytology in all cancers; flow cytometry in hematologic cancers), complete contrast-enhanced neuraxis MRI, and in instances of planned intra-CSF therapy, radioisotope CSF flow studies. In conjunction with the RANO Neurological Assessment working group, a standardized instrument was created for assessing the neurological exam in patients with LM. Considering that most lesions in LM are nonmeasurable and that assessment of neuroimaging in LM is subjective, neuroimaging is graded as stable, progressive, or improved using a novel radiological LM response scorecard. Radiographic disease progression in isolation (ie, negative CSF cytology/flow cytometry and stable neurological assessment) would be defined as LM disease progression. The RANO LM working group has proposed a method of response evaluation for patients with LM that will require further testing, validation, and likely refinement with use.

Contrast-enhanced 3D fast spin-echo T1 black-blood imaging selectively suppresses the signal of blood flow and could provide a higher contrast-to-noise ratio compared with contrast-enhanced 3D ultrafast gradient recalled echo (contrast-enhanced gradient recalled echo) and 2D spin-echo T1WI (contrast-enhanced spin-echo). The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether black-blood imaging can improve the diagnostic accuracy for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis compared with contrast-enhanced gradient recalled-echo and contrast-enhanced spin-echo and, furthermore, to determine whether the grade of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis evaluated on black-blood imaging is a significant predictor of progression-free survival.

Materials and Methods

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (n = 78) and healthy (n = 31) groups were enrolled. Contrast-enhanced gradient recalled-echo, contrast-enhanced spin-echo, and black-blood imaging were separately reviewed, and a diagnostic rating (positive, indeterminate, or negative) and grading of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis were assigned. The diagnostic accuracies of the 3 imaging sequences were compared in terms of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis detection. The Kaplan-Meier and the Cox proportional hazards model analyses were performed to determine the relationship between the leptomeningeal carcinomatosis grade evaluated on black-blood imaging and progression-free survival.

Results

Black-blood imaging showed a significantly higher sensitivity (97.43%) than contrast-enhanced gradient recalled-echo (64.1%) and contrast-enhanced spin-echo (66.67%) (P < .05). In terms of specificities, we did not find any significant differences among contrast-enhanced gradient recalled-echo (90.32%), contrast-enhanced spin-echo (90.32%), and black-blood imaging (96.77%) (P > .05). A Cox proportional hazards model identified the time to metastasis, Karnofsky Performance Scale status, and a combination of the leptomeningeal carcinomatosis grade with a linear pattern as independent predictors of progression-free survival (P < .05).

Conclusions

Black-blood imaging can improve the diagnostic accuracy and predict progression-free survival in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in leptomeningeal disease with or without brain metastasis: insights from an explorative data analysis of the charitéLMD registry [^15cb876d]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient cohort

Patients with known underlying solid tumor malignancy and evidence of leptomeningeal spread (LMD) and presence of BrM before the diagnosis of LMD or at diagnosis of LMD were included in this study with signs of LMD via cranial MRI (cMRI) and/or spinal MRI (sMRI) and/or positive lumbar puncture with detection of tumor cells via CSF analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). Patients with hematologic malignancy or primary central nervous system malignancy were excluded. Patients were retrospectively and, in part, prospectively identified and treated at a tertiary care center between January 2011 and April 2024. All eligible cases were included in this study. Clinical variables of interest were based on previous studies in the field. They involved demographics, radiological characteristics, pathology-related characteristics at baseline (i.e. diagnosis date of LMD), previous treatment modalities before a diagnosis of LMD, and treatment modalities after diagnosis of LMD and were extracted from patient records. Stratification according to classic LMD and nodular LMD was based on the classification of Turner et al. Radiologic tumor assessment related to intracranial disease, or the central nervous system and EcM burden was determined based on cMRI with or without sMRI scan at the time of LMD diagnosis and a CT staging 2 months before or after LMD diagnosis following the discretion of the treating physician and based on retrospective patient chart reviews without central confirmation according to standardized response evaluation criteria response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria and response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1), respectively. Tumor response on cMRI or CT staging was classified into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) for all included patients. Information on molecular pathology was extracted from institutional neuropathology or pathology reports on either tumor tissue or extracranial tumor tissue. Lack of CNS parenchymal disease or CNS status is henceforth defined as patients without a previous history of BrM before LMD diagnosis and lack of presence of BrM at the time of LMD diagnosis.

### 18F-choline PET / CT in leptomeningeal breast cancer metastases [^2d39f09a]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of 47-year-old woman affected by human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive breast cancer with a diffuse leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. An intense uptake of F-choline was reported at fused PET/MRI images in the brain, compatible with a diffuse leptomeningeal disease. This case highlights that F-choline PET would be used for the identification of leptomeningeal involvement in patients affected by breast cancer, as a support of MRI images.

METHODS

Study Design

This study is a retrospective analysis of a single-center database conducted after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Patient consent was waived by the Ethics Committee.

Patient Identification

The study population comprises patients with HER2-positive breast cancer diagnosed with brain metastasis between January 2013 and December 2017. HER2-positive status was defined as either HER2 immunohistochemistry 3+ staining or amplification by HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization. Brain metastases were diagnosed by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with neurological signs and/or symptoms. Patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, defined as cerebrospinal fluid cytology positive for malignant cells and/or relevant imaging findings, were also included.

Procedures

Patients' records, including electronic medical records, were used to extract data according to a predefined case record form. Extracted data included demographic information, clinical examination findings including neurological examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage at initial diagnosis, tumor characteristics including estrogen and progesterone receptor status, HER2 receptor status, treatment details in (neo)adjuvant setting, site of first metastasis, sites of distant metastasis, treatment received before developing brain metastasis, local therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, or SRS) for brain metastasis, systemic therapies received after developing brain metastasis, radiological reports, disease status at various time points after developing brain metastasis, toxicities due to local therapies and/or systemic therapies, and death.

Treatment of Brain Metastasis

Patients with brain metastasis were treated on the basis of the number, size, and site of parenchymal lesions with at least one of the following treatment modalities: surgical resection, followed by postoperative RT (focal or WBRT), WBRT, or single-dose radiosurgery (SRS). Surgical resection was considered for single large lesions with midline shift or significant edema with none or stable extracranial disease and estimated life expectancy of more than or equal to 6 months. Focal RT was considered for lesions up to 3 cm. If the above criteria were not fulfilled, patients were treated with WBRT after surgical resection. Systemic therapies included lapatinib either alone or with capecitabine, trastuzumab, or trastuzumab emtansine. Patients with the leptomeningeal disease were treated with intrathecal trastuzumab along with systemic HER2-targeted therapies.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for leptomeningeal metastasis, more specifically with respect to laser interstitial thermal therapy, CNS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering laser interstitial thermal therapy in adult patients who have undergone stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases with subsequent imaging progression due to tumor progression, as it may be equivalent to craniotomy in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival. Individualize the choice of management based on the unique characteristics of the tumor location and the patient's clinical status.

### Diagnosis and treatment patterns for patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors across Europe [^de55173a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases are a late manifestation of systemic cancer which affects up to 10% of patients with solid tumors. Prognosis is poor, and overall survival at 1 year is only approximately 10%. Management depends mainly on general and neurological condition, primary tumor, and patterns of metastasis, notably absence or presence of concurrent systemic or solid brain metastases. Here we set out to characterize current practice patterns of diagnosis and treatment of patients with leptomeningeal metastasis in Europe. We prepared a web-based survey including 25 simple or multiple choices questions on best practice supplemented by eight case vignettes with various diagnosis and management options. The survey was sent to the membership of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor Group. Between April 7, 2016 and August 8, 2016, 224 colleagues from 26 countries initiated the survey, 115 colleagues completed the whole survey. There were major differences both in the general diagnostic and therapeutic approach, e.g., regarding the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow studies, intra-CSF chemotherapy, various types of radiotherapy, and even more so when selecting decisions on diagnostic and therapeutic measures for single case vignettes. Diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with leptomeningeal metastasis from solid tumors vary widely across Europe. Standardization of diagnosis and evaluation tools as well as controlled studies to improve the level of evidence for all therapeutic approaches to LM are required.

### 18 F-FDG PET / CT findings of leptomeningeal metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^689e4a19]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NC) is an epithelial tumor with distinctive prevalence in East and Southeast Asia. Most patients with NC only experience regional metastasis. In cases of distant metastasis, prognosis is grim. Leptomeningeal spread of the disease is a rare occurrence, which is sparsely described in the literature. We present a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of high-grade NC with leptomeningeal metastasis. Initial MRI lumbar spine demonstrated subtle findings consistent with leptomeningeal disease. These findings are easily discernible on 18 F-FDG PET/CT.

### Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and brain metastases in gastroesophageal carcinoma: a real-world analysis of clinical and pathologic characteristics and outcomes [^8ba5179a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Among the patients with BrM, the median age was 64.4 years. Most patients were non-asian (n = 93, 93%), and 63 patients (63%) were either current or former smokers. In terms of the initial gastroesophageal staging, 65% received a de novo stage IV diagnosis, while 35% initially had stage I-III diagnoses, subsequently experiencing recurrence, and progressing to metastatic disease. Concerning the presentation of CNS metastasis, 28% presented with de novo brain metastasis, and 72% developed brain metastasis during their disease course. Adenocarcinoma histology was observed in 86 patients (86%), while 14 patients (14%) had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Additionally, only 19 patients (20%) had an ECOG PS score of 2 or higher at the time of BrM diagnosis (Table 1).

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients with CSN metastases from gastroesophageal carcinoma (N = 120)

Abbreviations: ECOG – Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) SRS - stereotactic radiosurgery, WBRT – Whole Brain Radiation Therapy, NA not Applicable

In the population diagnosed with LMC, the median age was 53.6 years. Out of the total, 17 individuals (85%) were non-asian, and 12 individuals (60%) were either smokers or former smokers. Additionally, 16 individuals (80%) were diagnosed with stage IV disease at the time of GEC diagnosis. Notably, there were no patients with de novo leptomeningeal carcinomatosis; all cases of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis developed at some point in their course. All 20 individuals (100%) had adenocarcinoma histology, and 3 individuals (15%) had an ECOG Performance Status of 2 or higher at the time of the diagnosis of LMC as shown in Table 1.

Diagnostic methods

Among those with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in our study, 16 patients (80%) received a diagnosis solely through brain MRI without requiring further confirmation through a lumbar puncture. However, for the remaining 4 patients (20%), the diagnosis was established through a lumbar puncture. None of these patients were treated with intrathecal chemotherapy.

Leptomeningeal enhancement

Mild, widespread perivascular inflammatory infiltrates in the meninges are a nearly ubiquitous autopsy finding in all forms of MS and approximately 40–50% of those with SPMS have focal areas of leptomeningeal ectopic lymphoid tissue ("meningeal follicles"). Gradients of neuronal loss and cortical demyelination emanating from these follicles have been found at autopsy, suggesting a direct causative relationship to cortical lesion formation. Further, intrathecal production of inflammatory cytokines associated with lymphoid follicle activity (i.e. CXCL13, IFN-γ) has been suggested to predict cortical damage on MRI.

The potential importance of meningeal inflammation as a contributor to MS pathology led to the search for surrogate imaging biomarkers. Although meningeal pathology in MS does not cause post-contrast enhancement on T1-weighted imaging, it has long been known that this technique is not as sensitive to meningeal disease as post-contrast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. FLAIR is > 10 times more sensitive to small concentrations of Gd in CSF and is more sensitive to the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement (LME) in conditions such as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and infectious meningitis.

Although, at present, no study directly compared 3T and 7T images, a recent meta-analysis showed that, in MS patients, higher LME-proportions were found in studies imaging at 7T (0.79 [95%-CI 0.64–0.89]) compared to lower field strengths (0.21 [95% CI 0.15–0.29], p < 0.001).

With this knowledge, post-contrast FLAIR MRI protocols were tested as a potential surrogate biomarker of meningeal inflammation in MS (Fig. 3). A large study of delayed-acquisition, 3D FLAIR on 3T MRI showed Gd deposition in the leptomeningeal space in 25% of MS patients compared to 2.7% of controls. Two patients from this study later went to autopsy and cellular inflammatory infiltrates were found in regions of leptomeninges correlating to locations of enhancing foci during life, supporting LME as a potential surrogate of meningeal inflammation in MS.

### Leptomeningeal metastases: new opportunities in the modern era [^52b4e496]. Neurotherapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

While optimal enrollment strategies, endpoint determination, and biomarker selection in patients with LM require continued refinement, the expansion of LM-directed clinical trials in the last decade is highly encouraging. Clinicians must consider that most conventional treatments for this patient population, such as WBRT and intrathecal therapy, have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in controlled prospective studies. Therefore, enrollment into therapeutic protocols is paramount to adequately investigate newer translational approaches, and clinical trials should be prioritized whenever possible.

Leptomeningeal metastases — good risk criteria and treatment: Good risk status includes Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60, no major neurologic deficits, minimal systemic disease, and reasonable systemic treatment options, if needed. Management may include systemic therapy, intra–cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) therapy, and radiation therapy. For intra‑CSF therapy, if symptoms or imaging suggest CSF flow blockage, perform a CSF flow scan prior to starting intra‑CSF therapy; if flow abnormalities are confirmed, use fractionated external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to metastatic or painful sites of obstruction and repeat CSF flow scan, and high‑dose methotrexate if breast cancer or lymphoma. Radiation considerations include involved‑field RT (e.g., partial or WBRT, skull base RT, focal spine RT) to bulky disease for focal disease control and to neurologically symptomatic or painful sites, and craniospinal irradiation (CSI) for central nervous system (CNS) and CSF disease control in select patients with or without symptoms; "Use of advanced modalities to minimize toxicity, including techniques in maximizing bone marrow sparing, is recommended when considering craniospinal RT… In addition, careful assessment and monitoring of blood counts should be performed given risk of hematologic toxicity".

### Leptomeningeal metastasis from gynecologic cancers diagnosed by brain MRI [^94275832]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is rarely observed in gynecologic cancers. As gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (Gd-MRI) is highly effective for diagnosing LM, the aim of this study is to describe the clinical behaviors and outcomes of LM patients who were diagnosed by Gd-MRI. After securing institutional review board approvals, we retrospectively reviewed patient records. Eight patients were found to have LM from gynecological malignancies. Primary tumors included three ovarian cancers, one tubal cancer, one peritoneal cancer, two endometrial cancers, and one cervical cancer. Gd-MRI of the brain and the spine is indicated as the high-priority inspection for the diagnosis of this devastating complication.

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is a devastating sequelae of metastatic cancer. It has protean manifestations on imaging. An elderly woman presented to our tertiary centre with symptoms suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident. Investigations revealed no evidence of this. There was clinical, contextual and radiological evidence of an underlying neoplasm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated evidence of a rare morphology (anterolateral pontine leptomeningeal enhancement) in the presence of a probable concomitant lung adenocarcinoma. Other reports have previously described this same neuroradiology, seemingly always in association with lung adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this report is to highlight an unusual case and discuss its peculiarity and pathophysiology. Our patient is the latest documented of a small cohort with this constellation of clinical and neuroradiological features. This study demonstrates the importance of differential diagnosis in stroke medicine, specifically the need to consider neoplastic phenomena in patients admitted following putative cerebrovascular events.

Comparison of patient characteristics grouped according to involvement of CNS parenchymal disease

Of the total cohort of 188 patients, 145 had CNS parenchymal disease, and 43 had no CNS parenchymal disease. Notably, a larger but non-significant percentage of patients with CNS parenchymal disease had a lower KPS (≤ 70%) at the time of LMD diagnosis (59% vs. 77%, p = 0.073). Similarly, symptoms like headache (39.3% vs. 48.8%), as well as nausea (26.2% vs. 11.6%), and vomiting (15.9% vs. 2.3% were more common in patients with CNS parenchymal disease, however without any significant difference. There was a significant difference in the modality of LMD diagnosis: MRI was the primary tool for LMD diagnosis in the case of patients with CNS parenchymal disease (62.8% vs. 34.9%, p = 0.013), whereas in the case of patients without CNS parenchymal disease CSF sampling together with MRI was more frequently performed than in patients with CNS parenchymal disease (60.5% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.013) (Table 1, 2). Other entities (non-breast cancer, non-melanoma, non-NSCLC) were more significantly more frequent in the non-parenchymal disease group with 34 patients (23.4%) vs. 21 patients (48.8%) (p = 0.044). Interestingly, presence of extracranial metastases at the time of LMD diagnosis was more frequently observed in patients without any CNS parenchymal disease with 34 patients (79.1%) vs. 81 patients (55.9%) (p = 0.023). Regarding systemic therapies, 84.8% of patients with CNS parenchymal disease received systemic treatment before LMD diagnosis, with chemotherapy being the most common (38.6% in CNS parenchymal disease vs. 31.0% in non-CNS parenchymal disease). Targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors before LMD diagnosis were also more prevalent in the CNS group (64.1% vs. 55.8% and 75.9% vs. 83.7%, respectively) (Table 2). Following LMD diagnosis, intrathecal therapy was administered to a higher percentage of patients in the non-CNS parenchymal disease group via both lumbar punctures (16.3% vs. 11.0%) and reservoirs (14.0% vs. 7.6%). Post-diagnosis chemotherapy was more frequent in non-CNS parenchymal disease patients, with a diverse range of agents used. However, overall, the proportion of patients receiving classic chemotherapy was relatively low in both groups (12.4% for CNS parenchymal disease and 25.6% for non-CNS parenchymal disease). Chemotherapy, TT and checkpoint inhibitors were similarly distributed between groups (Table 3). Local therapies after diagnosis showed significant variability, with BrM resection and later radiation therapy being more common in CNS parenchymal disease patients (37.2% vs. none in non-CNS). Radiation therapy, particularly WBRT, was more frequently employed in CNS patients after LMD diagnosis (30.3% vs. 27.9%) (Table 3).

### Ocular symptoms secondary to meningeal carcinomatosis in a patient with lung adenocarcinoma: a case report [^e4e1115a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) is a rare and severe complication of a number of neoplastic processes. Hematologic tumors are the most frequent cause of MC, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodking lymphoma. Among solid tumors, the most frequent causes of MC are breast and lung adenocarcinoma as well as melanoma. The incidence of this complication is around 3% in breast cancer, 7% in lung cancer and 1.5% in melanoma. MC is the first manifestation of systemic cancer in only 5–10% of patients, although it is frequently seen in patients with disseminated systemic disease.

MC occurs when tumor cells reach the leptomeningeal space either through the blood, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by growing along nerve and vascular sheaths. As a consequence, most patients present with different multifocal neurological symptoms that may involve the cranial nerves (oculomotor, facial, cochlear and optic), the spine and the cerebrum. Ocular symptoms were first reported by Katz, being diplopia and vision loss the most frequent ocular complaints.

Early diagnosis and treatment are usually very complicated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting brain meningeal dissemination, although the spine should also be assessed by MRI or CT myelography. MRI may show focal or diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement as well as tumoral lesions. However, these findings are non-specific, and should be evaluated in the particular clinical context. On the other hand, CSF analysis should be performed in all patients with suspected MC. Malignant cells are detected in the CSF in only 50% of patients with MC in the first lumbar puncture. Therefore, repeated CSF sampling is usually needed. Finally, the CSF protein concentration (50 mg/dl) and the opening CSF pressure (> 25 cm H2O) are frequently elevated, whereas the glucose concentration (< 60 mg/dl) is usually decreased.
