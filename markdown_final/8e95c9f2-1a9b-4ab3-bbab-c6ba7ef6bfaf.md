## Question

How does a birth-control pill affect your FSH and LH levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how birth control pills affect FSH and LH levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism of action of combined oral contraceptives and whether they suppress gonadotropins. Then, I should verify the magnitude and timing of FSH and LH suppression during active pill days. Next, I will examine what happens during the hormone-free interval and how formulation choices modify that rebound. After that, I need to consider progestin-only pills and whether they suppress gonadotropins differently. Finally, I should review clinical implications for fertility testing and assisted reproduction, and close with a concise synthesis of the net effects on FSH and LH over the cycle.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) deliver exogenous estrogen and progestin, which exert negative feedback at the hypothalamus and pituitary to suppress GnRH pulsatility and thereby reduce LH and FSH secretion, preventing ovulation. This is well-established in FDA labeling and mechanistic reviews, so I should anchor on that before moving to nuances [^114YCwv5] [^113VnddU].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of suppression during active pills. During the active hormone phase, both FSH and LH are markedly suppressed, with many women showing LH and FSH levels below 1 IU/L, indicating near-complete pituitary-ovarian suppression. This has been documented in studies of the pill-free interval and in IVF pretreatment contexts, and is consistent with the pharmacologic intent of preventing the mid-cycle LH surge [^113GkcU3] [^114ardBW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the entire cycle. During the traditional 7-day hormone-free interval (HFI), gonadotropins begin to rebound: FSH typically rises by day 4, inhibin B by day 5, and LH and estradiol by day 6, reflecting partial reactivation of the axis. Shortening the HFI to 3–4 days blunts these increases and maintains tighter suppression, and adding low-dose estrogen during the HFI further attenuates the FSH/LH rebound, which is clinically leveraged to reduce breakthrough follicular activity [^115YFs53] [^115kSJDZ] [^115kSJDZ].

> I should double-check whether the ethinyl estradiol dose matters for this rebound. Indeed, higher EE doses (30–35 mcg) are associated with a faster and larger rebound of LH and FSH during the HFI compared with 20 mcg formulations, implying dose-dependent aspects of suppression and recovery; this helps explain why some patients on higher-EE pills experience more pronounced hormonal fluctuations in the HFI [^111rnNph].

> Next, I should review progestin-only pills (POPs). Initially, I thought POPs uniformly suppress FSH and LH like COCs, but wait, let me verify that assumption. In fact, POPs suppress ovulation in only about half of users and generally do not meaningfully suppress basal FSH and LH; their contraceptive effect relies more on thickening cervical mucus, altering tubal motility, and endometrial changes, so gonadotropin suppression is not a primary mechanism for POPs, especially during lactation where suppression is minimal [^114h3bxV] [^116q6A1Q].

> Let me consider clinical implications. Because COCs suppress FSH and LH, measuring these gonadotropins during active pill use can yield misleadingly low values that do not reflect true baseline pituitary function; guidelines advise interpreting ovarian reserve markers, including AMH and antral follicle count, with caution during hormonal contraception, and to avoid overcalling diminished reserve in long-term COC users without reassessment off therapy when clinically appropriate [^112L4N7u] [^113oV3bK].

> I will now examine assisted reproduction contexts. COC pretreatment is commonly used for cycle scheduling, but it can deepen pituitary suppression and, in some women, lead to low LH during stimulation, which may correlate with reduced ovarian response. Some reports suggest early pregnancy loss associations in subsets with profound suppression, and expert guidance notes that while pretreatment facilitates logistics, it may modestly prolong stimulation and increase gonadotropin dose without clear improvement in live birth, so use should be individualized and, when suppression is excessive, LH supplementation can be considered [^112kAoNw] [^111bApYf] [^1144K6wi].

> But wait, what if the formulation differs from traditional EE-based COCs? I need to check newer estrogens. A COC using estetrol with drospirenone showed less pronounced suppression of FSH and LH compared with ethinyl estradiol combinations, suggesting that the degree of gonadotropin suppression can vary with the estrogen component; this may translate to different rebound dynamics and tolerability profiles, though clinical outcomes remain under study [^114mfQpU].

> Let me synthesize the net effect. During active COC use, both FSH and LH are profoundly suppressed, often to near-undetectable levels, which prevents follicular development and ovulation. During the hormone-free interval, both hormones rebound in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, with earlier and larger rises on higher-EE regimens and blunted rebounds with shortened HFIs or estrogen supplementation. POPs, by contrast, generally do not suppress FSH/LH and rely on local mechanisms for contraception [^114YCwv5] [^115YFs53] [^111rnNph] [^114h3bxV].

Birth control pills suppress **FSH and LH** through negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis [^113VnddU], preventing mid-cycle surges and ovulation [^114YCwv5]. FSH and LH remain low during active pills and **rebound during the hormone-free interval**, especially with longer pill-free days [^115YFs53]; shortening the hormone-free interval or adding low-dose estrogen blunts this rebound and improves cycle control [^115kSJDZ]. Progestin-only pills suppress **FSH and LH less consistently**, relying more on cervical and endometrial effects [^114h3bxV] [^116q6A1Q]. Upon stopping pills, FSH and LH typically recover within weeks to months, though recovery may be delayed with long-term use or in older women [^114ardBW] [^113oV3bK].

---

## Mechanism of action

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) contain **estrogen and progestin** [^111eKWsi] that act via negative feedback to suppress GnRH, thereby lowering FSH and LH and preventing follicular development and ovulation [^113VnddU]. Progestin-only pills (POPs) suppress **gonadotropins less consistently**, with additional contraceptive effects via cervical mucus thickening and endometrial changes [^114h3bxV] [^116q6A1Q].

---

## FSH and LH levels during the active pill phase

During active pills, **FSH and LH are suppressed** to follicular-phase levels or lower, preventing follicular development and ovulation [^114ardBW]. Suppression is dose dependent: higher estrogen doses produce greater suppression, whereas lower doses allow modest gonadotropin activity [^114mfQpU].

---

## FSH and LH levels during the hormone-free interval

During the hormone-free interval, **FSH rises by day 4 and LH by day 6**, reflecting rebound pituitary activity and potential follicular development [^115YFs53]. Shortening the hormone-free interval to 3–4 days or adding low-dose estrogen attenuates this rebound and improves cycle control [^112xGALf] [^115kSJDZ].

---

## Recovery of FSH and LH levels after discontinuation

After stopping pills, **FSH and LH typically recover within weeks to months**; older age or long-term use may delay recovery [^114ardBW]. Most women resume ovulation within 3 months, but some experience transient delay.

---

## Clinical implications of altered FSH and LH levels

- **Ovulation suppression**: Low FSH/LH prevents follicular development and ovulation, providing contraception [^114ds7Vo].
- **Cycle control**: Stable FSH/LH levels reduce menstrual irregularities and dysmenorrhea [^notfound].
- **Fertility**: Temporary suppression is reversible; prolonged use may delay return to ovulation in some women [^113oV3bK].
- **Bone health**: Chronic suppression may reduce bone density, especially in adolescents and young women [^notfound].

---

## Variability in FSH and LH suppression among different formulations

| **Formulation** | **FSH suppression** | **LH suppression** | **Clinical notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Combined oral contraceptives (estrogen + progestin) | High | High | Consistent ovulation suppression [^112kvdBs] |
| Progestin-only pills | Moderate | Moderate | Less consistent suppression; rely on cervical/endometrial effects [^114h3bxV] |
| Extended-cycle COCs (84/7 or 365-day) | High | High | Reduced hormone-free intervals improve suppression [^115kSJDZ] |

---

## Summary of key findings

- **COCs suppress FSH and LH via negative feedback**, preventing ovulation [^113VnddU].
- **FSH and LH rebound during the hormone-free interval**; shortening this interval or adding low-dose estrogen blunts the rebound [^115YFs53] [^112xGALf].
- **POPs suppress FSH and LH less consistently**, relying on cervical and endometrial effects [^114h3bxV].
- **FSH and LH recover within weeks to months after stopping pills**, with variability by age and duration of use [^113oV3bK].

Birth control pills suppress **FSH and LH** through negative feedback, preventing ovulation [^114YCwv5]. Levels remain low during active pills and rebound during the hormone-free interval; shortening the interval or adding low-dose estrogen reduces rebound and improves control [^115YFs53] [^112xGALf]. Recovery after stopping is usually within weeks to months, though delayed in some cases [^114ardBW] [^113oV3bK].

Drug Interactions

Drug Interactions

Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of Zenatane to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects.
Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Zenatane and tetracyclines should be avoided because Zenatane use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines.
Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations ("minipills" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Zenatane therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from patients who can become pregnant who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for patients who can become pregnant who use only a single form of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with Zenatane. Therefore, it is critically important for patients who can become pregnant to select and commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least one of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS).
Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving Ortho-Novum®7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, Zenatane at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products.
St. John's Wort: Zenataneuse is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort.
Phenytoin: Zenatane has not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and Zenatane. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together.
Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and Zenatane. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together.

### Pituitary and ovarian hormone activity during the 7-day hormone-free interval of various combined oral contraceptive regimens [^111rnNph]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to investigate changes in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) during the hormone-free interval (HFI) of 6 combined oral contraceptives (COCs).

Design

Blood samples were obtained from 62 women.

Results

When COCs were grouped by ethinyl estradiol (EE) dose, there was a significant positive mean slope for LH and FSH during the HFI for the 30- and 35 mcg-EE doses, whereas 20 showed a gradual nonsignificant slope. All E2 slopes were significant. P remained suppressed with all doses.

Conclusion

A more rapid rebound of gonadotropin levels is found with higher doses of EE during the HFI.

Implications

This study showed a more rapid rebound of pituitary hormone levels among women using higher-EE-dosage formulations, which was demonstrated by the statistically significant slope for mean LH and FSH from day 1 to day 7 of the HFI. The degree of suppression did not vary across progestin generations. It remains to be established whether women who experience side effects during their HFI may benefit from using a COC with a lower EE dose to minimize changes in endogenous pituitary hormone levels.

### Twenty-one day administration of dienogest reversibly suppresses gonadotropins and testosterone in normal men [^1131VFkQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Androgen-progestin combinations are promising male contraceptive regimens. Optimization of these regimens includes the development of new progestins with more favorable biological properties. In this context we tested the effects of the progestin dienogest (DNG) on reproductive hormones and metabolic parameters in men. After a 3-wk control period, 25 men were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of 2, 5, or 10 mg DNG or placebo and 10 mg cyproterone acetate for 21 d (n = 5 subjects/group). Subjects were followed for 2 wk after cessation of hormone administration. Weekly blood samples, physical examinations, hormone and chemistry measurements, semen analysis, and sexual/behavioral assessments were performed. These parameters were compared among study groups and within each group at different time points throughout the study periods. DNG and cyproterone acetate administration resulted in profound suppression of gonadotropins and T with no change in SHBG levels. No adverse effects were detected in any subject. Hormone levels returned to baseline after stopping hormone intake. DNG is a potent suppressor of gonadotropins and T in men and does not induce adverse effects over a 21-d administration. DNG is a promising progestin to be used in clinical trials for male contraception.

### A randomized study of the effect of mifepristone alone or in conjunction with ethinyl estradiol on ovarian function in women using the etonogestrel-releasing subdermal implant, implanon ® [^115HvTJu]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Mifepristone alone or in combination with ethinyl estradiol (EE) can effectively stop an episode of uterine bleeding in women using the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant, Implanon® but could impair contraceptive efficacy.

Aim

To examine the effects of administration of mifepristone alone or with EE on ovarian function and cervical mucus consistency in women using Implanon.

Study Design

Women using Implanon were randomized to mifepristone 25 mg twice daily on day 1 plus placebo 1 daily for 4 days or plus EE 20 mcg daily for days 2–5. Measurements of serum estradiol (E(2)), progesterone (P(4)), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), cervical mucus examination and maximal follicle size (by vaginal ultrasound) were carried out at various times.

Results

Following mifepristone intake, there was a dramatic increase in E(2) levels ranging from 543 to 1183 pmol/L (p = .000), which was not correlated with maximal follicle size or preceded by LH or FSH increase. The increase in E(2) triggered an LH increase resulting in development of a luteinized follicle in four women with no evidence of ovulation. One of these women had estradiol and progesterone levels suggestive of ovulation, but no corpus luteum was seen. Almost all women had very low mucus scores, which did not correlate with E(2) levels.

Discussion

Despite a transient increase in E(2) levels after mifepristone, there was no evidence of subsequent ovulation irrespective of whether they also received EE. The mechanism by which mifepristone in the presence of etonogestrel results in a rapid increase in E(2) levels remains unclear and could not be related to any significant changes in FSH, LH, ovarian follicle dynamics or subsequent possible ovulation.

Conclusion

Pregnancy is very unlikely to occur if mifepristone and EE are given during use of Implanon to stop an episode of bleeding.

### Cetrorelix acetate for injection (cetrorelix acetate) [^112RSyPG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Due to a positive estradiol (E2) feedback at midcycle, GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH-surge. This LH-surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle, resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels.

Cetrorelix Acetate for Injection competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose-dependent manner. The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0.25 mg dose. This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with cetrorelix acetate for injection, which is consistent with an antagonist effect.

The effects of cetrorelix acetate for injection on LH and FSH are reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In women, cetrorelix acetate for injection delays the LH-surge, and consequently ovulation, in a dose-dependent fashion. FSH levels are not affected at the doses used during controlled ovarian stimulation. Following a single 3 mg dose of cetrorelix acetate for injection, duration of action of at least 4 days has been established. A dose of cetrorelix acetate for injection 0.25 mg every 24 hours has been shown to maintain the effect.

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of single and multiple doses of cetrorelix acetate for injection in adult healthy female subjects are summarized in Table 1.

Absorption

Cetrorelix Acetate for Injection is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, maximal plasma concentrations being achieved approximately one to two hours after administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix acetate for injection following subcutaneous administration to healthy female subjects is 85%.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with hormonal contraception… [^1156jS3o]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of Action COMBINATION ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS Most combination OCPs contain ethinyl estradiol and a synthetic progestin. These pills inhibit ovulation in most women. They also induce thickening of the cervical mucus, which impedes transport of sperm to the uterus. With perfect use, only 0. 1 percent of women become pregnant within the first year of using a combination OCP.
6. As the dose and potency of both estrogen and progestin increase, the incidence of breakthrough bleeding decreases. 11, 12 How the different pill formulations containing low doses of estrogen differ in their propensity to cause abnormal uterine bleeding remains unclear. 13 Three recent studies 14–16 have shown similar incidences of abnormal uterine bleeding with monophasic and triphasic low-dose pills.

A fourth study 12 found that women taking a triphasic pill had significantly less abnormal bleeding than those taking a monophasic pill. Changing to a 50-mcg OCP increases the dose of both estrogen and progestin. Side effects, including nausea and breast tenderness, may increase. Adding a second OCP on a daily basis is not a good option, because this doubles the estrogen and progestin doses, further increasing side effects. When OCPs are doubled, the progestin component tends to dominate; therefore, endometrial atrophy and subsequent irregular bleeding increase. 8 After one year of using medroxyprogesterone injections, up to 50 percent of women experience amenorrhea. With increasing duration of use, the incidence of amenorrhea may reach 80 percent. Women who use levonorgestrel implants less commonly have amenorrhea, and bleeding abnormalities tend to decrease after the first year of use. 23 compared levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol, and ibuprofen with placebo for the treatment of prolonged bleeding in women who were using contraceptive implants. Women in all three treatment groups had fewer bleeding days than those in the placebo group. Ethinyl estradiol was the most effective treatment, followed by ibuprofen and then levonorgestrel.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1111AmGS]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) — clomiphene citrate and tamoxifen — are detailed for dosing, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms, adverse effects, and regulatory status. Clomiphene citrate dosing is 25–50 mg orally every 1–2 days with T Max = 5 hours and T 1/2 = 5–7 days; it reduces negative feedback on pit gonadotropin release with a resultant increase in gonadotropins (LH, FSH), and adverse effects include visual symptoms, flushing, headache, and abdominal discomfort. Tamoxifen dosing is 20 mg orally daily and lists T Max = 5 hours and T 1/2 = 5–7 days; it inhibits hypothalamic and pituitary estrogen receptors blocking estrogen negative feedback on gonadotropin release, increasing hypothalamic pituitarygonadal gonadotropin release, and adverse effects include liver abnormalities, liver enzyme changes, ocular disturbances including cataracts, and thromboembolic events including deep venous thrombosis and stroke. Both agents are noted as not FDA-approved for use in males.

### Male hormonal contraception [^111Usf8D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Male hormonal contraception, based on the suppression of both gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, resulting in marked decrease in sperm production, is designed for couples in stable relationships where the male partner desires to assume family planning responsibilities using reversible methods. Two large scale, multicenter studies that used testosterone injections as the prototype male hormonal contraceptive demonstrated when azoospermia and/or very severe oligozoospermia were attained, contraceptive efficacy was equivalent to female hormonal methods. Current studies aim to find the androgen alone or androgen plus progestin preparations that are most efficacious, user friendly, and with least potential adverse effects. It is likely that injections or implants of androgens either alone or with progestins will become the first male hormonal contraceptive available within this decade. Further research and development include the use of selective androgen and/or progestin receptor modulators, nonpeptide GnRH antagonists, and agents with local actions on the testis for male contraception.

### Effects of oral contraceptives administered at defined stages of ovarian follicular development [^111idfqr]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To elucidate the effects of initiating oral contraceptives (OC) at defined stages of ovarian follicle development.

Design

Prospective longitudinal study.

Setting

Healthy volunteers in an academic research environment.

Patient(S)

Forty-five healthy women between the ages of 18 and 35 years, randomized to initiate OC when a follicle diameter of 10, 14, or 18 mm was first detected.

Intervention(S)

The OC administration at defined stages of dominant follicle development.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Fates of all dominant follicles and serum concentrations of E(2)-17beta, LH, and P before and after initiating OC.

Result(S)

No ovulations (0/16) were observed when OC use was initiated at a follicle diameter of 10 mm, 4/14 (29%) follicles ovulated when OC were initiated at 14 mm, and 14/15 (93%) ovulated when OC were initiated at 18 mm. When ovulation did not occur, follicles regressed or became anovulatory cysts. Peak LH and E(2) levels were lowest in the 10-mm group, moderate in the 14-mm group, and greatest in the 18-mm group. Peak endocrine levels in all treatment groups were lower than the historic reference group.

Conclusion(S)

Follicular development, ovulation, and endocrine concentrations were not suppressed effectively when OC were initiated at late stages of dominant follicle development.

### Risk-benefit assessment of ethinylestradiol using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approach [^113EAqBD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

In 8 out of 11 evaluated clinical studies comprising a total of 122 female HVs, there were reported increased incidences of breakthrough bleeding and/or higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), or progesterone in the comedication arm compared to the control arm. In the remaining three clinical studies comprising 84 female HVs, no reports of breakthrough bleeding were mentioned, although two out of the three clinical studies had no specific pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations of either efficacy or toxicity. In all but one of the clinical studies with reported incidences of breakthrough bleeding, coadministration of the perpetrator drug resulted in EE steady‐state mean AUC (AUC ss) of less than 1,000 pg/ml.h in the comedication arm of the study.

Although the exact mechanism(s) for the CVD risk of EE is still unclear, most of the CVD effects have been attributed to metabolic changes caused by increased hormonal levels. There is, however, no information regarding what steady‐state systemic concentrations of EE are expected to result in undesirable side effects. Nonetheless, there have been specific bans and/or withdrawals of EE formulations containing > 50 μg both in the UK and the US. 2, 3 In order to make an assessment of adequate EE dosing required to minimize the risk of both contraceptive failure and CVD, we selected 1,000 pg/ml.h as a lower threshold, given that the AUC ss for the comedication arm in the evaluated clinical studies with reported breakthrough bleeding were less than 1,000 pg/ml.h. The mean simulated concentration of 1,675 pg/ml.h observed for the 50 μg oral dose (Table 3) was chosen as the upper threshold associated with a risk for CVD based on the recommended ACOG guidelines. We thereafter determined how frequently within a simulated population of 100 subjects (10 trials of 10 HV women aged between 20 and 50 years), the AUC ss for different doses of EE: 20 μg, 35 μg, and 50 μg alone and in the presence of moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers was below 1,000 pg/ml.h, on the one hand, or above 1,675 pg/ml.h on the other hand.

### New endocrine method of oral male contraception [^113iV3NG]. Contraception (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential for hormonal male contraception (HMC) is the inhibition of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), the hormone responsible for spermatogenesis. No drugs exist that can selectively suppress FSH without also inhibiting luteinizing hormone (LH), the hormone responsible for the biosynthesis of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) in men. The consequences are a loss of T and E2, with the accompanying symptoms and signs of T deficiency and E2 deficiency, respectively. The loss of T causes sexual function problems, including reduced libido and problems with erection and ejaculation. Moreover, T is not orally bioavailable, and there is a lack of suitable, orally bioavailable androgens to replace the loss of T. This has led to the use of nonoral T replacements, such as patches, gels, or parenteral administration of T or other androgens in current methods for HMC under development. In case these new HMC methods do not contain a testosterone preparation that is metabolized into E2, the suppression of LH will cause loss of E2 and symptoms of estrogen deficiency. We propose to investigate a new oral endocrine approach for HMC using a triple hormone drug called MANTE (Male oral contraception by a GnRH ANtagonist, Testosterone and an Estrogen). This method combines three novelties: (1) the use of an oral gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist to suppress FSH and spermatogenesis, (2) a high dose of the natural adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone to replace T, and (3) a low dose of an orally bioavailable estrogen, preferably estetrol (E4), to prevent signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency.

### Relationship between serum gonadotropins and spermatogenic suppression in men undergoing steroidal contraceptive treatment [^111rhsj6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

This study aimed to establish whether the degree of suppression of serum FSH and LH was related to sperm concentration in three testosterone (T) plus progestin contraceptive regimens. We measured serum FSH and LH using a modified, highly sensitive immunofluorometric assay in samples obtained from three published studies using T enanthate (TE; 100 and 200 mg weekly) plus daily oral doses of cyproterone acetate (CPA; 5–100 mg), levonogestrel (LNG; 150–500 micro g), or desogestrel (DSG; 150–300 micro g). Overall, men with sperm concentrations below 0.1 million/ml had significantly lower gonadotropin levels (serum FSH, approximately 0.12 IU/liter; serum LH, approximately 0.05 IU/liter) than oligospermic men (sperm concentrations, 0.1–5 million/ml; serum FSH, 0.23–0.5 IU/liter; serum LH, 0.05–0.56 IU/liter), but the relationship was weak, indicating the possible existence of other determinants. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the influence of candidate predictors of spermatogenic effects of the T plus progestin regimens. In the LNG and DSG studies, the marked suppression of serum LH to less than 5% of baseline values (< 0.15 IU/liter) was a consistent and highly significant predictor of sperm concentration (reduced to 2–7% that seen at higher LH levels) and the likelihood of its suppression below 1 million/ml (a proposed threshold for contraceptive efficacy). Serum FSH was not a significant independent predictor. The use of DSG and CPA (but not LNG) was a significant independent predictor of sperm suppression, and regimens that contained 200 mg TE weekly caused less spermatogenic suppression than 100 mg TE weekly. These findings suggest that T-progestin contraceptive regimens suppress sperm concentration by gonadotropin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The suppression of serum LH is a major predictor of the suppression of sperm concentration suppression in the LNG and DSG treatment studies. On the other hand, the greater spermatogenic suppression in regimens containing DSG or CPA suggests that these progestins have additional actions to suppress spermatogenesis via a gonadotropin-independent mechanism(s)

### Novel male hormonal contraceptive combinations: the hormonal and spermatogenic effects of testosterone and levonorgestrel combined with a 5 α-reductase inhibitor or gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist [^115gjxaf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

We postulated that the addition of a combined types I and II, 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) or long-acting GnRH antagonist (acyline) to combination testosterone plus levonorgestrel treatment may be advantageous in the suppression of spermatogenesis for male contraception. This study aimed to examine effects of novel combination contraceptive regimens on serum gonadotropins and androgens and sperm concentration. This study was divided into three phases: screening (2 wk), treatment (8 wk), and recovery (4 wk). Twenty-two men (n = 5–6/group) received 8 wk of treatment with testosterone enanthate (TE, 100 mg im weekly) combined with one of the following: 1) levonorgestrel (LNG) 125 mug orally daily; 2) LNG 125 microg plus dutasteride 0.5 mg orally daily; 3) acyline 300 microg/kg sc every 2 wk (as a comparator for any additional progestin effects); or 4) LNG 125 microg orally daily plus acyline 300 microg/kg sc every 2 wk. Serum gonadotropin levels were similarly suppressed by all treatments, falling to a nadir between 1.2 and 3.4% and 0.5 and 0.8% baseline for FSH and LH, respectively (P < 0.05). Serum dihydrotestosterone levels were significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the dutasteride group throughout the treatment period to a nadir of 31% baseline (wk 7). No significant differences in sperm concentrations among treatment groups were seen. Severe oligospermia (0.1–3 million/ml) or azoospermia was seen in none of five and four of five in TE + LNG; two of six and four of six in TE + LNG + dutasteride; two of six and four of six in TE + acyline; and one of five and three of five in TE + LNG + acyline groups, respectively. There was one nonresponder in each of the TE + LNG and TE + LNG + acyline groups. We conclude that the addition of a combined types I and II, 5alpha-reductase inhibitor or long-acting GnRH antagonist to a testosterone plus LNG regimen provides no additional suppression of gonadotropins or sperm concentration over an 8-wk treatment period. However, further evaluation of the effects of these regimens on the testis (including testicular steroid levels and germ cell maturation) and the treatment of larger numbers of men (and for longer periods) may provide data to support their place in contraceptive development.

### Isotretinoin (sotret) [^111Hx6Mz]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions

Vitamin A: Because of the relationship of Sotret to vitamin A, patients should be advised against taking vitamin supplements containing vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects.
Tetracyclines: Concomitant treatment with Sotret and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin capsule use has been associated with a number of cases of pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines.
Micro-dosed Progesterone Preparations: Micro-dosed progesterone preparations ("minipills" that do not contain an estrogen) may be an inadequate method of contraception during Sotret therapy. Although other hormonal contraceptives are highly effective, there have been reports of pregnancy from female patients who have used combined oral contraceptives, as well as transdermal patch/injectable/implantable/vaginal ring hormonal birth control products. These reports are more frequent for female patients who use only a single method of contraception. It is not known if hormonal contraceptives differ in their effectiveness when used with isotretinoin. Therefore, it is critically important for female patients of childbearing potential to select and commit to use 2 forms of effective contraception simultaneously, at least 1 of which must be a primary form (see PRECAUTIONS).
Norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol: In a study of 31 premenopausal female patients with severe recalcitrant nodular acne receiving OrthoNovum®‚ 7/7/7 Tablets as an oral contraceptive agent, isotretinoin at the recommended dose of 1 mg/kg/day, did not induce clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone and in the serum levels of progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Prescribers are advised to consult the package insert of medication administered concomitantly with hormonal contraceptives, since some medications may decrease the effectiveness of these birth control products.
St. John's Wort: Isotretinoin capsules use is associated with depression in some patients (see WARNINGS: Psychiatric Disorders and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric). Patients should be prospectively cautioned not to self-medicate with the herbal supplement St. John's Wort because a possible interaction has been suggested with hormonal contraceptives based on reports of breakthrough bleeding on oral contraceptives shortly after starting St. John's Wort. Pregnancies have been reported by users of combined hormonal contraceptives who also used some form of St. John's Wort.
Phenytoin: Isotretinoin capsules have not been shown to alter the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin in a study in seven healthy volunteers. These results are consistent with the in vitro finding that neither isotretinoin nor its metabolites induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP 2C9 human hepatic P450 enzyme. Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together.
Systemic Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical studies have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between systemic corticosteroids and Sotret. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together.

### Update on male hormonal contraception [^114djNuU]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Testosterone plus Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonists

GnRH antagonists act by competitive binding to receptors and reduce both LH and FSH to undetectable levels. GnRH antagonists are very effective in suppressing spermatogenesis. Short-term studies have shown that the suppression of spermatogenesis by GnRH antagonists plus testosterone is profound. However, GnRH antagonists are expensive and the majority of them still require frequent subcutaneous injections. New long-acting depot formulations of GnRH antagonists, such as degarelix, are under investigation. Those new long-acting formulations may represent an option for male contraception but remain to be demonstrated. Therefore, until newly developed GnRH antagonists are marketed, these regimens do not represent a realistic option for male contraception.

Hormonal contraceptive transdermal regimes using testosterone and Nestorone: gel-gel combination

Nestorone (segesterone acetate) (NES) is a 19-norprogesterone-derived progestin characterized by the absence of androgenic, estrogenic, or glucocorticoid effects. It provides inhibition of gonadotropins through a negative feedback mechanism but it also inhibits local testosterone production directly in the testis.

Testosterone gel can be used together with NES gel. This combination used daily in healthy men has shown effective gonadotropin suppression.

A total of 56 subjects were randomized to receive one of these treatments: testosterone gel at a dose of 10 g, testosterone plus NES at a dose of 8 mg, or testosterone plus NES at a dose of 12 mg. Sperm suppression below 1 million/ml or less was significantly more probable in men treated with testosterone plus NES 8 mg (89%, p < 0.0001) and testosterone plus NES 12 mg (88%, p = 0.0002) compared with men treated with testosterone (23%). Adverse effects were minimal in all groups with 21% of subjects presenting mild or moderate acne.

Testosterone and NES can be combined into a single gel with reduced volume thus simplifying application and improving adherence. A phase IIb efficacy trial of a testosterone plus NES gel has been initiated enrolling 400 couples. If the men achieve sperm concentrations of ≤ 1 million/ml, the couples will enter a 52-week efficacy phase.

### A randomized double-blind comparison of the effects of clomiphene citrate and the aromatase inhibitor letrozole on ovulatory function in normal women [^111JBgTn]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the ovarian follicular dynamics of cycle modification with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole compared with clomiphene citrate in normal ovulatory women.

Design

Randomized double-blind controlled trial.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital.

Patient(S)

Nineteen ovulatory female volunteers, ages 18–35 years.

Intervention(S)

Subjects were monitored in one control cycle. Subjects then received either letrozole 2.5 mg daily or clomiphene citrate 50 mg daily on days 5–9 after menses.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Number of mature follicles, endometrial thickness and endometrial pattern at ovulation, and follicular profiles of LH, FSH, and E(2).

Result(S)

The number of mature follicles at the LH surge in natural cycles was 1.0 with an exaggerated response seen for treatment both with clomiphene and letrozole. There was no difference in the endometrial thickness at midcycle during either the natural cycles or the medicated cycles. LH surges and spontaneous ovulation were documented in all natural and medicated cycles. When measured daily, follicular profiles of LH and FSH are similar between the groups in both the natural and medicated cycles. In the medicated cycles, clomiphene results in a significant increase in E(2) levels, while E(2) levels in letrozole-stimulated cycles appeared lower than in natural cycles.

Conclusion(S)

Transient inhibition of aromatase activity in the early follicular phase with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole results in stimulation of ovarian folliculogenesis similar to that seen with clomiphene citrate with no apparent adverse effect on endometrial thickness or pattern at midcycle.

### Greater inhibition of the pituitary – ovarian axis in oral contraceptive regimens with a shortened hormone-free interval [^115YFs53]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that shortening the hormone-free interval (HFI) between cycles of 21 days of oral contraceptives (OCs) reduces pituitary secretion of gonadotropins and ovarian production of estradiol and inhibin-B.

Design

We used a prospective trial design comparing the standard 7-day HFI and shortened HFI during cycles, with an OC containing 0.03 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg of drospirenone.

Methods

Twelve current OC users initially utilized an OC in the standard fashion, with 21 days of active pills and a 7-day HFI, followed by 21 days of active pills with randomization to either a 3-day or a 4-day HFI. Nine daily blood samples were obtained for the measurement of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and inhibin-B, beginning with active pill 21 days before each HFI of the two cycles. Analysis of variance was used to compare hormones for 9 days bracketing the standard 7-day HFI and to compare, within individuals, the 7-day HFI and the subsequent shortened HFI.

Results

During the 7-day HFI, all four hormones significantly (p > .001) increased from baseline. FSH increased beginning on HFI Day 4, inhibin-B increased beginning on HFI Day 5, and LH and estradiol increased beginning on HFI Day 6. Subjects randomized to the 3-day or the 4-day HFI did not differ with regard to age and body size (p = .88) or initial hormone level (p = .67). Greater pituitary and ovarian suppression was seen with the shortened HFI for all four hormones (p < .001). Hormone levels in the 7 days after the last active pill of the second cycle did not differ (p > .4) between the 3-day and the 4-day HFI groups.

Conclusions

Shortening the HFI from 7 days to 3 or 4 days blunts increases in the pituitary-ovarian axis during cycles of OC use.

### Effect of progestin-only pill on pituitary-ovarian axis activity during lactation [^116q6A1Q]. Contraception (2003). Low credibility.

We have monitored effects of progestin-only pill (POP) on ovarian activity during breastfeeding. Twenty-one women, using barrier methods (BM) of contraception and 9 women on POP were enrolled 6 weeks postpartum (PP) and followed-up to 18 weeks PP. There was little change in plasma follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, and no differences between BM and POP. POP did not affect plasma estradiol. There was no difference between BM and POP in plasma inhibin B concentrations. The size of follicles was similar in both groups in all time points. There was an increase in the endometrial thickness from 6 weeks PP to 18 weeks PP in BM (3.7 ± 0.5 vs. 5.4 ± 0.6 mm, p < 0.05), but no differences within the POP group or between the treatment groups. POP does not suppress gonadotropins nor affect growth of ovarian follicles during breastfeeding. Thus, the contraceptive effect of POP is likely mediated through local actions at the endometrium and cervix in a manner similar to that in menstruating women.

### Impact of hormonal contraceptives on cervical T-helper 17 phenotype and function in adolescents: results from a randomized, crossover study comparing long-acting injectable norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN), combined oral contraceptive pills, and combined contraceptive vaginal rings [^113igPvg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and unintended pregnancies. Observational studies suggest that injectable hormonal contraceptives (HCs) increase the HIV risk, although their effects on genital inflammation, particularly HIV-susceptible T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, are unknown. In a randomized crossover study, the effect of injectable norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN), combined contraceptive vaginal rings (CCVR; NuvaRing), and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) on cervical Th17 cells and cytokines were compared.

Methods

Adolescents (n = 130; 15–19 years) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to NET-EN, CCVR, or COCPs for 16 weeks, then subsequently crossed over to another HC for 16 weeks. Estrogen, follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were measured. Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR isotope, and cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) expression by cervical cytobrush-derived CD4+ T cells was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Th17 cells were defined as CCR6+ and CCR10-. Cervicovaginal Th17-related cytokines were measured by Luminex.

Results

CCVR use for the first 16 weeks was associated with reduced Th17 frequencies and lower FSH and LH concentrations, as compared to NET-EN and COCPs, with FSH concentrations and Th17 frequencies correlating significantly. However, Th17-related cytokine concentrations (interleukin [IL]-21, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ) and CCR5, HLA-DR, CD38, and Th17 frequencies were significantly higher in CCVR than NET-EN and COCP. At crossover, CCVR users changing to COCPs or NET-EN did not resolve activation or cytokines, although switching from COCP to CCVRs increased cytokine concentrations.

Conclusions

CCVR use altered endogenous hormone levels and associated cervical Th17 cell frequencies to a greater extent than use of NET-EN or COCPs, although Th17 cells were more activated and Th17-related cytokine concentrations were elevated. While CCVRs may impact the HIV risk by regulating Th17 numbers, increased activation and inflammation may balance any risk gains.

### A randomized prospective trial comparing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist / recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) versus GnRH-agonist / rFSH in women pretreated with oral contraceptives before in vitro fertilization [^111RV9bM]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of oral contraceptive (OC) pill pretreatment in recombinant FSH/GnRH-antagonist versus recombinant FSH/GnRH-agonist stimulation in in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients, and to evaluate optimization of retrieval day.

Design

Prospective, randomized, multicenter study.

Setting

Private practice and university centers.

Patient(S)

Eighty patients undergoing IVF who met the appropriate inclusion criteria.

Intervention(S)

Four study centers recruited 80 patients. The OC regimen began on cycle days 2 to 4 and was discontinued on a Sunday after 14 to 28 days. The recombinant FSH regimen was begun on the following Friday. The GnRH-agonist group was treated with a long protocol; the GnRH-antagonist was initiated when the lead follicle reached 12 to 14 mm. When two follicles had reached 16 to 18 mm, hCG was administered.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The primary outcome measures were the number of cumulus-oocyte complexes, day of the week for oocyte retrieval, and total dose and days of stimulation of recombinant FSH. Secondary efficacy variables included pregnancy and implantation rate; serum E(2) levels on stimulation day 1; serum E(2), P, and LH levels on the day of hCG administration; follicle size on day 6 and day of hCG administration; the total days of GnRH-analogue treatment; total days on OC; total days from end of OC to oocyte retrieval; and the cycle cancellation rate.

Result(S)

Patient outcomes were similar for the days of stimulation, total dose of gonadotropin used, two-pronuclei embryos, pregnancy (44.4% GnRH-antagonist vs. 45.0% GnRH-agonist, P = 0.86) and implantation rates (22.2% GnRH-antagonist vs. 26.4% GnRH-agonist, P = 0.71). Oral contraceptive cycle scheduling resulted in 78% and 90% of retrievals performed Monday through Friday for GnRH-antagonist and GnRH-agonist. A one day delay in OC discontinuation and recombinant FSH start would result in over 90% of oocyte retrievals occurring Monday through Friday in both groups.

Conclusion(S)

The OC pretreatment in recombinant FSH/GnRH-antagonist protocols provides a patient-friendly regimen and can be optimized for weekday retrievals. No difference was seen in number of 2PN embryos, cryopreserved embryos, embryos transferred, implantation and pregnancy rates between the two stimulation protocols.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone and ovarian reserve: update on assessing ovarian function [^116aXZa4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Influencing Factors of Serum AMH

To properly interpret serum AMH levels, knowledge of factors that influence AMH levels is crucial. The majority of women of reproductive age use a type of hormonal contraceptive (HC), yet reported effects of HC use on serum AMH levels are conflicting. A systematic review by Amer et al, reassessing 15 studies, concluded that serum AMH levels in normoovulatory women decreased when HC was used for at least a year, and this effect was in the majority of the studies reversible after discontinuation of HC use. However, the extent of decline ranged from 14% to 55%, which could be explained by differences in type of HC use, duration of use, timing of AMH measurement during the menstrual cycle, and AMH assays used. Indeed, Landersoe et al showed in a retrospective study that serum AMH levels were 30% to 40% lower in women using the oral contraceptive or the progesterone-only pill, while in women using an intrauterine device, only a decrease of 17% was observed. In addition, both studies reported a decline in AFC, strongly suggesting that the change in serum AMH levels caused by HC use results from a change in follicle dynamics rather than a direct effect on AMH gene regulation. However, a direct effect of an altered gonadotropin and sex steroid milieu on AMH expression cannot be ruled out.

### Norethindrone (jencycla) [^114h3bxV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. Mode of Action

Jencycla progestin-only oral contraceptives prevent conception by suppressing ovulation in approximately half of users, thickening the cervical mucus to inhibit sperm penetration, lowering the midcycle LH and FSH peaks, slowing the movement of the ovum through the fallopian tubes, and altering the endometrium.

2. Pharmacokinetics

Serum progestin levels peak about two hours after oral administration, followed by rapid distribution and elimination. By 24 hours after drug ingestion, serum levels are near baseline, making efficacy dependent upon rigid adherence to the dosing schedule. There are large variations in serum levels among individual users. Progestin-only administration results in lower steady-state serum progestin levels and a shorter elimination half-life than concomitant administration with estrogens.

### The use of hormonal contraceptives in fertility treatments: a committee opinion [^1144K6wi]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — pretreatment hormonal contraception shows mixed assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes; a study of 3 consecutive months before IVF found improved implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in subjects using at least 3 months compared with non–oral contraceptive pill users and those using < 2 months, with a lower antral follicle count and reduced symptoms of hyperandrogenism while on hormonal contraception, and the benefit of a 3-month course may be, in part, related to the 70–90-day development of ovarian secondary follicles; however, a nested cohort and secondary analysis assigning 21–25 days before GnRH antagonist IVF reported lower clinical pregnancy (48.8% vs. 63.6%; relative risk [RR], 2.13) and live birth (LB) (36.1% vs. 48.1%; RR, 0.75) after fresh embryo transfer than spontaneous menses, and in frozen embryo transfer cycles a similar pregnancy rate but higher pregnancy loss (27.7% vs. 13%; RR, 2.13) with hormonal contraception–induced menses.

### Evaluation of pituitary-ovarian axis suppression with three oral contraceptive regimens [^115kSJDZ]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The study was conducted to evaluate follicular development and hormone patterns with three oral contraceptive (OC) regimens before, during and after the 7-day hormone-free interval (HFI) or 7-day ethinyl estradiol (EE)-supplemented interval.

Study Design

The study is a single-center, open-label, prospective, randomized trial to evaluate pituitary-ovarian suppression with three OC regimens containing identical hormones: 30 mcg of EE and 150 mcg of levonorgestrel (LNG).

Methods

After a standard 21/7 OC baseline cycle, subjects were randomized to one of three treatment groups: (1) three 21/7-day cycles of 150 mcg LNG/30 mcg EE for 21 days followed by 7 days of placebo (n = 10); (2) one 84/7-day cycle of 150 mcg LNG/30 mcg EE for 84 days followed by 7 days of placebo (n = 12) and (3) one 84/7EE-day cycle of 150 mcg LNG/30 mcg EE for 84 days followed by 7 days of 10 mcg EE (n = 11). Estradiol; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); luteinizing hormone and inhibin-B levels, ovarian follicles and daily symptom diaries were collected.

Results

Compared to subjects receiving placebo during the 7-day HFI, those receiving EE demonstrated reductions (p < .05) in both FSH and estradiol. Number of developing follicles was less after the 7-day EE interval compared to that after 7-day HFI. Subjects on the 84/7 and 84/7EE regimens reported less (p = .03) daily menstrual flow than those on the 21/7-day regimen. A trend (p = .06) toward reduced headaches during the 7-day EE-supplemented interval was noted.

Conclusions

Supplementation of the standard 7-day HFI with 10 mcg EE after 84 days of an extended OC decreased FSH levels and decreased the number of developing follicles.

### Effects of the zishen yutai pill compared with placebo on live births among women in a fresh embryo transfer cycle: a randomized controlled trial [^115NDY5x]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Zishen Yutai Pill contains 15 Chinese traditional medicinal herbs. It is produced under Good Manufacturing Practice, which can therefore ensure the uniformity among different batches. The detailed formula and dosage of the Zishen Yutai Pill are presented in the protocol (Appendix 1). The placebo was made up of pregelatinized starch, black iron oxide, refined honey, and dextrin. Both the Zishen Yutai Pill and placebo were obtained from Baiyunshan Zhongyi Co. Ltd.

The participants' ovarian stimulation protocol in this study was determined by the clinician. In the GnRHa long protocol, triptorelin (Decapeptyl, 1.25 mg, once) was administered on day 21 of the preceding menstrual cycle, subcutaneously. After 14 days of downregulation, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was started and was continued until the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. In the GnRH antagonist protocol, FSH was administered daily beginning on day 2 of the cycle. The GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide, Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) was given at a daily dose of 0.25 mg subcutaneously when the leading follicle diameter was 12–14 mm. In both cases, when the diameter of the leading follicle reached 18 mm or greater, ovulation was triggered with 10,000 international units hCG intramuscularly. Serum progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol (E 2) were analyzed on the day of hCG administration.

All participants underwent fresh ET. Oocyte retrieval was performed 35–36 hours after hCG administration, and ET was performed 3 days later. The maximum number of embryos transferred was three. Intramuscular progesterone at a daily dose of 40 mg was given as luteal phase support. Quantitative β-hCG estimation was performed 14 days after ET. The oocytes were inseminated approximately 4–6 hours after follicular aspiration by a conventional method or ICSI, according to sperm quality. Morphologic criteria were used for embryo scoring. On day 3, one to three good-quality embryos were picked for fresh ET. The good-quality embryos were defined as the cleavage stage embryo at level I. The cleavage-stage embryo at level I was defined as uniform cells in size and cytoplasm, with 0–10% cellular debris and no multinucleation.

### Demonstration of progesterone receptor-mediated gonadotrophin suppression in the human male [^112pPihy]. Clinical Endocrinology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Synthetic gestogens in combination with testosterone have potential as a male hormonal contraceptive, predominantly acting by augmenting suppression of gonadotrophin secretion. Little is known, however, of the effects of gestogens in the male. Gestogens have affinity for both androgen and progesterone receptors but the relative contribution of action at these two receptors in gonadotrophin suppression remains unclear. In this study the effects of progesterone, with no significant androgen-receptor affinity are compared to desogestrel, a synthetic gestogen with relatively low affinity for the androgen receptor, on gonadotrophin secretion in normal men.

Design

Subjects received either 50 mg progesterone intramuscularly (i.m.) or 300 micro g desogestrel orally daily for 7 days. Frequent blood sampling over 12 h was undertaken before and after drug administration. GnRH [100 micro g intravenously (i.v.)] was administered 2 h before the end of the frequent sampling period.

Subjects

Twenty healthy men were randomly allocated to the two treatment groups.

Results

Both progesterone and desogestrel administration resulted in decreases in the concentration of both LH and FSH secretion, as well as testosterone. Analysis of the pulsatile nature of LH secretion indicated that both treatments reduced LH pulse amplitude, and that progesterone reduced LH pulse frequency. Progesterone, but not desogestrel, treatment also reduced the increase in LH secretion in response to GnRH.

Conclusions

The effects of progesterone were at least as marked as those of a maximally effective dose of desogestrel. As progesterone has negligible affinity for the androgen receptor, these results are compatible with the suppressive effects of synthetic 19-norgestogens on gonadotrophin secretion in the male being mediated via the progesterone receptor, with its androgenicity contributing minimally to gonadotrophin suppression.

### Oestrogen-selective modulation of FSH and LH secretion by pituitary gland [^112tM9xt]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

The significant decline in testosterone and androstenedione, but not DHEAS, in the face of aromatase inhibition is much harder to rationalise. It is possible that inhibition of oestrogen locally in the hypothalamus and pituitary by the aromatase inhibitor, together with GnRH receptor downregulation by goserelin, resulted in profound combined suppression of LH levels, especially at the level of bioactivity, which is not totally reflected in the immunoassay results.

It is important to mention that the evidence presented above came mainly from animal studies. However, if we can extrapolate from the available animal data, it is pertinent here to point out another potential mechanism for aromatase inhibitors to enhance the efficacy of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) protocols, as we have recently reported. The ability of the aromatase inhibitors to increase endogenous FSH production by the anterior pituitary, even with pituitary GnRH receptor downregulation (as in the present publication by Forward et al), is an exciting approach to improve the outcome of ovarian stimulation particularly in poor responders in in vitro fertilisation protocols. We believe this area of aromatase inhibitor use warrants further investigation.

### Impact of hormonal contraceptives on cervical T-helper 17 phenotype and function in adolescents: results from a randomized, crossover study comparing long-acting injectable norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN), combined oral contraceptive pills, and combined contraceptive vaginal rings [^1147FJYp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and unintended pregnancies. Observational studies suggest that injectable hormonal contraceptives (HCs) increase the HIV risk, although their effects on genital inflammation, particularly HIV-susceptible T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, are unknown. In a randomized crossover study, the effect of injectable norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN), combined contraceptive vaginal rings (CCVR; NuvaRing), and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) on cervical Th17 cells and cytokines were compared.

Methods

Adolescents (n = 130; 15–19 years) were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to NET-EN, CCVR, or COCPs for 16 weeks, then subsequently crossed over to another HC for 16 weeks. Estrogen, follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were measured. Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR isotope, and cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) expression by cervical cytobrush-derived CD4+ T cells was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Th17 cells were defined as CCR6+ and CCR10-. Cervicovaginal Th17-related cytokines were measured by Luminex.

Results

CCVR use for the first 16 weeks was associated with reduced Th17 frequencies and lower FSH and LH concentrations, as compared to NET-EN and COCPs, with FSH concentrations and Th17 frequencies correlating significantly. However, Th17-related cytokine concentrations (interleukin [IL]-21, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor–α, interferon-γ) and CCR5, HLA-DR, CD38, and Th17 frequencies were significantly higher in CCVR than NET-EN and COCP. At crossover, CCVR users changing to COCPs or NET-EN did not resolve activation or cytokines, although switching from COCP to CCVRs increased cytokine concentrations.

Conclusions

CCVR use altered endogenous hormone levels and associated cervical Th17 cell frequencies to a greater extent than use of NET-EN or COCPs, although Th17 cells were more activated and Th17-related cytokine concentrations were elevated. While CCVRs may impact the HIV risk by regulating Th17 numbers, increased activation and inflammation may balance any risk gains.

### Drug insight: recent advances in male hormonal contraception [^112YCDoq]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Medium credibility.

As there are limitations to current methods of male contraception, research has been undertaken to develop hormonal contraceptives for men, analogous to the methods for women based on estrogen and progestogens. When testosterone is administered to a man, it functions as a contraceptive by suppressing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. Since these hormones are the main stimulatory signals for spermatogenesis, low levels of LH and FSH markedly impair sperm production. After 3–4 months of testosterone treatment, 60–70% of men no longer have sperm in their ejaculate, and most other men exhibit markedly diminished sperm counts. Male hormonal contraception is well tolerated, free of serious adverse side effects, and 95% effective in the prevention of pregnancy. Importantly, male hormonal contraception is reversible, with sperm counts usually recovering within 4 months of the discontinuation of hormone treatment. Because exogenous testosterone administration alone does not completely suppress sperm production in all men, researchers have combined testosterone with second agents, such as progestogens or gonadotropin-releasing-hormone antagonists, to further suppress secretion of LH and FSH and improve suppression of spermatogenesis. Recent trials have used combinations of long-acting injectable or implantable forms of testosterone with progestogens, which can be administered orally, by injection or by a long-acting implant. Such combinations suppress spermatogenesis to zero without severe side effects in 80–90% of men, with near-complete suppression in the remainder of individuals. One of these testosterone and progestogen combination regimens might soon bring the promise of male hormonal contraception to fruition.

Combined Oral Contraceptives

Combined oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).

### The impact of menopause on bone, zoledronic acid, and implications for breast cancer growth and metastasis [^115aEZuM]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Table 1.
Definitions of menopause at study entry in adjuvant breast cancer clinical trials

Hormones that vary during perimenopause include AMH, estradiol, FSH, LH, and inhibins A and B. Serum levels of AMH, which are detectable from before birth through menopause, decline continuously with age in healthy women and become undetectable after menopause. Low and rapidly declining AMH serum levels directly correlate with ovarian follicle reserves, making it a useful marker for ovarian function. Notably, serum levels of AMH are elevated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome but are very low in women with ovarian failure. Thus, AMH can act as a marker of ovarian function in women approaching natural menopause and in women with cancer therapy-induced artificial menopause.

Other hormones (i.e. estradiol, FSH, and LH) regulating ovarian function have more complicated patterns during perimenopause because their levels also fluctuate during the menstrual cycle. However, overall, serum FSH and LH levels increase as inhibin B levels decrease during the menopausal transition. Changes in these hormone levels are linked to age, as progressive increases in serum FSH levels have been observed with increasing age in regularly cycling women over 40 years of age. Furthermore, it appears that inhibin B levels drop when the remaining ovarian follicles have reached a critically low number. During peri- and postmenopause, FSH and LH levels rise. In contrast, estradiol levels remain relatively constant until late perimenopause. However, after the final menses, during late perimenopause and early postmenopause, estradiol levels decline rapidly, only stabilizing 2–3 years after menopause.

### Male contraception: where are we going and where have we been? [^117AezyA]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2019). High credibility.

The life course of a sperm

Spermatogenesis begins in the brain. The hypothalamus secretes gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to release luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones then act on the Leydig and Sertoli cells within the testis.

Leydig cells produce testosterone, which is secreted into the bloodstream. Serum testosterone supports a wide range of male functions and is a key component of the negative feedback loop that controls GnRH and gonadotrophin production. Testicular levels of testosterone are approximately 40 times higher than in bloodand support Sertoli cells in their role in spermatogenesis.

After release from Sertoli cells ('spermiation'), sperm progress through the seminiferous tubules and into the epididymis for storage, concentration and maturation to functional sperm. Finally, at the point of ejaculation, sperm are transferred from the epididymis via the vas deferens to the urethra and then out of the body (figure 1).

The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis and its role in spermatogenesis. CCBY 4.0 Licence – John Reynolds-Wright. Image accessible via6A. FSH, follicle stimulating hormone; GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone; LH, luteinising hormone.

Potential novel male contraceptives can be divided into those based on a hormonal approach, acting via gonadotrophin suppression, and non-hormonal methods. Hormonal strategies for male contraception involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis, using exogenous testosterone in combination with progestogen to drive the negative feedback response and suppress GnRH, FSH and LH. Exogenous replacement of testosterone prevents hypogonadal side effects from HPT axis suppression but is not delivered at high enough concentrations to support spermatogenesis directly. Non-hormonal methods can act at any point during spermatogenesis or can target sperm maturation, detachment, motility or transport out of the testis. This includes physical methods of infiltration of the vas with a dissolvable compound to block or damage sperm during their movement along the vas.

### Effect of basal luteinizing hormone (bLH) level on in vitro fertilization / intra-cytoplasmic injections (IVF / ICSI) outcomes in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients [^1165uZ1e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PCOS is clinically characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory failure, and polycystic ovary morphology. Its endocrine profile is characterized by increased levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone. The incidence of PCOS in women of reproductive age and those with ovulatory infertility is about 4–20% and 70%, respectively. Although there are several PCOS-related studies, the pathogenic mechanisms of PCOS are unclear. Serum LH levels are upregulated in PCOS patients and maintained at normal or low FSH levels, thus increasing the ratio of LH and FSH (LH/FSH), leading to the impairment of follicular maturation and infertility. This is caused by the changes in the specific pattern of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion in patients, abnormalities in the negative feedback mechanism of oestrogens and progesterone, and multifactorial influences, such as hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinaemia, and obesity. High basal LH levels can induce theca cells, promote testosterone secretion, and affect follicle development, thus decreasing oocyte quality and increasing the risk of miscarriage. As a result, oral contraceptives (OC) are usually routinely prescribed to women with PCOS for 3–6 months before they enter ovulatory promoting cycle to downregulate LH and T levels in the body, improving the efficacy of ovulatory treatment, and reduce miscarriage rates. However, it is currently controversial whether PCOS patients should take OC before IVF/ICSI treatment. Moreover, it is unclear whether elevated basal LH levels can impact the ovulatory effect and clinical outcome. Studies have found that the rate of spontaneous pregnancy within 3 months after stopping taking OC is significantly lower than that of the non-OC group, indicating that the effect of OC on pregnancy is persistent.

Early-onset LH peak in antagonist protocols affects oocyte, embryo quality, and clinical pregnancy outcomes. However, a transient abnormal increase in LH during the surge cannot affect the clinical outcome. Furthermore, it is unclear whether basal LH levels affect pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients. In this study, the effect of basal LH rise on ovulation induction and pregnancy outcomes in PCOS patients was retrospectively examined using antagonist protocols.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^111eKWsi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Hormonal agents — Combination oral contraceptive pills (COCs) contain both an estrogen and a progestin component. COCs were first approved by the FDA for contraception in the United States in 1960 and prevent ovulation and pregnancy by inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone and, subsequently, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones. Ethinyl estradiol levels have gradually decreased from around 50 to 150 μg per pill to as low as 10 μg. Second-generation progestins include levonorgestrel and norgestimate; these progestins are referred to as the gonanes, and third-generation progestins include less androgenic gonane progestins, such as desogestrel and gestodene. World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for COC usage eligibility are listed in Table VIII.

### Contraceptive selection for the endocrine patient: what an endocrinologist should know [^114VW4hZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Although endocrinologists specialize in the management of hormones, they often lack sufficient training in the appropriate use of the diverse array of available contraceptive options. All medical providers should possess a fundamental understanding of contraceptive methods for pregnancy prevention, but endocrinologists should have a deeper understanding of birth control possibilities due to the useful role of hormone-containing contraception in managing endocrine and metabolic disorders. This manuscript outlines the history of contraception and then evaluates both existing and emerging birth control options for women and men. Delving further, this review also explores the impact of individual sex steroids-estrogens, progestins, and androgens-used in hormonal contraceptive methods. In addition to their role as contraceptives, the influence of these exogenous hormones on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis warrants careful consideration. These effects extend beyond pregnancy prevention and can be instrumental in regularizing menses, sex steroid replacement, and androgen suppression. Finally, this review provides tailored suggestions for contraceptive usage in patients with endocrine disorders, ensuring comprehensive care and informed decision-making in clinical practice.

### Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists for assisted reproductive technology [^115aEBqb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists can be used to prevent a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) without the hypo-estrogenic side-effects, flare-up, or long down-regulation period associated with agonists. The antagonists directly and rapidly inhibit gonadotrophin release within several hours through competitive binding to pituitary GnRH receptors. This property allows their use at any time during the follicular phase. Several different regimes have been described including multiple-dose fixed (0.25 mg daily from day six to seven of stimulation), multiple-dose flexible (0.25 mg daily when leading follicle is 14 to 15 mm), and single-dose (single administration of 3 mg on day 7 to 8 of stimulation) protocols, with or without the addition of an oral contraceptive pill. Further, women receiving antagonists have been shown to have a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming comparable clinical outcomes for the antagonist and agonist protocols, these benefits would justify a change from the standard long agonist protocol to antagonist regimens. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2006.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists compared with the standard long protocol of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted conception cycle.

Search Strategy

We performed electronic searches of major databases, for example Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE (from 1987 to April 2010); and handsearched bibliographies of relevant publications and reviews, and abstracts of major scientific meetings, for example the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently screened the relevant citations for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different agonist versus antagonist protocols in women undergoing IVF or ICSI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data. If relevant data were missing or unclear, the authors were contacted for clarification.

Main Results

Forty-five RCTs (n = 7511) comparing the antagonist to the long agonist protocols fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in rates of live-births (9 RCTs; odds ratio (OR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.08). There was a statistically significant lower incidence of OHSS in the GnRH antagonist group (29 RCTs; OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.57).

Authors' Conclusions

The use of antagonist compared with long GnRH agonist protocols was associated with a large reduction in OHSS and there was no evidence of a difference in live-birth rates.

### Targeting elevated GnRH pulsatility to treat polycystic ovary syndrome [^1157Eo7J]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of JCEM, Fraser and colleagues conducted a phase 2a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigning 73 women (64 completed the study), aged 18 to 45 years, who met the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS (all women had hyperandrogenemia, ie, total testosterone > 1.7 nmol/L) to once-daily oral administration of either fezolinetant 60 mg, or 180 mg, or placebo (1:1:1) for 12 weeks. LH levels at 12 weeks were dramatically reduced from baseline levels by 8.2 IU/L after 60 mg and 10.2 IU/L after 180 mg of fezolinetant (vs by 3.2 IU/L after placebo). The interpretation of grouped LH levels is challenging because not all women were anovulatory and may have been at different points in their cycle at the fixed every-3 weekly assessment time points. Testosterone levels are more stable over the menstrual cycle and fell at 3 weeks from baseline levels by 19% with 60 mg, and by 32% with 180 mg of fezolinetant, and these reductions were maintained for the duration of the 12-week intervention period. Alterations in GnRH pulsatility are known to affect LH more than follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and fezolinetant (180 mg) induced only a small decrease in FSH levels by 1.5 IU/L. There were no changes in leptin or sex hormone–binding globulin at 12 weeks, but there was a trend toward a reduction in antimüllerian hormone (which has been posited to directly stimulate GnRH pulsatility).

Current and future hormonal approaches

Testosterone and Nestorone® (segesterone acetate) transdermal gel

A nestorone-testosterone gel (NES/T) has recently entered an international phase IIb clinical trial to establish efficacy and side effect frequency, supported by the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Population Council. Nestorone® is a novel potent progestogen with minimal activity at the androgen receptor, also licensed by the Food and Drug Administration as a combined vaginal ring for female contraception, not yet available in the UK. This is a patient-controlled, daily-dose method of combined progestogen-testosterone hormonal contraception. Minimal side effects are anticipated due to the relatively low dose of testosterone and progestogen delivered.

In the development of this approach, NES/T was shown to suppress FSH and LH to less than 1 IU/L (a level consistent with achieving contraceptive effectiveness in other trials) more consistently and effectively than testosterone gel alone. There was a significant decrease in sperm concentrations in the NES/T group despite the duration of treatment being only 4 weeks, and no differences in psychosexual measures between groups or from baseline.

Kisspeptin-based HPT suppression

Kisspeptin is a compound recently discovered to play a significant role in the regulation of GnRH release by the hypothalamus. The kisspeptin-neurokinin B-dynorphin pathway acts on the hypothalamus to upregulate and downregulate the release of GnRH. It has potential to be used both in patients with hypogonadism to increase GnRH and sex steroid production, and conversely to suppress GnRH production and thus the HPT axis as a potential contraceptive, but we are not aware of any current trials related to male contraception.

Lowering gonadotropin dose and/or supplementing with oral agents — In a retrospective GnRH antagonist cohort, reducing FSH from a fixed 225 IU daily regimen to 225 IU on days 1–3, 150 IU on days 4–6, then 75 IU on days 7–8 with 200 IU low-dose hCG until trigger was associated with lower OHSS rates (1.3% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.025), with live birth rates not reported. A Cochrane meta-analysis including 5 studies found a significant decrease in OHSS with oral ovulation-inducing medications (letrozole and/or clomiphene citrate) with or without gonadotropins versus gonadotropins alone (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11–0.41) without a significant difference in live birth rates.

Discussion of effective birth control methods can be a challenging process for clinicians because the adoption and consistent use of contraception may be influenced by patients' fears, myths, and misperceptions. Over the years, new progestins have been included in combination contraceptives or are used alone to provide effective contraception as well as to decrease androgenic side effects and ameliorate the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Alternative delivery systems and regimens have also been introduced to improve tolerability and continuance and convenience of use.

### Contraceptive-specific antimüllerian hormone values in reproductive-age women: a population study of 42, 684 women [^112yB7Sk]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine how the contraceptive-specific serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels compare across ages and percentiles in a reproductive-age cohort.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort.

Setting

Community.

Patient(S)

This study included US-based women of reproductive age who purchased a fertility hormone test and consented to participate in research between May 2018 and November 2021. At the time of hormone testing, participants were users of various contraceptives (combined oral contraceptive [n = 6,850], progestin-only pill [n = 465], hormonal [n = 4,867] or copper [n = 1,268] intrauterine device, implant [n = 834], vaginal ring [n = 886]) or women with regular menstrual cycles (n = 27,514).

Intervention(S)

Contraceptive use.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Age and contraceptive-specific estimates of AMH.

Result(S)

There were contraceptive-specific effects on AMH with effect estimates ranging from 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82–0.85) (17% lower) for the combined oral contraceptive pill to no effect (1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.03) for the hormonal intrauterine device. We did not observe age-specific differences in suppression. However, there were differential suppressive effects of the contraceptive method across AMH percentiles, with the greatest effect at lower percentiles and least effect at higher percentiles. For example, for women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill, the AMH level was 32% lower at the 10th percentile (coefficient, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65–0.71), 19% lower at the 50th percentile (coefficient, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79–0.84), and 5% lower at the 90th percentile (coefficient, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92–0.98), with other forms of contraception showing similar discordances.

Conclusion(S)

These findings reinforce the body of literature that shows that hormonal contraceptives have different impacts on the AMH levels at a population level. These results add to this literature that these effects are not consistent; instead, the greatest impact occurs at the lower AMH percentiles. However, these contraceptive-dependent differences are small compared with the known biological variability in ovarian reserve at any given age. These reference values enable robust assessment of an individual's ovarian reserve relative to their peers without requiring cessation or potentially invasive removal of contraception.

### Cetrorelix acetate (Cetrotide) [^115Er12h]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Due to a positive estradiol (E2) feedback at midcycle, GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH-surge. This LH-surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle, resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels.

Cetrotide®competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose-dependent manner. The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0.25 mg dose. This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with Cetrotide®, which is consistent with an antagonist effect.

The effects of Cetrotide®on LH and FSH are reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In women, Cetrotide®delays the LH-surge, and consequently ovulation, in a dose-dependent fashion. FSH levels are not affected at the doses used during controlled ovarian stimulation. Following a single 3 mg dose of Cetrotide®, duration of action of at least 4 days has been established. A dose of Cetrotide®0.25 mg every 24 hours has been shown to maintain the effect.

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of single and multiple doses of Cetrotide®(cetrorelix acetate for injection) in adult healthy female subjects are summarized in Table 1.

Absorption

Cetrotide®is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, maximal plasma concentrations being achieved approximately one to two hours after administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of Cetrotide®following subcutaneous administration to healthy female subjects is 85%.

Distribution

The volume of distribution of Cetrotide®following a single intravenous dose of 3 mg is about 1 l/kg. In vitro protein binding to human plasma is 86%.

Cetrotide®concentrations in follicular fluid and plasma were similar on the day of oocyte pick-up in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Following subcutaneous administration of Cetrotide®0.25 mg and 3 mg, plasma concentrations of cetrorelix were below or in the range of the lower limit of quantitation on the day of oocyte pick-up and embryo transfer.

### Long-acting FSH versus daily FSH for women undergoing assisted reproduction [^115omjSb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Assisted reproduction techniques (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) can help subfertile couples to create a family. It is necessary to induce multiple follicles; this is achieved by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) injections. Current treatment regimens prescribe daily injections of FSH (urinary FSH with or without luteinizing hormone (LH) injections or recombinant FSH (rFSH)). Recombinant DNA technologies have produced a new recombinant molecule which is a long-acting FSH, named corifollitropin alfa (Elonva) or FSH-CTP. A single dose of long-acting FSH is able to keep the circulating FSH level above the threshold necessary to support multi-follicular growth for an entire week. The optimal dose of long-acting FSH is still being determined. A single injection of long-acting FSH can replace seven daily FSH injections during the first week of controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and can make assisted reproduction more patient friendly.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH in terms of pregnancy and safety outcomes in women undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment cycles.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases, trial registers and websites: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, electronic trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, citation indexes, conference abstracts in the ISI Web of Knowledge, LILACS, Clinical Study Results (for clinical trial results of marketed pharmaceuticals), PubMed and OpenSIGLE (10 October 2011). We also carried out handsearches.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing long-acting FSH versus daily FSH in women who were part of a couple with subfertility and undertaking IVF or ICSI treatment cycles with a GnRH antagonist or agonist protocol were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias was independently done by two review authors. Original trial authors were contacted in the case of missing data. We calculated Peto odds ratios for each outcome; our primary outcomes were live birth rate and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rate.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with a total of 2335 participants. A comparison of long-acting FSH versus daily FSH did not show evidence of difference in effect on overall live birth rate (Peto OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10, 4 RCTs, 2335 women) or OHSS (Peto OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.60, 4 RCTs, 2335 women). We compared subgroups by dose of long-acting FSH. There was evidence of reduced live birth rate in women who received lower doses (60 to 120 μg) of long-acting FSH compared to daily FSH (Peto OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.91, 3 RCTs, 645 women). There was no evidence of effect on live births in the medium dose subgroup (Peto OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.27) and no evidence of effect on clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate or ectopic pregnancy rate.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of a medium dose of long-acting FSH is a safe treatment option and equally effective compared to daily FSH. Further research is needed to determine if long-acting FSH is safe and effective for use in hyper- or poor responders and in women with all causes of subfertility.

### Oral prolonged-release dienogest 2 mg and ethinylestradiol 0.02 mg in a 24 / 4-day regimen for polycystic ovary syndrome-associated hirsutism: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^112c5NDV]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although current international guidelines recommend COCs to regulate menses and control clinical hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS, none are approved specifically for managing PCOS-associated hirsutism. The ideal contraceptive for women with PCOS should: (1) limit antral follicle development by inhibiting the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and reducing LH levels resulting in less androgen production from the ovaries; (2) counteract the effect of androgens on the pilosebaceous unit; (3) restore the balance between oestrogens and progesterone in the endometrium, ensuring control of the menstrual cycle; and (4) provide adequate protection against the milieu of unopposed oestrogen that may exist in some women with PCOS which predisposes them to endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.

Current PCOS guidelines state that COCs could be used in reproductive adults and adolescents with PCOS for the management of hirsutism and/or irregular menstrual cycles, but the guidelines do not currently recommend specific types or doses of progestin, oestrogen, or combinations in oral COC pills because there is only very low quality of evidence available. In terms of effectiveness in patients with hirsutism associated with PCOS, the lowest effective oestrogen doses (such as EE 0.02–0.03 mg or equivalent) can be considered first-choice COCs for the treatment of PCOS. In the case of the progestin DNG, it has been estimated that the antiandrogenic activity is about 30% of that of cyproterone acetate (CPA), the most potent antiandrogenic progestin.DNG + EE has been shown to be non-inferior to CPA + EE for the treatment of acne in a large randomised controlled trial. Moreover, the combination of low dose DNG + EE, as well as other antiandrogenic progestins in combination with EE, significantly reduces androgen levels, increases serum SHBG levels, and decreases total testosterone and free testosterone levels. Therefore, the DNG + EE combination has strong antiandrogenic potential but without the explicit warnings in the latest PCOS guidelines against first-line use of EE + CPA due to adverse effects including venous thromboembolic risks. In our current trial, favourable changes in circulating hormone levels were observed for participants in the DNG + EE group from baseline to the end of Cycle 9/EDV for free testosterone, testosterone, androstenedione, and FAI, as well as an increase in mean serum SHBG levels, which were not seen in the placebo group. Moreover, significant favourable decreases were observed for 17-OHP and DHEAS in the DNG + EE group compared with the placebo group. By using prolonged-release formulation of DNG + EE, the peak of exposure is reduced compared to immediate-release formulations and delayed by a few hours. This leads to a similar total systemic exposure with reduced peak intensity and therefore reduced hormonal fluctuations that result in a more predictable bleeding profile.

### The use of hormonal contraceptives in fertility treatments: a committee opinion [^111bApYf]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Hormonal contraception and IVF stimulation yield — In gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist cycles, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported ongoing pregnancy rate (odds ratio, 0.74) similar with pretreatment hormonal contraception versus none, and pretreatment increased treatment duration (weighted mean difference, +1.41 days; 95% confidence interval, +1.13 to +1.68) and total gonadotropin dose (weighted mean difference, +542 IU; 95% confidence interval, +127 to +956). Overall, there is no overwhelming evidence to suggest that hormonal contraception significantly decreases ovarian stimulation response, and there is no evidence to suggest the timing and length of pretreatment with hormonal contraception influence assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes.

### Effects on serum hormone levels of low-dose estrogen in place of placebo during the hormone-free interval of an oral contraceptive [^112xGALf]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of low-dose estrogen compared to placebo on ovarian activity during the traditional 7-day hormone-free interval (HFI) of an oral contraceptive (OC).

Study Design

Women were randomized to placebo or low-dose estrogen for 7 days during the HFI. Serum levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone and inhibin B were obtained before, during and after treatment.

Results

Mean hormone levels remained constant or only increased slightly for the low-dose estrogen group compared to greater more sustained increases observed for the placebo group. Estradiol, FSH and inhibin B levels were substantially higher for those on placebo. Differences were most noticeable by the end of the HFI and persisted into the subsequent cycle.

Conclusion

Subjects receiving low-dose estrogen for 7 days during the HFI demonstrated more pronounced ovarian suppression compared to placebo as evidenced by attenuation of increases in serum inhibin B, FSH and estradiol levels.

### Use of exogenous gonadotropins for ovulation induction in anovulatory women: a committee opinion [^115FZp9G]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism — clinical features and management include laboratory patterns, causes, and treatment principles. Endogenous circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations are in the low or low-normal range in women with hypothalamic amenorrhea, which usually results from very low or absent hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, though pituitary disorders can lead to a similar clinical presentation; disorders of endogenous GnRH secretion can be congenital, acquired, or idiopathic and lead to pituitary deficiency. Conditions such as anorexia nervosa, excessive chronic physical exercise, low body mass index, poor nutritional status, and severe emotional stress can result in hypothalamic amenorrhea, and medications may also disturb the release of GnRH and gonadotropins; hyperprolactinemia can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea. Dopamine agonist treatment will restore ovulation in most women with hyperprolactinemia, and behavioral modifications may be appropriate first-line treatment for many secondary causes of hypothalamic amenorrhea. Women with hypothalamic amenorrhea are unlikely to respond to oral agents such as clomiphene citrate and letrozole, and treatment of hypothalamic amenorrhea should include gonadotropin preparations with both FSH and LH activity to effectively stimulate steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^11131eWW]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — contraception with oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) encompasses chronic management benefits and mechanisms: OCPs are the mainstay for women not seeking pregnancy, improve hyperandrogenic skin manifestations, regulate menstrual cycles, and lower endometrial carcinoma risk; they suppress LH, increase SHBG with decreased free T, antagonize androgen action, and may decrease adrenal androgens. Progestin androgenicity varies (norethindrone, norgestrel, levonorgestrel more androgenic; desogestrel, norgestimate, gestodene less), and antiandrogenic progestin combinations (ethinyl estradiol with cyproterone acetate) have been most studied, with few studies of drospirenone or chlormadinone and none with dienogest in PCOS. Overall, OCPs are effective for long-term management, but concerns remain about potential long-term risks related to cardiovascular disease and glucose intolerance.

### Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist protocols for pituitary suppression in assisted reproduction [^116ziuP2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are commonly used in assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles to prevent a luteinising hormone surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) prior to planned oocyte retrieval, thus optimising the chances of live birth.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of the different GnRHa protocols as adjuncts to COH in women undergoing ART cycles.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from inception to April 2015: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and registries of ongoing trials. Reference lists of relevant articles were also searched.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any two protocols of GnRHa used in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in subfertile women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted the data. The primary outcome measure was number of live births or ongoing pregnancies per woman/couple randomised. Secondary outcome measures were number of clinical pregnancies, number of oocytes retrieved, dose of gonadotrophins used, adverse effects (pregnancy losses, ovarian hyperstimulation, cycle cancellation, and premature luteinising hormone (LH) surges), and cost and acceptability of the regimens. We combined data to calculate odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous variables and mean differences (MD) for continuous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) methods.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (3872 women), one ongoing trial, and one trial awaiting classification. These trials made nine different comparisons between protocols. Twenty of the RCTs compared long protocols and short protocols. Only 19/37 RCTs reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference between a long protocol and a short protocol in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.81; 12 RCTs, n = 976 women, I² = 15%, low quality evidence). Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short protocol, between 13% and 23% will achieve live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a long protocol. There was evidence of an increase in clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.92; 20 RCTs, n = 1643 women, I² = 27%, moderate quality evidence) associated with the use of a long protocol. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in terms of live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates when the following GnRHa protocols were compared: long versus ultrashort protocol (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.36; one RCT, n = 150 women, low quality evidence), long luteal versus long follicular phase protocol (OR 1.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.10; one RCT, n = 223 women, low quality evidence), when GnRHa was stopped versus when it was continued (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.33; three RCTs, n = 290 women, I² = 0%, low quality evidence), when the dose of GnRHa was reduced versus when the same dose was continued (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52; four RCTs, n = 407 women, I² = 0%, low quality evidence), when GnRHa was discontinued versus continued after human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) administration in the long protocol (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.64; one RCT, n = 181 women, low quality evidence), and when administration of GnRHa lasted for two versus three weeks before stimulation (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.68; one RCT, n = 85 women, low quality evidence). Our primary outcomes were not reported for any other comparisons. Regarding adverse events, there were insufficient data to enable us to reach any conclusions except about the cycle cancellation rate. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in cycle cancellation rate (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.55; 11 RCTs, n = 1026 women, I² = 42%, low quality evidence) when a long protocol was compared with a short protocol. This suggests that in a population in which 9% of women would have their cycles cancelled using a short protocol, between 5.5% and 14% will have cancelled cycles when using a long protocol. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. The main limitations in the evidence were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, and imprecise findings due to lack of data. Only 10 of the 37 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years.

Authors' Conclusions

When long GnRHa protocols and short GnRHa protocols were compared, we found no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates, but there was moderate quality evidence of higher clinical pregnancy rates in the long protocol group. None of the other analyses showed any evidence of a difference in birth or pregnancy outcomes between the protocols compared. There was insufficient evidence to make any conclusions regarding adverse effects.

### Estradiol valerate and estradiol valerate / dienogest [^115Pc8F8]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

FDA-Approved Patient Labeling

Guide for Using Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest

Birth control pills help to lower the chances of becoming pregnant when taken as directed. They do not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.

What Is Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest?

Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, an estrogen called estradiol valerate and a progestin called dienogest. Estradiol valerate is a synthetic estrogen that is converted to estradiol in your body.

Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest is used to treat heavy menstruation (your monthly period) that is not caused by any diagnosed conditions of the uterus (womb) in women who decide to use an oral contraceptive for birth control. Talk to your healthcare provider to determine if your bleeding is heavier than normal.

How Does Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest Work?

Birth control pills prevent your ovaries from producing and releasing mature eggs. Estradiol Valerate and Estradiol Valerate/Dienogest decreases menstrual bleeding by thinning the lining of the uterus.

### Luteinizing hormone-independent rise of progesterone as the physiological trigger of the ovulatory gonadotropins surge in the human [^112Tjx9Z]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

The current ovarian cycle paradigm postulates that ovulation is triggered by a critically sustained elevation of estradiol. However, an in-depth look into the published data reveals considerable uncertainty about the relative roles of progesterone and estradiol in the ovulation process. This review provides compelling evidences that the role of estradiol in ovulation has been misinterpreted and that the true physiological trigger of ovulation is a luteinizing hormone-independent preovulatory progesterone surge in the circulation to approximately 0.5 ng/mL. Furthermore, the current work reconciles the ability of progesterone to trigger ovulation, with its well-established ability to block ovulation during pregnancy, or when administered in the form of a synthetic progestin in birth control formulations and with experimental data that estradiol benzoate triggers ovulation in the complete absence of progesterone.

### Antimüllerian hormone levels decrease in women using combined contraception independently of administration route [^114ds7Vo]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of continuous use of oral (OC), transdermal, and vaginal combined contraceptives on the pituitary-ovarian axis and inhibition of follicular development.

Design

Spin-off study of a prospective, randomized trial.

Setting

University clinic.

Patient(S)

Forty-two of 54 healthy women completed the study.

Intervention(S)

Treatment with combined OCs (ethinyl E2 [EE] and desogestrel), transdermal patches (EE and norelgestromin), or vaginal rings (EE and etonogestrel) for 9 weeks continuously. Blood sampling was performed before and at 5 and 9 weeks of treatment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Changes in serum hormone levels induced by combined contraceptives.

Result(S)

Serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH), FSH, inhibin B, LH, and E2 levels had decreased significantly in all study groups after 9 weeks of treatment. Significant declines were already detected after 5 weeks' use of combined contraceptives with regard to all hormone levels apart from those of serum AMH, where the decrease between baseline and 5 weeks was only moderate. Between groups, serum levels of AMH, inhibin B, LH, and E2 were comparable at baseline and after 5 and 9 weeks of treatment.

Conclusion(S)

The decrease of serum AMH levels during the use of all combined contraceptives indicates that folliculogenesis is arrested independently of administration route.

Clinical Trial Registration Number

### Clinical trials in male hormonal contraception [^113Jr9nL]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

Research has established the principle of hormonal male contraception based on suppression of gonadotropins and spermatogenesis. All hormonal male contraceptives use testosterone, but only in East Asian men can testosterone alone suppress spermatogenesis to a level compatible with contraceptive protection. In Caucasians, additional agents are required of which progestins are favored. Clinical trials concentrate on testosterone combined with norethisterone, desogestrel, etonogestrel or depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate. The first randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial performed by the pharmaceutical industry demonstrated the effectiveness of a combination of testosterone undecanoate and etonogestrel in suppressing spermatogenesis in volunteers.

### Effects of the progesterone receptor modulator VA2914 in a continuous low dose on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and endometrium in normal women: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112pDALX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Progestin-only pills, the main hormonal alternative to ethinyl estradiol-containing pills in women bearing vascular risk factors, are poorly tolerated due to irregular bleeding. In contrast, progesterone receptor modulators can inhibit ovulation, alter endometrial receptivity, and improve cycle control.

Objective

We evaluated the effects of a new progesterone receptor modulator, VA2914, administered continuously for 3 months, on ovulation and endometrial maturation.

Design, Settings, and Patients

Forty-six normal women were included in a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, conducted in four referral centers.

Intervention

VA2914 (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/d) was administered continuously for 84 d. Pelvic ultrasound (treatment d 67 and 77), hormonal monitoring (FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone on treatment d 59, 63, 67, 70, 74, 77, 80, and 84), and endometrial biopsy (treatment d 77) were performed.

Main Outcome Measure

Ovulation inhibition was assessed by the absence of progesterone values above 3 ng/ml at any time during treatment month 3.

Results

Anovulation was observed in 81.8% women in the 5-mg group and 80% in the 10-mg group, and amenorrhea occurred in 81.2 and 90% of cases in the 5- and 10-mg groups. We did not detect any cases of endometrial hyperplasia despite estradiol levels that remained in the physiological follicular phase range throughout treatment cycle 3.

Conclusions

Continuous low-dose VA2914 can induce amenorrhea and inhibit ovulation without down-regulating estradiol levels or inducing endometrial hyperplasia in normal women. Long-term studies with a larger population are required to confirm the contraceptive efficacy of this regimen.

### Cetrorelix acetate (cetrorelix) [^111u7xuD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Due to a positive estradiol (E2) feedback at midcycle, GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH-surge. This LH-surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle, resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels.

Cetrorelix acetate for injection competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose-dependent manner. The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0.25 mg dose. This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with cetrorelix acetate for injection, which is consistent with an antagonist effect.

The effects of cetrorelix acetate for injection on LH and FSH are reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In women, cetrorelix acetate for injection delays the LH-surge, and consequently ovulation, in a dose-dependent fashion. FSH levels are not affected at the doses used during controlled ovarian stimulation. Following a single 3 mg dose of cetrorelix acetate for injection, duration of action of at least 4 days has been established. A dose of cetrorelix acetate for injection 0.25 mg every 24 hours has been shown to maintain the effect.

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of single and multiple doses of cetrorelix acetate for injection in adult healthy female subjects are summarized in Table 1.

Absorption

Cetrorelix acetate for injection is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, maximal plasma concentrations being achieved approximately one to two hours after administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix acetate for injection following subcutaneous administration to healthy female subjects is 85%.

### Dolutegravir has No effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol [^11243vzG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study demonstrated that the PK of NGMN and EE were equivalent with and without coadministration of DTG. Furthermore, consistent with these findings, there was also no systematic trend or significant effect on the concentration of PD markers, including LH, FSH, and progesterone. Together, these results provide in vivo support for the coadministration of NGM/EE and DTG without dose adjustment.

DTG and NGM/EE coadministration was well tolerated, with only headache being reported as a drug-related AE in more than 1 participant, and all AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Few AEs were observed with the 50-mg twice-daily dose of DTG used in this study. Although 50 mg once daily is the most commonly used dose in phase III trials, the 50-mg twice-daily dose is approved in the United States in those resistant to integrase strand transfer inhibitorand was selected for use in this study as the most likely scenario in which a potential drug interaction would be observed. The tolerability of NGM/EE and DTG 50 mg twice daily strongly suggests that the more commonly used 50-mg once-daily dose in HIV-1–infected individuals will also be well tolerated in combination with oral contraceptives.

### Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists for assisted reproductive technology [^111DPFCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists can be used to prevent a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) without the hypo-oestrogenic side-effects, flare-up, or long down-regulation period associated with agonists. The antagonists directly and rapidly inhibit gonadotrophin release within several hours through competitive binding to pituitary GnRH receptors. This property allows their use at any time during the follicular phase. Several different regimens have been described including multiple-dose fixed (0.25 mg daily from day six to seven of stimulation), multiple-dose flexible (0.25 mg daily when leading follicle is 14 to 15 mm), and single-dose (single administration of 3 mg on day 7 to 8 of stimulation) protocols, with or without the addition of an oral contraceptive pill. Further, women receiving antagonists have been shown to have a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming comparable clinical outcomes for the antagonist and agonist protocols, these benefits would justify a change from the standard long agonist protocol to antagonist regimens. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2006 and 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists compared with the standard long protocol of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted conception cycles.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched from inception to May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, inception to 28 April 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to 28 April 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 28 April 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to 28 April 2015), CINAHL (to 28 April 2015) and trial registers to 28 April 2015, and handsearched bibliographies of relevant publications and reviews, and abstracts of major scientific meetings, for example the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). We contacted the authors of eligible studies for missing or unpublished data. The evidence is current to 28 April 2015.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently screened the relevant citations for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different GnRH agonist versus GnRH antagonist protocols in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Other adverse effects (miscarriage and cycle cancellation) were secondary outcomes. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 73 RCTs, with 12,212 participants, comparing GnRH antagonist to long-course GnRH agonist protocols. The quality of the evidence was moderate: limitations were poor reporting of study methods. Live birthThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rate between GnRH antagonist and long course GnRH agonist (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 12 RCTs, n = 2303, I(2) = 27%, moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the chance of live birth following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 29%, the chance following GnRH antagonist would be between 25% and 33%.OHSSGnRH antagonist was associated with lower incidence of any grade of OHSS than GnRH agonist (OR 0.61, 95% C 0.51 to 0.72; 36 RCTs, n = 7944, I(2) = 31%, moderate quality evidence). The evidence suggested that if the risk of OHSS following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 11%, the risk following GnRH antagonist would be between 6% and 9%. Other adverse effectsThere was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rate per woman randomised between GnRH antagonist group and GnRH agonist group (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.30; 33 RCTs, n = 7022, I(2) = 0%, moderate quality evidence). With respect to cycle cancellation, GnRH antagonist was associated with a lower incidence of cycle cancellation due to high risk of OHSS (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69; 19 RCTs, n = 4256, I(2) = 0%). However cycle cancellation due to poor ovarian response was higher in women who received GnRH antagonist than those who were treated with GnRH agonist (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; 25 RCTs, n = 5230, I(2) = 68%; moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that the use of GnRH antagonist compared with long-course GnRH agonist protocols is associated with a substantial reduction in OHSS without reducing the likelihood of achieving live birth.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115b9KpZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — gonadotropins with intercourse (descriptive context): Gonadotropins have a dose-dependent action on the ovaries, with greater doses resulting in the maturation of additional follicles, and ovulation induction with gonadotropins is considered more aggressive than with letrozole or clomiphene. The more potent action of gonadotropins compared with oral medications frequently results in the development of more ovulatory-sized follicles, which would be anticipated to increase pregnancy rates at the expense of an increase in the risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy.

### Bona fide diminished ovarian reserve or profound ovarian suppression by long-term oral contraceptive use? [^113oV3bK]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are widely used by reproductive-aged women. Current data suggest that long-term use of COCs can suppress ovarian reserve markers, including anti-mullerian hormone and antral follicle count, which may negatively impact ovarian response and oocyte yield in patients undergoing planned oocyte cryopreservation to preserve future reproductive potential. Discontinuation of COCs can improve ovarian stimulation outcomes, though the ideal duration of cessation is unknown. In this case report, we describe a patient with profound ovarian suppression from long-term COC use and her delayed reversal in ovarian suppression as demonstrated by longitudinal assessment of ovarian reserve markers and ovarian stimulation outcomes.

### Update on male hormonal contraception [^116x3UXa]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral formulations: the 'male pill'

Up to now, studied male hormonal contraceptives are designed to be administered through injections or implants which may be uncomfortable so many men prefer other administration methods such as oral or transdermal self-administration. The oral delivery of testosterone has been challenging with the problem of hepatoxicity with methyltestosterone or for the necessity of multiple doses per day in the case of TU.

New androgens are currently under development as potential oral male hormonal contraceptives. Dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) is a derivative of 19-nortestosterone with both androgenic and progestational activity in preclinical studies. Recently, it has been studied in 82 healthy men for 28 days: a single dose of up to 400 mg daily was safe, well-tolerated, and demonstrated its ability to suppress serum testosterone, LH, and FSH to levels consistent with effective contraception. Limitations of oral DMAU are the need for concomitant food administration for effective absorptionand androgenic side effects (i.e. weight gain, increased hematocrit, and reduction in HDL-cholesterol).

Another new molecule is 11-beta-methyl-19-nortes-tosterone 17-beta-dodecylcarbonate (11-ßMNTDC), a derivative of 19-nortestosterone. In preclinical data, it showed serum gonadotropin suppression, and one study in men demonstrated that given in oral doses of 100–800 mg with food it is well tolerated and able to suppress testosterone.

### Clinical review 126: roles and novel regimens of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone in ovulation induction [^114EvTnN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Although FSH is universally recognized as the key driver of ovarian follicle growth and maturation, the role of LH in these processes is more controversial. LH acts on theca cells to induce androgen substrate for estrogen conversion by the aromatase system; furthermore, LH can affect granulosa cell function starting in the mid- follicular phase, when these cells express LH receptors. The capacity of LH to stimulate granulosa cells in larger follicles (> 10 mm diameter) may be the critical mechanism involved in the selection of the dominant follicle in the normal menstrual cycle. Furthermore, the addition of LH activity can shorten and optimize FSH ovulation induction and reduce the development of smaller preovulatory ovarian follicles that are associated with the severe complications of this procedure. Novel mixed gonadotropin administration regimens that incorporate graded amounts of LH and FSH activity may improve efficacy, safety, and cost of ovulation induction, particularly in the area of assisted reproduction.

### Dolutegravir has No effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol [^112xZo5p]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamic Assessments

Plasma analysis for luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and progesterone was performed at screening and on days 1, 10, 11, 21, and 22. For each biomarker (LH, FSH, and progesterone), the profiles for both treatment sequences (treatment sequences AB and BA) were plotted using box plots displaying the median, range, and 25th and 75th percentiles. Because of large variability and small sample size, formal statistical comparison of LH, FSH, and progesterone by treatment was not performed.

Safety Assessments

Adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) data were collected and recorded from the start of study treatment until the follow-up 7 to 14 days after the last dose. Any abnormal laboratory assessments that were considered clinically significant were recorded as AEs or SAEs if they met the respective definitions. All clinically significant changes from baseline were followed until resolution or stabilization, as determined by the investigator or his/her designee.

Statistical Analyses

A sample size of 16 to obtain 14 evaluable participants was chosen, assuming a within-subject variability of 15% and a true ratio of 1, which would provide > 90% power to demonstrate lack of interaction within the bioequivalence limit of 0.80 to 1.25.

Geometric least squares (GLS) mean ratios and 90% CIs were generated by the mixed-effect model, with treatment and period as fixed effects and subject as a random effect for within-subject treatment comparison. A P value < 0.05 for period effect was considered to be statistically significant. To assess the lack of effect of multiple doses of DTG on the PK (AUC 0-τ) of NGMN and EE, a bioequivalence approach was followed, using Schuirmann's two 1-sided t test procedure with α = 0.05 for each test. Lack of effect was tested by estimating the ratio of the GLS means for AUC 0-τ of each of NGMN and EE in the presence of DTG to the GLS mean of each of NGMN and EE alone; a ratio of < 0.8 or > 1.25 suggested a drug interaction. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.

### Endocrine and metabolic effects of an oral contraceptive containing estetrol and drospirenone [^114mfQpU]. Contraception (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect on endocrine and metabolic parameters of a new combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing estetrol (E4) and drospirenone (DRSP).

Study Design

Randomized, open-label, controlled, 3-arm, parallel study. Healthy subjects received either E4 15 mg/DRSP 3 mg (E4/DRSP) (n = 38), or ethinylestradiol (EE) 30 µg/levonorgestrel (LNG) 150 µg (n = 29), or EE 20 µg/DRSP 3 mg (n = 31) for 6 treatment cycles. Median percentage change from baseline to cycle 3 and to cycle 6 were evaluated for endocrine parameters, liver proteins, lipid profile, and carbohydrate metabolism.

Results

At cycle 6, E4/DRSP treatment had less effect on gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] +30.5%, luteinizing hormone [LH] -7.5%) compared to EE/LNG (FSH -84.0%, LH -92.0%) and EE/DRSP (FSH -64.0%, LH -90.0%). With E4/DRSP increases in total cortisol (+26.0%) and cortisol binding globulin ([CBG] (+40.0%) were less compared to EE/LNG (cortisol +109.0%, CBG +152.0%) and EE/DRSP (cortisol +107.0%, CBG +140.0%). Liver proteins, except CRP, increased, but the effect was less pronounced with E4/DRSP for angiotensinogen (+75.0%) compared to EE/LNG (+170.0%) and EE/DRSP (+206.5%) and for sex hormone binding globulin ([SHBG] +55.0%), compared to EE/LNG (+74.0%) and EE/DRSP (+251.0%). E4/DRSP had minimal impact on lipid parameters; the largest effect was observed for triglycerides (+24.0%), which was less compared to EE/LNG (+28.0%) and EE/DRSP (+65.5%). E4/DRSP had no effect on carbohydrate metabolism.

Conclusions

E4/DRSP treatment has limited effects on endocrine and metabolic parameters. The effects on gonadotropins, cortisol, CBG, angiotensinogen, SHBG and triglycerides were less pronounced compared to EE-containing products.

Implications Statement

Combining E4 15 mg with DRSP 3 mg resulted in a COC with a different metabolic profile in comparison to EE-containing products. The clinical relevance of these findings needs to be further assessed, using clinical endpoints to establish the safety profile of this new COC.

### FSH and ovarian response: spontaneous recovery of pituitary-ovarian activity during the pill-free period vs. exogenous recombinant FSH during high-dose combined oral contraceptives [^113GkcU3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Compare spontaneous recovery of pituitary-ovarian activity during the pill-free period following the correct use of low-dose oral contraceptives and subsequent ovarian function during the administration of exogenous recombinant FSH (recFSH) after switching to continued Lyndiol (2.5 mg lynestrenol + 0.05 mg ethinyl-oestradiol) medication.

Design

Prospective, randomized, group-comparative, single-centre study. Following the monitoring of the pill-free period (week 1) and subsequent treatment with Lyndiol (for a total of 5 weeks), all subjects were randomly allocated to one of four groups receiving daily FSH injections for 1 week [75, 150, 225 IU recFSH or 150 IU purified urinary FSH (uFSH)] during the fourth week of Lyndiol use.

Patients

Thirty-six healthy volunteers aged 18–39 years, prestudy oral contraceptive use for at least 3 months, cycle length between 24 and 35 days.

Measurements

Serum FSH, LH and oestradiol (E2) concentrations as well as transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the number and diameter of follicles > 2 mm were used to monitor pituitary ovarian function.

Results

At the start of the pill-free period following the prestudy contraceptive medication, 67% of the women presented with LH and FSH levels < 1 IU/l and only one follicle > 10 mm was observed. Initial levels of LH and FSH correlated (P < 0.05) with the extent of pituitary-ovarian activity during the pill-free period. At the end of the pill-free period a follicle > 10 mm had emerged in one subject only. During the first 3 days of Lyndiol use, seven women (19%) eventually showed at least one follicle > 10 mm. During combined exogenous FSH and Lyndiol administration, LH levels remained completely suppressed (≤ 0.5 IU/l) in all women studied. FSH levels and number and size of follicles increased with increasing doses of exogenous FSH in a dose-dependent manner. E2 levels remained low in all groups (< 150 pmol/l). During the week following FSH administration, FSH levels and E2 levels decreased gradually while the number of follicles > 10 mm still increased.

Conclusions

We have confirmed that dominant follicles > 10 mm are present at the end of the pill-free period and during the first days after resumption of pill intake. Once follicles > 10 mm arose at the end of the pill-free period, continued use of Lyndiol did not reduce follicle diameters. One week of Lyndiol reduces pituitary-ovarian activity to levels observed after 3 weeks of low-dose pills. FSH administration during Lyndiol resulted in dose-dependent follicle growth despite extremely low LH levels. E2 secretion (56 ± 51 pmol/l) occurred to a limited and variable extent along with extremely low serum LH concentrations. Recovery of pituitary-ovarian activity at the end of the pill-free period is comparable to FSH levels and follicle dynamics following 7 days of 75–150 IU/l recFSH.

### Effective use of hormonal contraceptives: part I: combined oral contraceptive pills [^112kvdBs]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

This systematic review examines evidence regarding when during the menstrual cycle a woman can initiate combined oral contraceptive (COC) use and what can be done if a woman misses COCs. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles published from 1966 to March 2005 related to COC initiation and to the effects of late or missed COCs. We identified 11 studies related to COC initiation and 25 studies related to the effects of missed pills. Evidence from these studies suggested that taking hormonally active pills for 7 consecutive days prevents normal ovulation and that initiating COCs through Day 5 of the menstrual cycle suppresses follicular activity. Studies on the effects of missed COCs generally showed that the risk of ovulation is greatest when the pill-free interval lasts > 7 days. Limitations of this body of evidence include small sample sizes that may not reflect variation in larger populations, lack of a standard measurement of ovulation and difficulty in discerning how ovulation resulting from late or missed COCs corresponds to the risk of conception.

### Effects of oral contraceptive pills on brain networks: a conceptual replication and extension [^113VnddU]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

OCPs, typically comprising synthetic estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and one of a variety of synthetic progestins, suppress endogenous progesterone and estradiol production. This suppression inhibits the hypothalamic–pituitary axis from secreting luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), preventing ovulation. Given the widespread use of OCPs, further research on their effects on brain networks is warranted to identify underlying changes in connectivity that cause the behavioral changes experienced by some women who use them. Progress toward identifying such changes may eventually help forewarn populations at risk for premature cessation of OCPs and subsequent unwanted pregnancies.

Currently, there is no behavioral, demographic, or biological parameter that can distinguish between those who will benefit from OCPs and those who experience adverse effects. Brain imaging studies offer a potential solution. Evidence so far shows that OCPs affect brain networks and the structure of brain regions within these networks; however, the observed effects vary between studies. OCPs have been associated with increased prefrontal gray matter volume in an observational study (Pletzer et al.), but reduced prefrontal gray matter in a randomized, placebo‐controlled trial (Petersen et al.). Review articles suggest that while OCPs influence brain structure, the direction and location of effects remain unclear. Inconsistent effects of OCPs on resting‐state functional connectivity have also been reported (Casto et al.).

A deep phenotyping approach has recently gained traction as a means to more robustly map brain networks (Poldrack et al.), including assessments of hormone‐induced changes in brain networks across the menstrual cycle in a single individual imaged daily across two complete menstrual cycles (Pritschet et al.). This report found that whole‐brain connectivity increases with estradiol levels, and that the dorsal attention network (DAN) and default mode network (DMN) see increased global efficiency at intervals predicted by estradiol levels (Pritschet et al.). Progesterone, on the other hand, had an opposite effect and largely decreased inter‐region connectivity. These results stand somewhat in contrast with a previous deep phenotyping (single‐subject) study, which found that progesterone levels were associated with increases in eigenvector centrality, a different but related measurement of connectivity (Arélin et al.). These small but important studies highlight the need for ongoing research to understand the dynamic effects of hormones on brain networks.

### Leuprolide acetate (lupron) [^114MUTKv]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

During the early phase of therapy, gonadotropins and sex steroids rise above baseline because of the natural stimulatory effect of the drug. Therefore, an increase in clinical signs and symptoms may be observed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section).

Noncompliance with drug regimen or inadequate dosing may result in inadequate control of the pubertal process. The consequences of poor control include the return of pubertal signs such as menses, breast development, and testicular growth. The long-term consequences of inadequate control of gonadal steroid secretion are unknown, but may include a further compromise of adult stature.

### Cetrorelix acetate [^117W2M21]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Due to a positive estradiol (E2) feedback at midcycle, GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LH-surge. This LH-surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle, resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels.

Cetrorelix acetate competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose-dependent manner. The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0.25 mg dose. This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with cetrorelix acetate, which is consistent with an antagonist effect.

The effects of cetrorelix acetate on LH and FSH are reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In women, cetrorelix acetate delays the LH-surge, and consequently ovulation, in a dose-dependent fashion. FSH levels are not affected at the doses used during controlled ovarian stimulation. Following a single 3 mg dose of cetrorelix acetate, duration of action of at least 4 days has been established. A dose of cetrorelix acetate 0.25 mg every 24 hours has been shown to maintain the effect.

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of single and multiple doses of cetrorelix acetate in adult healthy female subjects are summarized in Table 1.

Absorption

Cetrorelix acetate is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, maximal plasma concentrations being achieved approximately one to two hours after administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of cetrorelix acetate following subcutaneous administration to healthy female subjects is 85%.

Distribution

The volume of distribution of cetrorelix acetate following a single intravenous dose of 3 mg is about 1 L/kg. In vitro protein binding to human plasma is 86%.

Cetrorelix acetate concentrations in follicular fluid and plasma were similar on the day of oocyte pick-up in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Following subcutaneous administration of cetrorelix acetate 0.25 mg and 3 mg, plasma concentrations of cetrorelix acetate were below or in the range of the lower limit of quantitation on the day of oocyte pick-up and embryo transfer.

### Effect of recombinant LH supplementation timing on clinical pregnancy outcome in long-acting GnRHa downregulated cycles [^1143Etnu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a glycoprotein gonadotropin (Gn) produced by the adenohypophysis. Female LH mainly cooperates with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to promote follicular development, and plays an important role in inducing oocyte maturation, ovulation and luteinization. In addition, LH can promote androgen production, to maintain the synthesis and secretion of oestrogen and progesterone. Therefore, FSH and LH supplementation seems to be essential for follicular development, embryo implantation, and the persistence of pregnancy. Given the important role of LH in follicular development and hormone synthesis, whether exogenous LH should be added to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycle has been widely discussed.

At present, the long-acting gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) for pituitary downregulation is widely used for in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer (IVF/ICSI-ET). Two weeks after the injection of long-acting GnRHa in normal women of childbearing age, endogenous hormones are almost completely inhibited, and the FSH level gradually recovers from the 3rd-4th week, while the inhibition of the level of LH may last until the 8th week. The long-term inhibition of LH can prevent the early LH peak in IVF/ICSI-ET cycles. However, the deep suppression of serum LH levels caused by long-acting GnRHa may adversely affect follicular development, hormone synthesis and oocyte quality, and impair the final clinical pregnancy outcome. Some studies have suggested that LH supplementation has a beneficial effect on the clinical pregnancy rate. In contrast, other studies did not find added value of LH addition in IVF/ICSI-ET cycles. Thus, it is impossible to draw a definite conclusion. The main reason for the inconsistent results is that there are too many uncertain confounding factors, such as the difference in patients' ovarian response, the type of added LH, and the timing and dose of LH supplementation.

This study explored the effect of recombinant LH (rLH) on the clinical pregnancy outcome at different periods of long-acting GnRHa downregulated IVF/ICSI-ET cycles to provide a theoretical basis for further clinical randomized controlled trials, which could provide a practical scheme for the addition of rLH in long-acting GnRHa IVF-ET cycles.

Hypothalamic amenorrhea — gonadotropin strategy — achieves optimal clinical results by administering a combination of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH); this can be via hMG or FSH with either recombinant LH or low-dose hCG, there are no established superior gonadotropin regimens or doses, and profound hypothalamic dysfunction may require a prolonged period of treatment to achieve follicular growth.

Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Oral contraceptive pretreatment facilitated scheduling of pure FSH/GnRH antagonist cycles but in a small subset of patients was associated with low serum LH levels, reduced ovarian response, and early pregnancy loss.

### A novel male contraceptive pill-patch combination: oral desogestrel and transdermal testosterone in the suppression of spermatogenesis in normal men [^113Ju39t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

This study investigated the effect of transdermal T and oral desogestrel on the reproductive axis of healthy men. Twenty-three men were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups and received a daily transdermal T patch plus oral desogestrel at a dose of 75, 150, or 300 microg/d for 24 wk. Baseline blood and semen samples were obtained and then every 4 wk thereafter for 32 wk. The outcome measures were sperm density and plasma levels of FSH, LH, total and free T. The results show a dose-dependent suppression of spermatogenesis and gonadotropins. Seven of the 17 subjects became azoospermic. Desogestrel (300 microg daily) in combination with 5 mg daily transdermal T was the most effective (57% azoospermic), whereas a dose of 75 microg was ineffective (0% azoospermic). Total and free plasma T were reduced by approximately 30%. High density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly reduced. No serious side-effects were encountered. We conclude that daily self-administered desogestrel with transdermal T is capable of suppressing the male reproductive axis, although the efficacy was less marked and less consistent than injectable regimens. The lower efficacy is likely to be due to failure of the transdermal T system to maintain circulating T levels consistently in the required range.

### Update on male hormonal contraception [^112HWVWP]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Action mechanism of male hormonal contraception

The basic mechanism by which hormones affect fertility in men is through the suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with subsequent reversible inhibition of testicular function, namely spermatogenesis and testosterone production (Figure 1). Both the decrease of testosterone and suppression of FSH lead to a decrease of Sertoli cell function essential for germ-cell maturation. To maintain androgen-dependent physiological functions an androgen (usually testosterone) must be part of the contraceptive regimen.

### Oral contraceptive pill, progestogen or oestrogen pretreatment for ovarian stimulation protocols for women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques [^111e1fHR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Among subfertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), hormone pills given before ovarian stimulation may improve outcomes.

Objectives

To determine whether pretreatment with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) or with a progestogen or oestrogen alone in ovarian stimulation protocols affects outcomes in subfertile couples undergoing ART.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from inception to January 2017: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and registers of ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hormonal pretreatment in women undergoing ART.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy and pregnancy loss.

Main Results

We included 29 RCTs (4701 women) of pretreatment with COCPs, progestogens or oestrogens versus no pretreatment or alternative pretreatments, in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist cycles. Overall, evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias and imprecision. Most studies did not describe their methods in adequate detail. Combined oral contraceptive pill versus no pretreatmentWith antagonist cycles in both groups the rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy was lower in the pretreatment group (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95; 6 RCTs; 1335 women; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of pregnancy loss (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.26; 5 RCTs; 868 women; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence), multiple pregnancy (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.53 to 9.26; 2 RCTs; 125 women; I² = 0%; low quality evidence), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS; OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.40; 2 RCTs; 642 women; I² = 0%, low quality evidence), or ovarian cyst formation (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.75; 1 RCT; 64 women; very low quality evidence). In COCP plus antagonist cycles versus no pretreatment in agonist cycles, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.25; 4 RCTs; 724 women; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence), multiple pregnancy (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.19; 4 RCTs; 546 women; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence), or OHSS (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.96; 2 RCTs; 290 women, I² = 0%), but there were fewer pregnancy losses in the pretreatment group (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.72; 5 RCTs; 780 women; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). There were no data suitable for analysis on ovarian cyst formation. One small study comparing COCP versus no pretreatment in agonist cycles showed no clear difference between the groups for any of the reported outcomes. Progestogen versus no pretreatmentAll studies used the same protocol (antagonist, agonist or gonadotrophins) in both groups. There was insufficient evidence to determine any differences in rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy (agonist: OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.65; 2 RCTs; 222 women; I² = 24%; low quality evidence; antagonist: OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.54; 1 RCT; 47 women; low quality evidence; gonadotrophins: OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.23; 1 RCT; 42 women; very low quality evidence), pregnancy loss (agonist: OR 2.26, 95% CI 0.67 to 7.55; 2 RCTs; 222 women; I² = 0%; low quality evidence; antagonist: OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.09; 1 RCT; 47 women; low quality evidence; gonadotrophins: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 17.12; 1 RCT; 42 women; very low quality evidence) or multiple pregnancy (agonist: no data available; antagonist: OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.06 to 17.76; 1 RCT; 47 women; low quality evidence; gonadotrophins: no data available). Three studies, all using agonist cycles, reported ovarian cyst formation: rates were lower in the pretreatment group (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.32; 374 women; I² = 1%; moderate quality evidence). There were no data on OHSS. Oestrogen versus no pretreatmentIn antagonist or agonist cycles, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the groups differed in rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy (antagonist versus antagonist: OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.17; 2 RCTs; 502 women; I² = 0%; low quality evidence; antagonist versus agonist: OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.50; 2 RCTs; 242 women; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence), pregnancy loss (antagonist versus antagonist: OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.47; 1 RCT; 49 women; very low quality evidence; antagonist versus agonist: OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.62 to 4.06; 1 RCT; 220 women; very low quality evidence), multiple pregnancy (antagonist versus antagonist: no data available; antagonist versus agonist: OR 2.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 53.59; 1 RCT; 22 women; very low quality evidence) or OHSS (antagonist versus antagonist: no data available; antagonist versus agonist: OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 9.42; 1 RCT; 220 women). Ovarian cyst formation was not reported. Head-to-head comparisonsCOCP was compared with progestogen (1 RCT, 44 women), and with oestrogen (2 RCTs, 146 women), and progestogen was compared with oestrogen (1 RCT, 48 women), with an antagonist cycle in both groups. COCP in an agonist cycle was compared with oestrogen in an antagonist cycle (1 RCT, 25 women). Data were scant but there was no clear evidence that any of the groups differed in rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy, pregnancy loss or other adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Among women undergoing ovarian stimulation in antagonist protocols, COCP pretreatment was associated with a lower rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy than no pretreatment. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of live birth or ongoing pregnancy were influenced by pretreatment with progestogens or oestrogens, or by COCP pretreatment using other stimulation protocols. Findings on adverse events were inconclusive, except that progesterone pretreatment may reduce the risk of ovarian cysts in agonist cycles, and COCP in antagonist cycles may reduce the risk of pregnancy loss compared with no pretreatment in agonist cycles.

### Dynamics of pituitary down-regulation and ovarian response to controlled stimulation in in vitro fertilization cycles [^113YDqHq]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

The effect of the daily GnRH agonist administration on LH levels and ovarian response after down-regulation was investigated in 2 groups of women who received recombinant FSH versus hMG. The results showed that the pituitary gland remained responsive to the daily buserelin by producing pulses of LH, despite down-regulation in both groups; however, the patients whose condition is profoundly down-regulated may need exogenous LH to improve their response.

### Hormonal contraception and HIV-1 acquisition: biological mechanisms [^111rst3V]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Contraceptives: Actions, Types, and Serum Concentrations

Progestins are compounds with progestational activity, in particular the capability to induce a secretory endometrium to support gestation. The progestin component of contraceptives is designed to mimic the actions of progesterone, the endogenous progestogenic steroid hormone in all mammals. Progesterone plays a central role in reproduction to regulate establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, normal mammary gland development, menstrual cycle, and sexual behavior. During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, progesterone levels are relatively low whereas estrogen levels peak. Levels of progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum, rise after ovulation to prepare the endometrium for egg implantation, transform estrogen-primed endometrium into secretory tissue, prevent ovulation by abolishing peak gonadotropin levels, inhibit follicular maturation, and thin the endometrium. Higher progesterone levels also reduce glycogen secretion and cause cervical mucus to become thick and viscous to avoid sperm penetration, fertilization, and implantation by multiple embryos. Progestins mimic all of these actions of progesterone to prevent pregnancy via these multiple mechanisms. Estrogen, alternatively, induces gonadotropin release and ovulation in addition to having many additional beneficial effects on brain and cardiovascular function, lipid profiles, and bone density.

### Impact of hormonal contraceptives on cervical T-helper 17 phenotype and function in adolescents: results from a randomized, crossover study comparing long-acting injectable norethisterone oenanthate (NET-EN), combined oral contraceptive pills, and combined contraceptive vaginal rings [^115qjwun]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Phenotype of Th17 cells before (baseline) and after (16 weeks) being on (A) NET-EN, (B) COCPs, and (C) CCVR. The frequencies of Th17 cells and expression of CCR5, CD38, and HLA-DR on these cells were assessed before and after 16 weeks of adolescents being on the randomized HC. A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test was applied and a P value ≤ .05 was considered significant. Abbreviations: CCVR, combined contraceptive vaginal ring; COCPs, combined oral contraceptive pills; HC, hormonal contraceptive; NET-EN, injectable norethisterone oenanthate; Th17, T-helper 17.

Adolescents assigned to NET-EN had similar concentrations of endogenous hormones as COCP users (Supplementary Table 4). Adolescents using CCVRs, in contrast, had significantly lower concentrations of LH (P < .0001) and FSH (P < .0001) than those using either COCP or NET-EN, with less pronounced differences for E2 (P = 0.05). Lower frequencies of Th17 cells in CCVR users may have been influenced by lower FSH concentrations, since (1) FSH was positively associated with cervical Th17 frequencies (Supplementary Table 2); and (2) adolescents using CCVRs had lower FSH concentrations (Supplementary Table 4). Since LH and E2 dampened Th17 activation (significantly so for LH; Supplementary Table 2), the lower LH and E2 concentrations associated with CCVR use may have contributed to their increased activation.

### Assessment of the sensitivity of the hypothalamic GnRH… [^117CJ7FH]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

We propose that adult PCOS, and perhaps adolescent hyperandrogenemia, are due in part to dysregulation of pituitary and ovarian hormones. Synthesis and secretion of LH and follicle stimulating hormone are primarily regulated by gonadotropin releasing hormone. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the same gonadotrope cell, and the frequency of stimulation of this cell by GnRH in part determines which hormone is released. In the late follicular phase, LH increases as a consequence of increased GnRH secretion. Following ovulation, rising levels of E2 and P then reduce GnRH pulse frequency, allowing a rise in FSH for the next cycle of follicular maturation. One feature of adult PCOS is increased mean serum levels of LH and increased LH pulse frequency, presumably due to increased stimulation of the pituitary by excess hypothalamic secretion of GnRH. Since women with PCOS maintain high levels of LH and low levels of FSH, follicle maturation and ovulation do not occur normally.

Girls with hyperandrogenemia in adolescence also have an increased frequency of LH pulses when compared to age matched controls. In normal pubertal maturation the increase in GnRH pulse secretion during sleep stimulates LH and ovarian E2 and P secretion. Feedback of these hormones reduces GnRH pulses during daytime hours, initiating cycles of ovarian-hypothalamic feedback regulation which mature into the patterns seen in normal ovulatory cycles. Recent studies have shown that E2 and P can slow LH pulses in adult women with PCOS, but higher concentrations of P are needed to inhibit LH pulse frequency. If hypothalamic sensitivity to inhibition by P is reduced during pubertal maturation, the low levels of P present during the initial development of ovarian cyclicity may not be adequate to suppress GnRH/LH pulse secretion. This could lead to LH excess and relative FSH deficiency.

Administering oral doses of P in early adolescence may compensate and restore normal ovarian-hypothalamic feedback. In turn, increasing amounts of naturally secreted P in subsequent cycles could eventually normalize the system. The long term goal of this line of investigation is to determine if E2 and P treatment of adolescents with hyperandrogenemia can slow the GnRH pulse generator to promote FSH production and the advent of normal menstrual cycles. As an initial step we propose to determine if the GnRH pulse generator is relatively insensitive to E2 and P inhibition in hyperandrogenemic adolescent girls.

### Vaginally administered estroprogestinic decreases serum inhibin A and inhibin B levels and reduces endometrial thickness [^111C4jB9]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Serum levels of inhibin A, inhibin B, FSH, and LH were measured in healthy volunteers before and during oral or vaginal estroprogestinic administration. In addition, the effect on endometrial thickness and on follicular growth pattern were also assessed by vaginal ultrasound.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

University of Siena.

Patient(S)

Seventeen healthy fertile women.

Intervention(S)

This open-label study was performed in 10 healthy volunteers, who were assigned to vaginal ethinylestradiol (15 microg) and etonogestrel (120 microg), one ring to be used for one cycle, after stratification for the ovulation day in a pretreatment cycle. A similar study on seven women assigned to oral ethinylestradiol (20 microg) and levonorgestrel (100 microg) was considered, to compare the effects of the two different routes of administration. Blood samples were collected the cycle before (days 8–10) and during (days 8–10) vaginal ring insertion and serum inhibin B, inhibin A, FSH, and LH levels were measured by ELISA. Concomitantly, transvaginal ultrasound was performed in all subjects for endometrial and follicular growth assessment.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Inhibin A, inhibin B, FSH, and LH levels.

Result(S)

Vaginal administration induced a significant decrease of serum inhibin A, inhibin B, FSH, and LH. No significant changes in inhibin B and FSH secretion were observed during oral contraceptive (OC) administration, whereas LH and inhibin A levels significantly decreased. Endometrial thickness and ovarian volume decreased significantly during vaginal ring insertion, but not after OC administration.

Conclusion(S)

The present findings showed that treatment with vaginal estroprogestinic decreases serum inhibin A and inhibin B levels, the follicular diameter, and endometrial thickness, showing a rapid and significant effect with the vaginal route.

### Pituitary, ovarian and additional contraceptive effects of an estradiol-based combined oral contraceptive: results of a randomized, open-label study [^114ardBW]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The estrogen step-down/progestogen step-up 28-day estradiol valerate/dienogest (E(2)V/DNG) oral contraceptive effectively inhibits ovulation; however, limited data are available regarding its effects on estradiol (E2), progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or its additional extraovarian contraceptive effects.

Study Design

In this secondary analysis, 100 women received E(2)V 3 mg on days 1–2, E(2)V 2 mg/DNG 2 mg on days 3–7, E(2)V 2 mg/DNG 3 mg on days 8–24, E(2)V 1 mg on days 25–26 and placebo on days 27–28 for one treatment cycle. Measures included the presence/absence of cervical mucus; endometrial thickness; and serum E2, progesterone, and gonadotropin levels.

Results

E2, progesterone, LH and FSH levels did not exhibit the typical ovulatory increase and remained relatively stable during the cycle. E(2)V/DNG reduced mean maximal endometrial thickness and proportion of women with visible cervical mucus. All parameters returned to pretreatment levels during the posttreatment cycle.

Conclusion

E(2)V/DNG provides extraovarian contraceptive effects (reducing endometrial thickness and cervical mucus production) in addition to inhibiting ovulation, assuring contraceptive efficacy.
