## Question

Can apremilast be used to treat pain from acute pancreatitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether apremilast can be used to treat pain from acute pancreatitis, and if it should be used for that purpose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what apremilast is actually approved for and its mechanism of action. Then, I should verify current guideline-based standards for acute pancreatitis pain management. Next, I will examine whether any direct clinical evidence links apremilast to pancreatitis pain control. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility in the context of pancreatitis pathophysiology. Finally, I should assess safety considerations and synthesize a recommendation that aligns with the evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the drug and its label. Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, and oral ulcers in Behçet's disease, working via intracellular cAMP signaling to modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; there is no regulatory approval or labeled indication for acute pancreatitis or pancreatitis pain [^111cXMyP] [^115gU21g] [^116BWuwb] [^111t7s2k] [^1153FydT].

> Next, I should review the standard of care for pain in acute pancreatitis to avoid jumping to off-label assumptions. Current high-credibility guidelines emphasize supportive care with multimodal analgesia, using acetaminophen or NSAIDs initially, escalating to opioids as needed, and considering regional techniques such as epidural or patient-controlled analgesia, with emerging data for transversus abdominis plane blocks; none include apremilast for pain control in acute pancreatitis [^111xwKmv] [^114zjbSo] [^115S7yse] [^111iKwLG] [^1141GKwF] [^114cqWzo].

> I will now examine whether there is any direct evidence connecting apremilast to pancreatitis treatment or analgesia. Hold on, I should verify across guidelines and interventional studies in pancreatitis: the acute pancreatitis literature and consensus documents do not mention apremilast in any therapeutic capacity for pain or disease modification, whereas investigational anti-inflammatory strategies have focused on other classes such as COX-2 inhibitors and calcium release–activated calcium channel inhibitors like Auxora, underscoring that PDE4 inhibition has not been studied here [^112seZeM] [^116yyJ6y] [^116SjAWk] [^111JTgpi] [^114zjbSo] [^111xwKmv].

> Wait, let me verify mechanistic plausibility before ruling it out entirely. I initially thought that because apremilast reduces TNF-α and certain interleukins, it might dampen inflammatory mediators relevant to pancreatitis and thereby reduce pain; but hold on, the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis pain is driven by complex local and systemic processes including acinar injury, ductal hypertension, neurogenic inflammation, and cytokine cascades in which the clinically tested anti-inflammatory strategies have centered on different targets such as COX-2 inhibition, and there is no translational or clinical signal for PDE4 inhibition in this setting, so my initial thought overestimates its applicability here [^116gov5d] [^1139xHv8] [^116AiP6G] [^112seZeM] [^116yyJ6y].

> I need to ensure safety is not being overlooked. Apremilast commonly causes gastrointestinal adverse effects including abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, and vomiting, and it carries warnings regarding depression; in acute pancreatitis — where patients already have severe abdominal pain and GI dysfunction — these adverse effects could worsen symptoms or confound severity assessment and fluid/nutrition decisions, so adding apremilast introduces risk without evidence of benefit [^111cXMyP] [^115nVJkz].

> But wait, what if there are related pharmacologic signals suggesting benefit in pancreatic inflammation that I might be missing. Let me double-check the contemporary interventional landscape: aside from standard multimodal analgesia, newer data explore regional anesthesia techniques and selective anti-inflammatory approaches like COX-2 inhibitors, while entirely different classes such as DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are actually associated with pancreatitis risk rather than used to treat it, reinforcing that repurposing apremilast in acute pancreatitis pain is unsupported [^114cqWzo] [^112seZeM] [^116yyJ6y] [^113EbNJj] [^116jkGCY] [^115q7HMZ] [^111Ghqtu].

> Next, I should synthesize a clear, guideline-concordant recommendation. Given the absence of evidence or guideline endorsement for apremilast in acute pancreatitis, the established approach is to use acetaminophen or NSAIDs, escalate to opioids with patient-controlled analgesia as needed, consider epidural or TAP blocks in selected patients, and continue comprehensive supportive care and early nutrition, while avoiding agents without evidence or with potentially confounding GI adverse effects in this setting [^111xwKmv] [^114zjbSo] [^115S7yse] [^1141GKwF] [^11724Qiw].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line for clinical decision-making. Apremilast should not be used to treat pain from acute pancreatitis because there is no clinical evidence, no mechanistic rationale validated in this disease context, and no regulatory approval or guideline support, and its adverse effect profile may worsen gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients, so care should adhere to guideline-based analgesia and supportive measures instead [^111cXMyP] [^111xwKmv] [^114zjbSo] [^115S7yse] [^115nVJkz] [^111iKwLG].

Apremilast is **not recommended** for acute pancreatitis pain due to a **lack of clinical evidence** supporting its use. Current guidelines endorse opioids [^111iKwLG], NSAIDs, and regional anesthesia [^114zjbSo] for pain control [^114cqWzo]; apremilast is not included in pancreatitis pain protocols [^1141GKwF]. Its gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) may worsen pancreatitis symptoms [^111cXMyP], and its anti-inflammatory effects remain unproven in acute pancreatitis [^114Cpv6o]. Use **standard analgesics** and **avoid apremilast** for acute pancreatitis pain.

---

## Mechanism of action and pharmacological profile of apremilast

Apremilast is a **selective PDE4 inhibitor** [^111t7s2k] that increases intracellular cAMP [^1152wCwH], modulating cytokines — ↓TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23; ↑IL-10 — and reducing inflammation in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^111EZZhF] [^116AiP6G]. It is approved for moderate-to-severe **plaque psoriasis**, **psoriatic arthritis** [^111t7s2k], and oral ulcers in **Behçet's syndrome** [^1153FydT].

---

## Clinical evidence for apremilast in acute pancreatitis pain

There is **no clinical evidence** — RCTs, observational studies, or case reports — evaluating apremilast for acute pancreatitis pain [^1147TGW4]. Its anti-inflammatory effects have not been studied in this setting [^116gov5d], and no data support an analgesic benefit.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for acute pancreatitis pain management

Current guidelines recommend a **multimodal approach** to pain management in acute pancreatitis [^111iKwLG] and do **not mention apremilast** [^114zjbSo]. Recommended options include:

- **Opioids**: First-line for moderate-to-severe pain [^111iKwLG] (e.g. morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl) [^1141GKwF].
- **NSAIDs**: For mild-to-moderate pain or as adjuncts to reduce opioid use.
- **Regional anesthesia**: Epidural analgesia or TAP blocks as alternatives or adjuncts to IV analgesia [^114zjbSo] [^114cqWzo].
- **Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)**: Recommended to optimize pain control [^115S7yse].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of apremilast in acute pancreatitis

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits are **theoretical**, limited to **anti-inflammatory effects** via cytokine modulation, which remain unproven in acute pancreatitis [^114Cpv6o].

---

### Potential risks

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common and may worsen pancreatitis symptoms [^111cXMyP].
- **Depression and suicidal ideation**: Reported [^115nVJkz]; use caution in patients with depression [^113k4GvL].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) reduce apremilast efficacy.

---

## Comparison with standard analgesic treatments

| **Analgesic treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Safety profile** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Opioids | High efficacy for severe pain | - Risk of dependence <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Constipation | - Strong evidence <br/> - Guideline-recommended [^1141GKwF] |
| NSAIDs | Moderate efficacy for mild-to-moderate pain | - Gastrointestinal bleeding <br/> - Renal impairment | - Moderate evidence [^112seZeM] <br/> - Guideline-recommended [^111iKwLG] |
| Regional anesthesia (epidural, TAP block) | High efficacy for severe pain | - Invasive <br/> - Procedural risks | - Strong evidence [^114cqWzo] <br/> - Guideline-recommended [^114zjbSo] |
| Apremilast | No evidence of efficacy | - Gastrointestinal side effects [^111cXMyP] <br/> - Depression [^115nVJkz] <br/> - Drug interactions | - No evidence [^116gov5d] <br/> - Not recommended [^114Cpv6o] |

---

## Ongoing clinical trials or research studies

There are **no ongoing trials or studies** evaluating apremilast for acute pancreatitis pain [^1147TGW4].

---

## Expert opinions and clinical experiences

No **expert opinions** or clinical experiences support apremilast for acute pancreatitis pain; experts recommend guideline-based analgesics and regional anesthesia [^111iKwLG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Apremilast is **not recommended** for acute pancreatitis pain because of a **lack of evidence** and gastrointestinal adverse effects that may exacerbate symptoms [^111cXMyP]. Use **guideline-supported analgesics** (opioids, NSAIDs, regional anesthesia) [^114zjbSo] and **avoid apremilast** in this setting.

### Ultrasound-guided TAP block: A promising strategy for managing acute pancreatitis pain in a prospective interventional study [^114cqWzo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for acute pain management in patients with acute pancreatitis in the emergency department, this study focused on pain relief, opioid use, and hospital stay.

This prospective, non-randomized, interventional, single-center study was conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary university hospital. Adult patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis were enrolled and divided into two treatment groups: one treated with TAP block and opioids, the other with opioids only. The primary outcome was pain score reduction over 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included total opioid consumption (in morphine equivalents) and hospital stay duration.

A total of 56 patients were included, with 28 patients in each group. The TAP + opioid group demonstrated significantly lower Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores at all follow-up time points (1, 6, 12, and 24 hours; all p < 0.001). Mean opioid consumption was 6.43 ± 2.58 mg in the TAP group and 12.59 ± 4.93 mg in the opioid-only group (p < 0.001). The mean hospital stay was also significantly shorter in the TAP group (5.00 ± 2.16 days vs. 6.71 ± 2.31 days; p = 0.006), with the most pronounced effect seen in biliary pancreatitis (p = 0.020). No TAP-related complications were reported.

Ultrasound-guided TAP block appears to be a safe and effective analgesic modality in the emergency management of acute pancreatitis, offering early pain relief, reduced opioid requirements, and shorter hospitalization. These findings support its use in clinical practice for managing acute pancreatitis pain.

As a progressive fibroinflammatory disease, chronic pancreatitis (CP) often manifests as recurrent bouts of abdominal pain, with or without complications, causing a heavy burden on healthcare. In recent years, meaningful insights into the management of CP have been obtained from randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, which are of great importance. Based on this research, various treatments for CP have been identified. Therefore, it is crucial to choose a suitable strategy for patients with CP individually.

Relevant evidence on the management of CP has been summarized in this review, including nutritional supplements, medication, endoscopy, surgery, exploration of novel therapies, as well as evaluation and prediction of treatment response.

### Acute pancreatitis [^111SdqrS]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a disease that can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and causes. These include elevated serum amylase, vomiting, fever, gallstones, nausea, and increased serum lipase levels. Patients may also experience epigastric abdominal pain, right upper quadrant pain, and have a history of alcohol use disorder. Fox's sign and increased urine pancreatic amylase are other possible indicators. Additionally, ascites, elevated serum ALT, abnormal ECG results, and increased serum immunoreactive trypsinogen are associated with the condition.

Patients may exhibit abdominal guarding, suffer from infection, or have a history of traumatic injury, obesity, recent surgery, and alcohol consumption. Cigarette smoking is another risk factor, along with jaundice and tenderness to palpation. Other symptoms to look for are abdominal pain worsening after eating, shock, and cystic fibrosis. The symptomatology can extend to sinus tachycardia, anorexia, and abdominal pain radiating to the back.

Further clinical signs include reactions to certain medications, abdominal tympany, decreased serum calcium, hematemesis, and metabolic disorders. Patients may also present with abdominal rigidity, inflammation, and decreased bowel sounds.

### Heterogeneity in pancreatitis: Recognizing heterogeneity and its role in the management of pancreatitis summary of a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases workshop [^112E1rNt]. Pancreas (2025). Low credibility.

Both the clinical management and study of acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis are complicated by significant heterogeneity in etiology, mechanisms, symptoms, and complications. The National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases recently convened a workshop to address knowledge and knowledge gaps in the field.

Preclinical models that better replicate human disease are important for the development of new therapies. Pain is often the most common and difficult symptom to treat. The causes are multifactorial, and effective treatment may vary depending on whether the pain is neuropathic or nociceptive in origin. Additionally, the placebo effect can complicate the evaluation of the efficacy of medical and procedural interventions. Novel technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging and virtual reality may offer new means for assessing and treating pain, respectively.

Clinical trial designs will need to consider the best approaches to addressing the heterogeneity of chronic pancreatitis, including careful attention to designing eligibility criteria and establishing accepted and validated core outcomes criteria for the field. The latter may be informed by consensus in pain research. Recruitment of participants into clinical trials has been challenging, often requiring multiple centers. The establishment of a clinical trials network would facilitate greater opportunities for therapeutic trials in pancreatitis.

### Adjuvant non-opioid analgesics decrease in-hospital mortality in targeted patients with acute pancreatitis receiving opioids [^117SPZBq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a significant gastrointestinal emergency, with its incidence steadily rising annually. This condition is characterized by acute pancreas inflammation, typically presenting with varying degrees of abdominal pain. In the United States, acute pancreatitis is the third most prevalent primary diagnosis for gastrointestinal disorders requiring hospitalization, with abdominal pain contributing substantially to healthcare costs and expenditures. Consequently, effective pain management is paramount for treating acute pancreatitis. However, guidelines provide limited guidance on pain management.

Opioids are commonly used for pain control in acute pancreatitis patients. Yet, studies have documented potential adverse effects of opioids, such as intestinal motility disorders, sphincter of Oddi spasm or dysfunction, and increased intestinal permeability. Opioids can induce sphincter of Oddi spasms by increasing phasic wave frequency and interfering with filling and peristalsis, thereby elevating bile duct pressure. These factors exacerbate the severity of acute pancreatitis and increase the demand for intensive care, ultimately influencing survival and rendering mortality prediction among acute pancreatitis patients in the ICU a significant challenge.

Thus, employing a judicious approach to pain control has significant clinical implications for intensive care management of pancreatitis. Furthermore, combination therapy, involving lower opioid doses alongside non-opioid analgesics, has proven effective in reducing overall opioid usage, suggesting the potent benefits of this strategy.

### Pharmacodynamic analysis of apremilast in Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis: Results from a phase 2b randomized trial [^111EZZhF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

We evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects of apremilast in 69 patients who were included in biomarker subanalyses of a phase 2b study that demonstrated the long-term safety and efficacy of apremilast in Japanese adults with moderate to severe psoriasis. The association between cytokine levels and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) improvement was evaluated using linear regression and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis. At baseline, median plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 were elevated versus reference values for healthy individuals, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α levels were close to normal. With apremilast 30 mg b.i.d., there were significant associations between percentage change in PASI score and percentage change in IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 levels at week 16. Findings demonstrate that the efficacy of apremilast in psoriasis is associated with inhibition of key cytokines involved in the pathology of psoriasis.

### Acupuncture for pain in chronic pancreatitis: A single-blinded randomized crossover trial [^113FvaW9]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Many patients with painful chronic pancreatitis (CP) experience insufficient effects from traditional treatment, and the prevalence of adverse effects is high. Consequently, alternatives to conventional management are needed. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acupuncture in painful CP.

This was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized crossover trial. Fifteen patients with CP were assigned to a session of acupuncture followed by sham stimulation, or vice versa. Patients rated clinical pain scores daily on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) and completed the Patient Global Impression of Change. For mechanistic linkage, resting-state electroencephalograms were recorded and quantified by spectral power analysis to explore effects on central pain processing.

Acupuncture, compared with sham stimulation, resulted in more pain relief (2.0 ± 1.5 VAS vs. 0.7 ± 0.8 VAS; P = 0.009). However, the effect was short-lived, and following a 1-week follow-up, there was no difference in clinical pain scores between groups (P = 1.0) or the rating of Patient Global Impression of Change (P = 0.8). Electroencephalogram spectral power distributions between sham and acupuncture were comparable between groups (all P > 0.6).

The study presents proof of concept for the analgesic effect of acupuncture in pancreatic pain. Although the effect was short-lasting, the framework may be used to conceptualize future trials of acupuncture in visceral pain.

### Januvia [^113EbNJj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pancreatitis**: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking Januvia. After initiation of Januvia, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, Januvia should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for its development while using Januvia.

- **Heart failure**: An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of Januvia prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and renal impairment. Observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy and advise them to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to standards of care and consider discontinuation of Januvia.

- **Acute renal failure**: There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment.

### Auxora for the treatment of patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying systemic inflammatory response syndrome: Clinical development of a calcium release-activated calcium channel inhibitor [^116SjAWk]. Pancreas (2021). Low credibility.

The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Auxora in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS plus hypoxemia, including the assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and 90-day overall survival. Secondary objectives were to determine potential efficacy endpoints for use in future studies of Auxora in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS. Prospective endpoints evaluated to assess the potential efficacy of Auxora compared with standard care included:

- **Change in CTSI score**: From screening to day 5 (or discharge).
- **Proportion of patients tolerating solid food**: At 72 hours and at discharge (defined as tolerating ≥ 50% of a solid meal without vomiting or an increase in abdominal pain).
- **Percentage of patients with persistent SIRS**: Lasting ≥ 48 hours.
- **Changes in IL-6 levels**
- **Length of hospital stay**

For all cohorts, assessments were performed daily from days 1 to 10, or until discharge if occurring earlier. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring the frequency, duration, and severity of TEAEs and SAEs. After day 10, beginning on day 12, SAEs were captured every 48 hours until day 30, or until discharge. Patients discharged before day 30 were contacted on day 30 to capture SAEs and any readmissions to the hospital. Patients were also contacted on day 90 to assess mortality.

The planned sample size of 24 patients was selected based on practical considerations that enabled the initial evaluation.

### Efficacy of apremilast in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis: A randomised controlled trial [^115N9nax]. Lancet (2012). Low credibility.

Apremilast, a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4, functions intracellularly to modulate the production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Doses of 20 mg twice daily have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis during a 12-week phase 2 study. This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of different doses of apremilast in treating patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

- **Methods**: In this phase 2b, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with moderate to severe psoriasis were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to receive oral placebo or apremilast 10, 20, or 30 mg twice daily at 35 US and Canadian sites between September 24, 2008, and October 21, 2009. At week 16, patients in the placebo group were reassigned to receive apremilast 20 or 30 mg twice daily until week 24. Randomisation was generated with a permuted-block randomisation list via an interactive voice response system. For the first 16 weeks, treatment assignment was concealed from both investigators and participants. During weeks 16–24, while investigators and participants knew the treatment was active, the dosage remained concealed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving at least a 75% reduction from baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI-75) at week 16. Analyses were by intention to treat, with missing values imputed by last-observation-carried-forward. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00773734.

- **Findings**: 89 patients were randomly assigned apremilast.

### Critical thresholds: Key to unlocking the door to the prevention and specific treatments for acute pancreatitis [^114VWqvp]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP), an acute inflammatory disorder of the exocrine pancreas, is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases encountered in emergency departments, with no specific treatments. Laboratory-based research has formed the cornerstone of endeavors to decipher the pathophysiology of AP, due to the limitations of such studies in human beings. While this research has provided substantial understanding, several pressing questions remain unanswered:

- **Why is it that only a minority of individuals** with gallstones, those who drink alcohol excessively, or who are exposed to other causative factors, develop AP?
- **Why do only some develop more severe manifestations**: of AP with necrosis and/or organ failure?
- **Why have we been unable to find an effective therapeutic**: for AP?

This manuscript provides a state-of-the-art review of our understanding of the pathophysiology of AP, offering insights into these unanswered clinical questions. We describe multiple protective factors operating in most people, and multiple stressors that in a minority induce AP, independently or together, via amplification loops. We present testable hypotheses aimed at halting the progression of severity to develop effective treatments for this common unpredictable disease.

### Acute pancreatitis: Current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^116gov5d]. Pancreas (2023). High credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), characterized by pancreatic inflammation leading to multiorgan failure, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to identify novel therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes for SAP patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify clinical strategies, known molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutic targets for SAP.

- **Results**: Clinical approaches focus on determining which patients will likely develop SAP; however, therapeutic options are limited to supportive care and fluid resuscitation. The application of a novel 5-cytokine panel accurately predicting disease outcomes in SAP suggests that molecular approaches will improve the impact of future clinical trials in AP.

- **Conclusions**: Inflammatory outcomes in acute pancreatitis are driven by several unique molecular signals, which compound to promote both local and systemic inflammation. The identification of master cytokine regulators is critical to developing therapeutics that reduce inflammation through several mechanisms.

### Parecoxib sequential with imrecoxib for occurrence and remission of severe acute pancreatitis: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116yyJ6y]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, parecoxib sequential with imrecoxib significantly reduced the occurrence of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) and was effective and well-tolerated in the remission of SAP by suppressing the systemic inflammatory response, even experiencing a long time window of onset, leading to decreased morbidity. This strategy significantly decreased local complications and improved clinical outcomes, including shorter hospital stays, lower mortality, and reduced costs.

### Prevention of severe acute pancreatitis with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors: A randomized controlled clinical trial [^112seZeM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

On admission, serum levels of CRP were sharply increased in all patients enrolled in this study, with levels over 150 mg/L occurring in more than half of them. After treatment — on days 4 and 8 — CRP levels decreased significantly, with a greater reduction observed in the C+COX-2-Is group compared to the conventional treatment group.

Serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly higher than the upper limits of normal (TNF-α < 8.1 pg/mL, IL-6 < 7.00 pg/mL) at enrollment (day 0), with no initial difference between the two groups. Following treatment, these levels decreased in both groups on days 4 and 8, with a more significant reduction in the C+COX-2-Is group compared to the conventional group (P < 0.05).

No severe adverse events related to parecoxib or celecoxib were observed. There was, however, an occurrence of a scattered red maculopapular rash on the chest and both upper limbs of a 26-year-old man with calculous cholecystitis in the conventional group on the second day after admission. This was considered an allergic reaction to intravenous moxifloxacin. The rash resolved soon after the intramuscular injection of 25 mg promethazine hydrochloride.

### Characterizing mechanism-based pain phenotypes in patients with chronic pancreatitis: A cross-sectional analysis of the PROspective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for EpidEmiologic and Translational StuDies [^114N7mXR]. Pain (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we characterized pain in a large, multicenter cohort of patients with definite chronic pancreatitis (CP). Similar to the multicenter NAPS cohort (46%), 44.5% of the cohort was assigned alcoholic etiology. In our cohort, the history of recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) was 65.5%, which is also similar to the NAPS cohort (66%). Importantly, the prevalence of pain (80.9%) is in the range with other CP cohorts (72%-93%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the PROMIS Pain instruments in CP. Over two-thirds of patients in the cohort could be classified as having nociceptive-only (∼40%), neuropathic-like only (∼5%), or both (∼32%) types of pain, but a subset had unclassifiable pain (∼24%). This distribution is similar to other complex diseases. It should be noted that the PROMIS Pain Quality forms were initially designed and validated for somatic, not visceral, pain conditions. However, pancreatitis has a somatic component in addition to visceral; this enables the use of quantitative sensory testing to predict therapeutic responses. Although it is often assumed that pancreatitis-related somatic pain is referred pain, the parietal peritoneum that covers the pancreas is directly innervated by somatic afferents. Thus, chemicals released by injured pancreas as well as mechanical changes induced by edema and fibrosis can directly drive somatic nociception and pain.

There was no difference between pain groups with respect to most patient-related and disease-related factors. However, the proportion of women was significantly higher in the nociceptive-only pain group.

### Acute pancreatitis: Current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^114Cpv6o]. Pancreas (2023). High credibility.

- **Objective**: Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), characterized by pancreatic inflammation leading to multiorgan failure, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to identify novel therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes for SAP patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify clinical strategies, known molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutic targets for SAP.

- **Results**: Clinical approaches focus on determining which patients are likely to develop SAP. However, therapeutic options are limited to supportive care and fluid resuscitation. The application of a novel 5-cytokine panel that accurately predicts disease outcomes in SAP suggests that molecular approaches will improve the impact of future clinical trials in acute pancreatitis.

- **Conclusions**: Inflammatory outcomes in acute pancreatitis are driven by several unique molecular signals, which compound to promote both local and systemic inflammation. Identifying master cytokine regulators is critical for developing therapeutics that reduce inflammation through several mechanisms.

### Efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114VcEU9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease of the skin and joints. Plaque psoriasis is the most common clinical phenotype of psoriasis. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of plaque psoriasis. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

This systematic review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing apremilast 20mg twice daily (BID) and 30mg BID with placebo for its efficacy on plaque psoriasis. We searched the Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. We sought to evaluate the following outcomes: psoriasis area and severity index score (PASI)-50, PASI-75, PASI-90, static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA), and adverse events. The risk ratio (RR) was used to represent dichotomous outcomes and adverse events, and the data were pooled using the inverse variance weighting method.

Eight RCTs that enrolled 2,635 participants were deemed eligible. Apremilast 30mg BID and 20mg BID were significantly more efficacious than placebo in achieving PASI-75 over 16 weeks (RR = 4.60, 95% CI 3.29–6.41, and RR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.96–5.07, respectively). Apremilast 30mg BID showed a significantly higher rate of adverse events than the placebo (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.16–1.33), whereas apremilast 20mg BID did not exhibit any significant difference (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.91–1.42).

This meta-analysis demonstrated that apremilast monotherapy is an effective therapeutic option for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

### Auxora for the treatment of patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying systemic inflammatory response syndrome: Clinical development of a calcium release-activated calcium channel inhibitor [^111JTgpi]. Pancreas (2021). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is a local and systemic inflammatory disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality because of clinical sequelae, most notably pancreatic necrosis and persistent organ failure. Pancreatic necrosis occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with acute pancreatitis, with 30% of them subsequently developing infection of the necrotic tissue. Persistent organ failure, defined using the Modified Marshall Scoring system and lasting for at least 48 hours, may occur in up to 25% of patients with acute pancreatitis. Persistent organ failure signifies the development of severe acute pancreatitis and its presence increases the risk of mortality to as much as 50%. Recent studies have shown that pancreatic necrosis and persistent organ failure often occur independently of each other. In one post hoc analysis of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis (n = 639), 62% of patients did not develop organ failure and in a separate retrospective study of patients with multiple organ failure (n = 176), 54% had no evidence of pancreatic necrosis. As such, it is critical that any treatment for acute pancreatitis targets the development of both pancreatic necrosis and organ failure.

### Management of acute pancreatitis: Current knowledge and future perspectives [^111dSCiQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

In recent years, numerous articles have been published on the treatment of acute pancreatitis in experimental models, with most focusing on animals with mild disease. However, translating these results into clinical practice is challenging. For instance, infliximab, a monoclonal TNF antibody, was experimentally tested in rats and was found to significantly reduce the pathological score and serum amylase activity, as well as alleviate alveolar edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Yet, no studies are available for clinical human acute pancreatitis.

Another substance, interleukin 10, proved efficacious in decreasing the severity and mortality of lethal pancreatitis in rats but seems to have no effect on human severe acute pancreatitis. The main issue in acute pancreatitis, particularly in its severe form, is the difficulty of planning clinical studies capable of providing reliable, statistically significant answers regarding the benefits of various proposed therapeutic agents previously tested in experimental settings.

According to the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis, the efficacy of drugs already available, such as gabexate mesilate, lexipafant, and somatostatin, should be re-evaluated and possibly administered in a different manner. Adequate studies are needed to test this hypothesis, of course.

### Controversies on the endoscopic and surgical management of pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis: pros and cons [^117D5QLB]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Surgery is effective both in patients with a ductal obstruction and an inflammatory head mass. The most commonly performed procedure is pancreatic duct drainage by a lateral pancreaticojejunostomy, in which the pancreatic duct is opened along its entire length and anastomosed (side to side) to a Roux-Y jejunal limb. An inflammatory head mass can be resected using pancreatoduodenectomy or a duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection such as the Berne or Beger procedures. Ductal drainage and duodenum-preserving (partial) head resection are combined in a Frey procedure. Surgery is reported to have a good long-term effect, although approximately 10% of patients will not respond, and this risk is higher in patients who have had a large number of endoscopic procedures prior to surgery.

Two RCTs have compared endoscopic and surgical management in patients with painful obstructive CP. Both studies showed the superiority of surgical over endoscopic management. The study of Dite et al. randomized 72 patients with CP and reported, after 5 years of follow-up, 34% complete and 52% partial relief after surgery versus 15% complete pain absence and 46% partial relief after endoscopy. However, endoscopy in this study was not optimal since no ESWL was applied. The study by Cahen et al. randomized 39 patients with painful obstructive CP and reported, after 2 years of follow-up, 75% pain relief after surgery versus 32% after endoscopy, which included ESWL (p = 0.007). In long-term follow-up, these results remained stable after more than 6 years, with 80% pain relief in the surgery group versus…

### Controversies on the endoscopic and surgical management of pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis: Pros and cons [^115ft7Po]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

A hypothetical illustration of the pain intensity over time (solid curve) in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. At the initial course of the disease, the pain is fluctuating and may reach a high intensity, as illustrated on the y-axis. When the pain intensity is highest, the patient may become desperate and seek invasive treatment (arrow). However, the natural course of the disease (in this case, the pain temporarily improves) is not considered when evaluating the outcomes of uncontrolled studies of invasive treatment. Such selection bias necessitates a control group subjected to sham surgery/endoscopy before any definitive conclusions regarding the effectiveness of treatment can be made. The placebo effect (stippled green line) can further contribute to the pain relief observed after invasive treatments.

### Interventional options for the management of refractory cancer pain — what is the evidence [^114mXhRc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom in cancer patients. Standard pain treatment according to the WHO three-step analgesic ladder provides effective pain management in approximately 70–90% of cancer patients. Refractory pain is defined as not responding to "standard" treatments. Interventional analgesic techniques can be used in an attempt to control refractory pain in patients for whom conventional analgesic strategies fail to provide effective pain relief or are intolerable due to severe adverse effects. This systematic review aims to provide the latest evidence on interventional refractory pain management in cancer patients.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane, EMBASE, and PubMed, including reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials in the absence of reviews. Neuraxial analgesia may play a role in refractory cancer pain management. Paravertebral blocks decrease the incidence of persistent post-surgical pain after breast cancer. Coeliac plexus blocks improve pain scores in refractory pancreatic cancer pain for up to 4 weeks after the intervention, with fewer burdensome side effects compared to opioids. Cordotomy has mainly been studied in mesothelioma, and case series suggest possible benefit for pain at the expense of a relatively high risk of side effects.

Overall, very few RCTs have been conducted on interventional pain techniques. In reality, it is very difficult to undertake large controlled trials for a number of reasons. Therefore, today's best evidence for practice may be from existing studies and systematic reviews.

### Ultrasound-guided subcostal TAP block with depot steroids in the management of chronic abdominal pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis: A three-year prospective audit in 54 patients [^11764Pqo]. Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis is a common cause of chronic abdominal pain that utilizes significant health care resources. Pain in chronic pancreatitis can be of two types: visceral pain occurs during ongoing pancreatic inflammation. Once pancreatic inflammation subsides, the pain generator can move to the abdominal wall due to viscerosomatic convergence, presenting as abdominal myofascial pain syndrome. Subcostal transversus abdominis plane block is an abdominal plane block proven effective in upper abdominal pain of somatic origin.

- **Design**: The authors discuss the two distinct types of chronic abdominal pain resulting from pancreatitis and present a prospective audit of a management pathway.

- **Methods**: Over a three-year period, 54 patients with chronic abdominal pain due to pancreatitis were prospectively audited at a tertiary care university hospital. Patients were offered bilateral subcostal transversus abdominis plane block with depot steroids as the primary interventional treatment in the pathway.

- **Results**: In patients with myofascial pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis, the block was effective in producing clinically significant pain relief at three months (95%, 20/21) and durable pain relief lasting six months (62%, 13/21). In patients with visceral pain, the block produced a transient benefit lasting two to three weeks in one-third (six of 17) of the cases.

- **Conclusions**: Subcostal transversus abdominis plane block may be an option in the management of abdominal myofascial pain syndrome secondary to chronic pancreatitis.

### Pain intensity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis in an international, prospective study [^1139xHv8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

In this study of patients admitted with first-time acute pancreatitis (AP) across a large geographical area, severe pain intensity on admission was associated with more severe AP, renal organ failure, and pancreatic necrosis compared with no/mild pain. Moderate pain intensity on admission was only associated with increased odds of pancreatic necrosis (as well as decreased odds of fluid collections) compared with no/mild pain. However, the discriminatory performance of pain intensity was poor, with low AUC-ROCs and no significant effect on post-test probability for all outcomes. Although pain severity may reflect underlying disease burden in AP, it lacks sufficient accuracy for early risk stratification when used in isolation. However, the high negative predictive values observed in this study suggest that the absence of severe pain on admission may help reassure clinicians and support the decision for outpatient management in low-risk patients.

The pathophysiology of pain in AP is incompletely understood, and the majority of the evidence comes from chronic pancreatitis or experimental models of AP. Traditionally, pancreatic pain has been attributed to local inflammation, resulting in tissue damage, ischaemia, oedema, necrosis, and increased ductal pressure. Furthermore, the extensive release of inflammatory mediators during an episode of AP may lead to primary hyperalgesia. This is in contrast to the physiology of pain in painful chronic pancreatitis, for which it is well known that neuropathic pain and central sensitization play an important role.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^113p99NM]. Canadian Journal of Surgery. Journal Canadien de Chirurgie (2016). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and confirmation of this condition in patients presenting with relevant symptoms. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis, thereby enabling timely and appropriate treatment.

The criteria are based on three primary components: abdominal pain, elevated levels of lipase or amylase, and characteristic findings on imaging studies such as CT or MRI. The abdominal pain associated with acute pancreatitis is typically acute in onset, persistent, severe, and located in the epigastric region, often radiating to the back. The second component involves a significant increase in the levels of pancreatic enzymes, specifically lipase or amylase, to more than three times the upper limit of normal. The third component involves the identification of characteristic findings indicative of acute pancreatitis on CT or MRI scans.

The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed if two of the three criteria are met. These combinations can be either the presence of abdominal pain and elevated enzyme levels, elevated enzyme levels and characteristic imaging findings, or abdominal pain and characteristic imaging findings. If these combinations are not met, the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis are not fulfilled. This approach ensures a high degree of diagnostic accuracy while allowing for appropriate management decisions.

### Tradjenta [^115q7HMZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pancreatitis**: Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, has been reported in patients treated with Tradjenta. In the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], acute pancreatitis was reported in 9 (0.3%) patients treated with Tradjenta and in 5 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo. Two patients treated with Tradjenta in the CARMELINA trial had acute pancreatitis with a fatal outcome. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients treated with Tradjenta. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Tradjenta and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using Tradjenta.

- **Hypoglycemia with concomitant use with insulin and insulin secretagogues**: Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when Tradjenta is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g. sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The use of Tradjenta in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Therefore, a lower dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with Tradjenta.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with Tradjenta.

### Melatonin treatment of pigs with acute pancreatitis reduces inflammatory reaction of pancreatic tissue and enhances fitness score of pigs: Experimental research [^112iWXh7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory and potentially fatal disease. The initial management of acute pancreatitis is supportive and includes optimization of electrolyte and fluid balance, providing adequate caloric support, and preventing complications. Local complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic pseudocysts, pancreatic duct injury, and peripancreatic vascular complications are treated through a combination of endoscopic, radiologic, and surgical techniques. Surgical management is indicated in cases of acute gallstone pancreatitis or other complications. Despite improved diagnostic and therapeutic options, acute pancreatitis remains associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

The hormone melatonin has been suggested to enhance the activation of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, and to reduce radical oxygen and nitrogen species. In acute pancreatitis, melatonin is described as playing a protective role due to the reduction of gene expression and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukins such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and prostaglandins. Additionally, melatonin modulates the processes of apoptosis and necrosis. Studies using animal models indicate that melatonin might have a protective role in acute pancreatitis-associated organ injuries. The main purpose of this study was to further evaluate the clinical effects of melatonin in this context.

### Apremilast for immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced psoriasis: A case series [^116AiP6G]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Apremilast is an orally available phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. PDE4 inhibition leads to the accumulation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which results in an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, such as IL-10, and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, IL-22, and IL-13. Apremilast has shown clinical efficacy in both skin and arthritic psoriasis. Generally, the safety of apremilast at a dosage of 30 mg bid appears to be sound, as the most frequent adverse events include light-to-mild nausea and diarrhea during the first weeks of treatment. Apremilast's safety profile is further emphasized by the absence of tuberculosis reactivation, serious infections, and malignancies. For this reason, it is regarded more as an immunomodulating agent rather than an immunosuppressant drug.

### Pregabalin for decreasing pancreatic pain in chronic pancreatitis [^1153yXdw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain is one of the major symptoms in people with chronic pancreatitis. The role of pregabalin in managing chronic pancreatic pain due to this condition is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of pregabalin in individuals experiencing chronic abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2015, issue 6, as well as MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trial registers until June 2015. Additionally, we reviewed references of included trials to identify further studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in individuals with chronic pancreatic pain due to chronic pancreatitis. This inclusion was irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We computed the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using RevMan 5, based on intention-to-treat analysis.

- **Main results**: Only one study, funded by Pfizer, met the inclusion criteria for this review. A total of 64 participants (experiencing chronic pain due to chronic pancreatitis) were randomly assigned to receive escalating doses of pregabalin (150 mg per day to 600 mg per day; 34 participants) or a matching placebo (30 participants). Participants received pregabalin or placebo on an outpatient basis for three weeks, with outcomes measured at the end of treatment.

### Nationwide outcome of tailored surgery for symptomatic chronic pancreatitis based on pancreatic morphology: Validation of the international guidelines [^116hvJdP]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Clinically relevant pain relief was considered a decrease in pain during the follow-up period, defined as either complete (no more opioids) or partial (decreased use of opioids). Codeine and tramadol were considered weak opioids, whereas oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, diamorphine/heroin, dihydromorphine, and remifentanil were considered strong opioids. Other types of pain medication than opioids comprised paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and neuropathic analgesics such as gabapentin.

Endocrine and exocrine insufficiency was defined as the use of medication (i.e. diabetes medication and enzyme replacement therapy respectively) or a fecal-elastase-1 test. A main pancreatic duct of 5 mm was considered dilated, whereas 40 mm was considered enlarged. Pancreatic morphology of chronic pancreatitis was described as a normal or dilated main pancreatic duct, and enlarged or normal pancreatic head.

### Role of differential neuroaxial blockade in the evaluation and management of pain in chronic pancreatitis [^114jiGuT]. American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatic pain is challenging to treat. Surgical and medical therapies aimed at reducing pain have shown little long-term success. Moreover, there are no reliable predictors of response, including pancreatic duct diameter. A differential neuroaxial blockade facilitates the characterization of chronic abdominal pain into visceral and nonvisceral origins and may serve as a guide to treatment. Pain originating from an inflamed and scarred pancreas should be visceral. The purpose of our study was to determine the frequency of visceral pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis and assess whether our modified differential neuroaxial blockade technique using thoracic epidural analgesia can accurately predict which patients will respond to medical or surgical therapy.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with a firmly established diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis (Cambridge classification, calcifications) who had undergone a differential neuroaxial block for chronic abdominal pain evaluation. Patient demographics and medical or surgical treatment for pancreatic pain were recorded. Response to therapy was defined as a 50% reduction in pain by verbal response score.

- **Results**: A total of 23 patients were identified. Alcohol was the most common etiology for chronic pancreatitis (15 of 23, 55%). Surprisingly, the majority of chronic pancreatitis patients had nonvisceral pain (18 of 23, 78%), and only 22% (5 of 23) had visceral pain as determined by differential neuroaxial block. Of the patients with visceral pain, four out of five (80%) responded to therapy.

### A randomized controlled phase 2 dose-finding trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camostat in the treatment of painful chronic pancreatitis: The TACTIC study [^111G8WG7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) causes an abdominal pain syndrome associated with poor quality of life. We conducted a clinical trial to further investigate the efficacy and safety of camostat, an oral serine protease inhibitor used to alleviate pain in CP.

- **Methods**: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial that enrolled adults with CP with a baseline average daily worst pain score of ≥ 4 on a numeric rating system. Participants were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive camostat at 100, 200, or 300 mg three times daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was a 4-week change from baseline in the mean daily worst pain intensity score (0–10 on a numeric rating system) using a mixed model repeated measure analysis. Secondary endpoints included changes in alternate pain endpoints, quality of life, and safety.

- **Results**: A total of 264 participants with CP were randomized. Changes in pain from baseline were similar between the camostat groups and placebo, with differences of least squares means of -0.11 (95% CI, -0.90 to 0.68), -0.04 (95% CI, -0.85 to 0.78), and -0.11 (95% CI, -0.94 to 0.73) for the 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg groups, respectively. Multiple subgroup analyses were similar for the primary endpoint, and no differences were observed in any of the secondary endpoints. Treatment-emergent adverse events attributed to the study drug were identified in 42 participants (16.0%).

- **Conclusion**: We were not able to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in improvements in pain or quality of life outcomes in participants with painful CP who received camostat.

The goal is to frame the essential aspects of trial design, including patient-centered outcomes, proposed methods to measure the outcomes of pain and progression, and study design considerations for future trials to facilitate rapid drug development for patients with CP.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113QX2XL]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) do not influence the clinical course of acute pancreatitis (AP), including factors such as hospitalization length, time to resume oral intake, or pain relief. Consequently, their routine use is not recommended in this clinical context. However, for patients with chronic pancreatitis and other diseases characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, who exhibit steatorrhea that is refractory to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the use of PPIs as add-on medication is indicated.

AP is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders necessitating acute hospitalization worldwide, with an annual incidence reported between 13–45 cases per 100,000 people. It involves inflammation of the pancreas and can sometimes trigger a systemic inflammatory response that impairs the function of other organs or systems. The inflammation may resolve spontaneously or may progress to necrosis of the pancreas and/or surrounding fatty tissue. Such dysfunction may either resolve or lead to organ failure. Consequently, the disease presents in a wide spectrum, ranging from mild cases, where recovery occurs within a few days, to severe cases (10–15%) that require prolonged hospital stays, critical care support, and carry a 15–20% risk of death. In Italy, AP is frequently mild, with a biliary cause and a low overall mortality rate of 5%. Regardless of its etiology, AP must be recognized as a systemic disease, rather than merely a pancreatic disorder. This prevalent, potentially fatal condition necessitates up-to-date, evidence-based treatment.

### Management of chronic pancreatitis: Recent advances and future prospects [^117TRafd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

It is challenging to quantitatively assess pain symptoms in chronic pancreatitis (CP) research. Recently, a series of standardized stimulations have been used in quantitative sensory testing (QST) to map the pain system, providing a novel tool to investigate and evaluate chronic pain. Currently, there are two ongoing trials aimed at distinguishing phenotypes characterized by segmental sensitization of the pancreatic viscerotome and systemic sensitization with pathological central pain processing (NCT03434392). These trials also aim to evaluate the ability of pancreatic QST (P-QST) to predict responses to invasive therapies for CP with pain symptoms and to develop a predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment response (NCT04996628).

- **Evaluation and prediction of treatment response**: Evaluation and prediction of efficacy are critical for the management of CP. The QOLAPI trial (NCT03632616) and EQuiPP trial (NCT05012150) are currently recruiting participants to evaluate the effect of endoscopic therapy on the quality of life, pain, and pancreatic function of patients with CP. Regarding social factors, the PEPCP (Personalized Education and Pain Response in Chronic Pancreatitis) trial is also recruiting participants to evaluate the impact of personalized education on pain response in patients with CP (NCT04654377). Additionally, applying an evidence-based integrated management algorithm, the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group is conducting the COMBO trial, the first stepped-wedge cluster-RCT involving 26 centers, to investigate the effect of an evidence-based integrated approach.

### Conservative treatment of chronic pancreatitis [^114sj4rF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis has been difficult to treat because the origin, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and causes of unrelenting pain are poorly understood. Furthermore, the pharmacologic agents often used in other diseases with pain appear to be ineffective in many cases. The conservative management of chronic pancreatitis aims to limit disease progression and complications, replace lost exocrine and endocrine function, and control pain. Life style changes, such as cessation of alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking, trials of pancreatic enzymes, treatment of duct obstructions and pseudocysts, and surgical therapies, are currently employed. Fortunately, understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is advancing rapidly, and there is hope that patient-specific and highly effective therapies will become available in the near future.

### Idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis: current and future approaches to management [^116fWv4B]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Idiopathic recurrent acute pancreatitis (IRAP) is a clinically relevant condition with a high likelihood of progression to chronic pancreatitis (CP) in 20–50% of patients. This review outlines the importance of early diagnosis of IRAP and potential upcoming therapies to halt disease progression. It highlights a potential therapeutic window in the natural history of IRAP.

- **Recent findings**: Despite advancements in diagnostic modalities, identifying a definitive etiology remains challenging in a significant proportion of cases. Approaches emphasize structured, stepwise evaluation, including metabolic, genetic, and structural factors. Emerging therapies aim to target inflammation, trypsin activation, and pancreatic fibrosis.

- **Summary**: While diagnostic tools have improved, therapeutic options remain limited in IRAP. Early identification of modifiable risk factors, the use of advanced imaging, and the application of evolving treatment strategies may offer an opportunity to prevent the transition from IRAP to CP. Future research must focus on validating disease-modifying treatments and optimizing individualized management strategies.

### Zepbound [^111Ghqtu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists or tirzepatide.

In clinical trials of tirzepatide for a different indication, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 tirzepatide-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure). In a pool of two Zepbound clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), 0.2% of Zepbound-treated patients had acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication (0.14 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients (0.15 patients per 100 years of exposure). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for treatment-emergent adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis in the pooled clinical studies for OSA (Studies 5 and 6) was 0.84 patients per 100 years for Zepbound and 0 for placebo-treated patients.

After the initiation of Zepbound, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue Zepbound and initiate appropriate management. Continuation of Zepbound following a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be individually determined based on the clinical judgment of a patient's health care provider.

### Pancreatic pain [^112XPzXx]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis, with a profound socioeconomic impact. Historical management paradigms failed as they did not adequately address the fundamental underlying mechanisms. The present article describes the neurobiology of pain and sensitization in this condition in an effort to explain prior failings and provide future directions for managing pain in chronic pancreatitis.

A number of recent advances have been made in understanding the neurobiology of pain for this condition. This has been coupled with clinical advances in assessing sensitization to pain in these patients, which has been shown to predict response to medical and surgical therapy.

Pain in chronic pancreatitis is complex. Addressing the mechanical and morphological findings in chronic pancreatitis without addressing the underlying neurobiological mechanisms is destined to fail. New advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of pain in chronic pancreatitis help to explain prior failings and provide future direction for managing pain in patients afflicted by this disease.

### Oral lichen planus treated with apremilast [^1174XLeV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral lichen planus is a very difficult condition to treat and causes patients to experience pain and difficulty eating. Therapeutic approaches focus on minimizing flares and relieving pain and discomfort to improve patient quality of life. Topical preparations are the mainstay of therapy, but they are often insufficiently efficacious for more severe cases. The use of systemic agents can be complicated by potentially serious adverse effects, the need for regular monitoring, suboptimal efficacy, and cost. Reported here are three recalcitrant cases of oral lichen planus that were effectively treated with apremilast, a drug recently approved for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

### American gastroenterological association clinical practice update: Management of pancreatic necrosis [^1158yMJR]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and expert recommendations regarding the clinical care of patients with pancreatic necrosis and to offer concise best practice advice for the optimal management of patients with this highly morbid condition.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 15 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, which reflect landmark and recent published articles in this field. The review also reflects the experiences of the authors, who are advanced endoscopists or hepatopancreatobiliary surgeons with extensive experience in managing and teaching others to care for patients with pancreatic necrosis.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Pancreatic necrosis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, and optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach. This includes involving gastroenterologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and specialists in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and nutrition. In situations where clinical expertise may be limited, consideration should be given to transferring patients with significant pancreatic necrosis to an appropriate facility.

### A systematic review of pain assessment domains in acute pancreatitis randomised controlled trials [^1147TGW4]. Pancreas (2025). High credibility.

To evaluate the domains of pain assessment used in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on pain management in acute pancreatitis (AP), a systematic review of RCTs on AP pain management was conducted. Studies were analysed for domains assessed, methods of pain assessment, need for rescue analgesia, and adverse effects of pain management.

- **Results**: Sixteen RCTs, undertaken between 1984 and 2024 involving 1,016 patients, were included. Most trials (n = 15) employed a unidimensional pain assessment tool, with a visual analogue scale in 12 and a numeric rating scale in 3 trials. The multidimensional modified-brief pain inventory (m-BPI) used in one RCT was the only tool that evaluated more than just pain intensity as a domain. There was notable variation in other measures of pain, efficacy of analgesia, and the approach to rescue analgesia. The reporting of adverse effects was also highly variable and most commonly included nausea, vomiting, and altered bowel habits. There was no data on quality of life, or physical and psychological functions.

- **Conclusion**: The assessment of pain in RCTs relies almost entirely on unidimensional pain assessment tools, which do not capture the complexity of the pain experience. There is a need for multidimensional pain assessment tools specific to AP, which would allow better assessment of pain in clinical practice and in future trials.

### Endoscopic treatment of pain in chronic pancreatitis [^112Xn8ju]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis, having a profound effect on patients and a broad socioeconomic impact. Endoscopy is guideline recommended as first-line management for chronic pancreatitis pain in certain clinical scenarios. Herein, we provide an evidence-based review of the endoscopic treatment of pain due to chronic pancreatitis while highlighting some important confounders in the measurement of this outcome in clinical practice and research.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple recent studies have reported on the efficacy of endoscopic therapies for chronic pancreatitis pain. Despite the high technical success rates of these procedures, pain outcomes remain disappointing. Complex mechanisms beyond ductal hypertension, such as central sensitization, visceral hypersensitivity, and inflammatory neuritis account for some of the discordance observed between the rates of technical and clinical success. In addition, the sham effect is increasingly recognized as a confounder when interpreting the procedural benefit. Nevertheless, there are multiple promising innovations in the field of pancreatic endoscopy that are aimed to improve technical and clinical outcomes, but rigorous investigation is necessary to establish their role in clinical practice.

- **Summary**: Endoscopic therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain appears to be safe and effective in certain contexts, and recent innovations in the field will hopefully further improve outcomes. In addition to evaluating the technical success of endotherapy in chronic pancreatitis, methodologically rigorous investigation is needed.

### Management of treatment-resistant acquired perforating dermatosis with apremilast: A novel therapeutic approach [^1152wCwH]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The management of acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) presents a significant therapeutic challenge due to its chronic and often treatment-resistant nature. Traditional treatment strategies involve addressing the underlying medical conditions, commonly chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus, and alleviating symptoms. Considering its established efficacy in other inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis and Behçet's disease, the patient was started on apremilast.

Apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in controlling inflammatory responses by regulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. By doing so, apremilast results in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukins (IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-23), and interferon-gamma, while promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Phosphodiesterase 4 is widely expressed among various cells, including natural killer cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and keratinocytes.

In addition to modulating cytokine production, apremilast reduces the production of leukotriene B4, nitric oxide synthase, and matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in processes such as epidermal thickening and neutrophil chemotaxis. In the context of APD, apremilast's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects may help to mitigate local inflammation and reduce the formation of abnormal tissue structures. Apremilast has a relatively favorable adverse effect profile, including nausea, diarrhea, headaches, weight loss, and mood changes.

### Auxora for the treatment of patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying systemic inflammatory response syndrome: Clinical development of a calcium release-activated calcium channel inhibitor [^113udMu3]. Pancreas (2021). Low credibility.

A total of 7 patients treated with Auxora had a maximum IL-6 level of 150 pg/mL or greater in the first 24 hours, 2 of whom had IL-6 levels of 1000 pg/mL or greater. Both patients survived, and neither required mechanical ventilation despite having respiratory failure at presentation. Three patients treated with the standard of care had a maximum IL-6 level of 150 pg/mL or greater in the first 24 hours. Treatment with Auxora was associated with a decrease in IL-6 levels to less than 150 pg/mL in 6 of 7 patients, whereas only 1 of 3 patients treated with the standard of care had IL-6 levels that dropped below this threshold. Both patients with IL-6 levels of 1000 pg/mL or greater who were treated with Auxora had levels of 150 pg/mL or less after treatment.

### Management of chronic pancreatitis [^113zzNDa]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis results from repeated episodes of pancreatic inflammation and associated fibrosis, leading to the loss of functional exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. The disease is manifested by abdominal pain, deterioration in quality of life, food maldigestion and malabsorption, diabetes, and an increased risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This review summarizes the latest evidence on the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis and its manifestations. In particular, this review discusses advances in the understanding of the role of genetic disorders in the mechanisms of the disease and surgical options for patients refractory to medical therapy. Furthermore, clinical trials are underway to develop medical therapeutics.

### Painful chronic pancreatitis - new approaches for evaluation and management [^111xh3mi]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Management of abdominal pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis is often suboptimal. We review recent data on the epidemiology and new approaches for managing pain in chronic pancreatitis.

- **Recent findings**: Chronic pancreatitis duration does not appear to affect the pain experience. Pain patterns in chronic pancreatitis patients frequently change and are not related to traditional patient and disease-related factors. Psychological comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression, are frequent in patients with chronic pancreatitis and are associated with more severe pain and pain interference. Adjunctive treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, may positively influence pain management in chronic pancreatitis. Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is an increasingly adopted treatment option in painful chronic pancreatitis. Ongoing multicenter studies will help define optimal candidates, predictors of successful pain remission, and diabetes outcomes after TPIAT. Pancreatic quantitative sensory testing, a promising technique to interrogate nociception and sensory response, holds promise in identifying patients with central sensitization. Initial studies show feasibility to stratify patients into defined pain profiles, and future studies will explore if these can help in prognostication of pain therapy.

- **Summary**: Several lines of investigations currently under evaluation are likely to have a positive impact on the management of pain in chronic pancreatitis.
