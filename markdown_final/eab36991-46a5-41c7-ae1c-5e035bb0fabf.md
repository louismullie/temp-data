## Question

Exercise in older adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about exercise prescription for older adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching evidence base and guideline anchors. Then, I should verify the core prescription elements and dose–response. Next, I will examine special populations and comorbidities, followed by implementation, adherence, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, staged prescription and highlight key uncertainties and research gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the foundational evidence and guideline framework so I don't jump to conclusions. The WHO 2020 guidelines provide the backbone for older adults, recommending 150–300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75–150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, plus muscle-strengthening activities on at least two days per week, with multicomponent activity that emphasizes functional balance and strength training for all older adults, not just those with limited mobility [^115fALw6] [^115wiRqd]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality signal: large multinational cohorts show a 20–30% reduction in all-cause mortality when guidelines are met, and benefits may even strengthen with age, reinforcing the universal adult targets across the lifespan [^1122x1TR]. I also need to check the USPSTF stance on falls: the USPSTF gives exercise a Grade B recommendation for community-dwelling adults 65+ at increased fall risk, with moderate certainty of net benefit, which aligns with the emphasis on balance and strength components [^1113Mbed] [^115Mppuj].

> Next, I should review the core prescription elements and make sure I'm precise about dose and accumulation. Aerobic activity should target 150–300 minutes per week of moderate intensity or 75–150 minutes per week of vigorous intensity, and importantly, activity can be accumulated in bouts of any duration, removing the outdated ≥ 10-minute minimum, which makes prescriptions more feasible for frail or deconditioned older adults [^115wiRqd] [^115fALw6]. Wait, let me verify the resistance training specifics: major guidelines converge on at least two nonconsecutive days per week targeting all major muscle groups, with 1–3 sets of 8–12 repetitions at a moderate to high effort, using RPE or 1-RM-based intensity anchors, and applying progression over time [^11646ED9] [^113KGscn]. I should confirm balance and flexibility: balance training is now recommended for all older adults as part of multicomponent activity, and flexibility exercises for major muscle–tendon groups should be done at least two days per week to maintain joint range of motion [^115wiRqd] [^116d4M3C].

> I will now examine the dose–response and intensity question, because I need to ensure I'm not overstating thresholds. Benefits accrue from any amount above inactivity, with the steepest gains when moving from sedentary to active, and continued incremental benefits up to about 300 minutes per week of moderate activity or 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity, beyond which additional risk reduction plateaus for major outcomes like mortality [^115wiRqd] [^1122x1TR]. But wait, what if higher intensity yields more benefit? The Generation 100 RCT suggested larger health benefits with mainly high-intensity exercise compared with moderate intensity, although the trial did not show a significant reduction in all-cause mortality versus the reference group overall, so I should be cautious and frame this as supportive but not definitive for mandating high-intensity for all [^112yjM5p]. Let me reconsider: the safest conclusion is that higher intensity can be beneficial when safely tolerated, but moderate intensity still yields substantial gains and is appropriate for many older adults [^1127wjzA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "one-size-fits-all". I need to check how to tailor for frailty, sarcopenia, and multimorbidity. For sarcopenia, resistance exercise is first-line therapy, with pragmatic programs of 1–3 sets of 6–12 reps at 60–80% 1-RM or high RPE, typically two sessions per week, emphasizing progression and specificity to functional tasks; single weekly sessions can still help the most deconditioned individuals as a starting point [^113KGscn] [^1126W7Fv]. For diabetes, combined aerobic and resistance training is superior to either alone for glycemic control and cardiometabolic outcomes, and in older adults with obesity, strategies that reduce sedentary time and use low-volume or "resistance exercise snacking" can improve feasibility and adherence while still delivering benefits [^113ESWsa] [^1119Vxu1]. I should double-check cardiovascular disease framing: exercise is integral to secondary prevention and functional preservation, with emphasis on individualized intensity and supervision when indicated [^113qFM8m].

> Next, I should review implementation and adherence strategies, because efficacy in trials often fails to translate without behavioral scaffolding. Let me verify effective approaches: supervised, group-based programs with social support improve uptake and sustainability; behavior change techniques such as goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring, and problem solving increase adherence; and digital or remote delivery can expand access, though effectiveness varies and supervision remains important for high-risk individuals [^112jWCT6] [^1161G7Jd] [^116R9QHg]. I need to ensure I address barriers like fear of falling, pain, and environmental constraints by using graded exposure, pain-adapted exercise, and linking patients to community resources and programs such as STEADI [^1113TSAe] [^1161G7Jd].

> I should confirm monitoring and progression protocols so prescriptions are dynamic rather than static. Functional assessments such as SPPB, gait speed, and grip strength track meaningful change; the LIFE program data suggest the greatest mobility benefits accrue in those with SPPB less than 8, guiding intensity and supervision decisions [^1113VLda]. Let me verify safety screening: routine universal cardiac screening is not required for healthy older adults starting low-to-moderate activity, but symptom-guided evaluation and gradual progression are essential; supervised programs are prudent for frail, multimorbid, or very old adults [^116d4M3C] [^113mvuia]. I need to check that balance-challenge progression is explicit: reducing base of support, moving center of mass, dual-tasking, and progressing surface or visual conditions should be individualized and regularly advanced to maintain an optimal challenge [^115QnUCK].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical, staged prescription while keeping it clinically precise. For a generally healthy older adult, I would prescribe 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, swimming) in bouts of any length, plus two nonconsecutive days of resistance training targeting major muscle groups with 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps at moderate effort, and daily balance practice such as tandem stance, heel-to-toe walking, or tai chi. Flexibility for major joints should be included at least two days per week [^115fALw6] [^116d4M3C] [^11646ED9]. For a frail or sedentary individual, I would start with 5–10 minute bouts of light activity, progress to 30–60 minutes per week by week 2–4, and add seated or supported resistance and balance exercises, advancing to two full sessions per week as tolerated, with explicit written instructions and linkage to community programs for supervision and social support [^113EgioN] [^115wiRqd]. For someone with sarcopenia, I would prioritize progressive resistance training at 60–80% 1-RM or high RPE, two sessions per week, with compound movements like sit-to-stand, squats, and step-ups, and embed balance and gait challenges within the same session to address fall risk and function [^113KGscn] [^1126W7Fv].

> But wait, what about falls prevention specifically? I should confirm the evidence-based components. Programs that include gait, balance, and functional training, often combined with resistance training, reduce falls by about 23% overall and by larger margins for multicomponent programs; tai chi also confers benefit, whereas walking alone is insufficient for fall prevention in higher-risk adults [^115vAVvj] [^1113Mbed]. I need to ensure dose and delivery are right: at least three hours per week, sustained over 6–12 months, with progression in balance challenge and supervision for those at highest risk yields the most durable benefits, and cessation reverses gains, so continuity is key [^116svvqM] [^1173GWe7].

> I should double-check special populations where nuance matters. In Parkinson disease, individualized programs emphasizing balance and resistance are recommended, with higher supervision as disease severity and cognitive impairment increase; minimally supervised programs may increase falls in complex PD, so referral to skilled therapy is prudent [^115hDtkU]. After stroke, exercise targeting balance, strength, and walking is advised, integrated with rehabilitation and tailored to impairments and supervision needs [^115hDtkU]. For adults with cognitive impairment, exercise shows promise but evidence is limited and heterogeneous; careful supervision and simplified, safe programming are essential, and more definitive trials are needed before broad, unsupervised community prescriptions are made [^117HvubW].

> Let me consider cognitive outcomes, since many patients ask about dementia prevention. Observational and intervention data suggest exercise improves cognitive function and may slow decline, with meta-analytic signals around 45–60 minute sessions at moderate intensity, but large, long-term RCTs have shown mixed results, so I should present this as probable benefit with ongoing uncertainty about optimal modality, dose, and population subgroups [^115bJU79] [^114eAe8x]. I should confirm that combined aerobic and resistance training is reasonable and consistent with general health guidelines while we await more definitive dose–response data [^115bJU79].

> Next, I should review uncertainties and research gaps so my recommendations remain honest about the limits of evidence. We still need better risk stratification tools for primary care, head-to-head comparisons of different exercise packages, and clarity on the minimal effective dose for the oldest old and those with frailty or multimorbidity; remote delivery models and maintenance strategies after supervised phases also require stronger evidence [^112jWCT6] [^116RiHoB]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance already supports pragmatic, individualized approaches pending those data, which it does, emphasizing "some is better than none" and progressive, supervised implementation for high-risk groups [^115fALw6] [^1113Mbed].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical bottom line is clear and actionable. Exercise is a first-line therapy for aging, with the greatest aggregate benefit from multicomponent programs that include aerobic activity, resistance training, balance and functional challenges, and flexibility, scaled to baseline function and progressed over time; supervision and behavior change support improve safety and adherence, and continuity is essential to sustain benefits, particularly for fall prevention [^115fALw6] [^1113Mbed] [^1173GWe7]. I should confirm that even small starts matter: moving from sedentary to any activity yields meaningful health gains, so prescriptions should be realistic, enjoyable, and socially connected to maximize long-term success [^1127wjzA] [^116R9QHg].

Exercise in older adults improves **strength, balance, and cardiovascular health** [^116d4M3C], reducing falls [^115vAVvj], frailty, and chronic disease burden [^113271yY]. The WHO recommends **150–300 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [^115fALw6], plus resistance and balance training [^115wiRqd]; even small increases yield meaningful benefits [^117U6rWn], and programs should be individualized to ability and risk [^113EgioN]. Exercise is safe for most older adults [^116d4M3C], with supervision advised for high-risk or frail individuals [^115QnUCK]; adherence improves with social support, enjoyment, and progression [^114WdRE9] [^116d4M3C].

## Recommended exercise guidelines for older adults

The WHO and ACSM provide **evidence-based recommendations**:

| **Exercise type** | **Frequency** | **Intensity** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aerobic activity | 150–300 min/week | Moderate | Any duration |
| Resistance training | ≥ 2 days/week | Moderate | 1–3 sets, 8–12 reps |
| Balance training | ≥ 3 days/week | Moderate | 10–15 min/session |
| Flexibility exercises | ≥ 2 days/week | Low | 10–15 min/session |

---

These guidelines emphasize **multicomponent programs** [^115wiRqd] and tailoring to individual abilities and preferences [^113EgioN].

---

## Barriers to exercise participation

Older adults face several barriers, including:

- **Physical limitations**: Chronic conditions, pain, and functional limitations [^1119Vxu1].

- **Psychological factors**: Fear of injury, lack of motivation, and low self-efficacy [^116AMqFR].

- **Environmental factors**: Limited access to facilities, unsafe environments, and lack of social support [^114WdRE9].

---

## Strategies to promote exercise adherence

Effective strategies to improve adherence include:

- **Individualized programs**: Tailored to abilities, preferences, and health status [^113EgioN].

- **Social support**: Group exercise, family involvement, and community programs [^116R9QHg].

- **Behavioral interventions**: Goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback [^114WdRE9].

- **Progression and variety**: Gradual progression and diverse activities to maintain interest [^116d4M3C].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

Exercise is generally safe; however, **precautions are necessary**:

- **Medical screening**: Assess cardiovascular risk, balance, and functional capacity [^116d4M3C].

- **Supervision**: Supervised programs for high-risk or frail individuals [^115hDtkU].

- **Gradual progression**: Start low and progress slowly to prevent injury [^1127wjzA].

- **Hydration and monitoring**: Ensure adequate hydration and monitor for adverse effects [^notfound].

---

## Impact of exercise on chronic conditions

Exercise significantly benefits **chronic conditions** common in older adults:

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Reduces cardiovascular events and mortality [^113qFM8m].

- **Diabetes**: Improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity [^113ESWsa].

- **Osteoporosis**: Increases bone density and reduces fracture risk [^113ESWsa] [^115vAVvj].

- **Arthritis**: Reduces pain and improves joint function [^notfound].

---

## Role of healthcare professionals

Healthcare professionals play a critical role in **promoting exercise** by providing counseling, individualized prescriptions, and referrals to community programs [^114dJCdx]. They also monitor progress, address barriers, and adjust programs as needed [^113EgioN].

---

Exercise in older adults yields wide-ranging health benefits; **multicomponent, individualized programs** with social support and progression are most effective [^114MFoyn].

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^115wiRqd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What is new?

There are a few important differences in the new guidelines that should be highlighted for each age group. First, in adults, the previous stipulation that physical activity should be accumulated in at least 10 min bouts has been removed. This change reflects the accumulated evidence from cohort studies, which shows physical activity of any bout duration is associated with improved health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. Second, these updated guidelines for adults now specify a target range of 150–300 min of moderate-intensity and 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, compared with the previous guidelines that focused on achieving at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity activity per week. This change acknowledges that there is a range of physical activity which captures the maximal risk reductions for health outcomes associated with physical activity and going beyond this range does not appreciably further decrease the risk of major outcomes such as all-cause or CVD mortality. Third, with respect to older adults, the recommendation regarding multicomponent physical activity that emphasises functional balance and strength training to enhance functional capacity and prevent falls now applies to all older adults rather than specifically those with poor mobility. This change acknowledges the large volume of evidence demonstrating unequivocal beneficial effects of this physical activity type on the functional capacity and risk of falls in older people with a range of functional abilities.

There was also one key change in the new recommendations for children and adolescents. Specifically, the updated recommendation is now to do at least an 'average of 60 min/day' of MVPA rather than the previously stated ' accumulate 60 min of physical activity daily'. Although this might appear to be a subtle difference, the change better reflects the scientific evidence as most studies reported associations between an average daily value of physical activity rather than an accumulation of 60 min on each and every day of the week.

The new recommendation that sedentary behaviour should be limited across all groups is an important addition to these new global guidelines since 2010 and is in line with other recent country-level guidelinesthat generally support the notion of moving more and reducing sedentary time ('sitting less' for ambulatory people). Although specifying a quantitative threshold on the amount of sedentary behaviour was strongly considered, there was insufficient evidence. Furthermore, variations in how sedentary time was measured, and that a threshold would likely vary by health outcome, by level of physical activity and by population subgroups, made quantifying upper time limits difficult to ascertain.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115Mppuj]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the US. In 2018, 27.5% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported at least 1 fall in the past year and 10.2% reported a fall-related injury. In 2021, an estimated 38 742 deaths resulted from fall-related injuries.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.

Population

Community-dwelling adults 65 years or older at increased risk of falls.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians individualize the decision to offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. Existing evidence indicates that the overall net benefit of routinely offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls is small. When determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient's values and preferences. (C recommendation).

### LEAP! Rx: a randomized trial of a pragmatic approach to lifestyle medicine [^115GFo9E]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

According to US Census Projections, the number of adults aged 65 and older will increase from 54 million to 95 million by 2060. Aging brings increased cognitive and physical decline, with dramatic rises in the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which will require more specialized healthcare resources. There is strong evidence that these risks can be modified by lifestyle interventions. The extant literature and ongoing research suggest that lifestyle modifications, specifically exercise, are among the most effective and cost‐effective tools available for chronic disease management.

Public health bodies typically recommend at least 150 min of moderate‐intensity aerobic exercise and two sessions of resistance exercise per week as part of a regular exercise regimen to maintain health and fitness. Though the results of trials conducted to date have been mixed, overall, the evidence suggests that aerobic exercise in healthy, older adults may benefit cognitive performance, brain plasticity, and hippocampal atrophy while improving visual attention and memory. Resistance training is also essential to a complete exercise program for older adults. It uses muscular contraction against resistance to mitigate the effects of aging on neuromuscular function and functional capacityand may improve muscle strength, mass, and output, and its typically recommended frequency is at least twice weekly.

Despite the promise of exercise interventions to reduce the chronic disease burden of aging, public health efforts currently fall short. There has been little systematic progress in translating lifestyle intervention research into meaningful gains in population health. While laboratory‐based trials demonstrate efficacy in highly controlled environments, they are often not effective when translated to the broader population. Many clinicians recommend increased physical activity and exercise to their patients. However, this recommendation lacks specificity, and numerous barriers conspire against older adults to limit physical activity. In addition, recommendations from clinicians are often singular events with little follow‐up.

The current approach of education and encouragement alone is insufficient: Up to 25% of all adults in the US are completely sedentary, and more than half are insufficiently active to achieve health benefits, with physical activity levels declining through adulthood to low levels in older adults, exacerbating risk of functional decline. We designed the Lifestyle Empowerment for Alzheimer's Prevention (LEAP! Rx) study to help fill a critical gap between clinician recommendations and resources to support a healthier lifestyle. The intention was to provide specific and effective tools for clinicians to offer their patients to help initiate and sustain healthy lifestyle behavior changes.

### Exercise interventions for cognitive function in adults older than 50: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^115bJU79]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Physical exercise is seen as a promising intervention to prevent or delay cognitive decline in individuals aged 50 years and older, yet the evidence from reviews is not conclusive.

Objectives

To determine if physical exercise is effective in improving cognitive function in this population.

Design

Systematic review with multilevel meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Electronic databases Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Scopus), PsychINFO and CENTRAL (Cochrane) from inception to November 2016.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of physical exercise interventions in community-dwelling adults older than 50 years, with an outcome measure of cognitive function.

Results

The search returned 12820 records, of which 39 studies were included in the systematic review. Analysis of 333 dependent effect sizes from 36 studies showed that physical exercise improved cognitive function (0.29; 95%CI 0.17 to 0.41; p < 0.01). Interventions of aerobic exercise, resistance training, multicomponent training and tai chi, all had significant point estimates. When exercise prescription was examined, a duration of 45–60min per session and at least moderate intensity, were associated with benefits to cognition. The results of the meta-analysis were consistent and independent of the cognitive domain tested or the cognitive status of the participants.

Conclusions

Physical exercise improved cognitive function in the over 50s, regardless of the cognitive status of participants. To improve cognitive function, this meta-analysis provides clinicians with evidence to recommend that patients obtain both aerobic and resistance exercise of at least moderate intensity on as many days of the week as feasible, in line with current exercise guidelines.

### Prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111q3gCr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on counseling to prevent household and recreational injuries, including falls.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults. The interventions were grouped into 5 main categories: multifactorial clinical assessment (with or without direct intervention), clinical management (with or without screening), clinical education or behavioral counseling, home hazard modification, and exercise or physical therapy.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (Grade B recommendation)The USPSTF does not recommend automatically performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older because the likelihood of benefit is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of the circumstances of prior falls, comorbid medical conditions, and patient values. (Grade C recommendation).

### Exercise for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community [^116NtkRs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Fear of falling is common in older people and associated with serious physical and psychosocial consequences. Exercise (planned, structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity aimed at improving physical fitness) may reduce fear of falling by improving strength, gait, balance and mood, and reducing the occurrence of falls.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits, harms and costs) of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), AMED (1985 to August 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed 7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference lists and consulted experts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that recruited community-dwelling people (where the majority were aged 65 and over) and were not restricted to specific medical conditions (e.g. stroke, hip fracture). We included trials that evaluated exercise interventions compared with no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (e.g. social visits), and that measured fear of falling. Exercise interventions were varied; for example, they could be 'prescriptions' or recommendations, group-based or individual, supervised or unsupervised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. We combined effect sizes across studies using the fixed-effect model, with the random-effect model used where significant statistical heterogeneity was present. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rate outcomes. We estimated mean differences (MD) where studies used the same continuous measures and standardised mean differences (SMD) where different measures or different formats of the same measure were used. Where possible, we performed various, usually prespecified, sensitivity and subgroup analyses.

Main Results

We included 30 studies, which evaluated 3D exercise (Tai Chi and yoga), balance training or strength and resistance training. Two of these were cluster-randomised trials, two were cross-over trials and one was quasi-randomised. The studies included a total of 2878 participants with a mean age ranging from 68 to 85 years. Most studies included more women than men, with four studies recruiting women only. Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls; three of these recruited participants who also had fear of falling. Poor reporting of the allocation methods in the trials made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias in most studies. All of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection biases as there was no blinding of participants and outcome assessors and the outcomes were self reported. Twelve studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for fear of falling immediately post intervention and 'very low' for fear of falling at short or long-term follow-up and all other outcomes. Exercise interventions were associated with a small to moderate reduction in fear of falling immediately post intervention (SMD 0.37 favouring exercise, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies; 1692 participants, low quality evidence). Pooled effect sizes did not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling. Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the direction of effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24 favouring exercise, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36). None of our subgroup analyses provided robust evidence of differences in effect in terms of either the study primary aim (reduction of fear of falling or other aim), the study population (recruitment on the basis of increased falls risk or not), the characteristics of the study exercise intervention or the study control intervention (no treatment or alternative intervention). However, there was some weak evidence of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of exercise when compared with an alternative control. There was very low quality evidence that exercise interventions may be associated with a small reduction in fear of falling up to six months post intervention (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38; four studies, 356 participants) and more than six months post intervention (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; three studies, 386 participants). Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these studies that also reported on fear of falling reduced the risk of falling measured either as participants incurring at least one fall during follow-up or the number of falls during follow-up. Very low quality evidence from four studies indicated that exercise interventions did not appear to reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. The only study reporting the effects of exercise interventions on anxiety found no difference between groups. No studies reported the effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is important to remember that our included studies do not represent the totality of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only includes studies that reported fear of falling.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise interventions in community-dwelling older people probably reduce fear of falling to a limited extent immediately after the intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes. Although further evidence from well-designed randomised trials is required, priority should be given to establishing a core set of outcomes that includes fear of falling for all trials examining the effects of exercise interventions in older people living in the community.

### Physical activity guidelines for older adults [^113mvuia]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Few older adults in the United States achieve the minimum recommended amount of physical activity. Lack of physical activity contributes to many chronic diseases that occur in older adults, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, lung disease, Alzheimer disease, hypertension, and cancer. Lack of physical activity, combined with poor dietary habits, has also contributed to increased obesity in older persons. Regular exercise and increased aerobic fitness are associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality and morbidity, and are proven to reduce disease and disability, and improve quality of life in older persons. In 2008, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released guidelines to provide information and guidance on the amount of physical activity recommended to maintain health and fitness. For substantial health benefits, the guidelines recommend that most older adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination of each per week. Older adults should also engage in strengthening activities that involve all major muscle groups at least two days a week. Those at risk of falling should add exercises that help maintain or improve balance. Generally healthy adults without chronic health conditions do not need to consult with a physician before starting an exercise regimen.

### Exercise prescriptions in older adults [^114dJCdx]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Regular physical activity and exercise are important for healthy aging and are beneficial for chronic disease management. Exercise prescriptions for older adults should account for the individual's health status and functional capacity. Any amount of exercise is better than being sedentary, even if health status prevents a person from achieving recommended goals. For most health outcomes, more benefits occur with physical activity performed at higher intensity, greater frequency, or longer duration. Guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity and at least two days of muscle-strengthening activities per week. Key components of the prescription include setting achievable activity goals, identifying barriers and providing potential solutions, and providing specific recommendations on the type, frequency, and intensity of activities. Older adults will derive distinct benefits from aerobic exercise, strength or resistance training, flexibility or stretching exercises, and balance training. Many community resources are available to help older adults begin a more active lifestyle.

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^1138bqwQ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The updated WHO 2020 Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour provide clear, evidence-based, recommendations on how much physical activity provides health benefits for different population groups and on the potential risks of sedentary behaviours. These guidelines should be used to inform global, regional and national policy actions and investment, as well as to guide and strengthen national health behaviour surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets. The development of these new guidelines identified important areas requiring further research and thus also identified research priorities for the academic and research community.

What remains the same?

The evidence confirms the value of participating in regular physical activity to achieve health benefits across all ages and abilities. Further it supports key messages that some physical activity is better than none and that more is better for optimal health outcomes. More specifically, the evidence reaffirms all adults should undertake regular physical activity and should aim to achieve at least 150 min of moderate-intensity, or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity across the week (most of which should be aerobic), leads to health benefits. Furthermore, the guidelines continue to reinforce the value of muscle-strengthening activity for all adults and children. The key physical activity-specific recommendations above remain largely unchanged from 2010 and are consistent with other recently developed physical activity guidelines from several countries.

### The benefits of strength training for older adults [^113271yY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Aging is associated with a number of physiologic and functional declines that can contribute to increased disability, frailty, and falls. Contributing factors are the loss of muscle mass and strength as age increases, a phenomenon called sarcopenia. Sarcopenia can result or be exacerbated by certain chronic conditions, and can also increase the burden of chronic disease. Current research has demonstrated that strength-training exercises have the ability to combat weakness and frailty and their debilitating consequences. Done regularly (e.g., 2 to 3 days per week), these exercises build muscle strength and muscle mass and preserve bone density, independence, and vitality with age. In addition, strength training also has the ability to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and the signs and symptoms of numerous chronic diseases such as heart disease, arthritis, and type 2 diabetes, while also improving sleep and reducing depression. This paper reviews the current research on strength training and older adults, evaluating exercise protocols in a variety of populations. It is clear that a variety of strength-training prescriptions from highly controlled laboratory-based to minimally supervised home-based programs have the ability to elicit meaningful health benefits in older adults. The key challenges as this field of exercise science moves forward are to best identify the most appropriate strength-training recommendations for older adults and to greatly increase the access to safe and effective programs in a variety of settings.

### Physical activity and all-cause mortality by age in 4 multinational megacohorts [^1122x1TR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Global and other PA guidelines do not differentiate recommendations by age; the advised amounts of PA for younger, middle-aged, and older adults are uniformly the same. Systematic reviews underpinning these recommendations have consistently demonstrated that meeting these PA levels is associated with a 20% to 30% reduction in mortality risk compared with individuals who do not meet these criteria. Our study introduces new insights, further affirming that the mortality benefits associated with PA not only persist across different age groups but may also slightly enhance with age. From a public health viewpoint, it is crucial to communicate to adults that engaging in an adequate amount of PA remains critically important throughout the lifespan, gaining even greater importance as one ages. Policy actions must be addressed to facilitate and promote desired amounts of PA that can promote PA engagement and sustainability at all stages of adult life. Our results also lend support for the current PA guidelines where adults of all ages are recommended the same amount of PA.

### Role of exercise for knee pain: what do older adults in the community think? [^114CAhpU]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Older adults with knee pain report low levels of exercise and physical activity. One explanation for this might be that they believe exercise is unhelpful or even harmful for knee pain. We therefore explored the attitudes and beliefs of older adults in the community about the role of exercise for knee pain using mixed methods.

Methods

A survey was mailed to 2,234 older adults registered with 1 general practice within the UK. The survey included 23 attitude statements derived from published exercise recommendations. Semistructured interviews were completed in a purposeful sample of questionnaire responders (n = 22) and were recorded and analyzed thematically.

Results

The questionnaire response rate was 59% (n = 1,276), and 611 respondents reported knee pain in the past 12 months. There was considerable uncertainty about the benefits of exercise; < 50% largely or totally agreed on any attitude statement relating to the benefit of exercise for knee pain. The interviews revealed that attitudes and beliefs about exercise for knee pain are linked to the individuals' perceptions about their knee problems, and that many different barriers and facilitators to exercise and physical activity exist. These barriers and facilitators could be grouped as those relating to the person, the knee problem itself, and social or environmental factors. Barriers and facilitators varied between different individuals and over time.

Conclusion

The overall uncertainty within the community about the role of exercise for knee pain highlights the challenges faced by those living with knee pain in completing physical activity, and for health care professionals prescribing exercise for this patient group.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114nNDNt]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — exercise interventions for community-dwelling older adults show that nearly all programs included gait, balance, and functional training (30/37 trials), with about two-thirds including strength and resistance training (25/37); pooled analyses found that a pooled analysis of 29 trials (n = 14 475) showed exercise interventions were associated with a significant reduction in injurious fall rate at the longest follow-up (6–24 months) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]), reduced the number of persons with ≥ 1 fall at the longest follow-up (6–24 months) (25 trials; n = 13 384; relative risk, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87–0.98]) and the risk of injurious falls at 6 to 60 months (21 trials; n = 3984; IRR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.74–0.95]), while pooled analyses found no significant reductions in fall-related fractures or all-cause mortality; across reporting exercise trials, 58% of participants were at increased risk for falls.

### Exercise for falls prevention in aged care: systematic review and trial endpoint meta-analyses [^113JfkjP]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Exercise is recommended as a fall prevention strategy for older people living in aged care facilities who have sufficient physical and mental capacity and agree to participate (moderate certainty evidence). Continuation of exercise is required for effective fall prevention, as exercise has little or no lasting effect on falls after the end of a programme (high certainty evidence). Additional analyses and research are needed to determine the most effective types of exercise programs to be provided and how to best deliver them to people in this setting. Nevertheless, this meta-analysis provides justification for the provision and continuation of exercise programs to prevent falls in older people living in residential aged care settings; however, programs should consider individual abilities and preferences.

### Exercise / physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine [^113ESWsa]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). High credibility.

Adults and older adults with T2D — All adults with T2D should follow the same recommendations, with no more than 2 consecutive days between bouts due to the transient nature of exercise-induced improvements in insulin action; in older adults, resistance exercise training results in 10%–15% improvement in strength, bone mineral density, lean mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, and insulin sensitivity along with threefold greater reductions in A1C, and interventions that combine aerobic and resistance training may be superior to either one alone; adults unable to meet current recommendations should focus on improving on functional fitness and balance, and limitations to joint mobility may be accelerated by hyperglycemia.

### Evidence-based, high-intensity exercise and physical activity for compressing morbidity in older adults: a narrative review [^1122N6vH]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

From a cognitive-behavioral theory and exercise science perspective, ideal exercises can be conceptualized and enacted. It is important to emphasize, however, that there is a paucity of long-term studies to assess adherence, adverse events, and health outcomes related to the programs described in this review. Basic questions remain unaddressed. For example, a major expense in any program is the supervision of training. It is unclear how many supervised training sessions and "faded contacts" are needed to maintain different types of exercise. For example, sprint interval "exercise snacks" on stairs seem feasible and maintainable over months and years, but there are no data from translational research studies to indicate what initial instructional sessions are needed, if periodic checkups are needed, or how they should be most effectively done.

This review points to investing more resources into longer-term translational research as a basis for public health to promote evidence-based exercise and physical activity, especially for middle-aged and older adults, to compress morbidity by delaying or intervening with disability. At present, and unlikely in the future, there is not a medication or even a group of medications that can provide the same benefits as sustained and safe exercise practices. In some quarters, these efforts will be considered as not needed, maybe too expensive, or soon it may be believed that various health problems will be solved by precision medicine. However, there are compelling reasons to invest more in public health for both prevention and potentially lower-cost, evidence-based, lifestyle treatment. Consider this one point: the U.S. annually spends mostly on treatment (~97%), and not public health (~3%), a staggering $3.2 trillion on health care. If our health care spending was the sole and total economy, it would be the fifth largest economy in the world!

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117NBK76]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF fall prevention net benefit — community-dwelling older adults at increased risk: This recommendation applies to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk of falls. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls, and concludes with moderate certainty that multifactorial interventions provide a small net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls.

### When adults don't exercise: behavioral strategies to increase physical activity in sedentary middle-aged and older adults [^116AMqFR]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Physical activity is one of the most promising nonpharmacological, noninvasive, and cost-effective methods of health-promotion, yet statistics show that only a small percentage of middle-aged and older adults engage in the recommended amount of regular exercise. This state of affairs is less likely due to a lack of knowledge about the benefits of exercise than to failures of motivation and self-regulatory mechanisms. Many types of intervention programs target exercise in later life, but they typically do not achieve sustained behavior change, and there has been very little increase in the exercise rate in the population over the last decade. The goal of this paper is to consider the use of effective low-cost motivational and behavioral strategies for increasing physical activity, which could have far-reaching benefits at the individual and population levels. We present a multicomponent framework to guide development of behavior change interventions to increase and maintain physical activity among sedentary adults and others at risk for health problems. This involves a personalized approach to motivation and behavior change, which includes social support, goal setting, and positive affect coupled with cognitive restructuring of negative and self-defeating attitudes and misconceptions. These strategies can lead to increases in exercise self-efficacy and control beliefs as well as self- management skills such as self-regulation and action planning, which in turn are expected to lead to long-term increases in activity. These changes in activity frequency and intensity can ultimately lead to improvements in physical and psychological well-being among middle-aged and older adults, including those from underserved, vulnerable populations. Even a modest increase in physical activity can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. Recommendations for future interventions include a focus on ways to achieve personalized approaches, broad outreach, and maintenance of behavior changes.

### Life's essential 8: optimizing health in older adults [^113EgioN]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for physical activity in older adults

"Life's Essential 8" recommends 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week regardless of age, sex, or race. However, achieving these goals may not always be feasible or safe. Careful consideration of individual characteristics such as preferences, functional status, cognitive limitation, exercise capacity, and fall risk can determine best type and duration of exercise (Table 1).

Table 1
Highlights of Each Life's Essential 8 Component Pertaining to the Care of Older Adults

The benefits of physical activity are driven by exercise intensity. However, the most important goal for older adults is to avoid inactivity. The greatest benefit is seen in those who go from a sedentary lifestyle to any activity, that is, walking for 5 minutes several times a day. In order to perform aerobic activity safely, other modes of exercises focusing on strength, balance, and mobility are often required. Physical therapists, exercise physiologists, and nurses play an important role in implementation of progressive exercise. For those with mobility limitations, seated range of motion exercise, controlled breathing, stretching, and yoga can be safe and helpful. Strength (eg, stretch bands), balance (eg, chair stands, standing on 1 foot,), and flexibility training improves gait, speed/power of movement, and reduce risk of falls by improving muscle mass and strength, balance, and bone strength. These are usually initiated at low intensity for short durations (ie, 5–10 minutes) and then advanced in length and then intensity as tolerated.

Exercise evidence synopsis — The numerous health benefits of regular physical activity have been well established, yet approximately half of adults in the United States do not meet the minimum physical activity recommendations. Extensive observational data from meta-analyses and systematic reviews support recommendations for aerobic physical activity to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Resistance exercise should also be encouraged because of its several health benefits, including improving physical functioning, improving glycemic control in individuals with diabetes, and possibly blood pressure (BP) lowering; whether resistance exercise lowers ASCVD risk is unclear.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^113KGscn]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Overview

The aim of this section is to provide an illustration of what a simple yet easily modifiable RE prescription for older adults with sarcopenia could involve. Exercise variables including training frequency, exercise selection, exercise intensity, volume and rest periods represent the primary considerations when designing RE programmes. Manipulating these variables can modify the stimulus and adaptations induced by RE. To complement our proposed recommendations, readers are directed to work further discussing the nuances of RE prescription in older adults. Our illustrative RE prescription for sarcopenia is presented in Table 2.

Table 2
A proposed resistance exercise prescription for older adults with sarcopenia

1RM, 1 Repetition Maximum (the maximal amount of weight that can be lifted for one complete repetition); RPE, Rating of Perceived Exertion; CR10, Category Ratio 10 scale (see for guidance).

Training frequency

Exercise programmes for older adults typically involve between 1 and 3 RE sessions per week. Uncertainty remains as to what the optimal training frequency is for increasing muscle strength and it remains unknown whether RE frequency alone has a significant effect on training-induced gains. RE programmes involving two training sessions per week may offer greater benefit compared to once weekly training for improving muscle strength, yet it remains unclear how much of a meaningful additive effect a third session per week provides. Substantial benefits can be gained from two RE sessions per week and those prescribing exercise should be mindful that prescribing a greater number of RE sessions will not necessarily induce greater effects (i.e. quality over quantity). Adding in regular functional resistance–based exercises for older adults to perform at home in between scheduled exercise sessions may provide extra benefit and may also help support behaviour change and the formation of positive habits that may be important for ongoing exercise engagement. A lower weekly RE frequency has the advantage of allowing the individual a greater time to recover between each exercise session while also having important resource implications for delivery. As such, two training sessions per week should represent the standard prescription for older adults with sarcopenia. However, in those individuals with low baseline muscle strength or severe sarcopenia, a single RE session per week could still confer significant benefit. In these individuals, it would be appropriate for RE programmes to begin with a single weekly training session before progressing to two sessions per week over time. As the individual progresses through the training programme, increasing the number of weekly RE sessions can be an effective strategy to ensure that appropriate overload is provided.

### Exercise: the ultimate treatment to all ailments? [^113qFM8m]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Extensive clinical research has provided robust evidence that exercise is a cost-effective measure to substantially alleviate the burden of a large number of diseases, many of which belong to the cardiovascular (CV) spectrum. In terms of cardiac benefit, the positive effects of exercise are attributed to improvements in standard risk factors for atherosclerosis, as well as to its positive impact on several pathophysiological mechanisms for CV diseases. For secondary prevention, exercise, optimally in the context of a cardiac rehabilitation program, has been shown to improve functional capacity and survival. Clinicians should encourage physical activity and provide exercise recommendations for all patients, taking into consideration any underlying pathology. In the present review, the benefits of exercise for the prevention and treatment of major CV risk factors and heart conditions are analyzed.

### Physical activity and cognition in sedentary older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114eAe8x]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

In observational studies, individuals who are physically active often show less cognitive decline and a lower risk of dementia than sedentary individuals. A meta-analysis concluded that people who were not previously physically active start showing improved cognitive functioning after exercising for as little as four months. Furthermore, exercise interventions may also reduce the rate of cognitive decline in people with cognitive impairment. However, more recent studies are much less consistent. For example, a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of sedentary adults showed no effect on cognition outcomes after 24 months of moderate intensity physical exercise, and no cognitive improvement in AD patients after 16 weeks of aerobic exercise training. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of aerobic, resistance training and tai chi interventions in people older than 50 years showed little benefit of exercise on cognitive function. In addition to these differences, it is still unclear how to combine the type, intensity, and time of exercise for a maximum benefit on the cognition of sedentary elderly people.

The present review and meta-analysis aimed to appropriately explore the effects of PA on the cognition of sedentary older adults. Considering the significant health and economic burden of dementia, the results of our study may serve as a basis for establishing guidelines and recommendations for future sedentary behavior interventions in the elderly and provide highly operational and popular non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of cognitive decline.

Statements

Theme 1: functional capacity and health

Being physically active is a key factor in maintaining health and in normal functioning of physiological systems across the life-course.
Physically active older adults, compared with older inactive adults, show benefits in terms of physical and cognitive function, intrinsic capacity, mobility, musculoskeletal pain, risk of falls and fractures, depression, quality of life and compression of disability.
Physical inactivity in older adults is associated with a trajectory towards disease and increased risk of premature all-cause mortality. The conditions and diseases (and their key risk factors) include metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer and sarcopenia. Together this translates into increased years of ill health.
In older adults who have not previously been active, evidence shows that multiple physiological systems will be improved by increasing physical activity and undertaking exercise training programmes. In addition, exercise can be used to improve functional capacity, as an adjunct treatment for many diseases and for rehabilitation.
Compared with inactive older adults, lifelong physically active older adults have higher levels of physiological function. This includes the metabolic, skeletal, cardiovascular and immune systems.
Emerging evidence suggests that the benefits for older adults (eg, better physical function and reduced premature mortality) can be realised at lower volume and lower intensity than the often-used guidelines of 150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity per week. There is, however, a positive dose response with regard to volume and intensity of the exercise.
The heterogeneity among older people means that tailored strategies for physical activity and/or exercise are likely to be required for physiological benefits.
Sedentary behaviour may be an independent risk factor of health for older adults. However, evidence is needed on the health benefits of replacing sedentary behaviour with activity.
It is unclear whether previously inactive older individuals who undertake physical activity/exercise programmes will be able to reach the levels of physiological function of lifelong exercisers.
In acknowledging the heterogeneity of the older adult population, we agreed that further research is required to determine the precise exercise modality, for example, resistance, balance, flexibility, aerobic exercise, or a combination of modalities, and what durations and intensities of exercise will be required for optimal benefits.

### Can a framed intervention motivate older adults in assisted living facilities to exercise? [^116XswuQ]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The world population is ageing because of decreased fertility rates and increased life expectancy. It is estimated that in 2050, more than 4% of the whole population will be 80 years or older, compared to only 1% in 2002. In older people, physical activity is associated with lower mortality rates and enhanced physical and mental health.

Physical activity refers to any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles and incorporates exercise. Exercise includes a planned, repetitive component as well as a fitness goal. Typical examples of exercise are aerobic activities to enhance cardiorespiratory fitness and resistance exercises to enhance muscular strength. In order to achieve the health benefits from physical activity, the World Health Organization recommends that people aged 65+ years perform a combination of vigorous and moderate aerobic activities of at least 75–150 min, as well as muscle strengthening activities on two or more days a week. Although some studies suggest benefits of lighter aerobic physical activities, recommendations for resistance exercises remain fairly uncontested.

Despite these recommendations, exercise participation among older people is low, particularly with respect to resistance exercises and for people who live in an institution. Even in institutionalized older adults, exercise (in this case ergometer cycling) has been shown to benefit functional performance and muscular strength, given a sufficient participation. Hence, it is important to study whether and how institutionalized older adults can be motivated to perform (resistance) exercise.

Older people face several barriers to exercise, including health issues and a lack of knowledge about the relationship between exercise and health. On the other hand, older people do expect certain benefits from exercise, such as social interaction, competence mastery, physical health and enjoyment. A systematic review showed that exercise adherence rates are higher in older people who live alone, who have higher socioeconomic status, better physical health, better physical and cognitive abilities and fewer depressive symptoms. Despite this general understanding of determinants to exercise in older people, theory-based motivational research in this population is lacking. Nevertheless, several motivational theories are available, which have been applied successfully in the exercise context but primarily among younger populations.

### Evidence-based, high-intensity exercise and physical activity for compressing morbidity in older adults: a narrative review [^113n6hgU]. Innovation in Aging (2019). Medium credibility.

Resistance Training

Engagement in resistance training was until recently considered a mode of exercise quite secondary to aerobic exercise. However, it is now known that in addition to increasing strength, muscle mass, and functioning, engaging in resistance training is also associated with notable cardiometabolic benefits and can decrease risks for cardiovascular diseases, some cancers, and premature death. These profound and numerous benefits of resistance training for older adults, pointing to resistance training as a prime intervention, were minimally noted in the revised physical activity guidelines. Thus, this line of work points to important avenues for health improvement and intervention efforts. Recent research also indicates that specific thresholds of strength based on age and gender can predict morbidity. The retention of muscle mass and strength and the ability to coordinate strength are critical for remaining functional and avoiding the adverse effects of sarcopenia, which is consistent with the disablement process framework. Rather than a secondary mode of exercise, a case can be made that for middle age and older adults, resistance training should be the primary mode of exercise, and a major focus for public health should be to increase the low prevalence of resistance training across age groups and especially older adults. Based on the recommendation of training major muscle groups twice per week, the percentage of older adults performing resistance training is only about 5%.

As noted previously, the more than century-old paradigm for resistance training, still prominent in some quarters, has been weight lifting. The most basic assumption is that the stimulus primarily involves the amount of weight lifted (ie, the external load) and that generally "heavier is better". Heavier resistance has been believed to provide the best stimulus for increasing strength, muscle hypertrophy (ie, muscle stimulation and growth), and other favorable cardiometabolic benefits.

Ancillary Studies to LIFE and LIFE‐P

The results of the LIFE studies contributed to several public health recommendations for physical activity in older adults, including the US Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 53 the Asia‐Pacific Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Frailty, 54 and the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee guidelines. 55 The LIFE studies added to the scientific evidence, as indicated by high citation of the main articles 8, 14 (625 and 738 citations, respectively, reported by Google Scholar on November 18, 2019), which likely have had an effect on the US population physical activity practices. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that the proportion of adults meeting minimum aerobic physical activity guideline (moderate intensity for ≥ 150 min/wk, vigorous intensity for ≥ 75 min/wk, or an equivalent combination) increased from 49.9% in 2013 (before the publication of the LIFE Study results) to 54.1% in 2017. 56

Should we plan the LIFE Study today, we would likely focus on recruiting participants with an SPPB score of less than 8, as virtually all the physical activity benefit was accrued in this lower functioning group. We would also measure lower extremity strength and body composition.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^115QnUCK]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Interventions for community dwelling older adults at intermediate fall risk

Expert recommendation. Offer an exercise programme based on an individual assessment and according to the recommendations in the Exercise Interventions section (see algorithm, Figure 1). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Supervised exercises that target balance and strength prevent falls. Fall prevention exercise should focus on maintaining balance during functional tasks needed for daily life. The most relevant tasks for individuals vary according to lifestyle, domestic needs, physical function, environment and preferences.
Effective fall prevention programmes include individualised exercises that enable or support daily tasks or similar movements. Such exercises include sit-to-stand, squats, reaching which standing, standing with a narrower base of support, stepping and walking in different directions, speeds, environments and while dual tasking. Weights can be added to some exercises to increase difficulty. Exercises should be challenging (to enhance neural, muscular and skeletal function) but safe (to prevent injuries) and achievable (for sufficient dose and sense of mastery). Exercises should be reviewed and progressed regularly to ensure that optimal level of difficulty is maintained.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^112KCKxY]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Exercise and physical activity — Adults should be routinely counseled in healthcare visits to optimize a physically active lifestyle. Adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. For adults unable to meet the minimum physical activity recommendations (at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity), engaging in some moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity, even if less than this recommended amount, can be beneficial to reduce ASCVD risk. Decreasing sedentary behavior in adults may be reasonable to reduce ASCVD risk.

### When adults don't exercise: behavioral strategies to increase physical activity in sedentary middle-aged and older adults [^1161G7Jd]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

It is hard to imagine there would be anyone who is unaware of the tremendous benefits of exercise for one's health and well-being. The messages are everywhere in the media and the culture at large. Indeed, a recent New York Times headline touted, "Closest thing to a wonder drug? Try exercise". For those who read the scientific literature, there is compelling evidence that an active lifestyle has broad benefits for cognitive, physical, and psychological health. An active lifestyle can include participation in a wide range of activities — cognitively challenging tasks, social interactions, volunteer or paid work, hobbies, and physical exercise, all of which have some health benefits. The focus of this paper is on physical activity because it shows the strongest and most compelling effects for a wide range of health outcomes. Physical activity has been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular and respiratory health, enhanced insulin sensitivity, heightened bone and muscle strength, improved positive affect and cognitive function, and increased resistance to type 2 diabetes, cancers, and depression (e.g.;).

Physical activity is arguably the most promising nonpharmacological, noninvasive, and cost-effective method of health-promotion, that is, to the extent that people do it. Yet, statistics show that only a small percentage of adults engage in regular physical activity and the numbers are lower for middle-aged and older adults. The percentage of adults getting adequate amounts of exercise remains quite low. A recent report from the National Center for Health Statistics and the CDC reports that only about 20% of adults meet the federal recommended guidelines for aerobic and strength-training activity. Additionally, this percentage decreases with age, with only 12.7% of those 65 years or age and older getting the recommended amounts of exercise. Maintaining physical activity throughout life is an important public health objective that is within reach with the right kind of interventions. In fact, physical inactivity has been called a global pandemic and is cited as one of the leading causes of death.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^116jswr7]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

Older adults classified as low risk by our algorithm have an incidence of a single fall in the next year of approximately 20–30%, but the individual risk varies according to easily recognisable attributes such as vision, hearing and foot problems, but also less measurable factors such as: context (what does the individual need to do and in what environment?); behaviours (is the person cautious, impulsive, erratic?); and, transient factors such as illness, or absence of usual support. Our recommendations promote a generic primary preventative approach which can be adapted to individual circumstances and characteristics.
There is a growing body of evidence showing a relationship between physical activity and fall risk at a population level, and evidence for effective interventions on habitual physical activity and exercise programmes for older adults at low to intermediate risk for falls. While the interventions may well merit a higher grade, this recommendation on provision of advice is at Grade E, as there is insufficient evidence on how this is best provided, taking into consideration the potential risks, including falls, to habitually inactive people who embark on activities such as brisk walking.
Recommendations on types and amounts of habitual physical activity and the avoidance of being sedentary are provided by national and international guidelines, such as the World Health Organisation, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the.
The WHO and the UK Physical Activity guidelines take a life course approach and include a specific focus on functional mobility and falls, as well as considering the merits of various activities and sports. The American College of Sports Medicine provides a wide range of exercise prescriptions for various situations.
The WHO and the UK Physical Activity guidelines recommend activities which challenge balance and include resistance training twice per week. General physical activity alone (e.g. walking) is unlikely to prevent falls.
We recommend that, where possible and safe, older adults should aim to participate in 150–300 minutes per week of intermediate-intensity physical activity or 75–150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity. There is evidence from observational studies that meeting physical activity guidelines of moderate to vigorous intensity activity reduces future falls risk and reduces the chance of an individual falling, although these findings remain uncertain. This promotion of healthy lifestyle can be expected to decrease fall risk indirectly through its positive impact on deconditioning, frailty, sarcopenia and cardiovascular health.
Uptake and adherence to exercise interventions and to increasing habitual physical activity may be helped by behaviour-change approaches such as coaching, supervision, group activity and educational material.
Generic health promotion guidelines include advice on lifestyle habits, periodic vision and hearing checks and footcare. WHO has provided guidelines on primary and community-based assessment and first level responses across five key domains which are collectively predictive of future disability.
Falls prevention advice in low risk older adults may include referral to local community health promotion or 'ageing well' programmes where available.
We recommend inclusion of fracture risk management (including need for osteoporosis treatment) to reduce fracture risk.

### Aerobic activity… [^11646ED9]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Adults 65 or older need a mix of aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and balance activities each week.
- A variety of activities can be included in each of these categories.
- Some activities include a combination of all three types. Aerobic activity Older adults need 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity each week, which is equivalent in effort to brisk walking. This could be 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. Or, to meet recommendations, older adults could get 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, which is equivalent in effort to running or jogging. Or they could get an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity. Read more about physical activity intensity. Aerobic physical activity or "cardio" is rhythmic and continuous. It gets you breathing harder and your heart beating faster. Try a few of these activities:

- Mow the lawn or rake the leaves.
- Learn a new dance.
- Walk to the store.
- Hike a trail.
- Do active forms of yoga.
- Ride a bike inside or outside.
- Join a water aerobics class. Muscle-strengthening activities In addition to aerobic activity, older adults need to do things to strengthen muscles at least 2 days a week. Do muscle-strengthening activities to the point where it's hard to do another repetition without help. A repetition is one complete movement of an activity, like lifting a weight or doing one sit-up. Try to do 8 to 12 repetitions per activity, which counts as one set. Try to do at least one set of muscle-strengthening activities. For more benefits, do two or three sets. Multicomponent physical activity To get substantial health benefits, older adults need three types of activity each week: moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and balance activities. Some activities, such as yoga, tai chi, gardening, and many sports, include more than one type of physical activity.

They are called multicomponent physical activities. Doing activities of all three types is important for improving physical function and decreasing the risk of falls or injury from a fall. Multicomponent physical activities can be done at home or in a community setting as part of a structured program.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1113Mbed]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations — community-dwelling adults 65 years or older at increased risk for falls: The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls (B recommendation) and concludes with moderate certainty that exercise interventions provide a moderate net benefit in preventing falls and fall-related morbidity in older adults at increased risk for falls. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians individualize the decision to offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls to community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls; existing evidence indicates that the overall net benefit of routinely offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls is small, and when determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient's values and preferences (C recommendation). Population scope is community-dwelling adults 65 years or older at increased risk of falls.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. exercise and physical activity for older adults [^117BXXTs]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this Position Stand is to provide an overview of issues critical to understanding the importance of exercise and physical activity in older adult populations. The Position Stand is divided into three sections: Section 1 briefly reviews the structural and functional changes that characterize normal human aging, Section 2 considers the extent to which exercise and physical activity can influence the aging process, and Section 3 summarizes the benefits of both long-term exercise and physical activity and shorter-duration exercise programs on health and functional capacity. Although no amount of physical activity can stop the biological aging process, there is evidence that regular exercise can minimize the physiological effects of an otherwise sedentary lifestyle and increase active life expectancy by limiting the development and progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions. There is also emerging evidence for significant psychological and cognitive benefits accruing from regular exercise participation by older adults. Ideally, exercise prescription for older adults should include aerobic exercise, muscle strengthening exercises, and flexibility exercises. The evidence reviewed in this Position Stand is generally consistent with prior American College of Sports Medicine statements on the types and amounts of physical activity recommended for older adults as well as the recently published 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. All older adults should engage in regular physical activity and avoid an inactive lifestyle.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^1127wjzA]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Aerobic physical activity dosage for adults — minimum amounts and accumulation patterns to lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk — is specified with weekly time targets and options for shorter bouts. All adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to lower ASCVD risk. Shorter durations of exercise seem to be as beneficial as longer ones (e.g., ≥ 10-minute bouts) and additional reduction in ASCVD risk is seen with higher amounts (> 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity). There is likely no lower limit on the quantity of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at which benefits start to accrue, and sedentary individuals starting an exercise program should initiate exercise at a lower intensity and duration and progress gradually to recommended levels.

### Exercise promotion in geriatric oncology [^111u6vbw]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence of the benefits of exercise for people with cancer from diagnosis through survivorship is growing. However, most cancers occur in older adults and little exercise advice is available for making specific recommendations for older adults with cancer. Individualized exercise prescriptions are safe, feasible, and beneficial for the geriatric oncology population. Oncology providers must be equipped to discuss the short- and long-term benefits of exercise and assist older patients in obtaining appropriate exercise prescriptions. This review provides detailed information about professionals and their roles as it relates to functional assessment, intervention, and evaluation of the geriatric oncology population. This review addresses the importance of functional status assessment and appropriate referrals to other oncology professionals.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^116YGizX]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Sarcopenia is a generalised skeletal muscle disorder characterised by reduced muscle strength and mass and associated with a range of negative health outcomes. Currently, resistance exercise (RE) is recommended as the first-line treatment for counteracting the deleterious consequences of sarcopenia in older adults. However, whilst there is considerable evidence demonstrating that RE is an effective intervention for improving muscle strength and function in healthy older adults, much less is known about its benefits in older people living with sarcopenia. Furthermore, evidence for its optimal prescription and delivery is very limited and any potential benefits of RE are unlikely to be realised in the absence of an appropriate exercise dose. We provide a summary of the underlying principles of effective RE prescription (specificity, overload and progression) and discuss the main variables (training frequency, exercise selection, exercise intensity, exercise volume and rest periods) that can be manipulated when designing RE programmes. Following this, we propose that an RE programme that consists of two exercise sessions per week and involves a combination of upper- and lower-body exercises performed with a relatively high degree of effort for 1–3 sets of 6–12 repetitions is appropriate as a treatment for sarcopenia. The principles of RE prescription outlined here and the proposed RE programme presented in this paper provide a useful resource for clinicians and exercise practitioners treating older adults with sarcopenia and will also be of value to researchers for standardising approaches to RE interventions in future sarcopenia studies.

### Recovery from resistance exercise in older adults: a protocol for a scoping review [^112mgk83]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Resistance exercise, also known as strength training or resistance training, has been shown to be effective in improving muscle health in older adults. After the age of 50, it is thought that muscular strength decreases at a rate of 1.5%–5% per year, inevitably leading to a reduced functional capacity. There is now compelling evidence that this decline can be attenuated through regular participation in resistance exercise, resulting in improved muscle mass, muscle strength, body composition and metabolic health. Moreover, these adaptations have been shown to reduce fall risk, prevent disability and improve quality of life in older adults. Consequently, resistance exercise is recommended as a front-line treatment for many health conditions, including sarcopenia, a skeletal muscle disorder characterised by progressive loss of muscle strength and mass, and frailty. However, despite considerable research describing the potential benefits of resistance exercise in older adults, exercise recovery and the process of muscle repair and adaptation following intense exercise are distinctly understudied. Indeed, little is known regarding how older adults recover from individual exercise sessions that may be performed as part of a resistance training programme.

### Community-based group physical activity and / or nutrition interventions to promote mobility in older adults: an umbrella review [^116R9QHg]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We provide a high-level comprehensive synthesis regarding the overall effectiveness of group-based PA and/or nutrition interventions to improve mobility among community-dwelling older adults. Within this review, we take a broad view of mobility, which captures several modifiable risk factors that influence older adults' ability to move within and beyond their immediate environments. Interventions that combined aerobic and resistance exercise, and general PA interventions were found to result in meaningful improvements in physical function, balance, and muscle strength in older adults and are also likely to reduce falls and fall-related injuries. Mind-body exercise is also effective at improving physical function and balance, as is combined aerobic and resistance exercise for aerobic capacity.

Our findings support a multifaceted approach to health and wellbeing among community-dwelling older adults. Similar findings are reflected in two overviews of reviews focused on all adults over the age of 18, including older adults, which informed the recent Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. These guidelines also recommend a combination of aerobic, resistance, and balance exercises for adults aged 65+. Recent evidence has found that older adults face unique barriers and hesitancy to engage in certain types of exercise, such as resistance training. It is encouraging that benefits for each of our outcome domains were seen across a range of intervention types. This suggests that effective interventions for older adults can incorporate a variety of types of exercises or physical activities that are most likely to foster enjoyment. This notion is consistent with emerging literature regarding the role of intrinsic motivation (i.e. enjoyment in physical activity) as an important predictor of physical activity engagement among older adults. This approach can also improve accessibility to PA within this population by building upon existing community services and group-based PA programs that provide the additional benefit of social participation, which enhances enjoyment, adherence, and sustainability of PA. The importance of social participation for older adults is supported by recent research informed by social-cognitive and socio-emotional theories, suggesting that older adults experiencing social isolation may derive meaningful social benefits from interactions with other participants in group-based exercise programs.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116RiHoB]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — exercise intervention components and high-risk populations — notes that the studies of exercise interventions it reviewed varied in several ways, such as providing individual vs group sessions and in the exercise components of the interventions, that nearly all exercise interventions included gait, balance, and functional training, and most included a strength and resistance training component, and that research gaps include groups at high risk of falls, such as persons 85 years or older.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^115hDtkU]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Management and interventions

Conditional recommendation. Older adults with PD should be offered multidomain interventions, based on PD specific assessment and other identified falls risk factors. GRADE: 2B.

Strong recommendation. Older adults with PD at an early to mid-stage and with mild or no cognitive impairment should be offered individualised exercise programmes including balance and resistance training exercise. GRADE: 1A.

Strong recommendation. Consider offering exercise training, targeting balance and strength to people with complex phase PD if supervised by a physiotherapist or other suitably qualified professional. GRADE: 1C.

Recommendation details and justification

As a guide, a Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score ≥ 34 can be regarded as complex stage PD.
Supervision and modification of exercise interventions with PD individuals at a complex stage or with moderate or severe cognitive impairment requires specialist skills.
Falls prevention exercise interventions should be integrated in general mobility and ADL rehabilitation.
The effect of exercise on falls in older adults with PD that is more advanced (e.g. MDS-UPDRS motor score ≥ 34) and/or with substantial cognitive impairment is uncertain, but limited data indicate that minimally supervised exercise may increase the risk of falls.
A higher level of supervision is necessary in older adults with intermediate cognitive impairment, as such individuals may not be able to follow a self-directed programme, and for safety.
Specific subgroups of individuals (e.g. with FOG) may benefit from specifically targeted interventions (i.e. progressive balance and lower limb strengthening exercises).
Although preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of (pro-)cholinergic medications on falls is promising, the design, outcome assessment and size of clinical trials to date are inadequate to produce definitive evidence.
Optimisation of medications to maximise motor function and minimise side effects (such as dyskinesia and hypotension) are critical first steps to falls prevention in PD treatment.

Stroke

Conditional recommendation. Older adults after a stroke should be offered participation in individualised exercise programmes aimed at improving balance/strength/walking to prevent falls. GRADE: 2C.

Recommendation details and justification

The recommendation is based on systematic review evidence of health benefits of exercise aimed at improving strength/balance/walking in this clinical group.
Falls prevention exercise should be integrated in more general mobility and ADL rehabilitation.
Higher supervision is warranted when there are more impairments following stroke.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^1126W7Fv]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Prescribing resistance exercise for sarcopenia

Rationale

There is consistent evidence for the benefits of RE as a treatment for the individual components of sarcopenia across a range of population groups. However, evidence in older adults diagnosed with sarcopenia remains limited (see Supplementary Information available at Age and Ageing online for summary), even though RE is recommended as a first-line treatment in clinical practice. A key consideration in developing a pragmatic approach for the treatment of sarcopenia is that the therapeutic potential of exercise can be realised only if older adults receive an appropriate exercise dose, yet previous work suggests that the principles of exercise prescription are often overlooked or misapplied (e.g. non-individualised, lacking progression). We therefore propose a pragmatic person-centred approach, based on established principles from sport and exercise science, to guide individualised RE prescription for older adults with sarcopenia. Such an approach can inform the design and delivery of RE in older adults with sarcopenia pending more definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials.

As older adults with sarcopenia are also likely to be at an increased risk for falls and display reduced cardiorespiratory fitness, exercise programmes delivered to these individuals often involve a combination of exercise modes (e.g. RE, balance training, aerobic training). These multicomponent exercise programmes are likely to be the most efficacious approach for all-round fitness improvement in older adults compared to a single exercise mode alone. However, as prescription of each exercise mode involves the manipulation of specific variables, and RE is the most efficacious method for improving muscle strength and mass in older people, the following sections of this manuscript will focus on RE alone.

Principles of exercise training

Exercise training involves the repeated and systematic performance of individual exercise sessions over a period of time with the aim of improving physical ability (e.g. muscle strength) or skill. This process (Figure 1) involves prescribing an exercise dose in order to induce a training stimulus. The acute response to training and any resultant chronic training adaptation is driven by the training stimulus (i.e. the physiological stress placed on the individual). Whilst individual and contextual factors can influence the training stimulus, its primary determinant is the exercise dose. Several principles of exercise training are fundamental to ensure the provision of a safe, individualised and effective RE dose. These principles should be embedded in the design of any RE intervention to enable the exercise programme to stimulate positive training responses to achieve its desired outcomes. These principles are specificity, overload and progression and are defined in Table 1.

Other relevant USPSTF recommendations — falls, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency screening: The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older. The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls; multifactorial interventions may also be effective in some persons as well. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.

### Your move: a precision medicine framework for physical activity in aging [^114LYCdT]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

To optimize the health benefits of physical activity, it is crucial to consider variations in Minimal Clinically Important Differences (MCID) and tailor activity goals accordingly. A meta-analysis investigating the relationship between physical activity and cognitive function in older adults with a healthy body mass index has identified diverse dose-response ranges for different types of activities. Among these, aerobic and resistance exercises demonstrated an inverted U-shaped pattern with optimal benefits at an intermediate level. This can be attributed to the distinct mechanisms through which various exercise modalities impact health outcomes, as well as variances in perceived fatigue and effort. Interestingly, the study found that overweight and obese individuals experienced cognitive benefits at lower activity levels than the general population guidelines recommended by the WHO. These effects were larger in older women as compared to older men, without reporting for race. It is worth noting that a meta-analysis of physical activity interventions suggested modest group-level effect sizes in cognitive outcomes, and that some effects may become smaller when accounting for certain moderators like for example baseline performance or training program duration. However, it is central to recognize that this meta-analysis presented many methodological issues, the most relevant being that it excluded individuals with multiple medical conditions, leading to biased sample selection. Therefore, to ensure that physical activity is optimized for health benefits, it is important to acknowledge that populations with comorbidities may present variations in MCID, which emphasizes the necessity of tailoring physical activity goals to the individual.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117QYjFb]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF implementation guidance — Determine who is at increased risk for falls: Increasing age is strongly related to risk of falls; intervention studies most commonly used a history of falls to identify increased risk; and a pragmatic approach would be to assess for a history of falls or for problems in physical functioning and limited mobility. Refer older adults at increased risk for falls to exercise interventions, and individualize the decision to refer older adults at increased risk for falls to multifactorial interventions, considering the balance of benefits and harms based on prior falls, comorbid conditions, and patient values and preferences.

### Physical activity and health: what is the best dose? [^116J79yZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The questions remain, what dose of PA will provide health benefits, and is there an additional benefit for those who choose to perform the activity at vigorous intensity? Shiroma et al provide strong support that achieving either the moderate‐ or vigorous‐intensity targets recommended in the current Physical Activity Guidelines will delay mortality in older adults. The evidence‐base supporting a wide variety of health benefits for this total volume of PA is conclusive. Studies seeking to tease out whether vigorous‐intensity PA may provide additional or superior benefits are far from providing clear answers. In addition to taking individual health history, risk factors, current PA level, and interests into account, clinicians and allied health professionals should be strongly advocating that everyone strive to accumulate at least 500 MET minutes per week in PA of moderate to vigorous intensity.

Recommendation 7

Progressive resistance/weight-based training is effective for improving muscle mass, strength and physical performance.

In general, for older adults age 65 and above, more physical activity (frequency, duration and/or volume) leads to greater benefits as per the 2020 WHO Guidelines. The International Clinical Practice Guidelines for Sarcopenia prescribes progressive RET as the first-line therapy for sarcopenia. Similarly, the American College of Sport Medicine strongly recommends RET to increase strength and power in older adults. Evidence has demonstrated the benefit of exercise training, especially RET for ≥ 3 months, in improving muscle mass, strength and gait speed in older adults. Additionally, higher RET volume (total repetitions [number] x external load [kg]) is associated with greater improvements in LBM, with every additional 10 sets of exercise performed per session leading to an expected gain of 0.5 kg in LBM. With each incremental increase in exercise intensity from low (< 60% 1-repetition maximum [RM]) to low/moderate (60–69% 1-RM), low/moderate (60–69% 1 RM) to moderate/high (70–79% 1-RM), and moderate/high (70–79% 1-RM) to high (> 80% 1 RM), a 5.5% increase in strength is expected.

Table 4 outlines an example of how a 12-week structured RET-based exercise program for older adults can be implemented in terms of specificity, overload and progression exercise prescription principles. The application of moderate or greater intensity muscle strengthening exercises 2 or more days a week receives a strong recommendation with moderate certainty of evidence by the WHO Guidelines 2020. The Borg scale (Table 5) allows individuals to rate their level of exertion during exercise and can be used as a simplified alternative to gauge exercise intensity.

### Exercise and older patients: prescribing guidelines [^114WdRE9]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

A combination of aerobic activity, strength training, and flexibility exercises, plus increased general daily activity can reduce medication dependence and health care costs while maintaining functional independence and improving quality of life in older adults. However, patients often do not benefit fully from exercise prescriptions because they receive vague or inappropriate instructions. Effective exercise prescriptions include recommendations on frequency, intensity, type, time, and progression of exercise that follow disease-specific guidelines. Changes in physical activity require multiple motivational strategies including exercise instruction as well as goal-setting, self-monitoring, and problem-solving education. Helping patients identify emotionally rewarding and physically appropriate activities, contingencies, and social support will increase exercise continuation rates and facilitate desirable health outcomes. Through patient contact and community advocacy, physicians can promote lifestyle patterns that are essential for healthy aging.

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^115fALw6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe new WHO 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour.

Methods

The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations.

Results

The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold.

Conclusion

These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.

### Is physical activity a cause of longevity? It is not as straightforward as some would believe. A critical analysis [^116UDSaT]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There are discrepant findings between (A) observational follow-ups and (B) interventional studies that investigate possible causal association between high physical activity and low mortality. Participation in vigorous physical activity at a specific time-point is an indicator of good fitness and health, and is associated with a reduced risk of death. However, neither randomised controlled trials nor experimental animal studies have provided conclusive evidence to show that physical activity started during adulthood extends lifespan. Consequently, the undisputed health-related benefits of exercise have yet to translate into any proven causal relationship with longevity. Physical activity improves fitness and physical function, and confers other health-related effects. These outcomes have a greater basis in evidence-based data than any claims of a reduced risk of death, especially when recommending physical activity for previously physically inactive middle-aged and elderly adults.

### Physical activity and public health in older adults: recommendation from the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association [^111BXJxm]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To issue a recommendation on the types and amounts of physical activity needed to improve and maintain health in older adults.

Participants

A panel of scientists with expertise in public health, behavioral science, epidemiology, exercise science, medicine, and gerontology.

Evidence

The expert panel reviewed existing consensus statements and relevant evidence from primary research articles and reviews of the literature.

Process

After drafting a recommendation for the older adult population and reviewing drafts of the Updated Recommendation from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Heart Association (AHA) for Adults, the panel issued a final recommendation on physical activity for older adults.

Summary

The recommendation for older adults is similar to the updated ACSM/AHA recommendation for adults, but has several important differences including: the recommended intensity of aerobic activity takes into account the older adult's aerobic fitness; activities that maintain or increase flexibility are recommended; and balance exercises are recommended for older adults at risk of falls. In addition, older adults should have an activity plan for achieving recommended physical activity that integrates preventive and therapeutic recommendations. The promotion of physical activity in older adults should emphasize moderate-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, reducing sedentary behavior, and risk management.

### The effects of exercise training on hypertensive older adults: an umbrella meta-analysis [^112qLwgW]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Exercise training has been shown to blunt many of the physiological declines and common diseases of the aging process. One such beneficial effect is the reduction of blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive older adults. However, there is no consensus about which benefits of aerobic (AT) or resistance training (RT) may be lost by the use of combined training (CT) or even what benefits could be acquired only by performing CT, considering the extensive health needs of older adults with hypertension. Thus, we performed an umbrella meta-analysis. The benefits conferred by CT are extensive and encompass cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, and blood lipid profile improvements. CT may be recommended to improve the extensive health needs of hypertensive older adults that go beyond blood pressure reduction.

### Resistance exercise as a treatment for sarcopenia: prescription and delivery [^1172qZVs]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sarcopenia is a generalised skeletal muscle disorder characterised by reduced muscle strength and mass and associated with a range of negative health outcomes. Currently, resistance exercise (RE) is recommended as the first-line treatment for counteracting the deleterious consequences of sarcopenia in older adults. However, whilst there is considerable evidence demonstrating that RE is an effective intervention for improving muscle strength and function in healthy older adults, much less is known about its benefits in older people living with sarcopenia. Furthermore, evidence for its optimal prescription and delivery is very limited and any potential benefits of RE are unlikely to be realised in the absence of an appropriate exercise dose. We provide a summary of the underlying principles of effective RE prescription (specificity, overload and progression) and discuss the main variables (training frequency, exercise selection, exercise intensity, exercise volume and rest periods) that can be manipulated when designing RE programmes. Following this, we propose that an RE programme that consists of two exercise sessions per week and involves a combination of upper- and lower-body exercises performed with a relatively high degree of effort for 1–3 sets of 6–12 repetitions is appropriate as a treatment for sarcopenia. The principles of RE prescription outlined here and the proposed RE programme presented in this paper provide a useful resource for clinicians and exercise practitioners treating older adults with sarcopenia and will also be of value to researchers for standardising approaches to RE interventions in future sarcopenia studies.

### Benefits of exercise in the older population [^115LAeQ6]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Older adults 65 years of age and older compose a great portion of the US population. Physiologic changes of aging that limit function and general quality of life occur at a faster rate as we get older. There is high-quality evidence that exercise activity has many favorable benefits for older adults. The ideal exercise program in older adults should include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance training. The exercise recommendations should be individually tailored to the abilities, precautions, and goals of each person. They also should be of sufficient intensity, volume, and duration in order to achieve maximal benefits.

### Exercise for preventing falls in older people living in the community [^115vAVvj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

At least one-third of community-dwelling people over 65 years of age fall each year. Exercises that target balance, gait and muscle strength have been found to prevent falls in these people. An up-to-date synthesis of the evidence is important given the major long-term consequences associated with falls and fall-related injuries OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of exercise interventions for preventing falls in older people living in the community.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trial registers up to 2 May 2018, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of any form of exercise as a single intervention on falls in people aged 60+ years living in the community. We excluded trials focused on particular conditions, such as stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome was rate of falls.

Main Results

We included 108 RCTs with 23,407 participants living in the community in 25 countries. There were nine cluster-RCTs. On average, participants were 76 years old and 77% were women. Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias for one or more items. Results from four trials focusing on people who had been recently discharged from hospital and from comparisons of different exercises are not described here. Exercise (all types) versus control Eighty-one trials (19,684 participants) compared exercise (all types) with control intervention (one not thought to reduce falls). Exercise reduces the rate of falls by 23% (rate ratio (RaR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.83; 12,981 participants, 59 studies; high-certainty evidence). Based on an illustrative risk of 850 falls in 1000 people followed over one year (data based on control group risk data from the 59 studies), this equates to 195 (95% CI 144 to 246) fewer falls in the exercise group. Exercise also reduces the number of people experiencing one or more falls by 15% (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89; 13,518 participants, 63 studies; high-certainty evidence). Based on an illustrative risk of 480 fallers in 1000 people followed over one year (data based on control group risk data from the 63 studies), this equates to 72 (95% CI 52 to 91) fewer fallers in the exercise group. Subgroup analyses showed no evidence of a difference in effect on both falls outcomes according to whether trials selected participants at increased risk of falling or not. The findings for other outcomes are less certain, reflecting in part the relatively low number of studies and participants. Exercise may reduce the number of people experiencing one or more fall-related fractures (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95; 4047 participants, 10 studies; low-certainty evidence) and the number of people experiencing one or more falls requiring medical attention (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79; 1019 participants, 5 studies; low-certainty evidence). The effect of exercise on the number of people who experience one or more falls requiring hospital admission is unclear (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.18; 1705 participants, 2 studies, very low-certainty evidence). Exercise may make little important difference to health-related quality of life: conversion of the pooled result (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.04; 3172 participants, 15 studies; low-certainty evidence) to the EQ-5D and SF-36 scores showed the respective 95% CIs were much smaller than minimally important differences for both scales. Adverse events were reported to some degree in 27 trials (6019 participants) but were monitored closely in both exercise and control groups in only one trial. Fourteen trials reported no adverse events. Aside from two serious adverse events (one pelvic stress fracture and one inguinal hernia surgery) reported in one trial, the remainder were non-serious adverse events, primarily of a musculoskeletal nature. There was a median of three events (range 1 to 26) in the exercise groups. Different exercise types versus controlDifferent forms of exercise had different impacts on falls (test for subgroup differences, rate of falls: P = 0.004, I² = 71%). Compared with control, balance and functional exercises reduce the rate of falls by 24% (RaR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.81; 7920 participants, 39 studies; high-certainty evidence) and the number of people experiencing one or more falls by 13% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.91; 8288 participants, 37 studies; high-certainty evidence). Multiple types of exercise (most commonly balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises) probably reduce the rate of falls by 34% (RaR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.88; 1374 participants, 11 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and the number of people experiencing one or more falls by 22% (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96; 1623 participants, 17 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Tai Chi may reduce the rate of falls by 19% (RaR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.99; 2655 participants, 7 studies; low-certainty evidence) as well as reducing the number of people who experience falls by 20% (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91; 2677 participants, 8 studies; high-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of programmes that are primarily resistance training, or dance or walking programmes on the rate of falls and the number of people who experience falls. No trials compared flexibility or endurance exercise versus control.

Authors' Conclusions

Exercise programmes reduce the rate of falls and the number of people experiencing falls in older people living in the community (high-certainty evidence). The effects of such exercise programmes are uncertain for other non-falls outcomes. Where reported, adverse events were predominantly non-serious. Exercise programmes that reduce falls primarily involve balance and functional exercises, while programmes that probably reduce falls include multiple exercise categories (typically balance and functional exercises plus resistance exercises). Tai Chi may also prevent falls but we are uncertain of the effect of resistance exercise (without balance and functional exercises), dance, or walking on the rate of falls.

### Effect of exercise training for five years on all cause mortality in older adults-the generation 100 study: randomised controlled trial [^112yjM5p]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Most countries have experienced a large demographic change, with a substantial increase in the proportion of older adults alongside an increase in preventable, non-communicable diseases, which now account for more than 60% of all global deaths. Increased life expectancy, if not accompanied by good health, could lead to loss of independence and increased disability and morbidity, resulting in substantially higher healthcare costs and premature mortality. Cardiorespiratory fitness (peak or maximal oxygen uptake) is now regarded as a clinical vital sign, and physical activity guidelines have been developed as a non-expensive health promoting strategy in public healthcare to maintain or improve cardiorespiratory fitness, overall wellbeing and to combat the growing burden of non-communicable diseases worldwide. Today's physical activity recommendations around the world are relatively consistent and advise adults (including older adults) to exercise at moderate intensity for 150 minutes a week or at vigorous intensity for 75 minutes a week. The recommendations also state that they can be reached by combining moderate and vigorous activity provided that a certain total volume of energy expenditure is satisfied (at least 4184 kJ a week). The central implication is that either shorter duration vigorous physical activity or longer duration moderate physical activity or a combination of the two, that amount to the same amount of work each week, will have the same favourable health outcomes, with vigorous physical activity being the time efficient alternative. However, the physical activity guidelines have not been tested in large long term prospective randomised clinical trials, and information about their effect in older adults is lacking. In our study we found larger health benefits in those who undertook mainly high intensity exercise compared with those who undertook mainly moderate intensity exercise. We suggest that future guidelines for physical activity, at least for older adults, should be more specific in requiring that at least part of the physical activity should be performed at high intensity.

Conclusion

Compared with the Norwegian recommended guidelines for physical activity, supervised exercise (HIIT and MICT combined) showed no effect on all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease events, or cancer events in older adults. Our data do, however, suggest that HIIT lowers the risk of premature death compared with recommended guidelines and MICT.

### Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults [^113SsH5a]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is an emergent awareness that health benefits derived from physical activity (PA) do not diminish over the life-course, and that PA is also important for older adults as a way of both preventing and managing chronic diseases and disabilities. Additionally, there is a growing literature on the impact of the built environment on the amount and types of PA, with environmental design features promoting or hindering activity patterns. Thus, the identification of places where older adults engage in PA and the factors influencing the amount of PA is critical for promoting population health.

An evolution in the types and settings of PA being studied has occurred over the past decades. Earlier clinical perspectives focused on intensive exercise regimens for cardiovascular benefit that typically required exercise equipment in a gym setting. In contrast, the current public health perspective stresses that PA should be incorporated into everyday routines and settings such as people's neighborhoods. Additionally, physicians are seen as playing a critical role in assessing current PA levels and advising their patients on strategies for being more active.

Yet, national statistics indicate that while the majority of older adults engage in some minimal PA (e.g. walking up to 3 days a week), the majority fail to meet the recommended PA guidelines for engaging in PA (i.e. at least 150 min of moderate physical activity per week). This has resulted in a growing interest in understanding linkages between health and place, and how different dimensions of the environment interact with lifestyle factors to influence a variety of health outcomes across the life-course.

While there are a myriad of ways to be physically active, walking is one of the most popular forms of PA, especially among older adults. Walking behaviors resonate with environmental studies attempting to better understand where, why, and how community members engage in PA. Studies of older adults typically examine the amount of PA reported as well as barriers and facilitators to exercise and clinical or behavioral intervention effects. What is less known is how the physical and social environments interact with socio-demographic and self-assessed health statuses to predict who is most sedentary or most active.

### Physical activity guidelines for older people: knowledge gaps and future directions [^111PWbm3]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2021). High credibility.

Physical function (ie, aerobic capacity, gait speed, and muscle strength) has been proposed as a biomarker of healthy ageing, as it is predictive of adverse health events, disability, and mortality. The role of physical exercise as a therapeutic strategy for prevention of both disease and the associated decline in functional capacity has been emphasised repeatedly. Supervised exercise interventions in hospitalised older people (aged ≥ 75 years) have been proved to be safe and effective in preventing or attenuating functional and cognitive decline. Unfortunately, few studies have explored the potential role of tailored physical activity guidelines to maximise exercise-related effect on function. Also, exercise has not been fully integrated into primary or geriatric medical practice and is almost absent from the core training of most medical doctors and other health-care providers. Physical trainers should be included in health-care systems to help manage physical exercise programmes for older patients. Taking into consideration current evidence about the benefits of exercise for frail older adults, it is unethical not to prescribe physical exercise for such individuals. To promote healthy and dignified ageing, it is therefore essential to help health-care systems to more efficiently implement evidence-based exercise programmes for frail older adults in all community and care settings.

### Physical activity and public health: updated recommendation for adults from the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association [^112WC3RG]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Summary

In 1995 the American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published national guidelines on Physical Activity and Public Health. The Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the American Heart Association endorsed and supported these recommendations. The purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. Development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. This panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. Issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. Key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. A draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. Comments were integrated into the final recommendation.

Primary Recommendation

To promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [I (A)] Combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [IIa (B)] For example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk and noticeably accelerates the heart rate, can be accumulated toward the 30-min minimum by performing bouts each lasting 10 or more minutes. [I (B)] Vigorous-intensity activity is exemplified by jogging, and causes rapid breathing and a substantial increase in heart rate. In addition, every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance a minimum of two days each week. [IIa (A)] Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, persons who wish to further improve their personal fitness, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity.

### Efficacy of exercise-based interventions in preventing falls among community-dwelling older persons with cognitive impairment: is there enough evidence? An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^117HvubW]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Exercise-based interventions show promise in reducing falls among community-dwelling older adults with cognitive impairment. However, the statistical significance of this meta-analysis supporting this contention is primarily driven by a small number of studies, which calls into question the clinical significance. Although available evidence remains insufficient to inform recommendations for clinical and community practice, findings from our study should serve as an incentive for additional research to clarify the relationship between exercise and falls prevention among this high-risk population.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116H54Jz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with type 2 diabetes — lifestyle management — includes: 13.12 Recommend healthful eating with adequate protein intake for older adults with diabetes. Recommend regular exercise, including aerobic activity; weight-bearing exercise, and/or resistance training as tolerated for those who can safely engage in such activities. B 13.13 For older adults with type 2 diabetes, overweight or obesity, and capacity to exercise safely, an intensive lifestyle intervention focused on dietary changes, physical activity, and modest weight loss (e.g., 5–7%) should be considered for its benefits on quality of life, mobility and physical functioning, and cardiometabolic risk. A The goal of these programs is not weight loss but enhanced functional status; for nonfrail older adults with type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity, an intensive lifestyle intervention designed to reduce weight is beneficial across multiple outcomes; in Look AHEAD, it enrolled people between 45 and 74 years of age and required that they be able to perform a maximal exercise test, and participants who lost at least 10% of baseline body weight at year 1 had improved cardiovascular outcomes.

### Exercise for falls prevention in aged care: systematic review and trial endpoint meta-analyses [^114FhApS]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is strong evidence that exercise reduces falls in older people living in the community, but its effectiveness in residential aged care is less clear. This systematic review examines the effectiveness of exercise for falls prevention in residential aged care, meta-analysing outcomes measured immediately after exercise or after post-intervention follow-up.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis, including randomised controlled trials from a Cochrane review and additional trials, published to December 2022. Trials of exercise as a single intervention compared to usual care, reporting data suitable for meta-analysis of rate or risk of falls, were included. Meta-analyses were conducted according to Cochrane Collaboration methods and quality of evidence rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Results

12 trials from the Cochrane review plus 7 new trials were included. At the end of the intervention period, exercise probably reduces the number of falls (13 trials, rate ratio [RaR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49–0.95), but after post-intervention follow-up exercise had little or no effect (8 trials, RaR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.80–1.28). The effect on the risk of falling was similar (end of intervention risk ratio (RR) = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72–0.98, 12 trials; post-intervention follow-up RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.92–1.20, 8 trials). There were no significant subgroup differences according to cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

Exercise is recommended as a fall prevention strategy for older people living in aged care who are willing and able to participate (moderate certainty evidence), but exercise has little or no lasting effect on falls after the end of a programme (high certainty evidence).

### Recovery from resistance exercise in older adults: a protocol for a scoping review [^113UJDhq]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Resistance exercise has been shown to improve muscle health in older adults and is recommended as a front-line treatment for many health conditions, including sarcopenia and frailty. However, despite considerable research detailing the potential benefits of resistance exercise programmes, little is known about how older adults recover from individual exercise sessions. This scoping review will examine the current evidence surrounding the acute post-exercise effects of resistance exercise and the exercise recovery process in older adults to inform future research and exercise prescription guidelines for older adults.

Methods and Analysis

The methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley (2005) will be applied for this scoping review. A systematic search of five online databases and the hand-searching of reference lists of identified articles will be used to identify relevant papers. Studies that aim to measure exercise-induced muscle damage or exercise recovery following a resistance exercise session in participants aged 65 years and over will be included. Qualitative and quantitative data from relevant studies will be presented in a tabular format. Results will be summarised in narrative format. Key findings will be discussed concerning resistance exercise prescription in older adults.

Dissemination

This review will be used to direct further research surrounding the exercise recovery process from resistance exercise in older adults and will also aid in designing specific exercise prescription guidelines for an older population. Findings will be relevant to researchers, clinicians, health workers and policy-makers and disseminated through publications and presentations.

### Exercise: the ultimate treatment to all ailments? [^111wxZmC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Extensive clinical research has provided robust evidence that exercise is a cost‐effective measure to substantially alleviate the burden of a large number of diseases, many of which belong to the cardiovascular (CV) spectrum. In terms of cardiac benefit, the positive effects of exercise are attributed to improvements in standard risk factors for atherosclerosis, as well as to its positive impact on several pathophysiological mechanisms for CV diseases. For secondary prevention, exercise, optimally in the context of a cardiac rehabilitation program, has been shown to improve functional capacity and survival. Clinicians should encourage physical activity and provide exercise recommendations for all patients, taking into consideration any underlying pathology. In the present review, the benefits of exercise for the prevention and treatment of major CV risk factors and heart conditions are analyzed.

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^117U6rWn]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

These new, updated WHO guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour, together with the WHO guidelines for under 5 years of age, provide recommendations on physical activity and sedentary behaviour for individuals across the whole age spectrum and address a long-lasting gap with the inclusion of key populations for the first time. Collectively, the recommendations affirm the importance of regular aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity and reduction in sedentary behaviours. Benefits accrue from doing any amount of physical activity and this applies to people of all ages and abilities. There are significant health gains and cost savings to health systems if countries adopt these guidelines and direct efforts and resources to implementation of programmes and policy to enable achievement of the 2030 GAPPA target set out in the global action plan on physical activity. Benefits extend also beyond the health sector as mounting evidence across diverse fields shows the interconnected social, economic and environmental impacts of more physically active populations. Now, it is time to work to ensure and support the adoption and implementation of these new global guidelines for a healthier, more active future worldwide.

Key messages

These new 2020 WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour provide evidence-based public health recommendations concerning the amount and types of physical activity that offer significant health benefits and mitigate health risks.
They update and replace the previous 2010 WHO recommendations on physical activity.
The guidelines address children over the age of 5 years, adults, older adults and, for the first time, include specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability.
For all populations, the benefits of doing physical activity and limiting sedentary behaviour outweighed the potential harms.
Risks can be managed by gradual increase in the amount and intensity of physical activity.
Some physical activity is better than none for those not currently meeting these recommendations, individuals should start with small amounts of physical activity and gradually increase frequency, intensity and duration over time.
Countries are encouraged to adopt and disseminate these new global guidelines to key audiences, and use them as the basis for sustained national public education communication campaigns responding to their national context and factors such as culture, ethnic diversity and social norms.
These new guidelines should inform national policy and actions to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviours as well as to align national health behaviour surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.
Important evidence gaps remain and more research is needed on the dose-response relationship between volume and/or intensity of physical activity and health outcomes, particularly in people living with disability, and further evidence from low-income and middle-income, disadvantaged or underserved communities.

### Interventions promoting physical activity among older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DEj3x]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Frequent participation in physical activity (PA) has benefits across the lifespan but is particularly important for older adults. PA levels are either measured by objective or self-reported survey methods. Objective PA measurement is used to increase accuracy. This systematic review investigated the effect of physical activity-based interventions on objectively measured PA levels among community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older.

Research Design and Methods

Literature searches were conducted in five electronic databases and four clinical trial registries. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of physical activity-based interventions on objectively measured PA levels (e.g., accelerometers or pedometers) in community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older compared with no/minimal intervention were considered eligible. Data were pooled using the most conservative estimates reported from each study using the standardized mean difference (SMD). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence.

Results

Fourteen published trials and 3 ongoing trials were identified. There were significant effects favoring physical activity-based interventions compared with minimal intervention at short-term (less than or equal to 3 months) (SMD: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.43) and intermediate-term (more than 3 months and less than 12 months; SMD: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.49) follow-ups. The quality of evidence was moderate according to GRADE (downgraded for risk of bias).

Discussion and Implications

Our findings suggest that physical activity-based interventions may increase objectively measured PA levels in community-dwelling older adults. Further studies are still needed to identify the optimal dose, intensity, and mode of delivery of physical activity-based interventions.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1113TSAe]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults — are summarized as follows: The CDC recommends STEADI, a coordinated approach for fall prevention in adults 65 years or older that consists of 3 core elements: screen to identify fall risk, assess modifiable risk factors, and intervene using effective clinical and community strategies to reduce the identified risk. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that older adults engage in multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training, as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, as part of the 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity recommended for all adults. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the USPSTF 2018 recommendation on fall prevention in community-dwelling older adults.

USPSTF research gaps — interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults emphasize that research is needed to develop and validate primary care–feasible risk assessment tools for adults 65 years or older, to compare exercise plus multifactorial interventions with exercise alone, to improve availability and accessibility of effective interventions (including remote delivery), to evaluate effectiveness and harms in distinct functional/risk groups (including persons 85 years or older and those with frailty), and to assess benefits and harms of educational and psychological interventions.

### A geriatrician's approach to managing the complex older adult with obesity [^1119Vxu1]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical activity

Physical activity recommendation is a key component of weight management as it influences health benefits but its effect on weight loss remains moderate. Aerobic and resistance exercise combined with caloric restriction is essential to reduce adiposity and improve physical and metabolic health. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends a multicomponent regimen involving aerobic, muscle‐strengthening, and balance exercises in older adults to address obesity‐induced postural imbalance. Robust studies have recommended moderate‐to‐high‐intensity aerobic exercise to promote weight loss, which is less achievable in older adults. The International Exercise Recommendations in Older Adults (ICFSR): Expert Consensus Guidelines suggests achieving this by alternate methods such as intermittent intensity with resistance or interval training. The American College of Sports Medicine consensus statement for adults with obesity states that light‐intensity physical activity could be an alternative approach to high intensity provided it helps sufficient energy expenditure. Although adherence to traditional exercise is low, recent evidence has suggested minimal‐dose resistance training as alternate effective approaches. This could be brief sessions of resistance training performed at either moderate‐high loads done infrequently, referred to as low‐volume, high‐load resistance training, or lower loads performed at higher frequencies and also with minimal to no equipment, referred to as resistance exercise snacking, which can be used in patients with sedentary behavior. Exercise counseling could be recommended as a medicine prescription wherein the prescription needs to be tailored to the patient's exercise preference, amount of exercise agreed upon, and readiness (when and how often, i.e. days per week) and slowly increase the intensity (prescription dose) of physical activity and resistance training with a trusted partnership and shared decision‐making. Using office‐based tools such as a handgrip dynamometer to assess grip strength as a surrogate measure of muscle strength also serves as a motivator for older adults to improve resistance training. Exercise adherence in older adults with obesity and multiple chronic conditions is a challenge due to multiple limiting factors such as pain from OA leading to unpleasant experiences, embarrassment of one's own appearance, rapid exhaustion due to functional limitation due to inactivity, safety concerns, and lack of enjoyment with movement, leading to lack of motivation. The extent of risk aversion due to the mentioned factors should be taken into consideration. A patient handout or an after‐visit summary outlining the behavior plan for physical activity as an exercise prescription will help improve adherence. This could be supplemented with additional resource links from validated websites such as the National Institute on Aging, Rethink Obesity, American College of Physicians, and video‐based resources to help improve adherence. Effectiveness of behavioral counseling could be enhanced when clinicians review the exercise and physical activity discussed and outlined at the prior visit and assess change, discuss barriers, and advise strategies to overcome struggles and change the exercise dose as appropriate. This would also help gauge adherence between visits and reinforce accountability. Modalities such as interpersonal support (using a health coach), digital support, tracking, provider check‐in, and health care guidance and recommendations could help ensure adherence to physical activity and reduction of sedentary time, although we currently lack prospective studies to show effectiveness. Sedentary behavior increases with aging, leading to a high prevalence among older adults with > 8.5 h/day spent sitting, which is more commonly seen in residential settings. A strong association of increased sedentary behavior and physical inactivity with obesity in older adults exists. Older adults with obesity often perceive exercise as a challenge; therefore, recommendations to improve light‐intensity physical activity with a goal of reducing sedentary time may derive health benefits.

### Interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1128gmKr]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality among older adults in the United States. In 2014, 28.7% of community-dwelling adults 65 years or older reported falling, resulting in 29 million falls (37.5% of which needed medical treatment or restricted activity for a day or longer) and an estimated 33 000 deaths in 2015.

Objective

To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on the prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls and fall-related morbidity and mortality in community-dwelling older adults 65 years or older who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

Findings

The USPSTF found adequate evidence that exercise interventions have a moderate benefit in preventing falls in older adults at increased risk for falls and that multifactorial interventions have a small benefit. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that vitamin D supplementation has no benefit in preventing falls in older adults. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of exercise and multifactorial interventions as no greater than small. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the overall harms of vitamin D supplementation are small to moderate.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer multifactorial interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk for falls. Existing evidence indicates that the overall net benefit of routinely offering multifactorial interventions to prevent falls is small. When determining whether this service is appropriate for an individual, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, presence of comorbid medical conditions, and the patient's values and preferences. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older. (D recommendation) These recommendations apply to community-dwelling adults who are not known to have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency.

### US physical activity guidelines: current state, impact and future directions [^115Jd3xD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Regular physical activity is one of the most powerful methods to lower the risk of all-cause mortality, help control multiple medical co-morbidities and improve overall quality of life. For optimal health it is recommended that adults obtain at least 150 min per week of moderate-intensity or 75 min per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week along with at least 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity. Despite the known health benefits of exercise and long-standing recommendations from major health, medical and fitness societies, only half of Americans meet these guidelines. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides an update from the 2008 guidelines adding specific recommendations for pre-school children while emphasizing the need to reduce sedentarism across the age spectrum ("move more and sit less"). This document provides a summary of the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans as well as the impact of inactivity on health and future directions to improve utilization.

### Exercise for falls prevention in community-dwelling older adults: trial and participant characteristics, interventions and bias in clinical trials from a systematic review [^114icHbZ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

This review identified the diversity of trials that evaluate the effect of exercise on falls in community-dwelling older people, in terms of participants' age and baseline fall risk, intervention type, duration and delivery mode. Implications for clinicians include implementing balance challenging exercise programmes, of adequate duration, in a setting optimal for the patient, with strategies to promote exercise uptake. Further research is needed regarding exercise for fall prevention in low-income countries and in males. Future trials should minimise bias, comply with reporting guidelines and report factors relevant to facilitating translation to clinical practice.

### Personalized multicomponent exercise programs using smartphone technology among older people: protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^115e9KAb]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) published the new evidence-based guidelines for exercise among adults aged ≥ 65, comprising 150–300 min of moderate-intensity, or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, per week, combined with ≥ three times a week of multicomponent physical activity that emphasizes functional balance and strength training at moderate or greater intensity. In order to optimize the benefits of these exercise guidelines across the wide and varied target population of older people, two major challenges must be addressed.

Firstly, the widening gap between chronological and biological age, which typifies advancing age, raises into question the benefits of general guidelines for a certain chronological age. The growing variability between biological and chronological age is well recognized in aging research, and highlights the dangers and inexactitude involved in chronological age determined standards and reference ranges. For example, modeling the relationship between numerus biological markers and an individual's chronological age raises questions about the nature of aging, as witnessed by the differential trajectories of age-related decline experienced by individuals with the same chronological age. Thus biological age should be assessed distinctly from chronological age.

### Promoting and prescribing exercise for the elderly [^1151vdK2]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Regular exercise provides a myriad of health benefits in older adults, including improvements in blood pressure, diabetes, lipid profile, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and neurocognitive function. Regular physical activity is also associated with decreased mortality and age-related morbidity in older adults. Despite this, up to 75 percent of older Americans are insufficiently active to achieve these health benefits. Few contraindications to exercise exist and almost all older persons can benefit from additional physical activity. The exercise prescription consists of three components: aerobic exercise, strength training, and balance and flexibility. Physicians play a key role in motivating older patients and advising them regarding their physical limitations and/or comorbidities. Motivating patients to begin exercise is best achieved by focusing on individual patient goals, concerns, and barriers to exercise. Strategies include the "stages of change" model, individualized behavioral therapy, and an active lifestyle. To increase long-term compliance, the exercise prescription should be straightforward, fun, and geared toward a patient's individual health needs, beliefs, and goals.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: guidance for prescribing exercise [^116d4M3C]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this Position Stand is to provide guidance to professionals who counsel and prescribe individualized exercise to apparently healthy adults of all ages. These recommendations also may apply to adults with certain chronic diseases or disabilities, when appropriately evaluated and advised by a health professional. This document supersedes the 1998 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand, "The Recommended Quantity and Quality of Exercise for Developing and Maintaining Cardiorespiratory and Muscular Fitness, and Flexibility in Healthy Adults". The scientific evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of exercise is indisputable, and the benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks in most adults. A program of regular exercise that includes cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor exercise training beyond activities of daily living to improve and maintain physical fitness and health is essential for most adults. The ACSM recommends that most adults engage in moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥ 30 min·d on ≥ 5 d·wk for a total of ≥ 150 min·wk, vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥ 20 min·d on ≥ 3 d·wk (≥ 75 min·wk), or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise to achieve a total energy expenditure of ≥ 500–1000 MET·min·wk. On 2–3 d·wk, adults should also perform resistance exercises for each of the major muscle groups, and neuromotor exercise involving balance, agility, and coordination. Crucial to maintaining joint range of movement, completing a series of flexibility exercises for each the major muscle-tendon groups (a total of 60 s per exercise) on ≥ 2 d·wk is recommended. The exercise program should be modified according to an individual's habitual physical activity, physical function, health status, exercise responses, and stated goals. Adults who are unable or unwilling to meet the exercise targets outlined here still can benefit from engaging in amounts of exercise less than recommended. In addition to exercising regularly, there are health benefits in concurrently reducing total time engaged in sedentary pursuits and also by interspersing frequent, short bouts of standing and physical activity between periods of sedentary activity, even in physically active adults. Behaviorally based exercise interventions, the use of behavior change strategies, supervision by an experienced fitness instructor, and exercise that is pleasant and enjoyable can improve adoption and adherence to prescribed exercise programs. Educating adults about and screening for signs and symptoms of CHD and gradual progression of exercise intensity and volume may reduce the risks of exercise. Consultations with a medical professional and diagnostic exercise testing for CHD are useful when clinically indicated but are not recommended for universal screening to enhance the safety of exercise.

### Exercise for falls prevention in aged care: systematic review and trial endpoint meta-analyses [^1173GWe7]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Exercise programmes can reduce falls in older people living in residential aged care.
Exercise has little or no lasting effect on falls after the end of a programme so it should be incorporated into routine ongoing care.
Exercises should include a combination of exercise types and be tailored, considering individual abilities and preferences.

### Summary of the updated American Geriatrics Society / British Geriatrics Society clinical practice guideline for prevention of falls in older persons [^1161ybar]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Customized exercise program — implementation and cautions: Because evidence supports that exercise in the form of resistance (strength) training and balance, gait, and coordination training is effective in reducing falls, the panel concluded that such exercise should be included as part of a multifactorial or multicomponent intervention and may be considered as a single intervention. In most positive trials, programs were at least 12 weeks (1–3 times per week) with variable intensity. Exercise programs should be initiated with caution because some studies have shown that exercise may increase the rate of falls in persons with limited mobility who are not accustomed to physical activity. Trials that included balance training as part of the intervention showed significant reduction in falls and other benefits.

### Stepping towards health: a scoping review of square-stepping exercise protocols and outcomes in older adults [^115DXjmy]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Population aging is a phenomenon occurring across the globe, with estimates from the World Health Organization indicating that by 2030, one in six individuals in the world will be aged 60 years or older. However, despite the increased life expectancy, the added years are not accompanied by increased health. Aging has long been recognized as a main risk factor for major debilitating and life-threatening conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. These conditions, profoundly impact independence, and quality of life of older adults.

Physical activity, particularly exercise training has been highly recommended for older adults, even in the presence of chronic diseases and conditions. Regular exercise participation has the potential to prevent or delay the onset of a wide range of chronic diseases and conditions common in old ages, as well as counteract most of the physiological, functional, and psychological declines associated with aging. Additionally, exercise training has been recommended to improve physical performance (e.g. muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness) and cognitive function (e.g. global cognitive and executive function) in older adults.

### Comparison of power training vs traditional strength training on physical function in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RnZaZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Strength training exercise is recommended for improving physical function in older adults. However, whether strength training (lifting and lowering weights under control) and power training (PT) (lifting weights fast and lowering under control) are associated with improved physical function in older adults is not clear.

Objective

To evaluate whether PT vs traditional strength training is associated with physical function improvement in older adults.

Data Sources

Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PEDro, and SPORTDiscus were conducted from database inception to October 20, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared strength training with instructions to move the weight as fast as possible in the lifting phase with traditional strength training in healthy, community-living older adults (age ≥ 60 years).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 2, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Summary effect size measures were calculated using a multilevel random-effects model with cluster robust variance estimation and are reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs). Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included physical function and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes included power, strength, muscle mass, walk speed, balance, and adverse effects.

Results

A total of 20 RCTs enrolling 566 community-living older adults (mean [SD] age, 70.1 [4.8] years; 368 [65%] women) were included. For the primary outcomes, PT was associated with an improvement in physical function with low-certainty evidence in 13 RCTs (n = 383) (SMD, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.05–0.54) and self-reported function with low-certainty evidence in 3 RCTs (n = 85) (SMD, 0.38; 95% CI, -0.62 to 1.37). The evidence was downgraded by 2 levels for high risk of bias and imprecision for physical function and very serious imprecision for self-reported physical function.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PT was associated with a modest improvement in physical function compared with traditional strength training in healthy, community-living older adults. However, high-quality, larger RCTs are required to draw more definitive conclusions.

### Design characteristics and inclusion of evidence-based exercise recommendation in fall prevention community exercise programs for older adults in Canada: a national descriptive self-report study [^111hqgZY]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The importance of preventing falls and associated injuries among older adults, many of whom live independently in community settings, is well-recognized. Extensive evidence highlights the role of exercise, specifically exercise that trains balance, in preventing falls in community-dwelling older adults. A 2017 systematic review of 283 randomized controlled trials (159,910 participants) concluded that exercise is likely the most effective intervention to reduce falls and associated injuries. Most recently, a 2019 Cochrane review of 108 fall prevention exercise studies (23,407 participants) demonstrated that balance exercise reduced the number of people falling by 13% and the rate of falls by 24%. Complementary meta-analyses examining the effects of specific exercise design characteristics on fall rates have informed the development of evidence-based exercise recommendations for fall prevention. These recommendations specify that exercise should 1) provide a high challenge to balance through reducing the base of support, moving the centre of mass and controlling body position while standing, and standing without arm support, 2) be conducted for at least three hours per week, and 3) be offered on an ongoing basis.

Community exercise programs – broadly defined as publicly or privately funded group programs that are easily accessible to people living within the community with the intention to promote the health and well-being of its members – are a potential delivery mode for implementing evidence-based fall prevention exercise recommendations. If community exercise programs include effective fall prevention exercise, they could influence the health of community-dwelling older adults. Globally, efforts have been made to identify fall prevention exercise resources and challenges associated with their implementation. For example, a 2010 Canadian report identified 282 fall prevention initiatives, 205 of which included exercise. In the United States, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention United States published a synthesis of effective fall prevention exercise programs for community-dwelling older adults. A 2019 Centre for Ageing Better report highlighted barriers to implementing community exercise programs for older adults across England, and associated strategies to overcome these. Although these reports provide valuable insight, detailed information on exercise design and content of existing community exercise programs has yet to be examined, thus highlighting an important gap in the literature. Although a 2019 Winnipeg, Manitoba self-report survey study which aimed to describe older adult community exercise program design found that most programs represented in the survey did not explicitly focus on fall prevention and did not include all exercise recommendations, the scope was limited to just one city in Canada.

### Cardiovascular disease in the older adult: where are we 4 decades later? [^111PQw26]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Preventive cardiology

Since the Bethesda Conference, dimensions of preventive cardiology have expanded to include concerns more meaningful to older adults with CVD. This includes cognitive and functional endpoints, as well as QOL, exercise tolerance, fatigue, falls, mood, and disability. Many apply the precept of 5 Ms to guide choices for personalized preventive management.

Heterogeneity of older adults is relevant; some preventive strategies may provide more value for some older adults than others. For example, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial suggested that stringent reduction of blood pressure (< 120 mm Hg) provided significant benefits (cardiovascular events, death, cognition), but with the tradeoff that iatrogenic risks increased (eg, syncope, kidney disease), which can mediate an increased risk of noncardiovascular death.

Guidelines are nuanced in their recommendations, with the 2018 cholesterol guideline recommending both the use in some cases and deprescription of statins in other cases for primary prevention in older adults with the same level of evidence and strength of recommendation.

Key insights on frailty have surged, providing a broad construct of health that can inform prognosis and/or therapeutic efficacy and guide approaches to CVD management. Some frail adults do better with therapeutics (sometimes frailty implies they get the greatest value), but others may benefit less.

Finally, as the field of geroscience matures, identifying consistent mechanistic cornerstones of aging (Figure 1), pharmacological agents that increase resilience to molecular, metabolic, genetic, and inflammatory aging alterations are actively being studied as a means to prevent age-related CVD as well as age-related frailty and vulnerability to other chronic disease.

Growing sophistication regarding geroscience has reinforced the rationale for exercise training and healthy lifestyle. In particular, aerobic exercise can increase resilience to aging hallmarks as well as cardiovascular benefits. Resistance training has complementary benefits for moderate sarcopenia and frailty.

### Exercise arrangement is associated with physical and mental health in older adults [^115sDGQt]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Regular physical activity (PA) confers a wide range of health benefits, such as lower rates of all-course mortality and noncommunicable diseases and higher levels of cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, in both younger and older adults. Among older adults, regular PA also helps protect against frailty, sarcopenia, and cognitive decline. Global recommendations and guidelines on PA for older adults include specific proposals regarding the type, amount, frequency, intensity, duration, and total activity level of PA that brings health benefits.

Compared with evidence with PA conditions, far fewer data are available regarding PA arrangement, such as group-based exercise (exercising with others) or exercising alone, especially among older adults. Eime et al. identified four modes of leisure time PA: individual, team (club), organized, and informal. Interestingly, their systematic review of data from adults showed consistent evidence that club- and team-based sport participation was associated with better psychological and social health, as compared with other, individual forms of PA. Thus, among younger adults, robust evidence indicates that group-based sports and exercise participation yield psychosocial benefits.

To our knowledge, only four observational studies have directly compared the effects of exercising alone and exercising with others on health benefits among older adults. These studies reported that exercising with others was associated with significantly better mental health (MH) and subjective health status, lower risk of depression, and fewer falls than exercising alone. However, most of these studies reported psychological benefits only, and research on the relations of exercise arrangement with health benefits for older adults is at an early stage. A previous meta-analysis showed that participation in walking groups was more effective in PA promotion among older adults than among younger adults; thus, exercising with others may contribute to meeting recommended PA levels in older adults. However, although exercising with others may have positive effects on physical or functional variables, no study of older adults has comprehensively examined the effects of exercise arrangement on both physical health and MH.
