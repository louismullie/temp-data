## Question

Medication help auditory hallcinaion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medication for auditory hallucinations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic context and whether antipsychotics are appropriate. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic choices and dosing principles. Next, I will review treatment-resistant pathways, including clozapine and augmentation. After that, I need to examine non-pharmacologic options like CBT, AVATAR therapy, and neuromodulation. I should also consider special populations such as older adults, children, and those with neurodegenerative disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight safety monitoring and key takeaways, making sure I double-check any claims that might be overstated or under-supported by the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame, because I need to ensure we are not overgeneralizing antipsychotic use to all voice-hearers. Auditory hallucinations occur across diagnoses and even in some nonclinical populations, so antipsychotics are most appropriate when hallucinations are part of a psychotic disorder or when distress and functional impairment warrant pharmacotherapy; otherwise, nonpharmacologic approaches may be preferred, especially in isolated auditory hallucinations without broader psychosis, and in children where most cases are not psychotic and antipsychotics are reserved for a minority [^116KfgP4] [^113KLYBJ] [^116reCLn].

> Now, I should verify first-line pharmacologic treatment. Antipsychotic medications remain the cornerstone for treating auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, with dopamine D2 receptor blockade as the principal mechanism; typical and atypical agents reduce positive symptoms, though individual response varies and side-effect profiles differ, so selection should be individualized and pragmatic, balancing efficacy with metabolic, extrapyramidal, and sedation risks [^112uHKDR] [^111u5GdJ].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy among antipsychotics for hallucinations specifically. I initially thought haloperidol might be slightly inferior for hallucinations compared with second-generation agents, but I should double-check that claim; the review suggesting inferiority is lower-credibility, whereas broader evidence indicates broadly similar efficacy across several SGAs, with clozapine reserved for treatment resistance, so I should not overstate haloperidol's inferiority and instead emphasize class effects and patient-specific tolerability [^115b8oTW] [^112uHKDR].

> I need to ensure dosing principles are sound. For older adults, start low and go slow due to sensitivity to antipsychotics and fall risk; monitor for orthostasis, sedation, and QT prolongation, and consider nighttime dosing for sedating agents. For first-episode psychosis, early, continuous antipsychotic treatment reduces relapse risk, and depot formulations can mitigate adherence problems; if there is inadequate improvement after 2–4 weeks at a therapeutic dose, switching rather than endless dose escalation is reasonable [^1177xeb4] [^115b8oTW] [^11399zHL].

> Next, I should review treatment-resistant pathways. Clozapine is the gold standard after failure of two adequate antipsychotic trials, with about 60% response in refractory cases; therapeutic plasma levels above roughly 350–450 ng/mL are often targeted for maximal effect, though I should confirm that range is supported and note that monitoring is essential given agranulocytosis risk and mandatory blood counts [^112uHKDR] [^115b8oTW].

> Hold on, I should verify augmentation strategies when clozapine is insufficient. Combining antipsychotics with complementary receptor profiles can be considered in select cases, for example adding a D2 partial agonist to clozapine or using combinations like aripiprazole with loxapine, but evidence is limited and heterogeneous; augmentation should be cautious, monitored closely, and de-prescribed if ineffective, given polypharmacy risks [^113DagwT] [^112uHKDR].

> Let me consider non-pharmacologic treatments, because I need to ensure we are not overlooking effective psychosocial interventions. CBT for psychosis yields modest but meaningful improvements in positive symptoms and distress, with durable effects in some trials, and AVATAR therapy has shown superiority to supportive counseling in reducing voice severity in randomized trials; these therapies can be combined with medication and may be especially valuable for persistent voices and for patients prioritizing coping and distress reduction over symptom elimination [^113zY8wA] [^114BSARz] [^1111wGn4].

> I should double-check neuromodulation evidence, since results are mixed and evolving. Low-frequency left temporoparietal rTMS has signal for reducing medication-resistant auditory hallucinations in some studies, including a recent high-quality trial showing sustained improvements in frequency and salience, but earlier meta-analyses and reviews highlight heterogeneity, small samples, and low-to-very-low certainty; bilateral continuous theta burst stimulation has also shown benefit in a phase 3 multicenter trial, suggesting a viable option when antipsychotics are insufficient, though replication and standardization remain important [^115UDAz9] [^114n74cx] [^11628XS3].

> But wait, what about tDCS and other tES modalities. Small studies and meta-analyses show inconsistent results for tDCS in refractory auditory hallucinations; some randomized trials suggest benefit while others do not, and a recent meta-analysis found no significant advantage over sham, so tDCS should be considered experimental and, if used, within research or carefully selected clinical contexts with informed consent about uncertain efficacy [^112ZvfKe] [^114zQEM3] [^113v1s2t].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with older adults. In dementia and neurodegenerative disorders, hallucinations often reflect cholinergic deficits and may respond better to cholinesterase inhibitors than to antipsychotics; antipsychotics carry increased mortality and stroke risk in dementia, so they should be avoided if possible or used at the lowest effective dose with explicit risk–benefit discussions and attempts to taper if stable [^1177xeb4] [^113LA9gf].

> Let me reconsider children and adolescents. Most help-seeking youth with auditory hallucinations do not meet strict psychosis criteria, and antipsychotics are reserved for the minority with a bona fide psychotic disorder; psychoeducation, coping strategies, and trauma-informed care are first-line, and medication decisions should be conservative and diagnosis-driven [^113KLYBJ] [^116reCLn].

> I should confirm substance-related hallucinations. In alcohol withdrawal psychosis, benzodiazepines are first-line and antipsychotics may be added as adjuncts; in opioid-induced hallucinations, reducing or rotating the opioid and adding antipsychotics can be effective; and in Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic agents can precipitate hallucinations, so medication review and dose reduction are essential before adding antipsychotics, with quetiapine or clozapine preferred if needed due to lower extrapyramidal risk [^115KAKnm] [^112TpfVc] [^112AD84D].

> Next, I should review safety monitoring and practical pearls. Before prescribing, screen for medical contributors and offending drugs, obtain baseline vitals, ECG when indicated, metabolic labs, and document target symptoms and functional goals; during treatment, reassess every 2–4 weeks early on, monitor for metabolic effects, movement disorders, sedation, and QTc changes, and consider depots for adherence; in older adults, prioritize fall risk mitigation and use the lowest effective dose with periodic attempts to minimize or discontinue if clinically safe [^1177xeb4] [^115b8oTW] [^11399zHL].

> Hold on, I should verify the synthesis into a practical algorithm. Start with a careful diagnostic assessment and psychoeducation, initiate an antipsychotic tailored to comorbidities and side-effect risk, optimize dose and duration, and if inadequate response after 2–4 weeks, switch within class or across classes; after two adequate trials, move to clozapine with therapeutic drug monitoring; if clozapine is inadequate, consider augmentation or neuromodulation such as rTMS or cTBS where available, and integrate CBT or AVATAR therapy throughout to reduce distress and improve coping; at each step, reassess diagnosis, adherence, substance use, and medical contributors before escalating [^112uHKDR] [^115b8oTW] [^113zY8wA].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are balanced and evidence-aligned. Antipsychotics remain first-line for psychosis-associated auditory hallucinations, clozapine is the anchor for treatment resistance, psychosocial therapies meaningfully reduce distress and can be combined with medication, and neuromodulation offers a promising but still maturing adjunct for refractory cases; individualized care, vigilant safety monitoring, and iterative reassessment of risks, benefits, and patient preferences are essential to optimize outcomes [^112uHKDR] [^114BSARz] [^115UDAz9].

Antipsychotics are the **first-line pharmacologic treatment** for auditory hallucinations, with second-generation agents (e.g. risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole) preferred for their favorable side-effect profiles [^112uHKDR]. Clozapine is the **gold standard for treatment-resistant cases** [^112uHKDR] [^115b8oTW]. If antipsychotics are insufficient, consider adjunctive **rTMS** [^1176xNfg] or **tDCS** [^115YaVkH]. Benzodiazepines may be used short-term for acute distress or agitation, but not as primary therapy. Treatment should be individualized, with close monitoring for side effects and adherence [^11399zHL].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatment

Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone of treatment for auditory hallucinations, particularly in schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^112uHKDR]. They reduce hallucination severity and frequency, especially positive symptoms [^115b8oTW].

---

### Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs)

SGAs are preferred due to a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and a favorable side-effect profile [^112uHKDR]. Commonly used SGAs include:

| **Medication** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|
| Risperidone | - Effective in reducing auditory hallucinations <br/> - Monitor for hyperprolactinemia and metabolic side effects [^notfound] |
| Olanzapine | - Effective <br/> - Monitor for significant weight gain and metabolic syndrome [^notfound] |
| Quetiapine | - Effective <br/> - Lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms <br/> - Monitor for sedation and metabolic effects [^notfound] |
| Aripiprazole | - Partial dopamine agonist <br/> - Lower risk of metabolic side effects <br/> - Monitor for akathisia [^notfound] |

---

### First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs)

FGAs (e.g. haloperidol) are effective but have a higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia; reserve them for cases in which SGAs are contraindicated or ineffective [^notfound].

---

## Treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations

Approximately 25–30% of patients experience persistent auditory hallucinations despite adequate antipsychotic treatment [^115YaVkH]. For these patients, **alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies** are recommended [^115b8oTW].

---

### Clozapine

Clozapine is the **gold standard** for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, including persistent auditory hallucinations [^112uHKDR]. It is effective in approximately 60% of treatment-resistant cases but requires regular blood monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis [^112uHKDR].

---

### Augmentation strategies

Augmentation with a second antipsychotic (e.g. aripiprazole, risperidone) may be considered for partial responders to clozapine or other antipsychotics [^113zY8wA]. Evidence is limited; careful monitoring for side effects is required [^113zY8wA].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as adjuncts, particularly for treatment-resistant cases or when medication is contraindicated [^113yaibD].

---

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)

rTMS, particularly low-frequency stimulation of the left temporoparietal cortex, has **moderate evidence** for reducing auditory hallucinations [^114n74cx]. It is generally well tolerated, with mild headaches being the most common side effect [^114pxAkT].

---

### Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)

tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique with **preliminary evidence** for reducing auditory hallucinations [^115YaVkH]. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to establish its efficacy [^112ZvfKe].

---

### Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT, particularly CBT for psychosis (CBTp), is effective in reducing distress and improving coping strategies associated with auditory hallucinations [^115b8oTW]. It is recommended as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment [^115b8oTW].

---

## Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam, diazepam) may be used short-term for acute distress or agitation associated with auditory hallucinations. They are not recommended as primary treatment due to risks of dependence, sedation, and cognitive impairment.

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Regular monitoring**: Patients should be regularly monitored for side effects, adherence, and clinical response [^112uHKDR].
- **Individualized treatment**: Treatment should be tailored based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and side-effect profiles [^112uHKDR].
- **Patient education**: Educating patients and caregivers about medication side effects and adherence is essential for optimal outcomes [^111u5GdJ].

---

Antipsychotic medications are the **primary pharmacological treatment** for auditory hallucinations, with SGAs preferred for their favorable side-effect profiles [^112uHKDR]. Clozapine is the gold standard for treatment-resistant cases, and non-pharmacological interventions such as rTMS, tDCS, and CBT are recommended as adjuncts. Benzodiazepines may be used short-term for acute distress but are not recommended as primary therapy.

### The treatment of hallucinations in schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^115b8oTW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

This article reviews the treatment of hallucinations in schizophrenia. The first treatment option for hallucinations in schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can induce a rapid decrease in severity. Only 8% of first-episode patients still experience mild to moderate hallucinations after continuing medication for 1 year. Olanzapine, amisulpride, ziprasidone, and quetiapine are equally effective against hallucinations, but haloperidol may be slightly inferior. If the drug of first choice provides inadequate improvement, it is probably best to switch medication after 2–4 weeks of treatment. Clozapine is the drug of choice for patients who are resistant to 2 antipsychotic agents. Blood levels should be above 350–450 μg/ml for maximal effect. For relapse prevention, medication should be continued in the same dose. Depot medication should be considered for all patients because nonadherence is high. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be applied as an augmentation to antipsychotic medication. The success of CBT depends on the reduction of catastrophic appraisals, thereby reducing the concurrent anxiety and distress. CBT aims at reducing the emotional distress associated with auditory hallucinations and develops new coping strategies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is capable of reducing the frequency and severity of auditory hallucinations. Several meta-analyses found significantly better symptom reduction for low-frequency repetitive TMS as compared with placebo. Consequently, TMS currently has the status of a potentially useful treatment method for auditory hallucinations, but only in combination with state of the art antipsychotic treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered a last resort for treatment-resistant psychosis. Although several studies showed clinical improvement, a specific reduction in hallucination severity has never been demonstrated.

### Auditory hallucinations, not necessarily a hallmark of psychotic disorder [^116KfgP4]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations (AH) are often considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. This is promoted by the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorder (OSSSOPD), the diagnostic criteria for which are fulfilled with the sole presence of persistent AH, in the absence of any other psychotic symptoms. And yet, persistent AH are not synonymous with having a psychotic disorder, and should therefore not be uncritically treated as such. Many people who seek treatment for persistent AH have no other psychotic symptoms, have preserved reality-testing capacities, and will never develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Instead, hallucinations may be the result of many different causes, including borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, sleep disorders or brain lesions, and they may even occur outside the context of any demonstrable pathology. In such cases, the usage of the DSM-5 diagnosis of OSSSOPD would be incorrect, and it may prompt unwarranted treatment with antipsychotic medication. We therefore argue that a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (or any other type of psychotic disorder) characterized by AH should require at least one more symptom listed under the A-criterion (i.e. delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior or negative symptoms). Adhering to these more stringent criteria may help to distinguish between individuals with persistent AH which are part of a psychotic disorder, for whom antipsychotic medication may be helpful, and individuals with AH in the absence of such a disorder who may benefit from other approaches (e.g. different pharmacological interventions, improving coping style, trauma-related therapy).

### A review of multimodal hallucinations: categorization, assessment, theoretical perspectives, and clinical recommendations [^113T7HjK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

The clinical understanding of hallucinations has primarily focused on the auditory modality (exemplified by the fact that most interventions are predominantly for AHs), with limited considerations of other modalities or of MMHs.

Nevertheless, preliminary data indicate that MMHs are linked to higher levels of adverse mental health outcomes, being perceived as more distressing, frightening, and more veridical than unimodal hallucinations. For serial MMHs, related phenomena can make hallucinations appear to have the power to affect the person in different ways: for instance, tactile sensations or visions that are meaningfully connected to a disembodied voice can contribute to beliefs that a voice has power over the individual.

One should consider whether multimodal experiences are connected temporally (eg, "Do you usually see them when they are talking? Do you see them without hearing them?") because it would be of relevance in formulating how hallucinations impact on distress. In psychological interventions, clarifying the temporal sequencing of hallucinatory experiences in different modalities may inform how these episodes unfold over time. For instance, the beliefs that people hold about how different hallucinations are interconnected may be targets for cognitive therapy methods. Furthermore, assessing a person's response to the first hallucinatory episode, and their potential expectation for related experiences to occur, may indicate points of intervention via alternative coping strategies.

Finally, we need to evaluate if MMHs lead to poorer outcomes in treatment trials and research the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication for MMHs compared to unimodal ones. This is for 2 reasons: first, whilst antipsychotic medications have a broad effect on psychotic symptoms, and no drugs specifically target hallucinations, it is not known whether medication may differentially affect MMHs vs unimodal experiences within subjects. This is an area for further research. Second, given the role that antipsychotics have in the management of patients' potential distress caused by hallucinations (which is often what differentiates clinical from nonclinical cases), it is important to extend the investigation of such efficacy beyond unimodal experiences and to the distress experienced by those specifically with MMHs.

### Psychological therapies for auditory hallucinations (voices): current status and key directions for future research [^113yaibD]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The International Consortium for Hallucinations Research (ICHR) was set up to promote international collaborations on key areas of research related to auditory hallucinations. This article reports on the findings of a working group reviewing psychological therapies for hallucinations to identify key directions in future research. Psychological therapies are widely recommended in clinical practice guidelines as part of the treatment for people who experience psychotic phenomena, particularly for those with medication-refractory psychotic experiences. While previous reviews have considered psychological therapies for psychosis broadly, including recent reviews of practice, outcomes, new developments, and implementation issues, no recent reviews have focused on therapies for hallucinations. Yet, hallucinations, particularly in the form of hearing voices, are a frequent source of distress and interference with functioning, resulting in them being a major target of psychological therapies for psychosis. This article considers issues specific to psychological interventions for hallucinations, with a focus on the phenomenon of hearing voices: hallucinatory experiences involving hearing speech, often with the impression of this being generated by another identity. Although a broad spectrum of hallucinatory phenomena arise across a range of populations (including nonclinical), we have focused on hearing voices because, as well as this being the most frequent hallucinatory phenomenon encountered in psychotic disorders, voices have been the usual focus of therapies for hallucinations described in the literature to date. This review considers current approaches to research on therapies for voices, limitations in existing research in informing the outcomes of therapy and specific therapy processes, and sets out priorities for ongoing research in this area.

### Schizophrenia [^111u5GdJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 0.7% and incidence rates vary between 7.7 and 43.0 per 100,000; about 75% of people have relapses and continued disability, and one third fail to respond to standard treatment. Positive symptoms include auditory hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder. Negative symptoms (demotivation, self-neglect, and reduced emotion) have not been consistently improved by any treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for positive, negative, or cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia? What are the effects of drug treatments in people with schizophrenia who are resistant to standard antipsychotic drugs? What are the effects of interventions to improve adherence to antipsychotic medication in people with schizophrenia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 51 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: amisulpride, chlorpromazine, clozapine, depot haloperidol decanoate, haloperidol, olanzapine, pimozide, quetiapine, risperidone, sulpiride, ziprasidone, zotepine, aripiprazole, sertindole, paliperidone, flupentixol, depot flupentixol decanoate, zuclopenthixol, depot zuclopenthixol decanoate, behavioural therapy, clozapine, compliance therapy, first-generation antipsychotic drugs in treatment-resistant people, multiple-session family interventions, psychoeducational interventions, and second-generation antipsychotic drugs in treatment-resistant people.

### Psychological therapies for auditory hallucinations (voices): current status and key directions for future research [^116AoGDH]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Empirical Findings for Psychological Interventions for Voices

The effects of psychological therapies for voices have most frequently been evaluated by examining the efficacy of CBTp, as an adjunct to routine care (including antipsychotic medication), on the overall severity of positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions combined). Despite symptom severity providing quite an indirect index of adaptation to psychosis, and differences in trials included, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are consistent in demonstrating evidence for beneficial but modest effects of CBTp on measures of positive symptoms (posttreatment between-group effect sizes ranging from 0.25 to 0.47). Methodological differences in trials, such as blinding, may moderate positive symptom effect sizes. There may also be smaller magnitude effects when compared with control therapies as opposed to TAU(although these effect sizes did not significantly differ in a recent meta-analysis), but it is likely that control therapies contain more therapeutic elements than a true placeboand a recent large meta-analysis indicated advantages of CBTp over any active control condition.

### Children seeking help for auditory verbal hallucinations; who are they? [^113KLYBJ]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Auditory Verbal Hallucinations (AVH) in children and adolescents are a relatively common and mostly transient feature in community samples. However, it should not be regarded as a merely benign phenomenon, as childhood AVH are associated with psychopathology. Little is known about the clinical group of children seeking help for AVH. This brings uncertainty on how to assess and treat these children.

Methods

This study describes the characteristics of 95 help-seeking children (aged 6 to 18years) with AVH attending an outpatient clinic specifically dedicated to help youth with this complaint. We aim to provide pointers regarding diagnostic assessment and interventions.

Results

Children seeking help for AVH suffered from a diversity of co morbid psychiatric diagnoses and consistently experienced high stress from AVH. When the DSM-IV-TR criteria for psychotic disorder NOS were used, all 95 children obtained this diagnosis. However, when a psychotic disorder was defined using the A-criterion of schizophrenia, only a minority of 11 cases (11.6%) was diagnosed as having a psychotic disorder. All children were in need of psycho-education and coping strategies and only the minority (11.6%) fulfilling criteria for a more narrowly defined psychotic disorder was prescribed antipsychotic medication.

Conclusions

Children seeking help for AVH form a heterogeneous group with high stress and reduced functioning. Even though only a minority (11.6%) suffers from a psychotic disorder, all children warrant clinical care due to their burden and multi morbid psychopathology.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for schizophrenia [^114n74cx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms which fail to fully respond to antipsychotic medication. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been proposed as a new treatment for people with schizophrenia, especially those who experience persistent auditory hallucinations.

Objectives

To estimate the effects of TMS alone, compared with sham TMS or with 'standard management' and any other comparison interventions in reducing psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (June 2006, June 2008, April 2013). This register is compiled by methodical searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Dissertation abstracts, LILACS, PSYNDEX, PsycINFO, RUSSMED, and Sociofile, and is supplemented with handsearching of relevant journals and numerous conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials recruiting at least five participants and comparing TMS with sham TMS or any other treatment for people with schizophrenia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model. We assessed overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 41 studies with 1473 participants in the review. We found significant differences in favour of temporoparietal TMS compared to sham TMS for global state measured on the CGI scale (7 RCTs, n = 224, MD -0.5, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.23, very low-quality evidence) and positive symptoms measured on the PANSS scale (5 RCTs, n = 127, MD -6.09, 95% CI -10.95 to -1.22, very low-quality evidence). Participants experienced significantly more headaches in the temporoparietal TMS group (10 RCTs, n = 392, RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.50, very low-quality evidence). However, no more participants left the study early from the TMS group than from the sham group (very low-quality evidence). Cognitive state was assessed using 39 different measures, and all were equivocal (very low-quality evidence). We included only two trials which compared temporoparietal TMS with standard treatment. In both trials the participants received first- and second-generation antipsychotic medication in both treatment groups, therefore TMS was used an adjunctive therapy to medication. We found no significant differences in the number of participants that showed clinical improvement in global state (1 RCT, n = 100, RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.57) or left the study early (2 RCTs, n = 140, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.46) (both very low-quality evidence). No studies reported on global state score, mental state, cognitive state and adverse effects. For prefrontal TMS compared to sham TMS, global state was measured on three different scales, all of which presented equivocal results (very low quality evidence). We could not pool data for mental state on the PANSS scale due to high heterogeneity. Cognitive state was assessed using 19 different measures, with 15/19 being equivocal (very low-quality evidence). Prefrontal TMS caused more headaches (6 RCTs, n = 164, RR 2.77, 95% CI 1.22 to 6.26, very low-quality evidence) but there was no difference in the number of participants leaving the study early (very low-quality evidence). No studies reported data for clinical improvement. We found a significant difference in favour of prefrontal theta burst stimulation TMS compared to sham TMS for mental state on the PANNS scale (3 RCTs, n = 108, MD -5.71, 95% CI -9.32 to -2.10, very low evidence). We found no difference for clinical improvement, cognitive state, number of headaches, and leaving the study early (very low-quality evidence). None of the included studies reported satisfaction with care.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this review, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of TMS to treat symptoms of schizophrenia. Although some evidence suggests that TMS, and in particular temporoparietal TMS, may improve certain symptoms (such as auditory hallucinations and positive symptoms of schizophrenia) compared to sham TMS, the results were not robust enough to be unequivocal across the assessment measures used. There was insufficient evidence to suggest any added benefit with TMS used as an adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medication. The overall quality of evidence was graded as very low due to risk of bias, and this was accompanied by an imprecision in estimates due to the relatively small number of participants in the studies. Thus, consideration is required in improving the quality of trial processes, as well as the quality of reporting of ongoing and future TMS trials, so as to facilitate accurate future judgements in assessing risk of bias. Differences in TMS techniques in relation to stimulation intensity, stimulation length, brain areas stimulated and variations in the design of sham TMS all contributed to the heterogeneity of study findings and limited the interpretation and applicability of the results. In addition, the trials assessed their outcomes with a variety of scales, and usable data were limited. Therefore, to better evaluate the treatment effects of TMS in people with schizophrenia, we favour the use of standardised treatment protocols and outcome measures.

### Prediction of relapse after discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment in Alzheimer's disease: the role of hallucinations [^112FGFyD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

In Alzheimer's disease, antipsychotic medications are often used for a period, with relief of symptoms, and then discontinued, after which relapse may occur. The authors sought to determine which neuropsychiatric symptoms predict relapse.

Method

In the Antipsychotic Discontinuation in Alzheimer's Disease trial, 180 patients with Alzheimer's disease and symptoms of agitation or psychosis were treated with risperidone for 16 weeks, after which patients who responded (N = 110) were randomly assigned to continue risperidone for 32 weeks, to continue risperidone for 16 weeks followed by switch to placebo for 16 weeks, or to receive placebo for 32 weeks. As reported previously, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with a two- to fourfold increased risk of relapse over 16–32 weeks. In planned post hoc analyses, the authors examined associations between the 12 symptom domains in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and relapse in the first 16-week phase after randomization.

Results

Compared with patients with mild hallucinations or no hallucinations, patients with severe hallucinations as a presenting symptom at baseline had a higher likelihood of relapse (hazard ratio = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.52, 5.76). This effect was present for the subgroup with auditory hallucinations, but not the subgroup with visual hallucinations. Among patients with baseline hallucinations, 13 of 17 (76.5%) who discontinued risperidone relapsed, compared with 10 of 26 (38.5%) who continued risperidone (p < 0.02). This group difference remained significant for severe (77.8%) compared with mild (36%) hallucinations. NPI domain scores after the initial open-treatment phase were not associated with relapse.

Conclusions

Patients with severe baseline hallucinations were more likely to relapse after randomization, and the presence of baseline hallucinations was associated with a higher risk of relapse after discontinuation of risperidone compared with continued risperidone treatment. For patients with hallucinations, particularly auditory hallucinations, antipsychotic discontinuation should be approached cautiously because of high relapse risk.

### Report on the inaugural meeting of the international consortium on hallucination research: a clinical and research update and 16 consensus-set goals for future research [^111bpm8R]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

This article presents a report on the first meeting of the International Consortium on Hallucination Research, which took place on September 13–14, 2011 at the Institute of Psychiatry, London. The first day of the meeting served to reflect on the current state of knowledge regarding auditory hallucinations in different diagnostic groups, based on the presentations from the phenomenology, cognition, emotion, electrophysiology, neurochemical, neuroimaging, genetics, treatment, and computational modeling working groups. The second day comprised a discussion forum where the most important and urgent questions for future research were identified. The meeting recognized that a lot has been achieved in auditory hallucination research but that much still remains to be done. Here, we outline the top 16 goals for research on auditory hallucinations, which cover topics of conceptual importance, academic and treatment issues, scientific rigor, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Concerted and coordinated actions will be required to make substantial research progress.

### Auditory verbal hallucinations: neuroimaging and treatment [^111HbEAk]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a frequently occurring phenomenon in the general population and are considered a psychotic symptom when presented in the context of a psychiatric disorder. Neuroimaging literature has shown that AVH are subserved by a variety of alterations in brain structure and function, which primarily concentrate around brain regions associated with the processing of auditory verbal stimuli and with executive control functions. However, the direction of association between AVH and brain function remains equivocal in certain research areas and needs to be carefully reviewed and interpreted. When AVH have significant impact on daily functioning, several efficacious treatments can be attempted such as antipsychotic medication, brain stimulation and cognitive-behavioural therapy. Interestingly, the neural correlates of these treatments largely overlap with brain regions involved in AVH. This suggests that the efficacy of treatment corresponds to a normalization of AVH-related brain activity. In this selected review, we give a compact yet comprehensive overview of the structural and functional neuroimaging literature on AVH, with a special focus on the neural correlates of efficacious treatment.

### Schizophrenia (maintenance treatment) [^11399zHL]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One in a hundred people will develop schizophrenia; about 75% of people have relapses and continued disability, and a third fail to respond to standard treatment. Positive symptoms include auditory hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder. Negative symptoms (demotivation, self-neglect, and reduced emotion) have not been consistently improved by any treatment.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: Which interventions reduce relapse; and improve adherence rates? Which interventions are effective in people resistant to standard antipsychotic drugs? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 45 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: behavioural therapy, clozapine, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), compliance therapy, continuation of antipsychotic drugs (reduce relapse rates), first-generation antipsychotic drugs in treatment-resistant people, multiple-session family interventions, psychoeducational interventions, second-generation antipsychotic drugs in treatment-resistant people, and social-skills training.

### A review of functional and structural neuroimaging studies to investigate the inner speech model of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia [^117SxtkC]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, in sensitivity analyses, studies were excluded if the use of anti-psychotics was significantly different between hallucinators and non-hallucinators, given severity of illness (and hence persistent hallucinations) could be confounded by higher antipsychotic dose, and there is the potential for medication to effect brain structure. Nevertheless, if anti-psychotics had induced remission in those defined as hallucinators, structural brain changes contributing to the experience of AVHs may no longer be present. Yet, in the DTI meta-analyses, 223 out of the 267 hallucinators had ongoing AVHs at the time of scanning — the majority despite anti-psychotic medication. Therefore, if structural brain changes are related to AVHs, these effects should have persisted in the majority of hallucinators– irrespective of anti-psychotic use. The numbers are less clear for the VBM studies. However, at least 41 out of the 111 hallucinators included in the comparison to non-hallucinators had ongoing AVHs at the time of scanning — again, the majority despite anti-psychotic medication. To minimise the risk of anti-psychotics affecting structural neuroimaging findings, comparing medication naïve hallucinators and non-hallucinators would be optimal — yet challenging, as effective treatment cannot be delayed to acquire such data. Thus, comparing hallucinators (with active AVHs) and non-hallucinations, who both have minimal antipsychotic exposure may be the most pragmatic approach.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^1127BZkK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Whilst our understanding, assessment, and treatment of hallucinations in older adults have improved in the last decade, greater priority needs to be given to communicating these advances to clinicians so that clinical care can be grounded in the best available evidence. The International Consortium of Hallucinations Research Working Group on Hallucinations in Older Adults was set up to respond to this challenge. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to highlight the key issues for the workforce caring for older adults with hallucinations; critically review current assessment tools, management guidelines, and treatment approaches for this population; and offer recommendations and resources to support best practice.

### Treating auditory hallucinations with transcranial direct current stimulation in a double-blind, randomized trial [^113v1s2t]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could be a treatment option for medication-resistant auditory hallucinations (AH), but so far results have been inconclusive, and large sample trials have been missing. This study used tDCS as a treatment method for these hallucinations in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a relatively large sample size.

Methods

Fifty-four patients of several diagnostic categories with medication-resistant AH were randomized and treated during 10 sessions of 20 min each, with either 2 mA tDCS or placebo, administered on five consecutive days (i.e., two sessions per day). Anodal stimulation was targeted at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cathodal stimulation at the left temporoparietal junction. AH severity was assessed using the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS). Other outcome measures were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Stroop, and the Trail Making Test.

Results

AH frequency and severity decreased significantly over time, as did the scores on the total and general subscales of the PANSS. However, there was no significant interaction effect with the treatment group on any of the main outcome measures.

Conclusions

We found no evidence that tDCS is more effective for medication-resistant AH than placebo, even though AH frequency and severity decreased in both groups. An alternative strategy may be to offer tDCS at an earlier stage of illness. In the light of recent investigations into the neurophysiological mechanisms behind tDCS, we may also have to consider the possibility that tDCS is not able to induce any long-lasting brain changes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115KAKnm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder — recommendations and pharmacotherapy signals: Recommendation VI.22 states, "If available and applicable, existing institutional/hospital-associated delirium protocols can be used for supportive care of patients with an alcohol-induced psychotic disorder", Recommendation VI.23 states, "The treatment of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder may require consultation with a psychiatrist", and Recommendation VI.24 states, "The treatment of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder may require addition of antipsychotics". Symptoms of alcohol-induced psychosis consist of auditory hallucinations and possibly visual hallucinations and delusions, there is no established pharmacotherapy, but a randomized controlled trial of 50 patients showed diazepam to be effective at reducing hallucinations compared to placebo, and the Guideline Committee rated diazepam as an appropriate medication for the treatment of alcohol-induced psychosis while also concluding that it may be necessary to treat these patients with an additional antipsychotic medications to alleviate the symptoms. Patients experiencing alcohol-induced psychosis are at risk of developing acute delirium while in the inpatient setting and appropriate hospital-associated delirium protocols should be implemented, if available, to reduce the risk of delirium and associated health outcomes.

### High frequency rTMS; a more effective treatment for auditory verbal hallucinations? [^111khc3k]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

The great majority of studies on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a therapeutic tool for auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) have used 1-Hz stimulation with inconsistent results. Recently, it has been suggested that 20-Hz rTMS has strong therapeutic effects. It is conceivable that this 20-Hz stimulation is more effective than 1-Hz stimulation. The aim of this preliminary study is to investigate the efficacy of 20-Hz rTMS compared with 1-Hz rTMS as a treatment for AVH. Eighteen schizophrenia patients with medication-resistant AVH were randomized over two treatment groups. Each group received either 20 min of 1-Hz rTMS or 13 trains of 20-Hz rTMS daily over 1 week. After week 1, patients received a follow-up treatment once a week for 3 weeks. Stimulation location was based on individual AVH-related activation patterns identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Severity of AVH was monitored with the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS). Both groups showed a decrease in AVH after week 1 of rTMS. This decrease was significant for the 20-Hz group and the 1-Hz group. When the two treatment types were compared, no treatment type was superior. Based on these results we cannot conclude whether high frequency rTMS is more effective against AVH than is traditional 1-Hz rTMS. More research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters and to investigate potential target locations for stimulation.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZvfKe]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Through imaging studies, a significant increase in cerebral activity has been detected in fronto-temporal areas in patients experiencing auditory verbal hallucinations. Therefore, non-invasive neuromodulation, in particular transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has been considered as a therapeutic intervention for medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. We aimed to synthesize results from randomized trials on either rTMS or tDCS versus placebo in patients with schizophrenia by including five recently published trials in the field. A systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant literature was conducted. Studies were included on the basis of pre-defined selection criteria. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials. RevMan 5.3 was used to conduct the statistical analysis. Including 465 and 960 patients, respectively, 12 tDCS and 27 rTMS studies were included. Regarding treatment of medication refractory auditory verbal hallucinations, no significant effect of tDCS (-0.23 [-0.49, 0.02], p = 0.08) or rTMS (-0.19 [-0.50, 0,11], p = 0.21) was found compared to sham in this meta-analysis. The current study found that it cannot be concluded that rTMS and tDCS are efficacious in treating medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations. Larger randomized controlled tDCS trials of a higher quality should be conducted in the future to establish substantial evidence of tDCS. The interventions appear safe and may have beneficial effects on other outcomes.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^111BUjLk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Management and Treatment Approaches

Current guidelines and treatment recommendations are largely based on expert consensus. The focus is typically on the overall management of a specific clinical condition, with hallucinations one of the symptoms covered, eg, NICE Guidelines for Parkinson's disease. To date, few guidelines have focused on hallucinations specifically (eg,) and the forthcoming SHAPED (Study of Hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, Eye disease, and Dementia) consensus guidelines will be the first to focus on visual hallucinations in older adults.

All guidelines for hallucinations take the view that different treatments for hallucinations are required at different disease or hallucination stages and that experiencing hallucinations may not, in itself, require a specific treatment beyond general measures (eg, education, reassurance, physical, and medication review). For example, the SHAPED guidelines suggest including a review of cognitive and ophthalmological health, given that these may be masked by other conditions: ie, cognitive impairment may be missed in a patient with eye disease with their decline in functional ability attributed to visual loss. Early provision of information about the risk of hallucinations is emphasized as a way of reducing stigma and for healthcare professionals to routinely ask about hallucinations — to shift the onus of reporting hallucinations away from the patient. The point at which specific pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for hallucinations are required is not clearly defined in guidelines but based on clinical judgment.

Differential Diagnosis

Before commencing treatment, it must be clear that hallucinations are causing distress, ie, that there is a need for treatment. If this is the case, the second point of attention is whether it is indeed hallucinations. Especially in older adults with cognitive dysfunction, it can be difficult to disentangle hallucinations from obsessions, misperceptions/misunderstandings (ie, illusions), or involuntary mental imagery, such as the so-called "earworms" (ie, songs in the mind that continually repeat).

### Schizophrenia and emergency medicine [^11542nbo]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia is a chronic condition characterized by positive symptoms (auditory hallucinations, delusion), negative symptoms (avolition, social withdrawal), and disorganized thoughts/behaviors. Although the pathophysiology is incompletely understood, several neurobiological mechanisms have been proposed. Treatment usually involves antipsychotic medication as well as psychotherapy and supportive services. When evaluating patients in the emergency department, acute safety considerations are paramount. Patients should be assessed for suicide risk, violence risk, inability to care for self, and the risk of being the victim of a crime. Persons with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of substance use and a variety of medical problems.

For Purpose 2: Psychological Therapy.

If the answer is close to the description under point 2, then psychological therapy that helps the person to develop effective (and avoid ineffective) strategies and skills for coping with hallucinations, and any distress associated with these experiences, is recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapies help clients think and feel differently about hallucinations. Improving coping skills can also help to reduce distress, which may contribute to the onset or maintenance of hallucinations. In the case of bereavement hallucinations, it is important to take a relational psychotherapeutic perspective on the experience, as the distress may signify relationship difficulties with the deceased, eg unfinished business and intrusive presence. Several psychotherapies initially developed for treating people with a primary psychotic disorder and auditory hallucinations (cognitive behavioral therapy, COMET, acceptance, and commitment) are also applied to older persons, though less is known about the application of cognitive behavioral therapy for distressing visual hallucinations. In some cases, adjustments need to be made when the cognitive resources of patients are limited. The essence of such therapies is that the patient learns that hallucinations are not a real-life threat, may have personal significance or meaning, or can safely be ignored. If (auditory) hallucinations have neutral content, then psychotherapy developed for tinnitus may be a better fit, as it focuses on the reduction of worry, and shifting attention away from the unwanted perceptions.

For Purpose 3: The Following Steps Can Be Used

Step 1: Check Medication

Checking medication records is important since several types of medication can induce hallucinations, especially those with anticholinergic activity and those that increase monoaminergic function. People with cognitive dysfunction are at particular risk for such side effects. The most commonly used hallucination-triggering medication are corticosteroids, levetiracetam (an anti-epileptic drug), anti-malaria medication, dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, rotigotine, ropinirole, etc.), losartan (an antihypertensive drug), and opioids such as tramadol. If there is a correlation in time between the onset of hallucinations and start of medication use, it may be worthwhile to taper off that medicine or replace it by another one and reevaluate hallucination severity.

### Functional and structural effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: a systematic review [^116tepsr]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a disabling symptom for people with schizophrenia (SCZ), and do not always respond to antipsychotics. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown efficacy for medication-refractory AVH, though the underlying neural mechanisms by which rTMS produces these effects remain unclear. This systematic review evaluated the structural and functional impact of rTMS for AVH in SCZ, and its association with clinical outcomes.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in Medline, PsychINFO, and PubMed using terms for four key concepts: AVH, SCZ, rTMS, neuroimaging. Using PRISMA guidelines, 18 studies were identified that collected neuroimaging data of an rTMS intervention for AVH in SCZ. Risk of bias assessments was conducted.

Results

Low frequency (< 5 Hz) rTMS targeting left hemispheric language processing regions may normalize brain abnormalities in AVH patients at structural, functional, electrophysiological, and topological levels, with concurrent symptom improvement. Amelioration of aberrant neural activity in frontotemporal networks associated with speech and auditory processing was commonly observed, as well as in cerebellar and emotion regulation regions. Neuroimaging analyses identified neural substrates with direct correlations to post-rTMS AVH severity, propounding their use as therapeutic targets.

Discussion

Combined rTMS-neuroimaging highlights the multidimensional alterations of rTMS on brain activity and structure in treatment-resistant AVH, which may be used to develop more efficacious therapies. Larger randomized, sham-controlled studies are needed. Future studies should explore alternate stimulation targets, investigate the neural effects of high-frequency rTMS and evaluate long-term neuroimaging outcomes.

### Fifteen minute consultation on children' hearing voices': when to worry and when to refer [^116reCLn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations are uncommon paediatric presentations, but they can be alarming and lead to emergency consultations. This review outlines the phenomenology of auditory hallucinations, their assessment and clinical significance. Auditory hallucinations are seen in the course of acute medical disorders, often together with decreased levels of consciousness, as in febrile illness and in toxic, neurologically compromised states; they can also be a feature of episodic neurological conditions such as migraine and temporal lobe epilepsy. Auditory hallucinations are key symptoms in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenic and other psychotic states, but they can also present with depressive and anxiety disorders, and in the context of virtually every psychiatric disorder of childhood. In fact hallucinations — usually simple and transient — are common in the general child populations. Auditory hallucinations become clinically significant when they occur as part of a medical disorder or in the context of acute psychotic states and schizophrenia, when they are frequent, complex, distressing and cause impairment. The treatment of clinically relevant hallucinations is that of the primary medical or psychiatric disorder. Occasionally they require treatment in their own right with psychological treatments, and only when these have been tried and fail, a careful trial of antipsychotic medication may be appropriate.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for schizophrenia [^1117ozp6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

People with schizophrenia typically experience auditory hallucinations or delusions during acute episodes. Although effective drug treatments are available, many have intractable symptoms that do not recover between acute episodes. One proposed alternative to drug treatments is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To date, many research trials to assess effectiveness of TMS for people with symptoms of schizophrenia have been conducted worldwide. However, there is a lack of consensus on whether TMS should be recommended to be adopted in routine clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review of the literature for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TMS with sham or standard treatment. Forty-one trials (1473 participants) survived eligibility criteria and had extractable data. We found significant differences in favor of temporoparietal TMS compared with sham TMS for global state (7 RCTs, n = 224, MD: -0.5, 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.23) and for positive symptoms measured on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (5 RCTs, n = 127, MD: -6.09, 95% CI: -10.95 to -1.22). However, we also found that the quality of trial reporting was frequently suboptimal and the risks of bias were strong or unascertainable for many trial aspects; this led to many results being graded as very low-quality evidence. On that basis, we were unable to definitively support or refute the routine use of TMS in clinical practice. Future definitive trials of TMS with rigorous processes and high-quality reporting are needed.

### AVATAR therapy for auditory verbal hallucinations in people with psychosis: a single-blind, randomised controlled trial [^114LPK79]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

The study was a single-blind, randomised controlled trial done in the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust. Potential participants were referred to the study by their treating clinician in routine clinical service. All referrals were screened for eligibility against the following inclusion criteria: having had distressing auditory verbal hallucinations for at least 12 months in the context of a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (ICD-10 F20–29) or affective disorder with psychotic symptoms (ICD-10 F30–39 subcategories with psychotic symptoms), currently a patient of NHS psychiatric services, older than 18 years, and able to speak and read English. All participants had been taking antipsychotic medication before the trial but their auditory verbal hallucinations had been unresponsive or only partially responsive to previous treatment. Participants were excluded if they were unable to give informed written consent; were currently receiving psychological therapy for psychosis, including attending so-called hearing voices groups; were refusing medication; had a diagnosis of organic brain disease, learning disability, or primary substance dependency; and heard voices in a language not spoken by the therapists. All participants gave written informed consent.

The study was approved by the London-Hampstead Research Ethics Committee (reference 13/Lo/0482). The trial protocol has been published elswhere. The study was overseen by an independent trial steering committee and a separate Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee.

Randomisation and masking

All participants continued to receive standard psychiatric care, with the agreement that existing medication was to remain unchanged over the duration of the trial unless otherwise determined by clinical need. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive AVATAR therapy or supportive counselling with randomised permuted blocks (block size randomly varying between two and six). Randomisation was done on completion of baseline assessments through an independent web-based service provided by the UKCRC Registered Clinical Trials Unit at King's College London (registration number 053) to maintain allocation concealment. Participants were informed of their allocation by a therapist.

All assessments were done by research assessors who were masked to therapy allocation. To avoid unmasking, we ensured that assessors did not have access to clinical records after the baseline (pre-randomisation) assessment or access to the therapy database at any stage, that all assessments were done at sites remote from the clinic, and that participants were reminded before each assessment not to disclose their allocation.

### A neuropsychiatric model of biological and psychological processes in the remission of delusions and auditory hallucinations [^113NP2ou]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

This selective review combines cognitive models and biological models of psychosis into a tentative integrated neuropsychiatric model. The aim of the model is to understand better, how pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavior therapy come forward as partners in the treatment of psychosis and play complementary and mutually reinforcing roles. The article reviews the dominant models in literature. The focus in this review is on one hand on neural circuits that are involved in cognitive models and on the other hand on cognitive processes and experiences involved in biological models. In this way, a 4-component neuropsychiatric model is tentatively constructed: (1) a biological component that leads to aberrant perceptions and salience of stimuli, (2) a cognitive component that attempts to explain the psychic abnormal events, (3) a mediating component with psychological biases which influences the reasoning process in the direction of the formation of (secondary) delusions, and (4) a component of psychological processes that maintains delusions and prevents the falsification of delusional ideas. Remission consists actually of 2 processes. Biological remission consists of the dampening of mesolimbic dopamine releases with antipsychotic medication and decreases the continuous salient experiences. Psychological remission consists of the reappraisal of primary psychotic experiences. Both forms of remission are partially independent. We expect that a full remission including biological and psychological remission could prevent relapse.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation for refractory auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia [^112cPQYc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Some patients with schizophrenia may suffer from continuous or severe auditory hallucinations that are refractory to antipsychotic drugs, including clozapine. Such patients may benefit from a short trial of once- to twice-daily transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the cathode placed over the left temporoparietal cortex and the anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; negative, cognitive, and other symptoms, if present, may also improve. At present, the case for tDCS treatment of refractory auditory hallucinations rests on 1 well-conducted randomized, sham tDCS-controlled trial and several carefully documented and instructive case reports. Benefits with up to 3 years of maintenance tDCS have also been described. In patients with refractory auditory hallucinations, tDCS has been delivered at 1- to 3-mA current intensity during 20–30 minutes in once- to twice-daily sessions for up to 3 years with no apparent adverse effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation therefore appears to be a promising noninvasive brain stimulation technique for patients with antipsychotic-refractory auditory hallucinations.

### Multidisciplinary approaches to understanding auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia and nonschizophrenia populations: the international consortium on hallucination research [^114BhptQ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

This special theme issue of Schizophrenia Bulletin presents a series of related articles focusing on auditory hallucinations, prepared by members of the International Consortium on Hallucination Research [InCoHR] working groups. The InCoHR is a large collaborative framework that serves as a platform for researchers to meet and collaborate on multidisciplinary projects relating to auditory hallucinations [AH] and discuss methodological issues facing transdiagnostic research. Laroi et al. observe the similarities in characteristic features of AHs in different clinical and nonclinical groups, but they also note that differences exist, reflecting the contribution of disease-related process. Waters et al. use findings of shared cognitive impairments across different diagnostic groups with AHs to propose a novel theoretical cognitive framework. Allen et al. describe that the neurobiological substrates of AHs include neural systems involved in language processing, as well as sensory and nonsensory brain regions and that studies are increasingly using fine-grain analysis of patients' characteristics in analyzing neuroimaging data. Ford et al. discuss different neurophysiological approaches and describes hallucination-related alterations in activity in temporal and frontal regions of the brain and particularly in auditory cortical areas. Finally, Sommer et al. review different treatment options for AHs in schizophrenia and other disorders, including pharmacological treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] and acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT], transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS], and electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]. These related publications describe the current substance and direction of research on AHs across different diagnostic groups.

### Pre-clinical indications of brain stimulation treatments for non-affective psychiatric disorders, a status update [^1171wxY6]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Several studies have examined the reduction of negative symptoms solely or conjointly with auditory hallucinations. Such studies have found significant reductions in symptoms such as emotion processing, mood impairments, and cognitive control, from targeting prefrontal areas. Studies examining negative symptoms alone have found significant improvements following tDCS specifically in passive/apathetic withdrawal, expressive deficits, stereotyped thinking, psychosocial functioning, disorganization, and overall cognitive deficits. Negative symptom improvement could be attributed to the stimulation of cortical-subcortical networks, and interestingly, medications were also found to influence the efficacy of treating negative symptoms. Haloperidol and clozapine decreased tDCS effects potentially due to their influence of plasticity and its eliminatory effect on anodal excitation.

With regards to cognitive symptoms, tDCS has been shown to improve working memory deficits supported by 12 out of 18 studies in a systematic review. However, several metaanalyses have indicated that the variation in stimulation parameters may account for inconsistent results between groups. Additionally, studies analyzing the effect of tDCS on cognitive symptoms as a secondary outcome found no improvements compared to sham in cognition including executive function, memory, and social cognition. Although in early stages, tDCS demonstrates potential for treating auditory hallucinations and negative symptoms in psychotic disorders, with opportunities to explore additional clinical features. Further study exploring how tDCS compares to existing first-line interventions are needed.

### AVATAR therapy for auditory verbal hallucinations in people with psychosis: a single-blind, randomised controlled trial [^113vXZCG]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Auditory verbal hallucinations, which are typically of a derogatory and threatening nature, are reported by approximately 60–70% of people with schizophrenia. Although pharmacological therapy is effective at reducing hallucinations in many people, approximately 25% of people with psychotic conditions continue to experience them. Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis is also helpful for many people, although average effect sizes are in the small to moderate range, and training and resource requirements mean that, in practice, therapy is delivered to only a fraction of those who might benefit. Consequently, there is considerable interest in the development of novel therapies that draw on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis but which are shorter, specifically targeted at auditory verbal hallucinations, and are capable of being delivered by a wider workforce.

Several novel therapies build on the perspective that auditory verbal hallucinations are experienced as coming from entities that have personal identities, speak with purpose, and with whom the hearer establishes a personal relationship. The operation of power within this relationship is viewed as crucial. The voice is typically experienced as dominant (even omnipotent), with the voice-hearer assuming a submissive role characterised by feelings of inferiority and powerlessness that can reflect social relationships more generally. In light of this finding, explicitly relational and interpersonal approaches have been developed that locate voices (and voice relationships) within the person's biographical contextand target key interpersonal dimensions such as power and proximity.

### Dopamine, psychosis and schizophrenia: the widening gap between basic and clinical neuroscience [^113oQFxp]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Why do antipsychotics work?

This raises important questions as to how antipsychotic drugs exert their effects. In most individuals with schizophrenia, antipsychotic treatment is effective in reducing positive symptoms; therefore, excessive D2 signalling in the associative striatum appears to be critical. Stimulation of D2 and D1 receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (which are largely segregated) in the associative striatum feedback indirectly to the thalamus, completing a loop that allows for feedforward-based and feedback-based signalling. The basal ganglia acts as a gateway for, or mediator of, cortical inputs – and may represent a common pathway through which psychotic symptoms present. Therefore, excessive dopamine signalling in the associative striatum may directly lead to psychotic symptoms by compromising the integration of cortical inputs. In treatment-responsive patients, antipsychotics may attenuate the expression of psychotic symptoms by normalising excessive D2 signallingto restore the balance between D1 and D2 receptor pathways. Because they act downstream to schizophrenia-related presynaptic abnormalities, they fail to improve indices of cortical function (i.e. cognitive symptoms). Alternatively, impaired cortical input to the associative striatum via the thalamus, PFC or other regions could dysregulate this system independently of, or in addition to, associative striatal dopamine dysfunction. In this case, D2 receptor blockade may be insufficient to restore normal function, which is one explanation for why some individuals are treatment refractory. For example, increases in subcortical synaptic dopamine contentand increases in presynaptic striatal dopamine functionare both associated with increased treatment efficacy. Thus, in treatment-resistant subjects, there is little evidence of abnormal dopaminergic function. Medicated persons with schizophrenia, who remain symptomatic with auditory hallucinations, show increased thalamic, striatal and hippocampal activation. Moreover, treatment-refractory patients who respond positively to clozapine treatment show alterations in cerebral blood flow in fronto-striato-thalamic circuitry, suggesting clozapine is restoring a functional imbalance in these systems. Taken together, this evidence suggests that psychosis is the result of a network dysfunction that includes a variety of brain regions (and multiple neurotransmitter-specific pathways), of which impairment at any level could precipitate psychotic symptoms.

Step 3: Pharmacotherapy

If the patient wants to reduce hallucinations and previous strategies were not successful, pharmacotherapy can be an effective means to do so, although side effects may be severe, especially in older people. It is important to discuss the unstable course of hallucinations and the possibility that they will disappear spontaneously. Considering that hallucinations can arise from aberrations in many neurotransmitters systems, including the dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic system, then specific medication may be effective only in specific subtypes. The phenomenology of the hallucinations may provide some clues to the direction of which receptor system may be involved. For example, dopamine couples salience to experiences and increased dopamine production can lead to highly salient, often frightening hallucinations, as seen in people with psychotic depression, schizophrenia, delirium, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Antipsychotic medication can be effective for this specific type of hallucinations. As dopamine receptors decrease with age, much lower dosages are used for older adults; hence, the adage "start low, go slow" to titrate until the lowest effective dose is achieved. Sedative antipsychotics need to be given at nightime to reduce the risk of falls. Electrocardiogram for potential QT elongation should be performed before and after the start of risperidone, aripiprazole, and typical antipsychotics. As antipsychotic use has been associated with significant mortality and morbidity risks for older patients, especially those with dementia, such medication should be avoided if possible and tapered off if not effective or when hallucinations have been in stable remission when it is used.

Hallucinations, especially in the visual domain, in older adults can also arise from the loss of cholinergic innervation, especially in people with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, or Parkinson's disease. As acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter in sustained attention, patients with loss of cholinergic innervation often show drowsiness, inattention, and forgetfulness ("what was the reason I went to the kitchen?"). Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine can be effective in treating this type of hallucination. If using rivastigmine, patches may be better tolerated than pills as they provide fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Starting dose is usually 4.6 mg/24 hours, which is increased to 9 mg/ 24 hours after 3–5 weeks if generally tolerated, although side effects are also common.

### Hearing and dementia [^112pk3je]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Management

While effects on specific aspects of cognitive function are difficult to predict, correction of reversible hearing deficits has been shown to benefit global functioning in daily life. Simple interventions such as earwax removal can be highly effective. In addition, prescription of hearing aids and other assistive listening devices where appropriate, environmental modification strategies may be useful in managing altered hearing in patients with dementia. Examples include the use of written communication aids and electronic devices, conducting conversations face-to-face and free of significant background noise, avoiding sounds known to provoke distress, and masking techniques for musical and other auditory hallucinations. Anecdotally, cholinesterase inhibitors may benefit some patients with musical hallucinations; however, there is currently little role for specific pharmacotherapy in managing auditory dysfunction in dementia. Specific auditory training protocols based on speech and nonspeech sounds have been shown to improve speech intelligibility in hearing-impaired adults but have yet to be adequately assessed in dementia. Though music is unquestionably a welcome source of solace for many patients and caregivers and often a useful displacement activity, evidence for a specific role of music therapy in the management of dementia awaits better-controlled trials. Assistive listening devices incorporating a mobile microphone are a promising strategy to compensate for deficits of auditory scene processing, but their utility in patients with dementia remains to be established. Management of hearing loss in dementia is an inter-disciplinary enterprise, and close collaboration with audiology, speech and language therapy, and social services is invaluable.

### Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation for auditory verbal hallucinations: negative findings from a double-blind-randomized trial [^1152uuMN]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in schizophrenia are resistant to antipsychotic medication in approximately 25% of patients. Treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for refractory AVH has shown varying results. A stimulation protocol using continuous theta burst rTMS (TB-rTMS) showed high efficacy in open label studies. We tested TB-rTMS as a treatment strategy for refractory AVH in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

Seventy-one patients with AVH were randomly allocated to TB-rTMS or placebo treatment. They received 10 TB-rTMS or sham treatments over the left temporoparietal cortex in consecutive days. AVH severity was assessed at baseline, end of treatment and follow-up using the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS) and the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS). Other schizophrenia-related symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Results

Seven patients dropped out before completing the study. In the remaining 64, AVH improved significantly after treatment in both groups as measured with both PSYRATS and AHRS. PANSS positive and general subscores also decreased, but the negative subscores did not. However, improvement did not differ significantly between the TB-rTMS and the placebo group on any outcome measure.

Conclusions

Symptom reduction could be achieved in patients with medication-resistant hallucinations, even within 1 week time. However, as both groups showed similar improvement, effects were general (ie, placebo-effects) rather than specific to treatment with continuous TB-rTMS. Our findings highlight the importance of double-blind trials including a sham-control condition to assess efficacy of new treatments such as TMS.

### Examining transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) as a treatment for hallucinations in schizophrenia [^115YaVkH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Some 25%–30% of patients with schizophrenia have auditory verbal hallucinations that are refractory to antipsychotic drugs. Outcomes in studies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation suggest the possibility that application of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) with inhibitory stimulation over the left temporo-parietal cortex and excitatory stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could affect hallucinations and negative symptoms, respectively. The authors investigated the efficacy of tDCS in reducing the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations as well as negative symptoms.

Method

Thirty patients with schizophrenia and medication-refractory auditory verbal hallucinations were randomly allocated to receive 20 minutes of active 2-mA tDCS or sham stimulation twice a day on 5 consecutive weekdays. The anode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the left temporo-parietal cortex.

Results

Auditory verbal hallucinations were robustly reduced by tDCS relative to sham stimulation, with a mean diminution of 31% (SD = 14; d = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.76–2.40). The beneficial effect on hallucinations lasted for up to 3 months. The authors also observed an amelioration with tDCS of other symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (d = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.22–1.73), especially for the negative and positive dimensions. No effect was observed on the dimensions of disorganization or grandiosity/excitement.

Conclusions

Although this study is limited by the small sample size, the results show promise for treating refractory auditory verbal hallucinations and other selected manifestations of schizophrenia.

### Schizophrenia [^112uHKDR]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Management and outcome

Since the serendipitous discovery of chlorpromazine over 50 years ago, almost all antipsychotic drugs available in the clinical settings for schizophrenia derive their effectiveness through DRD2 blockade. Clozapine is the most potent in efficacy, and a group of antipsychotics including clozapine binds and influences not only DRD2 but also other neurotransmitter receptors, such as serotonin receptors 2 (5HT-2R). In the UK Clozapine is only licensed for use in those who have failed to respond to other antispsychotics due to the risk of agranulocytosis and neutropenia (1–3%) requiring ongoing blood monitoring. Antipsychotic drugs are relatively effective in reducing positive symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, and remain the mainstay of both acute and long-term pharmacological treatment. However they are not effective for other important clinical features of schizophrenia, such as negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, which are more strongly associated with functional impairment than positive symptoms. There is evidence that long-term, maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs is effective in preventing relapse of psychotic symptoms, but troublesome side effects such as weight gain, movement disorders and sedation are common and contribute to poor adherence. Moreover, a substantial number of patients show no, or at best partial, response in positive symptoms with current antipsychotic drugs. – Individual response is often idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. Newer, so-called second-generation, antipsychotic drugs can be effective in treating psychotic symptoms with fewer movement disorders, but carry a higher risk of cardio-metabolic side effects. Choice of the optimal antipsychotic is therefore usually pragmatic and balances individual benefits with costs and risks. Clozapine is effective in around 60% of previously treatment refractory cases, but there is evidence that it is underprescribed.

### Safety of rTMS for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pxAkT]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness and leading cause of disability worldwide. Schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairment. Treatment involves use of antipsychotic medication and psychotherapy. However, antipsychotics are only partially effective, substantially improving symptoms in less than 25% of individuals, and only a minority of individuals achieve remission. Antipsychotics are most effective for positive symptoms, and there are no current pharmacologic treatments for negative symptoms or cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Given the limited treatment options for schizophrenia, the field has frantically searched for alternative interventions.

Neuromodulation, or the use of brain stimulation to change neuronal activity, is one such intervention that has been explored for schizophrenia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a form of noninvasive neuromodulation that involves pulsing an electrical current through an external electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp and using the induced electromagnetic field to temporarily alter patterns of neuronal activity. rTMS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and smoking cessation. Since its initial FDA approval for MDD in 2008, rTMS has become a valuable and readily available research tool to probe neural circuitry involved in many other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, where it has been studied as an intervention for auditory hallucinations, negative symptoms, and cognitive performance, among others. In Europe, rTMS has a conformité européenne mark (ie, European version of FDA clearance) for treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.rTMS is generally very well tolerated, as the most common side effect is headache. In contrast to interventions like electroconvulsive therapy, rTMS does not involve the use of anesthesia and has no cognitive side effects. Because rTMS stimulates neurons to depolarize, rTMS is associated with risk of seizure. When international consensus guidelines are followed, rTMS has a seizure risk of less than 1/1000.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial [^111B3N1e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), generally defined as hearing nonexistent spoken voices, are a typical symptom of schizophrenia. Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with schizophrenia have AVH at initial presentation, and of these, 25% to 30% of AVH are nonresponsive to antipsychotic medications. The persistence of AVH can significantly diminish the quality of lifeand elevate the risk of suicideand violence. Consequently, effective alternative therapies are urgently needed to treat AVH in patients with schizophrenia. To this end, numerous neuroimaging studies have been tested to identify the neural correlates of AVH.

Among the abundant brain regions or networks that may be involved in the generation of AVH in patients with schizophrenia, the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) has attracted particular attention because of its potential for reducing AVH in clinical treatments such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Most of the rTMS studies treating AVH in patients with schizophrenia, localized the left TPJ according to the international 10–20 system of electroencephalography. However, the TPJ is a heteromodal association cortex consisting of heterogeneous subregions, with high interindividual variability. The 10–20 system is not sufficiently accurate to guide the TMS coil to a predefined TPJ subregion. As a result, the stimulation may be delivered to functionally distinct TPJ subregions on different treatment days. This imprecise stimulation may fail to accomplish an accumulated effect to alleviate AVH symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. To overcome this shortcoming, our group precisely guided the coil and monitored its online position using individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in an open-label rTMS study, which significantly decreased AVH in patients with schizophrenia.

### Targeting auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: effective connectivity changes induced by low-frequency rTMS [^113eJ8Gk]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental disorder characterized by a spectrum of symptoms, including psychotic manifestations such as hallucinations and delusions, as well as cognitive and emotional dysfunctions. Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are most the common core of schizophrenia, affecting approximately 60–80% of individuals with the disorder. These hallucinations often involve hearing voices without external stimuli. Persistent AVH significantly impairs daily functioning, disrupts social interactions, and diminishes quality of life. The chronic and intrusive nature of AVH can lead to heightened anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints, further complicating the management of schizophrenia.

Traditionally, antipsychotic medications have been primary treatment for AVH. Although these medications are beneficial, their side effects, including dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia, are problematic. Non-pharmacological treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, avatar therapy, and neurofeedback training have also been explored as alternatives or adjuncts to medication. However, these approaches have limitations, including the need for extensive patient engagement, long-term commitment, and expensive equipment, which restrict their effectiveness and accessibility, particularly for individuals with severe symptoms. Recent evidence suggests that non-invasive brain stimulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), may offer an effective alternative for relieving AVH with fewer side effects and relatively safety. rTMS modulates cortical excitability through electromagnetic induction. It is thought to induce longer-lasting changes at the neuronal level, primarily through mechanisms like long-term potentiation or depression. Studies have highlighted its potential, particularly when administered at low-frequency (typically 1 Hz), to alleviate AVH symptoms, despite some reports of negative findings. This form of rTMS is thought to decrease cortical excitability and restore the neurophysiological balance often disrupted in schizophrenia.

### Changing relationship with voices: new therapeutic perspectives for treating hallucinations [^111vXChX]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

A growing body of research on verbal hallucinations shows the importance of beliefs about and relationships with the voices for their pathological course. In particular, beliefs about the omnipotence of the voices and the need to control them, and relationships with them that involve efforts to resist or fight them, have shown themselves to be more pathogenic than effective. Likewise, treatments aimed at eliminating the voices, be they based on medication or 'traditional' cognitive-behavioural therapy, have not always been successful. A series of strategies focused on changing relationships with the voices instead of trying to eliminate them-including mindfulness, acceptance, experiential role plays and re-authoring lives-is emerging as a new perspective for the treatment of hallucinations. All of these strategies are based on the person, not on the syndrome, which also represents a new conception of the problem, in a phenomenological-social perspective, alternative to the predominant medical conception.

### Alpha transcranial alternating current stimulation reduces depressive symptoms in people with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations: a double-blind, randomized pilot clinical trial [^1145tB1X]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

This study was conducted from November 14th, 2017, to January 5th, 2021, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03221270: "Targeting Auditory Hallucinations With Alternating Current Stimulation", STILL3) and was approved by the UNC-Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited from local clinics affiliated or unaffiliated with the university. The target sample size was 40, which was determined based on our previous pilot clinical trial.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All participants were diagnosed with schizophrenia, any subtype, or schizoaffective disorder (confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-IV) with symptoms present for greater than 1 year, who also met the following criteria: 18–70 years old; experiencing at least three auditory hallucinations per week; clinically stable (no hospitalization in the past 12 weeks); on stable doses of antipsychotic medications (no changes in doses or medication for 4 weeks prior to enrollment). In addition, participants were required to meet the criteria for treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations, defined as having ongoing auditory hallucinations during trials of at least 2 different antipsychotic agents of adequate dose and duration. To further define the experience of auditory hallucinations, the variability was limited as eligible participants were interviewed twice over the course of 2 weeks during the screening period and only enrolled if they demonstrated ≤ 20% change in their Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS) scores.

Individuals were excluded from the study for the following criteria: concurrent (within 4 weeks) anticonvulsant medications or daily treatment of benzodiazepines (limited as-needed use that was discontinued more than 48 h prior to a study session was allowed); A DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence within the past 6 months; positive urine test of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates; history of significant head injury or traumatic brain injury, prior brain surgery or any brain devices/implants, history of seizures, unstable medical illness, or pregnancy; non-English speakers.

This study used a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute. Bi-annual reviews of blinded data and adverse events were submitted to the DSMB. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools.

### A systematic review of relational-based therapies for the treatment of auditory hallucinations in patients with psychotic disorders [^113hqtKQ]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Data were extracted by L.D. and S.G. using a standardized form. Key information related to the sample, the intervention, the control group, the outcomes measured, and study results were recorded. Effects sizes that were not reported within the article were calculated to help have a magnitude of the effects when possible. The effect sizes were categorized as small (0.2), medium (0.5) and large (> 0.8) effects (Cohen). The details of the studies may be found in online Supplementary Material. Extracted data were independently crosschecked and any queries were resolved by discussion with A.D. and S.P. Furthermore, L.D. and S.G. independently undertook quality assessment using a set of criteria based on the GRADE Checklist (Guyatt et al.) and CONSORT Checklist. Studies were assigned: very low quality, low, moderate-to-low, moderate, moderate-to-high and high (see online Supplementary Material). We assigned higher scores to studies that comprised of single-blind randomized control trial (RCT) with larger sample sizes ideally over 100, compared the treatment to an active control group, and measured their outcome with standardized scales. A similar method has been used in a prior study for quality assessment (Dellazizzo, Potvin, Bahig, & Dumais). To achieve a high standard of reporting data, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman).

### Understanding auditory verbal hallucinations in healthy individuals and individuals with psychiatric disorders [^1167dTwJ]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Auditory verbal hallucinations(AVHs) are psychiatric manifestations that are common in patients with psychiatric disorders and can occur in healthy individuals. This review summarizes the existing literature on the phenomenological features of auditory verbal hallucinations, imaging findings, and interventions, focusing on patients with schizophrenia who experience auditory verbal hallucinations, in addition to patients with borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as healthy individuals. The phenomenological features of AVHs vary in different psychiatric disorders, and the symptoms are associated with changes in specific brain structures and disturbances in brain function, blood flow, and metabolism. Interventions for auditory verbal hallucinations include antipsychotic drugs, neurostimulation, and cognitive behavioral therapy.

### Non-visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review [^112m6Jr8]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

The current review was subject to several methodological limitations. Owing to its scope focused on non-visual and multisensory hallucinations, established PD studies centred on visual hallucinations only were excluded (though the number of existing studies likely necessitates a systematic review in its own right). By the same token, research examining hallucinations more broadly without specifying modality were also left out (including those that utilised the UPDRS as their main hallucination assessment tool). Consequently, any findings relating solely to visual hallucinations were incomplete and conclusions drawn from this review must take this into account. The other major limitation relates to lack of consideration of PD medications, especially in terms of its effects and associated timelines. This was a conscious decision, as the range of drugs and varying doses employed to treat a myriad of PD symptoms renders this a complex and somewhat contentious topic. For instance, some PD drugs are known or held to induce psychosis, whereas other neuropsychiatric medications are evidently prescribed to treat hallucinations. Until clear effects of these substances on hallucinatory events can be established, current findings will again need to be interpreted within this lens. Moreover, a lack of neuropathological confirmation of clinically suspected PD across the included studies has limited the generalisability of our conclusions, given some cases may be re-classified as dementia with Lewy bodies or some other Parkinsonism syndrome post-mortem. Finally, it is possible that we may have missed papers that presented non-hallucinations data in their full-text, but not the abstract. However, our comprehensive and extensive search strategy, would hopefully have mitigated this. On the other hand, the chief strength of our review is a much needed focus on non-visual and multisensory hallucinations in PD, a hitherto neglected area, despite repeated calls from established PD researchers in the field.

### Quality assessment and comparison of evidence for electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for schizophrenia: a systematic meta-review [^1176xNfg]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized studies directly comparing the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression generally favour ECT. ECT and rTMS have also been investigated for chronic symptoms of schizophrenia although there are no direct comparisons available.

Aims

We sought to determine the relative benefits and adverse outcomes of ECT and rTMS by comparing effect sizes reported in systematic reviews and to quality assess this evidence using GRADE and QUOROM guidelines.

Method

Included are systematic reviews with meta-analysis published since 2000, reporting results for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder or first episode schizophrenia. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Current Contents, PsycINFO and the Cochrane library were searched and hand searching was conducted. Data extraction and quality assessment were completed by two independent reviewers.

Results

Fifty-three of 58 reviews were excluded as they did not meet inclusion criteria. The remaining five have a low probability of reporting bias and show that high quality evidence suggests a short-term, medium to large treatment effect of rTMS for auditory hallucinations (d = 0.88) but not other symptoms, for people treated with concurrent antipsychotics. For ECT, high quality evidence suggests a short-term small, significant effect for improvement in global symptoms, for people with or without concurrent antipsychotics (RR = 0.76). There is no evidence for longer-term therapeutic or adverse effects of either treatment.

Conclusions

It is worthwhile considering rTMS in cases where auditory hallucinations have not responded to antipsychotic medications and ECT where overall symptoms have not responded to antipsychotic medications.

### Efficacy of fronto-temporal transcranial direct current stimulation for refractory auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study [^114zQEM3]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) that are refractory to antipsychotic medications are reported in about 20–30% of schizophrenia patients. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive and safe neuromodulatory technique, has attracted significant interest as an add-on treatment for refractory AVH in schizophrenia. Studies examining the efficacy of tDCS for refractory AVH in schizophrenia have reported inconsistent findings. In this study, using a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design (RCT), we sought to examine the effect of add-on tDCS [anode corresponding to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathode to left temporo-parietal junction; 2-mA, twice-daily sessions for 5-days] to treat refractory AVH in schizophrenia patients (N = 25); following this RCT phase, patients that had < 30% reduction in AVH severity were offered an open-label extension (OLE) active stimulation to evaluate the effect of cross-over to verum tDCS. In the RCT phase, repeated measures ANOVA with tDCS type [verum (N = 12) vs. sham (N = 13)] as between subjects factor demonstrated a significant tDCS-type X time-point interaction [F = 21.5, p < 0.001, partial-η2 = 0.48] with significantly greater reduction of AVH score in verum tDCS group as compared to sham group. In the OLE phase, sham-to-verum crossed over patients (N = 13) showed significantly greater reduction in AVH severity than their corresponding change during RCT phase (t = 2.9; p = 0.01). Together, these observations add further support to the beneficial effects of add-on tDCS to treat refractory AVH schizophrenia.

The results of two-way rm-ANOVA (α = 0.05).

Further analysis revealed that for the 40Hz-tACS group, the effect of the time factor on auditory hallucination symptom scores was statistically significant (F (3,45) = 20.000, p Bonf < 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons revealed that only baseline auditory hallucination scores were significantly different from week2 (p = 0.008), week4 (p < 0.001) and follow-up (p < 0.001). For the sham group, the effect of the time factor on auditory hallucination symptom scores was statistically significant (F (3,45) = 7.670, p Bonf < 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed that only baseline auditory hallucination scores were significantly different from week2 (p = 0.042), week4 (p = 0.022) and follow-up (p = 0.003) (Fig. 2A). As treatment time proceeds, medication alone (sham group) and medication overlaid with 40Hz-tACS could significantly reduce auditory hallucination symptoms.

### Common and unique white matter fractional anisotropy patterns in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations: a retrospective tract-based spatial statistics study [^111MySip]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have reported that medication-resistant AVHs in patients with schizophrenia are associated with gray matter structural and functional abnormalities. These studies have provided additional data to improve the treatment of AVHs in patients with schizophrenia. Several treatment strategies have been developed for treatment-resistant AVHs based on these findings, including r-TMS, adjunct antipsychotic agents, transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS), and adjunct antipsychotic agents; however, there remains no consensus on the most appropriate treatment strategy for AVHs in patients with schizophrenia based on gray matter abnormalities.

WM abnormalities have become the focus of schizophrenia research with the development of neuroimaging technology over the past two decades. The relationship between AVHs in patients with schizophrenia and gray matter abnormalities has been studied by numerous scholars using multiple MRI imaging technologies. In contrast, limited studies have investigated the relationship between AVHs in patients with schizophrenia and WM abnormalities. and there have been even fewer follow-up studies to investigate the association between AVHs and WM abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia. More notably, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has reported an association between the WM modality change trajectory in patients with schizophrenia with AVHs and the treatment effect of AVHs. Hence, we conducted a study using the MRI data from our schizophrenia study database, which was established in 2013, to investigate the relationship between AVHs in patients with schizophrenia and WM trajectory features. We aimed to provide data that scholars can utilize to identify precise therapeutic strategies to treat medication-resistant AVHs in patients with schizophrenia.

The primary goal of this study was to describe the WM abnormality alteration trajectory that accompanies 5 years of antipsychotic agent treatment. As a secondary goal, we sought to describe the unique and common WM abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia who presented with medication-resistant AVHs and patients with treatable AVHs to further explore the pathological WM features of these patients. The treatment strategies developed based on the data presented herein can reduce impairment and improve the prognosis of patients with schizophrenia and medication-resistant AVHs.

### Examining the association between genetic liability for schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease [^113LA9gf]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD + P) — broadly comprising delusions and hallucinations — is experienced by up to 50% of people over the course of the illness, with prevalence peaking in the later stages. AD + P is associated with accelerated cognitive decline (independent of disease duration), higher mortality rates and distress to both people with the disease and their carers –. Moreover, there are wider societal implications with long-term follow-up studies indicating that AD + P is associated with a shorter time to nursing home care. Despite these compelling reasons for effective management, there is a critical treatment gap, with no licensed treatments available in many jurisdictions. Atypical antipsychotics — developed first for schizophrenia — are frequently used to treat AD + P (in many countries off label) and, while they have some modest benefits, are associated with considerable harms, including a 1.5- to 1.8-fold increase in mortality and a threefold increase in stroke.

Clinically useful alternatives to antipsychotics are scarce. There are only two new antipsychotic compounds in phase II or later stages of development (pimavanserin and MP-101) but both are refinements of existing mechanisms of action of atypical antipsychotics targeting mechanisms relevant to schizophrenia (e.g. 5HT2A, mGluR2/3) and side effects remain a concern. The limited understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning AD + P represents a major challenge to the effective targeting of existing treatments and the identification of novel treatment targets.

One key question is whether some or all of the psychotic symptoms experienced by people with AD have a similar basis to schizophrenia. Phenomenologically the psychotic symptoms in each are different; in AD visual hallucinations are more common than auditory hallucinations, delusions are usually simple, and the first rank symptoms of schizophrenia are very rare. In addition, schizophrenia is characterized by both positive and negative symptoms. While negative symptoms can also accompany psychosis in AD, consensus is yet to be reached on whether these other neuropsychiatric symptoms form part of the AD + P clinical syndrome. Despite the different phenomenology, atypical antipsychotics confer some treatment benefits in some cases of AD + P, and similar neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and executive function have been observed in individuals with very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis and AD + P, suggesting some overlap.

### Should we expand the toolbox of psychiatric treatment methods to include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)? A meta-analysis of the efficacy of rTMS in psychiatric disorders [^113iRR6o]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe treatment method with few side effects. However, efficacy for various psychiatric disorders is currently not clear.

Data Sources

A literature search was performed from 1966 through October 2008 using PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase Psychiatry, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and PsycINFO. The following search terms were used: transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, repetitive TMS, psychiatry, mental disorder, psychiatric disorder, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, catatonia, mania, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, bulimia nervosa, and addiction.

Study Selection

Data were obtained from randomized, sham-controlled studies of rTMS treatment for depression (34 studies), auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH, 7 studies), negative symptoms in schizophrenia (7 studies), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, 3 studies). Studies of rTMS versus electroconvulsive treatment (ECT, 6 studies) for depression were meta-analyzed.

Data Extraction

Standardized mean effect sizes of rTMS versus sham were computed based on pretreatment-posttreatment comparisons.

Data Synthesis

The mean weighted effect size of rTMS versus sham for depression was 0.55 (P < .001). Monotherapy with rTMS was more effective than rTMS as adjunctive to antidepressant medication. ECT was superior to rTMS in the treatment of depression (mean weighted effect size -0.47, P = 0.004). In the treatment of AVH, rTMS was superior to sham treatment, with a mean weighted effect size of 0.54 (P < .001). The mean weighted effect size for rTMS versus sham in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia was 0.39 (P = 0.11) and for OCD, 0.15 (P = 0.52). Side effects were mild, yet more prevalent with high-frequency rTMS at frontal locations.

Conclusions

It is time to provide rTMS as a clinical treatment method for depression, for auditory verbal hallucinations, and possibly for negative symptoms. We do not recommend rTMS for the treatment of OCD.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^116sAA1e]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Treatment

For some disorders, such as intoxication, psychotic depression, and schizophrenia, hallucinations may respond well to treatment of the underlying disorder. However, in other disorders, such as dementia, vision or hearing loss, or Parkinson's disease, this is not the case. In such instances, additional treatment aimed specifically at hallucinations may be indicated. For the treatment of hallucinations, the most important question is what the aim of treatment should be. There are a number of answers frequently given to this question:

I want to understand why I experience these hallucinations.
I want to be competent to handle these hallucinations.
I want to get rid of these hallucinations.

For Purpose 1: Psychoeducation.

If the response to this question is in line with answer 1, then psychoeducation is the treatment of choice. In one or more sessions, the patient and his/her loved one can be provided with information about how perception is accomplished in the brain, how this process can go awry, and which factors can precipitate hallucinations. A good start for psychoeducation is to ask the patient what he/she already knows and which explanation he/she currently uses for this experience. From there, unhelpful explanations can be corrected and new knowledge can be added to improve disease insight.

### Hallucinations in children and adolescents [^1124gtAj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians need to consider a wide range of differential diagnoses when children and adolescents present with hallucinations. This includes considering whether it is a developmentally normal phenomenon or if there is a psychiatric, medical, or neurologic diagnosis. Nonpsychotic children with hallucinations can be differentiated from psychotic children. Nonpsychotic children who are at risk (or prodromal) for future psychosis can be differentiated from nonprodromal healthier children. We examine the epidemiology, prognosis, and neurobiological research. Lastly, we discuss treatment approaches, including medication and cognitive behavioral therapy.

### AVATAR therapy for auditory verbal hallucinations in people with psychosis: a single-blind, randomised controlled trial [^113xgNNg]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Trial profile

Numbers lost to follow-up are cumulative in relation to the total allocated at the start of the study.

Unmasking occurred in 28 participants (18.6%), 14 in each study group. When unmasking occurred, subsequent assessments were done by a different researcher. Replacement was not possible in three of these 28 participants (two participants refused to see any other researcher and one participant repeatedly unmasked the replacement researcher).

Overall, there was a greater proportion of men, the mean age was 42.7 years (SD 10.7), and approximately 40% of participants in each group belonged to an ethnic minority population (table 1). Most participants were unemployed and the most common diagnosis was paranoid schizophrenia (table 1). Participants had an average length of illness of 20.1 years (SD 10.8) and all were prescribed antipsychotic medication before the trial, with more than a third prescribed clozapine. There was no difference at baseline or follow-up in the total dose of prescribed antipsychotic medication (olanzapine or chlorpromazine equivalents). The majority of participants (n = 117 [78%]) reported hearing multiple voices (mean 3.6 [SD 3.5], range 1 to > 20) and most identified the source as of human origin, though only a third said they thought they knew the person responsible.

### Successful treatment of intractable visual hallucinations with 5-HTantagonist ketanserin [^113CEn7Q]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations, visual, auditory or in another sensory modality, often respond well to treatment in patients with schizophrenia. Some, however, do not and can be very chronic and debilitating. We present a patient with schizophrenia with intractable hallucinations despite state of the art care, including high-dose clozapine and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Based on the possible role of the 5-HT 2A receptor in hallucinations, we treated her with the antihypertensive drug ketanserin, a 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist. This significantly reduced her visual but not her auditory hallucinations, suggesting a possible role of the 5HT 2A receptor in the pathophysiology of specifically visual hallucinations. This is the first time ketanserin has been described to successfully reduce visual hallucinations in a patient with schizophrenia.

### Opioid-induced hallucinations: a review of the literature, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^112TpfVc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Despite their association with multiple adverse effects, opioid prescription continues to increase. Opioid-induced hallucination is an uncommon yet significant adverse effect of opioid treatment. The practitioner may encounter patient reluctance to volunteer the occurrence of this phenomenon because of fears of being judged mentally unsound. The majority of the literature concerning opioid-induced hallucinations arises from treatment during end-of-life care and cancer pain. Because the rate of opioid prescriptions continues to increase in the population, the rate of opioid-associated hallucinations may also conceivably increase. With a forecasted increase in the patient-to-physician ratio, opioid therapy is predicted to be provided by practitioners of varying backgrounds and medical specialties. Hence, knowledge of the pharmacology and potential adverse effects of these agents is required. This review seeks to increase awareness of this potential complication through a discussion of the literature, potential mechanisms of action, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^11587qMM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope, exclusions, and target population — Patients with identifiable causative diagnoses of secondary tinnitus are excluded from this guideline, and clinicians should decide whether to apply these recommendations to patients with these conditions on an individualized basis; the guideline also excludes patients with pulsatile tinnitus, or tinnitus related to complex auditory hallucinations or hallucinations related to psychosis or epilepsy. The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus, with the target audience being any clinician, including nonphysicians, and the target patient population limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome. Regarding burden, in the United States the estimated prevalence of experiencing tinnitus at any time is 25.3% and experiencing frequent (almost always or at least once a day) tinnitus is 7.9%.

### Amantadine (Gocovri) [^113DW9JL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with GOCOVRI because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In controlled trials, the incidence of patients who experienced visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, delusions, illusions, or paranoia was 25% in patients treated with GOCOVRI 274 mg, and 3% in placebo-treated patients. Hallucinations caused discontinuation of treatment in 8% of GOCOVRI-treated patients, and in 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation, and after dose increases.

5.4 Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension

In controlled clinical trials, 29% of GOCOVRI-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients experienced dizziness, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, presyncope, postural dizziness or hypotension. In GOCOVRI-treated patients, 3% discontinued study treatment because of dizziness, postural dizziness, or syncope, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting GOCOVRI or increasing the dose. Concomitant use of alcohol when using GOCOVRI is not recommended [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

5.5 Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.

Abrupt discontinuation of GOCOVRI may cause an increase in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease or cause delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression, or slurred speech. It is recommended to avoid sudden discontinuation of GOCOVRI [see Dosing Information (2.4)].

### Combination loxapine and aripiprazole for refractory hallucinations in schizophrenia [^113DagwT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the effects of combining loxapine with aripiprazole for refractory hallucinations in 2 patients with chronic schizophrenia.

Case Summary

Two patients with schizophrenia and auditory hallucinations that were unresponsive to what was considered adequate treatment with multiple typical and atypical antipsychotic medications given over several years were prescribed a combination of aripiprazole 20–30 mg and high-dose loxapine (100–300 mg/day). Both patients had refused clozapine and depot antipsychotics. Aripiprazole/loxapine therapy resolved hallucinations in both patients, and discontinuation of either medication resulted in a return of persecutory voices. Breakthrough hallucinations in both individuals responded to increasing the loxapine dosage. Adverse effects included hypersalivation and tremor, which were treated with benztropine and propranolol. The patients also reported mild sedation, which resolved after several weeks of treatment. Both patients continued to do well during 2 years after starting this combination of medications.

Discussion

Recent research has indicated serotonergic and dopaminergic abnormalities in the superior temporal gyrus of patients with a history of chronic auditory hallucinations. Both loxapine and aripiprazole have effects on dopaminergic and postsynaptic serotonergic (5-HT₂A) receptor systems, which could account for synergistic effects in treating refractory hallucinations. The combination appears safe, even when loxapine is given in high dosages. Patients should be monitored for the development of parkinsonian tremors.

Conclusions

The combination of aripiprazole and high-dose loxapine should be considered in patients with schizophrenia who develop treatment-refractory hallucinations, particularly those who are unwilling to accept treatment with either depot antipsychotics or clozapine.

### Common and unique white matter fractional anisotropy patterns in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations: a retrospective tract-based spatial statistics study [^113ZmLfD]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations experienced by patients with schizophrenia are associated with unique WM tract abnormalities compared to treatment-responsive AVHs. Specifically, greater FA in the superior longitudinal tract may contribute to medication-resistant AVHs, whereas increased FA in the CC and visual radiation may be related to recovery. We suggest that interventions targeting the superior longitudinal tract is an effective treatment strategy for AVHs that are unresponsive to conventional antipsychotic drugs.

### Immersive virtual reality-assisted therapy targeting persistent auditory verbal hallucinations in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in Denmark: the challenge assessor-masked, randomised clinical trial [^115tYaD8]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Background

Auditory verbal hallucinations are among the most frequent and debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (henceforth termed schizophrenia), particularly in patients with treatment-resistant symptoms. Current treatment options have suboptimal response rates and innovative interventions are needed. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel immersive virtual reality-assisted therapy (Challenge-VRT) for auditory verbal hallucinations.

Methods

In this randomised, assessor-masked, parallel-group superiority clinical trial, patients with schizophrenia were recruited from outpatient psychiatric services across three Danish regions. Key inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, auditory verbal hallucinations for at least 3 months, and insufficient symptom response to antipsychotic medication. Exclusion criteria included being unable to identify a dominant voice, current substance dependence, and organic brain disorder. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via a secure web-based system using permuted blocks (block size 12), stratified by site and antipsychotic treatment. Allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. Participants were assigned to either Challenge-VRT (seven weekly immersive virtual reality sessions plus two booster sessions) or a control intervention of enhanced treatment-as-usual, matched in frequency and duration. Challenge-VRT was co-developed with individuals with lived experience of auditory verbal hallucinations. The primary outcome was clinician-rated auditory verbal hallucination severity measured by the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales-Auditory Hallucinations total score (PSYRATS-AH) at 12 weeks post baseline. Secondary outcomes were PSYRATS-AH frequency, PSYRATS-AH-Distress, The Voice Power Differential Scale, the Voices Acceptance and Action Scale, the Assertive Responding to Voices subscale from the Approve-Voices, and the Personal and Social Performance Scale, all at 12 weeks. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle and used linear mixed models. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04661163, and is now completed.

Findings

Between Nov 16, 2020, and June 14, 2023, 399 patients were referred for potential study inclusion, 62 patients were excluded (declined to participate or unable to be contacted), and 337 were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 66 did not meet the inclusion criteria. 271 participants were randomly assigned to Challenge-VRT (n = 140) or enhanced treatment-as-usual (n = 131). One participant was excluded post-randomisation, resulting in 270 included in the analysis of all outcomes. Participants had a mean age of 32.83 years (SD 11.9, range 18–72), 105 (39%) were male, and 165 (61%) were female. No data on ethnicity were collected. At 12 weeks, Challenge-VRT significantly reduced auditory verbal hallucination severity compared with enhanced treatment-as-usual on the PSYRATS-AH (adjusted mean difference -2.26 [95% CI -4.26 to -0.25]; p = 0.027; Cohen's d, 0.27). Among secondary outcomes, a significant reduction in PSYRATS-AH frequency was observed in the Challenge-VRT group at both 12 weeks (adjusted mean difference -0.84 [95% CI -1.53 to -0.14]; p = 0.018) and 24 weeks (adjusted mean difference -0.86 [95% CI -1.65 to -0.07]; p = 0.034). No significant differences were found for other secondary outcomes. The intervention was generally well tolerated. Six serious adverse events occurred that might have been related to the Challenge-VRT intervention (five cases of hospital admission due to exacerbation of auditory verbal hallucinations and one episode of self-harm). No deaths occurred during the trial.

Interpretation

Challenge-VRT showed short-term efficacy in reducing the severity of auditory verbal hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia, and the findings support further development and evaluation of immersive virtual reality-based therapies in this population.

### Hallucination focused integrative treatment: a randomized controlled trial [^116JZ8Jk]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Improvements in psychopathology, subjective burden, and coping with voices after hallucination focused integrative treatment (HIT) were studied in chronic schizophrenic patients with persistent (> 10 years), drug-refractory auditory hallucinations. In a randomized controlled trial, routine care was compared with HIT pre- and posttreatment at a 9-month interval. Independent raters used semistructured interviews to assess burden, symptoms, and coping. Within-group improvements in both burden and psychopathology were most significant in the experimental group (p < 0.05) after treatment. HIT patients showed change in applied coping strategies, but it did not reach statistical significance. Type and (change in) number of coping strategies did not seem related to outcome. The results suggest that HIT is a cost-effective practice that positively affects mental state in general, subjective burden, quality of life, and social functioning.

### Common and unique white matter fractional anisotropy patterns in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations: a retrospective tract-based spatial statistics study [^112eUEGo]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior studies on WM abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and AVHs have provided more data for further exploration of the specific WM features associated with medication-resistant AVHs. These studies have reported that AVHs in patients with schizophrenia exhibit different responses to antipsychotic therapy. For example, one study reported that the quetiapine and ziprasidone groups exhibited faster decreases in mean hallucination AVH scores than the risperidone group. Several studies reported that the response effect of AVH to antipsychotic agents was related to WM abnormalities (WM tract integrity and WM tract region alterations). More notably, we previously demonstrated that atypical antipsychotic treatment induced a gradual expansion in WM alterations in patients with persistent AVHs, although the AVHs were alleviated. These studies indicate that WM abnormalities are related both to AVH severity and the treatment effect of AVHs in patients with schizophrenia. Hence, further exploration of WM abnormalities associated with AVHs in patients with schizophrenia can provide more information for further exploration of treatment options for patients with treatment-resistant AVHs, subsequently improving these patients' prognosis.

Although approximately one-third of patients with schizophrenia exhibit medication-resistant AVHs, few studies have attempted to identify neuropathological features unique to this subpopulation. We speculated that such patients may exhibit unique regional WM abnormalities compared to patients with treatable AVHs. We conducted a retrospective study of neuroimaging data from our prior large cohort study in order to test this hypothesis. The current study was designed to test four specific hypotheses: (i) patients with schizophrenia and medication-resistant AVHs will demonstrate regional WM abnormalities compared to matched healthy controls (HCs); (ii) patients with schizophrenia and treatable AVHs will also demonstrate WM abnormalities compared to HCs, but these abnormalities will differ in regional pattern from those of patients with medication-resistant AVHs; (iii) the baseline WM abnormalities (before treatment) will differ between patients with medication-resistant and treatable AVHs; and (iv) the developmental trajectory of WM abnormalities from baseline to post-treatment (after 5 years of drug therapy) will also differ between patients with schizophrenia and medication-resistant and treatable AVHs.

### Common and unique white matter fractional anisotropy patterns in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations: a retrospective tract-based spatial statistics study [^115MB2ap]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are experienced by the majority of patients with schizophrenia and are often resistant to treatment with antipsychotic agents. White matter (WM) tract abnormalities are associated with AVH treatment efficacy. Using a retrospective design, 115 patients with schizophrenia with AVHs, 48 with medication-resistant AVHs and 67 with treatable AVHs, and 70 healthy controls (HCs) were selected from the database of our cohort study for 5-year follow-up assessment. WM tract integrity was measured using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) at baseline and after 5 years of antipsychotic agent treatment. The fractional anisotropy (FA) value was used to demonstrate WM tract alterations in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant AVHs, in patients with schizophrenia with treatable AVHs, and in HCs. Our data demonstrated that medication-resistant patients showed significantly greater FA values in the corpus callosum (CC) fasciculus at baseline and in the corticospinal tract post-treatment compared to HCs, but the baseline difference in the CC fasciculus was no longer significant after 5 years of antipsychotic agent treatment. The medication-resistant AVH group exhibited greater FA values in the superior longitudinal fasciculus after 5 years of antipsychotic agent treatment. Compared to the HC group, the treatable AVH group exhibited significantly greater FA values in the visual radiation and CC after 5 years of antipsychotic agent treatment. In the medication-resistant and treatable groups, common WM tract abnormalities were noted, as greater FA values were observed in the CC group at baseline compared to the HC group. At the same time, distinct abnormalities were noted, as greater FA values were observed in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, which may contribute to medication-resistant AVHs, whereas abnormalities in the CC fasciculus may contribute to both treatable and medication-resistant AVHs. In the HCs, a decrease in FA values in the posterior CC was observed after 5 years of observation compared to baseline. In summary, patients with treatment-resistant AVHs with schizophrenia and patients with treatable AVHs with schizophrenia have common and distinct abnormalities in the WM tract.

### Psychological therapies for auditory hallucinations (voices): current status and key directions for future research [^111Ec97M]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Extending Beyond Schizophrenia and Beyond Voices

It is similarly important to note that voices span diagnostic categories, yet therapies have been developed primarily for persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Auditory hallucinations have been documented in PTSD with a prevalence of 40%–50%; 37% in bipolar 1 disorder, 30% in borderline personality disorder; 10%–23% in major depression; 14% in obsessive compulsive disorder; 14% in dementia; and 10% in Parkinson disease. The focus to date on schizophrenia spectrum disorders likely reflects these being the diagnoses in which they are regarded a primary symptom, rather than secondary or comorbid feature, and hence a priority treatment target. However, there remains a need to consider how to intervene with voices in the context of other presentations. It is notable that voice characteristics can be broadly similar across different diagnostic groups. However, assumptions that methods will generalize to non-schizophrenia populations, such as those with borderline personality or dissociative disorder diagnoses, are yet to be tested.

Similarly, voice experience needs to be considered in conjunction with the co-occurrence of hallucinatory experiences in other sensory modalities, which have been neglected within the therapy literature until only very recently.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112GG84p]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — mental health, cognition, and core clinical evaluation elements include table-directed actions and narrative guidance. For mental health symptoms, the table lists "Referral to mental health professionals for assessment and treatment of depression and/or anxiety; urgent referral for suicidal patients", and for apparent cognitive impairments, "The presence of dementia will affect the results of tinnitus and audiologic assessments". The guideline further states that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties" and that "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL" with characteristics "including laterality and pulsatile nature". It advises that "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded" and that "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus", with "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications" and "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use" to be discussed or elicited. It adds that "An appropriate clinical evaluation should occur early to direct the need for and the type of additional testing and treatment" and that "the patient encounter should identify any severe coexisting mental illness, such as depression or dementia, as these patients may need expedited referral and management", while noting that "the examination should be directed to identify secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Carbon dioxide induction of panic anxiety in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations [^116BMzBS]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

Panic is commonly co-morbid with schizophrenia. Panic may emerge prodromally, contribute to specific psychotic symptoms, and predict medication response. Panic is often missed due to agitation, impaired cognition, psychotic symptom overlap and limited clinician awareness. Carbon dioxide exposure has been used reliably to induce panic in non-psychotic panic subjects, but has not been systematically studied in schizophrenia. Eight inpatients with schizophrenia, recent auditory hallucinations, none preselected for panic, all on antipsychotic medication, received a structured Panic and Schizophrenia Interview (PaSI), assessing DSM-IV panic symptoms concurrent with paroxysmal auditory hallucinations. On that interview, all eight subjects reported panic concurrent with auditory hallucinations. At one sitting, subjects were exposed, in random order, to 35% carbon dioxide and to placebo room air, blinded to condition. All subjects experienced panic to carbon dioxide, one with limited symptoms. Only one subject panicked to placebo. One subject (one of only two without antipanic medication) had paroxysmal voices concurrent with induced panic. With added adjunctive clonazepam, that patient had marked clinical improvement and no response to carbon dioxide re-challenge. This first systematic examination offers preliminary evidence that carbon dioxide safely induces panic symptoms in schizophrenia. Panic may be prevalent and pathophysiologically significant in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations.

### Common and unique white matter fractional anisotropy patterns in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations: a retrospective tract-based spatial statistics study [^116ptbd9]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have confirmed that medication-resistant AVHs are highly prevalent in patients with schizophrenia. AVHs are reported by 70 to 80% of patients with schizophrenia, approximately 20 to 40% of whom demonstrate an unfavorable response to antipsychotic medications. Although all of these studies acknowledge that WM abnormalities play a pivotal role in the pathological mechanisms of AVHs –, and some have reported that WM abnormalities are associated with the treatment response to AVHs, limited studies have reported that WM abnormalities are associated with the effects of therapeutic strategies for treating AVHs. Against this background, exploring the pathological brain features of patients with medication-resistant AVHs can provide useful information for developing effective treatment strategies for treatment-resistant AVHs.

Although a growing number of studies have investigated the pathological features of WM tract alterations in patients with schizophrenia who have AVHs, to the best of our knowledge, limited studies have investigated WM alterations in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant AVHs. In fact, WM tract abnormalities play a pivotal role in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant AVHs from the perspective of brain informatics. Indeed, prior studies have reported that the AVH treatment response is related to WM tract abnormalities. A prior study that examined the ability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r-TMS) to induce reorganizational changes within the WM rich-club structural network in schizophrenia shed light on the potential mechanisms through which r-TMS may alleviate AVHs. Another study reported that local alterations of WM integrity abnormalities in the left arcuate fasciculus and in the language pathway in patients with schizophrenia with AVHs are related to medication resistance. Leroux et al. reported that decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the interhemispheric auditory pathway (IAP) was observed in patients with schizophrenia who had lifelong AVHs. These and other studies on the relationship between medication resistance and treatment of AVHs and WM abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia,– indicate that WM plays a pivotal role in AVH treatment response in patients with schizophrenia. Hence, investigating WM abnormalities utilizing MRI techniques can help identify the means of treating medication-resistant AVHs in patients with schizophrenia.

### Common and unique white matter fractional anisotropy patterns in patients with schizophrenia with medication-resistant auditory verbal hallucinations: a retrospective tract-based spatial statistics study [^112FUF7z]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are reported by 70–80% of patients with schizophrenia, and approximately 20–40% of these patients demonstrate an unfavorable response to available antipsychotic medications. These medication-resistant AVHs markedly interfere with normal social function and degrade quality of life. As a treatment, these AVHs are frequently addressed by increasing the dose of antipsychotic medication, which in turn can exacerbate drug side effects. Numerous studies have investigated the pathological features of medication-resistant AVHs to identify risk factors – and alternative treatment methods –; however, the underlying neuropathology remains obscure –. Numerous studies have been conducted into white matter (WM) pathological features in patients with schizophrenia over the last two decades. These studies have provided numerous constructive findings for further exploring the brain features of patients with schizophrenia and information for precise treatment and establishment of strategies. Studies into schizophrenia have reported numerous gray matter features specific to schizophrenic symptoms, such as AVHs –, rather than WM features, due to the difficulty of investigating the brain features of patients with AVHs –. However, with advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of WM tract abnormalities, a growing number of studies have focused on investigating the relationship between WM tract alterations and AVHs –. The majority of these studies have indicated that WM abnormalities in the corpus callosum (CC) area, uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, postcentral and superior parietal lobule, arcuate fasciculus, interhemispheric fasciculi, and interhemispheric auditory pathway (IAP), as well as in tracts connecting the language, auditory, and memory/limbic networks and cingulum bundle and rich-club reorganization of WM structural network, are the pivotal brain pathological features of patients with schizophrenia with AVHs. As such, these studies have provided evidence that structures associated with WM abnormalities and neuronal activity are associated with treatment response.

### A randomized, sham-controlled study of high frequency rTMS for auditory hallucination in schizophrenia [^112D4VaN]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) in patients with schizophrenia are sometimes resistant to standard pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be a promising treatment modality for AVHs, but the best protocol has yet to be identified. We used a double-blind randomized sham-controlled design aimed at 30 patients (active group N = 16 vs. sham group N = 14) with chronic AVHs that persisted regardless of adequate pharmacotherapy. The protocol was a total of four sessions of high-frequency (20-Hz) rTMS targeting the left temporoparietal cortex over 2 days (total 10,400 stimulations) administered to each patient. After the rTMS session the patients were followed for 4 weeks and evaluated with the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS). The mean changes of AHRS score were 22.9 (baseline) to 18.4 (4th week) in the Active group and 24.2 (baseline) to 21.8 (4th week) in the Sham group, indicating no significant difference by mix model analysis. As regards other secondary end points (each subscore of AHRS, BPRS, GAF and CGI-S), none of these parameters showed a significant between-group difference. The present study's rTMS protocol was ineffective for our patients. However, several previous studies demonstrated that high-frequency rTMS is a possible strategy to ameliorate pharmacotherapy-resistant AVH. It is important to establish a high-frequency rTMS protocol with more reliability.

### What happened to the voices? A fine-grained analysis of how hallucinations and delusions change under psychiatric treatment [^1142F9fx]. Psychiatry Research (2011). Low credibility.

The Psychiatric Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS) have demonstrated their usefulness for the dimensional assessment of hallucinations and delusions. However, there is no evaluated German version of the PSYRATS to date. Also, in spite of theoretical conceptions about "detaching" effects of antipsychotics, there are few consolidated findings about how core symptomatic aspects of schizophrenia change during antipsychotic treatment. The present study aimed to fill this gap. A total of 40 schizophrenic voice-hearers were interviewed three times during the course of six months using a newly developed German version of the PSYRATS with very good psychometric properties. At the same time, psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In the longitudinal course, a general symptomatic decrease became apparent only for auditory hallucinations but not for delusions. Specifically, the loudness of the hallucinated voices as well as the associated distress decreased early, while other aspects of the hallucinations took more time to fade. In this study, the PSYRATS proved to be a valuable tool for measuring the change of specific symptom dimensions. However, our results only partially supported the notion of a general detachment from symptoms due to psychiatric treatment.

### Psychological therapies for auditory hallucinations (voices): current status and key directions for future research [^1136hNAR]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

This report from the International Consortium on Hallucinations Research considers the current status and future directions in research on psychological therapies targeting auditory hallucinations (hearing voices). Therapy approaches have evolved from behavioral and coping-focused interventions, through formulation-driven interventions using methods from cognitive therapy, to a number of contemporary developments. Recent developments include the application of acceptance- and mindfulness-based approaches, and consolidation of methods for working with connections between voices and views of self, others, relationships and personal history. In this article, we discuss the development of therapies for voices and review the empirical findings. This review shows that psychological therapies are broadly effective for people with positive symptoms, but that more research is required to understand the specific application of therapies to voices. Six key research directions are identified: (1) moving beyond the focus on overall efficacy to understand specific therapeutic processes targeting voices, (2) better targeting psychological processes associated with voices such as trauma, cognitive mechanisms, and personal recovery, (3) more focused measurement of the intended outcomes of therapy, (4) understanding individual differences among voice hearers, (5) extending beyond a focus on voices and schizophrenia into other populations and sensory modalities, and (6) shaping interventions for service implementation.

### Non-invasive brain stimulation augmentation therapy for treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115zqK1R]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotic medications have been the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment since their introduction in the 1950s. However, a substantial proportion of individuals exhibit inadequate response to these drugs, a condition termed treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Estimates suggest that approximately a third of the individuals with schizophrenia do not respond adequately to antipsychotics.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, modulating brain activity using electrical currents or magnetic fields without surgical intervention, are potential adjunctive treatments for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Among them, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST) utilise magnetic fields to induce electric currents in the brain, while transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) — primarily transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) — and electroconvulsive therapy apply direct or alternating electrical currents to stimulate neural activity. NIBS applications have been guided by symptom-specific targets implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Temporoparietal cortex regions are commonly stimulated with so-called inhibitory protocols to reduce auditory hallucinations, while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is targeted with 'excitatory' protocols to improve negative symptoms, though the terms 'excitatory' and 'inhibitory' parameters are not fully valid in terms of their complex neurophysiology and individual differences. Although concerns persist about their efficacy and safety, electroconvulsive therapy and rTMS are recommended by some guidelines due to high non-response rates to antipsychotics and limited alternative interventions.

It is unclear whether different NIBS techniques are associated with symptom improvement in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses are out of date, limited to single interventions (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy or rTMS), did not use network meta-analysis, and lacked focus on treatment-resistant populations. Additionally, most trials have only compared NIBS techniques against sham stimulation and few against other NIBS techniques. Multiple Chinese studies have explored the efficacy of NIBS in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but their findings have not been systematically integrated into the global evidence base. Therefore, employing a network meta-analysis, which combines both direct and indirect comparisons of treatments in a single analysis, could provide more comprehensive insights.

To our knowledge, no network meta-analysis has been performed comparing NIBS techniques for the treatment of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of different NIBS techniques.

### Functional connectivity of the temporo-parietal region in schizophrenia: effects of rTMS treatment of auditory hallucinations [^114LRged]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2010). Low credibility.

Auditory-verbal hallucinations are a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia. In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting speech perception areas has been advanced as a potential treatment of medication-resistant hallucinations. However, the underlying neural processes remain unclear. This study aimed to assess whether 1 Hz rTMS treatment would affect functional connectivity of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Resting state fMRI scans were obtained from 18 patients with schizophrenia. Patients were assessed before and after a 6 day treatment with 1 Hz rTMS to the left TPJ, or placebo treatment with sham rTMS to the same location. We assessed functional connectivity between a priori defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) comprising the putative AVH network and the bilateral TPJ seed regions, targeted with rTMS. Symptom improvement following rTMS treatment was observed in the left rTMS group, whereas no change at occurred in the placebo group. Although no corresponding changes were observed in the functional connections previously found to be associated with AVH severity, an increase in connectivity between the left TPJ and the right insula was observed in group receiving rTMS to the left TPJ. The placebo group conversely showed a decrease in connectivity between the left TPJ and left anterior cingulate. We conclude that application of 1 Hz rTMS to the left TPJ region may affect functional connectivity of the targeted region. However, the relationship between these functional changes during the resting state and the rate of clinical improvement needs further clarification.

### Hallucinations in critically ill patients: understanding the unreal [^115XLvjo]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations are perceptual experiences that occur in the absence of an external stimulus and can involve any of the five sensory modalities: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile. Auditory and visual hallucinations are the most common forms encountered clinically. These phenomena may manifest as hearing voices, seeing images, or perceiving sensations that do not correspond with any external reality. Hallucinations are frequently associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, neurological disorders such as Parkinson disease, severe sleep deprivation, or substance intoxication and withdrawal. They may also occur in individuals with sensory impairments, such as hearing or vision loss, where the brain may generate internal stimuli in response to the sensory deficit. The content of hallucinations can vary significantly, from benign to distressing or threatening, and may cause substantial psychological distress to the patient. The pathophysiology underlying hallucinations is not fully understood but is believed to involve dysregulation of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, and abnormal activity in brain regions responsible for sensory processing. Common risk factors or hallucinations are presented in the Table 1.

Table 1
Risk factors for hallucinations

The ICU environment likely increases the risk of hallucinations due to multiple factors that disrupt normal cognitive function. Sleep deprivation is common in ICU patients, caused by frequent interruptions, noise, and continuous light exposure, which can precipitate delirium and hallucinations. Sensory overload from persistent alarms, machinery noise, and healthcare staff activity can overwhelm the sensory processing of patients, leading to perceptual distortions. Social and physical isolation in the ICU contributes to psychological stress and anxiety, further predisposing patients to hallucinations. Medications frequently administered in the ICU, including sedatives, analgesics, and anticholinergics, are known to have neuropsychiatric side effects, including hallucinations. Additionally, severe infections and metabolic disturbances, can impair cognitive function and contribute to delirium and associated hallucinations. The disorienting nature of the ICU — characterized by unfamiliar surroundings, lack of natural light, and frequent staff changes — further challenges patients' ability to distinguish between reality and hallucinations.

### Unravelling the genetic and molecular basis of low-frequency rTMS induced changes in functional connectivity density in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations [^112GunYw]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive impairments, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 0.7% and substantial associated disability. Among its hallmark symptoms, auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) defined as sensory experiences occurring without external stimulation, are particularly prevalent and persistent, affecting up to 70% of individuals with schizophrenia. Although antipsychotic medications remain the cornerstone of treatment for, AVH often persist in many patients, and these medications can induce significant side effects, inducing weight gain, sedation, dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia. These limitations highlight the urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for psychiatric disorders. Low-frequency rTMS targeting the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ) has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating both the frequency and severity of AVH. In particular, 1 Hz stimulation is believed to exert an inhibitory effect on cortical excitability, thereby mitigating hyperactivity in the auditory cortex, which critically involved in the generation and persistence of AVH. Meta-analyses further corroborate the therapeutic benefits of low-frequency (1 Hz) rTMS stimulation in reducing AV symptoms. The proposed mechanism suggests that rTMS normalizes aberrant cortical excitability and connectivity underlying the pathology of AVH. For instance, studies utilizing 1 Hz rTMS directed at the left TPJ have reported increased connectivity between the stimulation site and the right insula, alongside reduced connectivity with the right temporal lobes in patients receiving active stimulation. Specifically, functional connectivity density (FCD) analysis, a data-driven method that quantifies the number of connections between a given voxel and all other voxels in the brain, provides highly sensitive to individual variations in connectivity and holds potential as a biomarker for schizophrenia. Previous research has shown that maintenance rTMS targeting the left dorsal prefrontal cortex, when combined with electroconvulsive therapy and olanzapine, enhances FCD in the left prefrontal lobe, parietal lobe, and insular lobe in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. These findings indicate that rTMS can modulate activity within targeted cortical sites and their associated networks, potentially contributing to symptom amelioration. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of rTMS on AVH in schizophrenia.

### Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on auditory hallucinations refractory to clozapine [^113GjzES]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the therapeutic effects on auditory hallucinations refractory to clozapine with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied on the left temporoparietal cortex.

Method

Eleven patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) experiencing auditory hallucinations (unresponsive to clozapine) were randomly assigned to receive either active of rTMS (N = 6) or sham stimulation (N = 5) (with concomitant use of clozapine) using a double-masked, sham-controlled, parallel design. A total of 160 minutes of rTMS (9600 pulses) was administered over 10 days at 90% motor threshold. The study was conducted from January 2003 to December 2005.

Results

There was a reduction in hallucination scores in both groups, which persisted during follow-up in the active group for the items reality (p = .0493) and attentional salience (p = .0360). Both groups showed similar patterns of symptomatic changes on subscales (negative symptoms, general psychopathology) and total scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impressions scale, and Visual Analog Scale.

Conclusion

Active rTMS in association with clozapine can be administered safely to treat auditory hallucinations, although its clinical utility is still questionable. No significant clinical effects were observed in the sample studied, possibly because it was too small and/or due to its high refractoriness.

### AVATAR therapy for auditory verbal hallucinations in people with psychosis: a single-blind, randomised controlled trial [^114BSARz]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

A quarter of people with psychotic conditions experience persistent auditory verbal hallucinations, despite treatment. AVATAR therapy (invented by Julian Leff in 2008) is a new approach in which people who hear voices have a dialogue with a digital representation (avatar) of their presumed persecutor, voiced by the therapist so that the avatar responds by becoming less hostile and concedes power over the course of therapy. We aimed to investigate the effect of AVATAR therapy on auditory verbal hallucinations, compared with a supportive counselling control condition.

Methods

We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial at a single clinical location (South London and Maudsley NHS Trust). Participants were aged 18 to 65 years, had a clinical diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum (ICD10 F20–29) or affective disorder (F30–39 with psychotic symptoms), and had enduring auditory verbal hallucinations during the previous 12 months, despite continued treatment. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive AVATAR therapy or supportive counselling with randomised permuted blocks (block size randomly varying between two and six). Assessments were done at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks, by research assessors who were masked to therapy allocation. The primary outcome was reduction in auditory verbal hallucinations at 12 weeks, measured by total score on the Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scales Auditory Hallucinations (PSYRATS–AH). Analysis was by intention-to-treat with linear mixed models. The trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 65314790.

Findings

Between Nov 1, 2013, and Jan 28, 2016, 394 people were referred to the study, of whom 369 were assessed for eligibility. Of these people, 150 were eligible and were randomly assigned to receive either AVATAR therapy (n = 75) or supportive counselling (n = 75). 124 (83%) met the primary outcome. The reduction in PSYRATS–AH total score at 12 weeks was significantly greater for AVATAR therapy than for supportive counselling (mean difference −3.82 [SE 1.47], 95% CI −6.70 to −0.94; p < 0.0093). There was no evidence of any adverse events attributable to either therapy.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the first powered, randomised controlled trial of AVATAR therapy. This brief, targeted therapy was more effective after 12 weeks of treatment than was supportive counselling in reducing the severity of persistent auditory verbal hallucinations, with a large effect size. Future multi-centre studies are needed to establish the effectiveness of AVATAR therapy and, if proven effective, we think it should become an option in the psychological treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations.

### Antipsychotic medication treatment for mild hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: positive impact on long-term worsening [^111zGRFW]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

To test if antipsychotic medication treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild hallucinations and retained insight delays deterioration to delusions or hallucinations without insight. We identified subjects at the time they developed their first hallucination, based on documented progression in their UPDRS thought disorder (TD) score from < 2 to 2 ("benign" hallucinations with insight retained). We registered TD scores at follow-up visits and their hallucination treatment: antipsychotic medication, PD medication reduction, or observation. The primary outcome measure was the time from the first TD = 2 until the TD score worsened to 3 (hallucinations with loss of insight) or 4 (delusions, psychosis). The effect of antipsychotic medication treatment on transition hazard rate was modeled by proportional hazards regression (Cox model) with antipsychotic medication use as a time-dependent covariate. Of 64 patients, 31 received antipsychotic medication during the study (mean group follow-up 31 months). Of the 38 subjects who reached endpoint, eight subjects had been treated with antipsychotic medication compared to 30/33 in those not treated with antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic medication treatment reduced the risk of deterioration [hazard ratio = 0.156, CI = (0.067–0.363), P < 0.0001] compared to treatment without antipsychotic medications. The median time from the introduction of antipsychotic medication to the conversion from TD = 2 to TD > 2 was 39 months in subjects on antipsychotic medication compared to 12 months in patients treated otherwise. Until randomized treatment trials provide definitive information, early antipsychotic medication treatment for mild hallucinations should be considered with the combined goal of improving current hallucinations and reducing risks of later deterioration.

### Opicapone (Ongentys) [^112Cygee]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Dyskinesia

ONGENTYS potentiates the effects of levodopa [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and may cause dyskinesia or exacerbate pre-existing dyskinesia.

In controlled clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2) [see Clinical Studies (14)], dyskinesia occurred in 20% of patients treated with ONGENTYS 50 mg compared to 6% of patients who received placebo. Dyskinesia was also the most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of ONGENTYS [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Reducing the patient's daily levodopa dosage or the dosage of another dopaminergic drug may mitigate dyskinesia that occurs during treatment with ONGENTYS.

5.5 Hallucinations and Psychosis

In Study 1 and Study 2, hallucinations (hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, mixed hallucinations) occurred in 3% of patients treated with ONGENTYS 50 mg compared to 1% of patients who received placebo. Delusions, agitation, or aggressive behavior occurred in 1% of patients treated with ONGENTYS 50 mg, and in no patient who received placebo. Consider stopping ONGENTYS if hallucinations or psychotic-like behaviors occur.

Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ONGENTYS because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis with an increase in central dopaminergic tone. In addition, treatments for psychosis that antagonize the effects of dopaminergic medications may exacerbate the symptoms of PD.

### Hallucinations in critically ill patients: understanding the unreal [^112VitUa]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of hallucinations remains challenging in the ICU, as no specific tool has been designed to quantify this symptom at the bedside. Among commonly used scales, the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) includes a qualitative evaluation of hallucinations. The management of hallucinations focuses on addressing the underlying cause, utilizing non-pharmacological interventions such as reorientation, sleep regulation, and sensory overload reduction. Antipsychotics should be considered only when necessary, particularly for psychiatric conditions.

A recent study multicenter study investigated the prevalence of hallucinations in ICU patients, and their potential association with outcome. Using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the medical charts of > 7,500 patients admitted to three medical-surgical ICUs over a 6 year period, the authors found that hallucinations were relatively common, occurring in 8% of cases. Of note, previous single-center studies reported hallucinations in 7–16% of patients during ICU stay. Patients who developed hallucinations were younger, more severely ill, and more likely to have preexisting cirrhosis and/or liver failure. Although the number of patients admitted from mental health facilities was similar between the groups, the number of patients with chronic mental health disorders (i.e. bipolar disorder or schizophrenia) was higher in the group of patients who experienced hallucinations. Hallucinations were mostly visual and less frequently auditory, occurred early, and were strongly associated disturbed behavior on the same day. Interestingly, the authors also identified ICU-related factors associated with hallucinations. Specifically, the use of ketamine and dexmedetomidine were much higher among patients who developed hallucinations. Moreover, such treatments were administered before onset of hallucinations in most cases. Conversely, patients who developed hallucinations were most likely to be treated with antipsychotics (atypical antipsychotics or haloperidol) while in ICU, and such treatments were frequently administered after hallucination onset. Compared to patients without hallucinations, patients with hallucinations had similar ICU and hospital trajectories, and similar mortality rates. Unfortunately, long term outcomes, including cognitive function, and neuropsychological consequences in survivors were not assessed.

### Auditory hallucinations induced by trazodone [^1171n8rv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 26-year-old female outpatient presenting with a depressive state suffered from auditory hallucinations at night. Her auditory hallucinations did not respond to blonanserin or paliperidone, but partially responded to risperidone. In view of the possibility that her auditory hallucinations began after starting trazodone, trazodone was discontinued, leading to a complete resolution of her auditory hallucinations. Furthermore, even after risperidone was decreased and discontinued, her auditory hallucinations did not recur. These findings suggest that trazodone may induce auditory hallucinations in some susceptible patients.

### Theta burst stimulation of temporo-parietal cortex regions for the treatment of persistent auditory hallucinations: a multicentre, randomised, sham-controlled, triple-blind phase 3 trial in Germany [^11628XS3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Background

Auditory verbal hallucinations are a major burden for patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and are often resistant to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the temporo-parietal cortex has been proposed as a treatment for persistent auditory verbal hallucinations. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of bilateral continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a brief and efficient form of rTMS, in adults with auditory verbal hallucinations versus sham cTBS.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, sham-controlled, triple-blind phase 3 clinical trial was conducted at seven German psychiatric university hospitals and followed a planned two-stage adaptive design. Eligible patients were aged 18–65 years, had experienced persistent auditory verbal hallucinations at least once per week for a minimum of 3 months, and scored 3 points or higher on item P3 (hallucinatory behaviour) of the clinician-rated Positive Scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). 138 adults with treatment-persistent auditory verbal hallucinations and schizophrenia spectrum disorder were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 15 sessions of active (n = 70) or sham cTBS (n = 68) administered sequentially as 600 pulses to the left and 600 pulses to the right temporo-parietal cortex over a 3-week period. The primary outcome was the change in the auditory hallucinations subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS-AH) from baseline to the end of treatment at 3 weeks, analysed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients who received at least one stimulation session. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one stimulation session. Follow-up assessments were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of treatment. People with lived experience were not involved in the study. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02670291.

Findings

Between Oct 24, 2015, and May 1, 2023, 2583 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 138 patients were randomly assigned to active cTBS (n = 70; 32 [46%] females and 38 [54%] males) or sham treatment (n = 68; 24 [35%] females and 44 [65%] males). Race and ethnicity data were not collected. The primary intention-to-treat analysis (66 patients in the active cTBS group; 64 patients in the sham cTBS group), combining stages 1 and 2, showed patients in the active cTBS group had a significantly greater decrease in the PSYRATS-AH score at end of treatment than did patients in the sham cTBS group (-6.36 [SD 7.97] vs -3.74 [SD 5.79]; adjusted difference -2.36 [95% CI -4.71 to -0.01]; p = 0.042). Overall, 85 adverse events (43 in the active cTBS group; 42 in the sham cTBS group) were reported in 22 (33%) of 66 patients in the active cTBS group and 21 (33%) of 64 patients in the sham cTBS group. Headache was the most common adverse event in both groups (n = 13 active cTBS group vs n = 17 sham cTBS group). One serious adverse event occurred in the active group.

Interpretation

Sequential bilateral temporo-parietal cTBS over 3 weeks was safe and effective for reducing auditory verbal hallucinations in adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This trial establishes cTBS as a treatment option for the care of these patients. Further research is needed to evaluate maintenance strategies, identify treatment predictors, and assess long-term efficacy.

### Cognitive behavioural therapy in clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (FOCUS): an assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial [^113zY8wA]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Although the benefit of CBT was significant at the end of the treatment (9 months), CBT had no lasting effect on total psychiatric symptoms in clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (at 21 months). This is similar to the observed effects of medications for people with psychosis, which also diminish when treatment ends. The observed average reductions in PANSS total score were lower than the 15 points estimated to be equivalent to a rating of minimal improvement on the CGI scale. The effects on PANSS positive symptoms, PANSS emotional distress, and auditory hallucinations (PSYRATS total) by the end of the treatment show that CBT can change psychotic symptoms, as well as negative emotions, in a large, well conducted, assessor-blind clinical trial. This finding suggests that claims that such effects cannot be replicated under these conditionsare unfounded. The effect sizes observed in the FOCUS trial are similar to those found across all heterogeneous but rigorous CBT trials when meta-analysed. The effect sizes are also similar to those found for pharmacological augmentation of clozapine with a second antipsychotic. However, our trial provides stronger evidence, with less risk of bias than the few, small, short-duration, high risk of bias trials in meta-analyses of augmentation with antipsychotics. The adverse effect profile for CBT is also likely to be favourable when compared with the cardiovascular risks associated with multiple antipsychotic medications. Some small lasting effects were observed at 21 months, including on self-rated recovery, which is important to service users; however, these effects are unlikely to reach a threshold of clinically important change.

### Effects of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on treatment resistant auditory-verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial [^116bWyTi]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroimaging findings implicate bilateral superior temporal regions in the genesis of auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH). This study aimed to investigate whether 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the bilateral temporo-parietal region would lead to increased effectiveness in the management of AVH, compared to left rTMS or placebo.

Methods

38 patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) and medication-resistant AVH were randomly assigned to 1 Hz rTMS treatment of the left temporo-parietal region, bilateral temporo-parietal regions, or placebo. Stimulation was conducted over 6 days, twice daily for 20 min, at 90% of the motor threshold. Effect measures included the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS), Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), and a score for hallucination severity obtained from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).

Results

All groups showed some improvement on the total AHRS. Hallucination frequency was significantly reduced in the left rTMS group only. The bilateral rTMS group demonstrated the most remarkable reduction in self-reported affective responsiveness to AVH. A modest, but significant decrease on the PANSS hallucination item was observed in the combined rTMS treatment group, whereas no change occurred in the placebo group. The left rTMS group showed a significant reduction on the general psychopathology subscale.

Conclusion

Compared to bilateral or sham stimulation, rTMS of the left temporo-parietal region appears most effective in reducing auditory hallucinations, and additionally may have an effect on general psychopathology. Placebo effects should however not be ruled out, since sham stimulation also led to improvement on a number of AVH parameters.

### Can typical and atypical antipsychotics show differential effectiveness in treating paranoia and hallucinations in schizophrenia? [^116KDPFz]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A dopamine excess is thought to be involved in positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. All current antipsychotics show a degree of dopamine receptor antagonism. Little is known about the differential effectiveness of different antipsychotics in treating specific sets of symptoms. We report the case of a 35-year-old man with schizophrenia who presented with prominent hallucinatory symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] P1 = 5, P3 = 5, P6 = 5) resistant to high doses of a dopamine, serotonin receptor antagonist, olanzapine. Switching from olanzapine to zuclopenthixol, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, led to a complete shift of his symptomatology: his hallucinations abated, however, he presented as very highly paranoid (PANSS P1 = 6, P3 = 2, P6 = 7). On a combination of both antipsychotics, his symptoms subsided (PANSS P1 = 3, P3 = 2, P6 = 2). We discuss the potential for differential effectiveness of different antipsychotic medications in treating hallucinations and paranoia. We argue that future studies could address this question by stratifying patients based on symptoms.

### Visual hallucinations in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism [^112AD84D]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Hallucinations in Parkinson's disease

Visual experiences account for the majority of hallucinations in PD and DLB, and only a small proportion of patients report auditory, tactile or olfactory hallucinations. Most authors have focused on the appearance of formed VH which are predominantly of people, animals or objects. These are generally described as solid images which may be still or moving, and may be miniaturised in up to 35% of cases. One-third of patients report hallucinations lasting for hours at a time.

A prodromal syndrome of minor hallucinations probably precedes the emergence of formed VH. These brief experiences include visual illusions, extracampine hallucinations (or 'presence' hallucinations, the sense of a presence in the room, often behind or beside the patient) or passage hallucinations (sense of movement in the periphery). These experiences are often not reported by patients as hallucinations, and must be sought on direct questioning. The majority of patients report that hallucinations appear when they have their eyes open, particularly in dim lighting or at the end of the day.

Most patients are aware of the hallucinatory nature of their experiences, with insight maintained in all non-demented and 64% of demented patients in one series. They are often not perceived as frightening, although when they do become so the behavioural disturbance that may ensue is likely to have significant impact on care needs and are likely the explanation for the significant contribution of hallucinations to the rate of nursing home placement. The presence of hallucinations correlates with the incidence of major depression, and are associated with increasing age, sleep disturbance, depressionand cognitive disturbance.

The relationship between VH and dopaminergic medications in PD is complex. VH were occasionally reported in PD before the availability of dopaminergic medication. Conflicting reports have shown both a positiveand no association between dopaminergic medication dose and the appearance of VH. Most medications used in the treatment of PD, including dopaminergic, anticholinergic and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may also induce delirium.

In one retrospective series, eight patients developed hallucinations in the setting of dopamine agonist use for pituitary tumours which translated to a rate of 1% in that series of 600 patients. The hallucinations reported were predominantly auditory and associated with paranoid delusions and all patients had resolution of their psychotic symptoms with reduction or withdrawal of the medication. This suggests that while dopaminergic medication may have some inherent hallucinatory potential, the much higher rate of hallucinations seen in parkinsonian patients implies hallucinations develop as part of the disease process.

### Impact of antipsychotic medication on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) effects in schizophrenia patients [^112kywtF]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has generated interest as a treatment modality for schizophrenia. Dopamine, a critical pathogenetic link in schizophrenia, is also known to influence tDCS effects. We evaluated the influence of antipsychotic drug type (as defined by dopamine D2 receptor affinity) on the impact of tDCS in schizophrenia. DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed schizophrenia patients [N = 36] with persistent auditory hallucinations despite adequate antipsychotic treatment were administered add-on tDCS. Patients were divided into three groups based on the antipsychotic's affinity to D2 receptors. An auditory hallucinations score (AHS) was measured using the auditory hallucinations subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS). Add-on tDCS resulted in a significant reduction inAHS. Antipsychotic drug type had a significant effect on AHS reduction. Patients treated with high affinity antipsychotics showed significantly lesser improvement compared to patients on low affinity antipsychotics or a mixture of the two. Furthermore, a significant sex-by-group interaction occurred; type of medication had an impact on tDCS effects only in women. Improvement differences could be due to the larger availability of the dopamine receptor system in patients taking antipsychotics with low D2 affinity. Sex-specific differences suggest potential estrogen-mediated effects. This study reports a first-time observation on the clinical utility of antipsychotic drug type in predicting tDCS effects in schizophrenia.

### Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial with gamma-band transcranial alternating current stimulation for the treatment of schizophrenia refractory auditory hallucinations [^114VaT5P]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations to this work. First, the study conducted was a small-scale pilot investigation intended for exploration purposes with limited statistical power for identifying effect sizes except those that were significant. Specifically, we acknowledge that the non-significant baseline differences of auditory hallucinations and the relatively small sample size may have impacted the overall findings. However, in contrast to previous studies, our study fully considered the mechanism of action of tACS, detecting symptoms and neurophysiological changes in patients with schizophrenia at multiple key time points. Second, due to irresistible factors, both EEG signal acquisitions during the treatment period were made after the end of tACS with a short time interval of approximately one hour. Therefore, the immediate effect caused by tACS cannot be completely eliminated. Third, as this was a small pilot study, our results could have been influenced by factors such as medication, therapy, duration of illness, etc. Fourth, in order not to influence our subsequent follow-up results, we did not perform the assessment of blinding. Therefore, our experiments cannot entirely eliminate the influence of individual differences in the subjective perception of various stimuli. Finally, the results for functional connectivity and controllability showed significant differences only at post-treatment (week4), and there were no significant differences in the results at week2 or follow-up. This demonstrated that four weeks of stimulation had yet to alter synaptic plasticity in patients with refractory hallucinatory schizophrenia. Future intervention programs should take full account of the actual situation of patients by appropriately extending the length of stimulation.

To conclude, 40Hz-tACS significantly altered functional connectivity and functional brain network controllability of the gamma-band in schizophrenia with treatment-resistant auditory hallucinations during auditory steady-state stimuli. At the same time, 40Hz-tACS combined with medicine treatment significantly accelerated the improvement of auditory hallucination symptoms. Our findings suggested that 40Hz-tACS combined with medicine would represent a feasible and efficacious treatment for symptoms that were specific to auditory hallucinations. Further, the study provided preliminary evidence that 40Hz-tACS could be used as a clinical complementary treatment for schizophrenia.

"Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus". "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications should be discussed". "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use should be elicited". Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties". Finally, "Although most tinnitus patients will have few relevant positive physical findings, the examination should be directed to identifying secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Tolcapone (Tasmar) [^111eAWth]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations/Psychotic-Like Behavior:

In clinical trials, hallucinations developed in approximately 5% of patients treated with placebo, compared to 8% and 10% of patients treated with 100 mg or 200 mg three times per day, respectively. Hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal from clinical trials in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, compared to 1.4% and 1.0% of patients treated with TASMAR 100 mg or 200 mg TASMAR three times per day, respectively. Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 0.0% of patients in the placebo group, compared to 1.7% and 0.0% of patients treated with 100 mg or 200 mg TASMAR three times per day, respectively.

In general, hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy with tolcapone (typically within the first 2 weeks). Clinical trial data suggest that hallucinations associated with tolcapone use may be responsive to levodopa dose reduction. Patients whose hallucinations resolved had a mean levodopa dose reduction of 175 mg to 200 mg (20% to 25%) after the onset of the hallucinations. Hallucinations were commonly accompanied by confusion and to a lesser extent sleep disorder (insomnia) and excessive dreaming. The incidence of hallucination may be increased in elderly patients over 75 years treated with TASMAR (see Geriatric Use).

Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during TASMAR treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of TASMAR. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease may have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.

Ordinarily, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with TASMAR because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of TASMAR.

### Avatar therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders [^1111wGn4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve satisfactory improvements in their mental state, particularly the symptom of hearing voices (hallucinations), with medical treatment.

Objectives

To examine the effects of Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

Search Methods

In December 2016, November 2018 and April 2019, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) was searched, review authors checked references of all identified relevant reports to identify more studies and contacted authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

All randomised clinical trials focusing on Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and 95% CIs. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in; mental state, insight, global state, quality of life and functioning as well as adverse effects and leaving the study early.

Main Results

We found 14 potentially relevant references for three studies (participants = 195) comparing Avatar Therapy with two other interventions; treatment as usual or supportive counselling. Both Avatar Therapy and supportive counselling were given in addition (add-on) to the participants' normal care. All of the studies had high risk of bias across one or more domains for methodology and, for other risks of bias, authors from one of the studies were involved in the development of the avatar systems on trial and in another trial, authors had patents on the avatar system pending. 1. Avatar Therapy compared with treatment as usual When Avatar Therapy was compared with treatment as usual average endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Positive (PANSS-P) scores were not different between treatment groups (MD -1.93, 95% CI -5.10 to 1.24; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). A measure of insight (Revised Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire; BAVQ-R) showed an effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD -5.97, 95% CI -10.98 to -0.96; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). No one was rehospitalised in either group in the short term (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.20; studies = 1, participants = 19; low-certainty evidence). Numbers leaving the study early from each group were not clearly different - although more did leave from the Avatar Therapy group (6/14 versus 0/12; RR 11.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 181.41; studies = 1, participants = 26; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in anxiety between treatment groups (RR 5.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 89.80; studies = 1, participants = 19; low-certainty evidence). For quality of life, average Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (QLESQ-SF) scores favoured Avatar Therapy (MD 9.99, 95% CI 3.89 to 16.09; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported data for functioning. 2. Avatar Therapy compared with supportive counselling When Avatar Therapy was compared with supportive counselling (all short-term), general mental state (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)) scores favoured the Avatar Therapy group (MD -4.74, 95% CI -8.01 to -1.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low-certainty evidence). For insight (BAVQ-R), there was a small effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD -8.39, 95% CI -14.31 to -2.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low-certainty evidence). Around 20% of each group left the study early (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89; studies = 1, participants = 150; moderate-certainty evidence). Analysis of quality of life scores (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA)) showed no clear difference between groups (MD 2.69, 95% CI -1.48 to 6.86; studies = 1, participants = 120; low-certainty evidence). No data were available for rehospitalisation rates, adverse events or functioning.

Authors' Conclusions

Our analyses of available data shows few, if any, consistent effects of Avatar Therapy for people living with schizophrenia who experience auditory hallucinations. Where there are effects, or suggestions of effects, we are uncertain because of their risk of bias and their unclear clinical meaning. The theory behind Avatar Therapy is compelling but the practice needs testing in large, long, well-designed, well-reported randomised trials undertaken with help from - but not under the direction of - Avatar Therapy pioneers.

### Enhanced theta oscillations in the left temporoparietal region associated with refractory positive symptoms in schizophrenia [^1124LVNf]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic, multifactorial psychotic disorder affecting millions worldwide and is characterized by functional decline. The diagnosis requires at least two of the following five symptoms, with at least one being (1), (2), or (3): (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and (5) negative symptoms. Positive symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, are central to the diagnosis of schizophrenia and are often the most distressing for patients. Among these positive symptoms, auditory hallucinations are particularly common, affecting approximately 60–75% of individuals with the disorder. Given the significant distress caused by positive symptoms, identifying effective treatment options for individuals with treatment-resistant positive symptoms would be of considerable clinical value.

For clinical treatment, the first treatment option for positive symptoms in schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can induce a rapid decrease in severity. Despite adequate pharmacological therapy, up to 30% of schizophrenia patients suffer from treatment-refractory positive symptoms (RPS). In addition, noninvasive brain stimulation techniques offer immense potential as an add-on treatment for persistent symptoms of schizophrenia. The comprehensive parameterization of brain stimulation necessitates a close association with the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms governing the symptoms. Thus, understanding the pathogenesis of positive symptoms is instrumental in developing more effective treatments.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) possesses the capability to capture electrical signals emanating from neuronal clusters with high temporal resolution. Numerous EEG studies have elucidated a spectrum of electrophysiological alterations linked to positive symptoms. The current studies consistently report that patients present abnormal auditory gamma responses – and that phase-locked values in the gamma band were positively associated with auditory hallucinations. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited reduced gamma activity in the left frontal lobe and bilateral frontal activation during language processing tasks, and the left frontal hypoactivation was significantly associated with the severity of delusions and hallucinations. Beyond task-related EEG abnormalities, resting-state EEG alterations also warrant investigation. When the brain is at rest, the spontaneous activity may reflect the potential of the brain to efficiently process task information.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation of left temporoparietal cortex and medication-resistant auditory hallucinations… [^115UDAz9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

© 2024 Background Neuroimaging studies suggest that auditory hallucinations of speech arise, at least in part, from activation of brain areas underlying speech perception. One-hertz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation produces sustained reductions in cortical activation. Recent results of 4-day administration of 1-Hz rTMS to left temporoparietal cortex were superior to those of sham stimulation in reducing AHs. We sought to determine if a more extended trial of rTMS could significantly reduce AHs that were resistant to antipsychotic medication. Results Auditory hallucinations were robustly improved with rTMS relative to sham stimulation. Frequency and attentional salience were the 2 aspects of hallucinatory experience that showed greatest improvement. Duration of putative treatment effects ranged widely, with 52% of patients maintaining improvement for at least 15 weeks.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was well tolerated, without evidence of neuropsychological impairment. Conclusions These data suggest that the mechanism of AHs involves activation of the left temporoparietal cortex. One-hertz rTMS deserves additional study as a possible treatment for this syndrome. The study described herein used a more extended course of 1-Hz rTMS at higher stimulation strength to determine if more robust and sustained clinical improvements could be obtained. Patients in this study reported AHs that were medication-resistant. Positive findings in this group would underscore the potential clinical usefulness of rTMS for treating AHs. An adequate medication trial was defined as a minimum of at least 6 weeks at a daily dosage of 1000 chlorpromazine equivalents for patients with standard neuroleptics32 and the following dosages for atypical neuroleptics: daily minimum of 6 mg risperidone, 15 mg olanzapine, 500 mg quetiapine, or 400 mg clozapine.

Results of follow-up assessments for up to 1 year of all patients receiving active rTMS are provided in Figure 4. Fifty-two percent of patients had sustained improvement at 15 weeks. Patients as a group demonstrated robust reductions in AH severity following active rTMS relative to sham rTMS during the double-blind phase of the protocol. Patient guessing suggested that somatic experience or other events did not provide cues regarding the type of stimulation received during the double-blind phase. Improvements were detected primarily in frequency and attentional salience of hallucinations.

### Treatment of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia with bilateral theta burst stimulation (cTBS-AH) [^1115q4nx]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Study Overview Auditory verbal hallucinations, a cardinal feature of schizophrenia, are often severely distressing and increase the risk for violence and suicide. Although antipsychotic medication mostly exerts rapid beneficial effects on this symptom particularly in first-episode patients who continue on taking their medication, in up to 25%-30% of all patients, such hallucinations persist in the treatment of auditory hallucination by this first full-size multicenter controlled clinical trial. This is a double blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy and safety of bilateral daily cTBS to the temporoparietal cortex on the severity of AH. The study will be conducted in a two-armed parallel design in which 50% of the patients will be treated with the verum stimulation and the other half of patients will receive the placebo / sham stimulation. RMT will be determined once, i.e. before the beginning of treatment period. The cTBS or sham treatment will be targeted both temporoparietal cortices halfway between T3/P3 and T4/P4.

The treatment will be administered over a period of 3 consecutive weeks at each workday, resulting in a total of 15 treatment sessions. Ratings will be performed after the last treatment of each week by an independent rater. Follow-up visits are planned 1, 3 and 6 months after end of treatment phase to control for sustainability of cTBS treatment effects.
