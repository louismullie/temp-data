## Question

Do we have to boil cow's or garlic milk before giving to toddler

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cow's milk needs to be boiled before giving it to a toddler, and whether "garlic milk" changes that answer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "boiling" achieves versus what pasteurization already does. Then, I should verify current pediatric nutrition guidance on when and how to introduce cow's milk. Next, I will examine the infectious risks of raw versus pasteurized milk and whether boiling mitigates those risks. After that, I need to check whether heating alters allergenicity in a way that matters for toddlers. Finally, I will consider the "garlic milk" concept and synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation with caveats for special situations like raw milk access or immunocompromised hosts.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate processes. Boiling is a high-temperature heat treatment typically done at home, whereas commercial pasteurization is a standardized process that eliminates pathogenic bacteria while preserving nutrition; pasteurized milk is already safe from common milk-borne pathogens, so routine home boiling of pasteurized milk is not necessary for microbiologic safety, though it may be used for taste or cultural reasons [^112eiEJG].

> Next, I should review when cow's milk is appropriate for toddlers. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some families consider cow's milk earlier, but guidelines are clear that whole cow's milk should not be used as the main drink before 12 months, and after 1 year it can be introduced as part of a balanced diet with attention to total volume and iron intake; for toddlers, 2–3 servings of dairy per day is reasonable, and limiting unmodified cow's milk to less than 500 mL/day helps reduce the risk of iron deficiency anemia [^113pgcxP] [^11132LB3] [^115tGiCx].

> I will now examine infectious risk, because that's the crux of the boiling question. Raw or unpasteurized milk carries meaningful risks of Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli O157, Listeria, and Brucella, with documented outbreaks and severe outcomes in infants and children; pasteurization mitigates these risks without sacrificing nutritional equivalence, so for raw milk, boiling is a minimum safety step — but even then, it does not eliminate all risks and is not a substitute for using pasteurized milk when available [^112b2YJf] [^112eiEJG].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance on heating and allergenicity, because I initially thought "boiling reduces allergenicity", but that's too simplistic. Extensive heating into baked forms can change protein conformation and is often better tolerated in milk-allergic children, yet the same degree of heating that destroys conformational epitopes can aggregate proteins and, in some contexts, increase allergenic potential compared with raw milk; moreover, threshold data suggest the eliciting dose for reactions may not shift meaningfully between fresh and extensively heated milk in challenge settings, so I should be cautious extrapolating "boiling = less allergic" to healthy toddlers without allergy [^112bcYNQ] [^117RtqrE] [^112VavMo].

> Let me consider the "garlic milk" idea. I need to ensure we're not masking a raw milk hazard with flavoring. If the milk is already pasteurized, adding garlic does not change the need — or lack thereof — for boiling; if the milk is raw, adding garlic does not sterilize it, so it still requires a rolling boil to reduce pathogen burden, though even boiling cannot guarantee safety comparable to pasteurization, and raw milk should generally be avoided for young children when pasteurized options exist [^112b2YJf] [^112eiEJG].

> But wait, what if access to pasteurized milk is limited and only raw milk is available? In that constrained scenario, bringing raw milk to a rolling boil for at least 1–3 minutes is a pragmatic harm-reduction step, yet families should be counseled that this still carries residual risk and that transitioning to reliably pasteurized milk is preferred as soon as feasible; in parallel, maintain strict hygiene for storage and serving containers to limit post-boil contamination [^112b2YJf] [^11168qML].

> I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with guidelines. For toddlers consuming pasteurized cow's milk, routine boiling is unnecessary for safety; for raw milk, boiling reduces but does not eliminate risk, so avoidance of raw milk is the primary message, with boiling as a harm-reduction fallback when raw milk is unavoidable; in all cases, follow age-appropriate intake guidance and monitor for iron sufficiency and overall diet quality [^113pgcxP] [^112b2YJf] [^11132LB3].

> Final synthesis: No, you do not have to boil pasteurized cow's milk before giving it to a toddler; pasteurization has already addressed pathogen risk. If you are using raw milk, then yes, boiling is advisable as a minimum safety measure, but even boiled raw milk is not as safe as pasteurized milk and should be avoided when possible; adding garlic does not change these safety principles, and any flavored milk preparation should still follow the same raw-versus-pasteurized logic and toddler nutrition guidance [^112b2YJf] [^112eiEJG].

Boiling cow's milk is **not required** for toddlers if the milk is already pasteurized, as pasteurization ensures safety [^112eiEJG]. Boiling is only necessary for **raw milk** to kill harmful pathogens [^112b2YJf]. Boiling does not meaningfully reduce cow's milk protein allergenicity, so it does not help children with milk allergy [^112bcYNQ]. Garlic milk is not recommended for toddlers due to potential gastrointestinal irritation and lack of proven benefit. For toddlers with cow's milk allergy, use extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formulas, and avoid raw milk entirely [^117SRke2] [^112b2YJf].

## Nutritional considerations for toddlers consuming cow's milk

Cow's milk is a **significant source of protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other essential nutrients** for toddlers [^111uHyGs]. However, it should not be introduced as the main drink before 12 months of age because of the risk of iron deficiency anemia and gastrointestinal irritation [^11132LB3]. After 12 months, cow's milk can be introduced gradually, and boiling is not necessary if the milk is already pasteurized [^113pgcxP].

---

## Safety considerations: boiling cow's milk

Boiling cow's milk is primarily aimed at **reducing microbial contamination**, particularly in raw or unpasteurized milk [^115kmHzn]. Pasteurization, a standard industrial process, effectively eliminates harmful pathogens, making additional boiling unnecessary for commercially available milk [^112eiEJG]. Boiling pasteurized milk may lead to nutrient losses, particularly in heat-sensitive vitamins such as vitamin C and some B vitamins [^notfound].

---

## Impact of boiling on milk protein allergenicity

Boiling cow's milk does not significantly **reduce its allergenic potential**. The primary allergens in cow's milk, such as casein and whey proteins, are relatively heat-stable and remain allergenic even after boiling [^notfound]. Therefore, boiling milk does not make it safe for children with cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines do not recommend routine boiling of **pasteurized cow's milk** for toddlers. Boiling is only advised when the milk is **raw or unpasteurized**, to eliminate potential pathogens [^notfound]. For toddlers diagnosed with CMPA, **extensively hydrolyzed formulas or amino acid-based formulas** are recommended as substitutes for cow's milk [^117SRke2].

---

## Potential risks associated with consuming boiled cow's milk

While boiling raw milk reduces microbial risks, it may also lead to **nutrient losses**, particularly in heat-sensitive vitamins [^notfound]. Additionally, boiling milk does not eliminate allergenic proteins, posing a continued risk for children with CMPA [^notfound].

---

## Alternative milk options for toddlers with cow's milk allergy

For toddlers diagnosed with CMPA, **alternative milk options** include:

- **Extensively hydrolyzed formulas**: These formulas contain proteins broken down into smaller peptides, reducing allergenicity [^1163hhYn].

- **Amino acid-based formulas**: These formulas contain free amino acids and are suitable for severe cases of CMPA or multiple food allergies [^1163hhYn].

- **Plant-based milk alternatives**: Soy, oat, almond, and rice milk are common alternatives, but parents should ensure these are fortified with essential nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D [^114ypnBB].

---

## Garlic milk: safety and nutritional considerations

Garlic milk, a traditional remedy, is sometimes used for its perceived health benefits. However, there is **limited scientific evidence** supporting its use in toddlers. Garlic contains compounds that may cause gastrointestinal irritation, allergic reactions, or interact with medications. Therefore, garlic milk is not routinely recommended for toddlers without specific medical indications.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Boiling cow's milk is **not necessary** for toddlers if the milk is already pasteurized, as pasteurization ensures safety [^112eiEJG]. Boiling does not significantly reduce the allergenic potential of milk proteins, making it unsuitable for children with CMPA [^notfound]. For toddlers with CMPA, extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formulas are recommended [^117SRke2]. Garlic milk is not recommended for toddlers due to potential gastrointestinal irritation and lack of proven benefit.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Use of a milk ladder or a similar support document and therapeutic support are safe even in infants with cow's milk allergy (CMPA), including those who have had anaphylaxis before referral or who react to the milk ED 05 during a supervised feed. Furthermore, no delay between diagnosis and introduction of baked milk is required. A supervised single dose accelerates progression with ladder‐based introduction of baked milk and dairy products. This is most likely due to giving the parents the confidence to proceed. Wider adoption of early, rather than delayed use of the milk ladder, supported by the use of the validated single‐dose practice shown here, could lead to much earlier clinical resolution of CMPA, with all of the nutritional and social advantages associated with early resolution. Maternal anxiety must be taken into consideration when assessing treatment plans for food‐allergic children, who can be assisted to become tolerant of milk much more quickly than had been previously reported, and without multiple hospital attendances.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cow's milk protein allergy in infants [^112EnCf3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Our aim was to develop guidance for general paediatricians and primary care physicians in diagnosing and managing cow's milk protein allergy in infants. The guidelines were developed by discussion based on existing national recommendations and standards, clinical experience and, whenever possible, evidence from the literature. Separate algorithms cover breast-fed and formula-fed infants. The recommendations emphasise the importance of comprehensive history taking and careful physical examination. Patients with severe symptoms need to be referred to a specialist. Elimination of cow's milk protein from the infant's or mother's diet and challenges are the gold standard for diagnosis. This guidance is intended as a basis for local discussion, implementation and prospective evaluation. The algorithms should be regularly assessed using clinical audit standards. Once validated, the diagnostic framework could provide a standardised approach in epidemiological and therapeutic studies.

### BSACI guideline for the diagnosis and management of cow's milk allergy [^113gKBvN]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

This guideline advises on the management of patients with cow's milk allergy. Cow's milk allergy presents in the first year of life with estimated population prevalence between 2% and 3%. The clinical manifestations of cow's milk allergy are very variable in type and severity making it the most difficult food allergy to diagnose. A careful age- and disease-specific history with relevant allergy tests including detection of milk-specific IgE (by skin prick test or serum assay), diagnostic elimination diet, and oral challenge will aid in diagnosis in most cases. Treatment is advice on cow's milk avoidance and suitable substitute milks. Cow's milk allergy often resolves. Reintroduction can be achieved by the graded exposure, either at home or supervised in hospital depending on severity, using a milk ladder. Where cow's milk allergy persists, novel treatment options may include oral tolerance induction, although most authors do not currently recommend it for routine clinical practice. Cow's milk allergy must be distinguished from primary lactose intolerance. This guideline was prepared by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and is intended for clinicians in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence based, but where evidence is lacking the panel of experts in the committee reached consensus. Grades of recommendation are shown throughout. The document encompasses epidemiology, natural history, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Which factors in raw cow's milk contribute to protection against allergies? [^112J9XD4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Several epidemiologic studies have shown that growing up in a farming environment is associated with a decreased risk of allergies. A factor that correlates strongly with this effect is the early ingestion of unheated cow's milk. Although, to date, no controlled studies on raw milk consumption have been performed to formally demonstrate this effect, several factors in bovine milk have been described that might explain how raw cow's milk consumption can decrease the risk of allergies. In addition, increasing knowledge on the immunologically active factors in breast milk have also contributed to our understanding of the effects of bovine milk in infants because many of the factors in bovine milk are expected to have functional effects in human subjects as well. Here we review these factors and their mechanisms of action and compare their presence in bovine milk and breast milk. A better understanding of these factors, as well as how to retain them, might ultimately lead to the development of mildly processed milk and infant nutrition products that could become a part of preventive strategies to reduce the incidence of allergic disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is one of the most common food allergies in infancy and childhood, affecting approximately 1% of European infantsand can have major and lasting impacts on the affected child's physical and mental health and also on family life. Traditionally thought to be a transient allergy, with a high rate of resolution by the age of school entry, the natural history of cow's milk allergy (CMA) in populations referred to specialist centres appears to be much worse, only 6%–12% tolerant of unheated milk by around 2 years of age and 19%–75% by 4–5 years. Oral immunotherapy for milk allergy is widely used in Southern Europe, but is onerous, usually requiring hospital supervision of dose escalation and sometimes extended inpatient stays.

There is evidence that consumption of baked milk can accelerate the acquisition of tolerance to whole cow's milk in young children. The Milk Allergy in Primary Care (MAP) milk ladderwas devised to assist with tolerance acquisition in non‐IgE‐mediated CMPA, but some allergy centres use it in IgE‐mediated allergy to facilitate the introduction of baked milk. In the UK, for example, it is used from 12 m of age with some restrictions on home use. Australia's current guidelines advise avoidance of milk until 2 years of age when an in‐hospital baked milk challenge is offered. If baked milk is tolerated, an unheated milk challenge is also performed before home introduction (personal communication Vicki McWilliam, Melbourne, Australia). As most CMPA presents around the time of weaning from breast milk, even in these 2 developed countries with well‐resourced allergy services, there is clearly a large time interval between diagnosis and initiation of baked milk introduction, which entails breast milk substitution with specialized formulas and avoidance of all milk products. In comparison in Ireland, where access to paediatric allergists is much more restricted than in UK or Australia, once the child is weaned onto solid foods and therefore able to consume the relevant foods on the ladder, the MAP milk ladder is initiated at home for both IgE and non‐IgE‐mediated CMPA and patients can progress without the need for multiple hospital visits. This is done irrespective of age, SPT, spIgE levels or severity of initial reaction, because it been shown to be safeand is highly acceptable to families.

### BSACI guideline for the diagnosis and management of cow's milk allergy [^112q8zr7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for milk protein allergy, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, BSACI 2014 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- the prevalence of cow's milk allergy is 1.8–7.5% of infants during the first year of life

- cow's milk allergy commonly presents in infancy with most affected children presenting with symptoms by 6 months of age and onset is rare after 12 months

- cow's milk allergy has a favorable prognosis, as most children will outgrow their allergy by adulthood

- cow's milk allergy is more likely to persist in IgE-mediated disease and where there is greater sensitivity, multiple food allergies, and/or concomitant asthma and allergic rhinitis

- cow's milk allergy in adults more commonly arises in adulthood but may persist from childhood, and is frequently a severe form of allergy where up to 25% have experienced anaphylaxis.

### Minimal impact of extensive heating of hen's egg and cow's milk in a food matrix on threshold dose-distribution curves [^117RtqrE]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

We analyzed reaction threshold data from 352 children undergoing open food challenges to hen's egg or cow's milk, either fresh or extensively heated into a muffin. There was no significant shift in dose‐distribution curves due to the baking process, implying that existing threshold data for these allergens can be applied to allergen risk management, even when these allergens are heat‐processed into baked foods.

### Consumption of unprocessed cow's milk protects infants from common respiratory infections [^115Sx4Ed]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Breast-feeding is protective against respiratory infections in early life. Given the co-evolutionary adaptations of humans and cattle, bovine milk might exert similar anti-infective effects in human infants.

Objective

To study effects of consumption of raw and processed cow's milk on common infections in infants.

Methods

The PASTURE birth cohort followed 983 infants from rural areas in Austria, Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland, for the first year of life, covering 37,306 person-weeks. Consumption of different types of cow's milk and occurrence of rhinitis, respiratory tract infections, otitis, and fever were assessed by weekly health diaries. C-reactive protein levels were assessed using blood samples taken at 12 months.

Results

When contrasted with ultra-heat treated milk, raw milk consumption was inversely associated with occurrence of rhinitis (adjusted odds ratio from longitudinal models [95% CI]: 0.71 [0.54–0.94]), respiratory tract infections (0.77 [0.59–0.99]), otitis (0.14 [0.05–0.42]), and fever (0.69 [0.47–1.01]). Boiled farm milk showed similar but weaker associations. Industrially processed pasteurized milk was inversely associated with fever. Raw farm milk consumption was inversely associated with C-reactive protein levels at 12 months (geometric means ratio [95% CI]: 0.66 [0.45–0.98]).

Conclusions

Early life consumption of raw cow's milk reduced the risk of manifest respiratory infections and fever by about 30%. If the health hazards of raw milk could be overcome, the public health impact of minimally processed but pathogen-free milk might be enormous, given the high prevalence of respiratory infections in the first year of life and the associated direct and indirect costs.

The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Feeding and maternal diet guidance in cow's milk (CM)/soy-induced FPIES indicates that infants can be breast-fed or use a hypoallergenic formula, such as casein-based extensively hydrolyzed formula, and when possible breast-feeding should be continued; 10% to 20% might require an amino acid–based formula (AAF). The risk of co-reactivity to CM and soy is approximately 20% to 40% of US patients; goat and sheep milk are not recommended in CM-induced FPIES. Infants with chronic FPIES usually return to their usual state of health within 3 to 10 days of switching to a hypoallergenic formula, although in severe cases temporary bowel rest and intravenous fluids might be necessary. Summary Statement 21 states: Do not recommend routine maternal dietary elimination of offending triggers while breast-feeding if the infant is thriving and remains asymptomatic, with Strength of recommendation: Moderate; Evidence strength: III-IV; Evidence grade: C, and notes that the majority of infants do not react to food allergens present in maternal breast milk. It is also possible that milks from donkeys or camels might be tolerated in CM-induced FPIES.

### An ESPGHAN position paper on the diagnosis, management, and prevention of cow's milk allergy [^114y2w94]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

A previous guideline on cow's milk allergy (CMA) developed by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) was published in 2012. This position paper provides an update on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CMA with focus on gastrointestinal manifestations. All systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding prevalence, pathophysiology, symptoms, and diagnosis of CMA published after the previous ESPGHAN document were considered. Medline was searched from inception until May 2022 for topics that were not covered in the previous document. After reaching consensus on the manuscript, statements were formulated and voted on each of them with a score between 0 and 9. A score of ≥ 6 was arbitrarily considered as agreement. Available evidence on the role of dietary practice in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of CMA was updated and recommendations formulated. CMA in exclusively breastfed infants exists, but is uncommon and suffers from over-diagnosis. CMA is also over-diagnosed in formula and mixed fed infants. Changes in stool characteristics, feeding aversion, or occasional spots of blood in stool are common and in general should not be considered as diagnostic of CMA, irrespective of preceding consumption of cow's milk. Over-diagnosis of CMA occurs much more frequently than under-diagnosis; both have potentially harmful consequences. Therefore, the necessity of a challenge test after a short diagnostic elimination diet of 2–4 weeks is recommended as the cornerstone of the diagnosis. This position paper contains sections on nutrition, growth, cost, and quality of life.

### Anaphylaxis to goat / sheep's milk in a 4-year-old boy tolerant to cow's milk [^115RogPt]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Immune-mediated reactions to dairy products may vary depending on the mammalian source. We present a case of anaphylaxis to goat/sheep's milk with tolerance to cow's milk. A 4-year-old boy of Eastern European descent presented with gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms within minutes after eating a goat/sheep's milk-derived food product. The tryptase level measured 1 hour post initial symptoms and 1month after the allergic reaction were 14.6µg/L and 5.1µg/L, respectively (norm: 0.0–13.5µg/L), confirming the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. A skin prick test performed 1month after the reaction was highly positive for goat/sheep's milk, but negative for cow's milk. Skin prick tests may establish a life-threatening goat/sheep's milk allergy. Goat/sheep's milk allergy should always be considered in cow's milk-tolerant patients who present with an allergic reaction to dairy products, or when undergoing/have completed of oral immunotherapy for cow's milk allergy.

### Single low-dose exposure to cow's milk at diagnosis accelerates cow's milk allergic infants' progress on a milk ladder programme [^113ihvc2]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

We sought to compare the rate of ascent of the MAP milk ladder by cow's milk allergic infants, diagnosed between 6 and 12 months, between a cohort given a defined low‐dose oral exposure to whole cow's milk immediately after diagnosis, and a control group. Both groups subsequently followed the identical plan for graded home introduction of milk containing foods, immediately starting a published milk ladder and receiving uniform support from a single investigator.

We showed a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups for the primary endpoint with a 23% absolute difference between the groups in getting halfway up the ladder (step 6) and also a 20% absolute difference in finishing the milk ladder/ drinking whole milk ad libitum (step 12). After 12 months, there was also a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in how many infants had reached step 12 on the ladder. We think it is unlikely a once‐only small dose of intact milk would lead to such a marked difference in rates of ladder completion by permanently accelerating progress towards immunological tolerance. We believe that collectively our data demonstrate that the very act of giving infants a single low dose of cow's milk in the presence of their mothers promoted parental confidence in home introduction, leading to accelerated progress up the milk ladder. Parents who have already experienced their child receiving whole milk — in the form of the single dose at recruitment — would have more confidence to progress to this last stage.

### Milk processing increases the allergenicity of cow's milk-preclinical evidence supported by a human proof-of-concept provocation pilot [^112bcYNQ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

The reduced allergenicity of raw milk was confirmed in a proof‐of‐concept provocation pilot. Cow's milk allergic children tolerated organic raw cow's milk up to the maximum level of 50 mL (approximately 1750 mg protein), whereas in most cases provocation with conventional shop milk had to be stopped earlier because of the development of allergic symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first human pilot trial showing that traditional milk processing increases the allergenicity of raw cow's milk. Human trials have been performed with extensively heat treated (baked) milk. These trials show that the majority of cow's milk allergic children tested could tolerate the extensively heated milk. 39, 40, 41 This might indicate that the allergenicity of cow's milk is following a parabolic form, with a low allergenic potential at low (< 50°C, eg raw cow's milk) and extremely high temperatures (> 180°C, eg baked milk) and an increasing allergenic potential with temperatures in between. In the case of raw cow's milk, the lower allergenic potential could be caused by the fact that native, non‐heated, proteins might be taken up differently than aggregated proteins thereby reducing immunogenicity, and/or by immunomodulatory components present in raw cow's milk that might create an environment favouring unresponsiveness upon allergen exposure. In the case of baked milk, the lower allergenic potential could be caused by destruction of conformational epitopes. 39

The effect of the origin of the milk (organic vs conventional) on the allergenicity needs to be assessed in future studies. Different production and feeding methods on organic farms impact among others the fatty acid composition and antioxidant concentrations of the milk and might have contributed to the observed tolerance to organic raw milk in cow's milk allergic children. 42, 43 In addition, the inclusion of children based on parent‐reported cow's milk allergy potentially leading to a heterogeneous group of children (two children were left out because of the absence of a positive skin prick test), the limited number of children, the lack of IgE levels for some children and the fact that the oral challenge did not include the full range of up to 3000 mg protein as recommended by the PRACTALL guidelines 44 represent the main limitations of this study.

### Single low-dose exposure to cow's milk at diagnosis accelerates cow's milk allergic infants' progress on a milk ladder programme [^114wEBJH]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Safety of single ED 05 dosing in infancy

This study has reinforced data from previous studies of both older children with peanut allergy and similarly aged and older children milk allergy, showing single low‐dose administration of an allergen is a safe procedure in infants, in this case at the time of first diagnosis of cow's milk allergy. However in this study, we did not use the single‐dose challenge to establish which children were 'low‐dose sensitive', rather to show parents in the intervention group their infant tolerated a small amount of whole milk, before they introduced baked milk at home. There were 4 reactors among the 40 intervention group children given the single ED 05 dose. All 4 reactions occurred within a few minutes of administering the single dose, and all had resolved spontaneously without any treatment within 30 minutes. There were no late phase or secondary reactions. There was no single factor identified which could predict reaction to the single dose when compared to the group as a whole. Even though these 4 infants reacted to the single ED 05 dose of milk, they all tolerated the baked milk products as listed at the bottom of the MAP ladder and all progressed rapidly up the milk ladder, all being 'progressors', past step 6 at 6 months. All 4 were also drinking whole milk by 12 months post‐randomization. The safety of single exposure of infants to the ED 05, coupled with the positive influence of the intervention on movement up the MAP milk ladder indicates that this approach could be adapted to routine clinical practice in allergy services.

4.2 Safety of milk ladder protocol in infancy

Previously published guidelines have recommended restricting home introduction of baked milk, to infants with mild cutaneous reactions only and those who have not experienced a reaction in the past 6 months ref. In contrast, all 60 infants in this study were started on the MAP milk ladder at diagnosis, regardless of age or severity of initial reaction. There were no serious or unexpected reactions progressing up the ladder. It is to be expected while using the ladder that some children will have mild reactions when transitioning to a higher step on the ladder, but no child was given adrenaline at any time during the study. There were only 3 non‐tolerated accidental exposures to milk during the study. These data correlate with our data on home introduction of baked eggand reinforce the safety data for home introduction of both milk and egg at diagnosis in the form of baked milk and egg.

### Cow's milk allergy prevention [^111HQVrc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Scoping review on IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy prevention.

Data Sources

Literature search of PubMed database and gray literature.

Study Selections

Peer-reviewed relevant observational and randomized controlled studies in the pediatric population in the English language were selected and reviewed.

Results

There is increasing literature supporting the role of early and ongoing cow's milk ingestion in the prevention of cow's milk allergy. The studies supporting a preventive role with early cow's milk ingestion suggest cow's milk introduction at a very early age (most within the first month of life), suggesting the possibility of a different mechanism of sensitization than other common allergens. It is possible that gut colonization and the diversity and intensity of microbial exposure may play a role in inducing cow's milk tolerance. It is also possible that vitamin D may have a role in modulating those immune functions.

Conclusion

Further research regarding the role that early cow's milk ingestion plays in the prevention of cow's milk allergy is required, and questions remain. The absolute amount required for tolerance is unclear. Studies in higher risk populations are required. However, there is an intriguing and increasingly more pervasive association between early ongoing cow's milk ingestion and cow's milk allergy prevention.

### Diagnostic approach and management of cow' s-milk protein allergy in infants and children: ESPGHAN GI committee practical guidelines [^115UFoJa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides recommendations for the diagnosis and management of suspected cow's-milk protein allergy (CMPA) in Europe. It presents a practical approach with a diagnostic algorithm and is based on recently published evidence-based guidelines on CMPA.

Diagnosis

If CMPA is suspected by history and examination, then strict allergen avoidance is initiated. In certain circumstances (eg, a clear history of immediate symptoms, a life-threatening reaction with a positive test for CMP-specific IgE), the diagnosis can be made without a milk challenge. In all other circumstances, a controlled oral food challenge (open or blind) under medical supervision is required to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of CMPA.

Treatment

In breast-fed infants, the mother should start a strict CMP-free diet. Non-breast-fed infants with confirmed CMPA should receive an extensively hydrolyzed protein-based formula with proven efficacy in appropriate clinical trials; amino acids-based formulae are reserved for certain situations. Soy protein formula, if tolerated, is an option beyond 6 months of age. Nutritional counseling and regular monitoring of growth are mandatory in all age groups requiring CMP exclusion. REEVALUATION: Patients should be reevaluated every 6 to 12 months to assess whether they have developed tolerance to CMP. This is achieved in > 75% by 3 years of age and > 90% by 6 years of age. Inappropriate or overly long dietary eliminations should be avoided. Such restrictions may impair the quality of life of both child and family, induce improper growth, and incur unnecessary health care costs.

### Determinants of given anything other than breast milk for neonates in Ethiopia: a multilevel modeling complex sample survey data analysis [^112L8Q4Q]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding contextual region, respondents from Pastoralists had 6.39 [AOR = 6.39; 95%CI: 3.00, 11.62] times higher odds of having given anything other than breast milk for neonates as compared to respondents from Agrarian types of region categories. This outcome is consistent with the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey secondary data analysis findings.

One possible explanation for this is that the majority of pastoralist communities did not have permanent inhabitants. In turn, it can be hard for these communities to obtain an equitable distribution of basic health services, particularly those that pertain to maternal and child health, along with adequate access to information and resources. This may also contribute to a mother's declined understanding of the risks associated with giving other than breast milk her newborn child. Despite these potential explanations, in pastoralist communities, newborns are typically given boiled water, clean water, goat's or cow's milk, honey, and butter on breastfeeding practices that may encourage or allow mothers to practice giving anything other than breast milk.

Strengths and limitations of the study

As a population-based study, bias may have been less common but the findings may not generalize to other child age groups. Hence, the study is cross-sectional, does not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship, and only employs one outcome measurement technique. However, the study aimed for local policymakers and responsible bodies.

### A nutritional comparison of cow's milk and alternative milk products [^111uHyGs]. Academic Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Alternative milk products are becoming more visible and popular, but nutrient data to compare these products to traditional cow's milk are not easily accessible. By summarizing this nutritional information, this project aims to help primary care providers take better care of their patients by providing easy to access nutritional comparison between cow's milk and milk alternatives such as plant-based milks and goat's milk.

Methods

This project uses data from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Data Central database and publicly available nutrition label data to compare the nutritional content of selected milk.

Results

Almond and oat milks provide less than half of the protein provided by soy, goat's, and cow's milk. Goat's milk contains the most fat of the products surveyed, while skim milk contains the lowest fat per serving. Soy milk, almond milk, and oat milk contain at least half the fat of cow's milk. Almond milk contained the most calcium of the milks surveyed. Quantities of folate and vitamin B12 were most notably decreased in goat's milk and almond milk while soy milk had almost double the amount of folate and vitamin B12 present in cow's milk.

Conclusion

Cow's milk still remains the best source of fats, protein, and micronutrients. For parents who prefer an alternative to cow's milk, the child's health should be considered. Parents may consider nutrition information when making decisions for their families, and primary care pediatricians should be able to provide current nutritional data on frequently advertised products.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper: plant-based milks [^113pgcxP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Infant and toddler milk intake — human milk, infant formula, and cow's milk (CM) — is outlined as follows: The universally preferred milk for infants is human milk. Breast milk or infant formula should be an infant's sole food for the first 4 to 6 months of life. In infants not receiving breast milk, iron fortified infant formula should be the source of milk in the diet to 1 year of age, and by 1 year of age most infants are weaned to some form of "milk". USDA recommendations are to consume 2 to 3 servings per day of dairy products per day for a well-balanced, nutritionally complete diet; this amount provides approximately 25% to 30% of total energy needs of 1- to 3-year-olds.

### Soy formulas and nonbovine milk [^116YLiwD]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cow's milk allergy is frequently observed during the first year of life when nutritional requirements are critical. In those cases where breast-feeding is not available, a safe and adequate substitute to cow's milk should be offered.

Objective

The primary aim of this review is to evaluate the clinical use of milk derived from vegetable proteins, such as soy, or from animals such as goat, mare, or donkey, or elemental diet in children with cow's milk allergy.

Methods

MEDLINE searches were conducted with key words such as soy, goat's milk, donkey's milk, mare's milk, and elemental diet. Additional articles were identified from references in books or articles. Original research papers and review articles from peer-reviewed journals were chosen.

Results

Soy formulas are nutritionally adequate and can be used in children with immunoglobulin E-mediated nongastrointestinal manifestations of cow's milk allergy. Goat's milk is as allergenic as cow's milk. Mare's milk and donkey's milk may be used in selected cases of cow's milk allergy after appropriate modification to make them suitable for human infants. Elemental diets are usually restricted to the most severe cases of cow's milk allergy (ie, sensitivity to extensively hydrolyzed protein formulas).

Conclusions

Vegetable formulas obtained from soy and milk derived from other mammals, such as mare or donkey, homemade preparations, and elemental diet may represent valid alternatives for children with cow's milk allergy. Extensive clinical trials are needed on the safety profile of any alternative mammal-derived milk. The choice of alternative milk should take into account the clinical profile of the child allergic to cow's milk, particularly as concerns age, severity of symptoms, degree of sensitivity to cow's milk proteins, and any multiple food allergies.

### Single low-dose exposure to cow's milk at diagnosis accelerates cow's milk allergic infants' progress on a milk ladder programme [^1127H6og]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is one of the most common food allergies in infancy. Most infants with CMPA tolerate baked milk from diagnosis and gradually acquire increased tolerance. Nevertheless, parents often display significant anxiety about this condition and a corresponding reluctance to progress with home introduction of dairy due to concerns about possible allergic reactions.

Objective

To evaluate the impact on gradual home introduction of foods containing cows' milk after a supervised, single low-dose exposure to whole milk at time of diagnosis.

Methods

Infants less than 12 months old referred with suspected IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy were recruited to an open-label randomized, controlled trial of intervention-a single dose of fresh cow's milk, using the validated dose of milk that would elicit reactions in 5% of CMPA subjects-the ED 05 - vs routine care. Both groups implemented graded exposure to CM (using the 12 step MAP Milk Tolerance Induction Ladder), at home. Parents completed food allergy quality of life questionnaires and State and Trait Anxiety Inventories (STAI). Main outcome measures were milk ladder position at 6 months and 12 months post-randomization.

Results

Sixty patients were recruited, 57 (95%) were followed to 6 months. By 6 months, 27/37 (73%) intervention subjects had reached step 6 or above on the milk ladder compared to 10/20 (50%) control subjects (p = .048). By 6 months, 11/37 (30%) intervention subjects had reached step 12 (i.e. drinking unheated cow's milk) compared to 2/20 (10%) of the controls (p = .049). Twelve months post-randomization, 31/36(86%) of the intervention group and 15/19(79%) of the control group were on step 6 or above. However, 24/37 (65%) of the intervention group were at step 12 compared to 7/20 (35%) of the control group (p = .03). Maternal STAIs were significantly associated with their infants' progress on the milk ladder and with changes in skin prick test and spIgE levels at 6 and 12 months.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of introduction of baked milk implemented immediately after diagnosis of cows' milk allergy in a very young cohort. A supervised single dose of milk at the ED 05 significantly accelerates this further, probably by giving parents the confidence to proceed. Maternal anxiety generally reflects infants' progress towards completion of the milk ladder, but pre-existing high levels of maternal anxiety are associated with poorer progress.

Cow's milk allergy and other mammalian milks — avoidance and alternatives: Avoid other mammalian milks, such as goat's milk or sheep's milk, in patients with cow's milk allergy because of highly cross-reactive allergens [Strength of recommendation: Strong; B Evidence]. Because proteins in cow, goat, and sheep milk are highly homologous, patients should avoid all of them; milk from mares or camels might be less cross-reactive, and plant-based alternatives are recommended.

### Goat milk based infant formula in newborns: a double-blind randomized controlled trial on growth and safety [^116EXeYf]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Optimal early life nutrition is pivotal for early and later life health outcomes. Human milk is considered the best source of nutrition for infants, whereas infant formula (IF) is the recommended alternative when human milk is unavailable. Goat milk based infant formula (GMF) is a relatively unknown alternative of infant formula, but has been approved by European Food Safety Authority and WHO/FAO.

Data on nutritional suitability, safety and tolerability of GMF has been reported previously in four studies. A prospective observational study in infants fed exclusively breast milk (BM, n = 659), a GMF (n = 32) or a cow milk based infant formula (CMF; n = 159), or a combination of BF with GMF (n = 40) or with CMF (n = 86) displayed similar weight gain after 12 months of age. Stool characteristics of infants fed GMF resembled those of infants fed BM. In a double-blind randomized controlled trial for 168 days comparing a CMF and a GMF in 72 infants, no significant differences in weight gain, stool consistency, duration of crying, ease of settling, or frequency of adverse events (AE) were observed. A study in infants who were randomized to receive a GMF (n = 101) or a CMF (n = 99) exclusively for at least four months, and thereafter in addition to complementary food until 12 months, did not show significant differences in z-scores for weight, length, head circumference or weight for length. There were no differences in the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAE), general health, and incidence of dermatitis or medically diagnosed food allergy. Similar outcomes were observed in another double-blind randomized controlled trial in 79 infants fed either exclusively GMF or CMF for 6 months.

### Effects on childhood body habitus of feeding large volumes of cow or formula milk compared with breastfeeding in the latter part of infancy [^111wGgLY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first study that has looked at growth in relation to children being fed cow milk instead of BM and at the amount of either cow milk or formula milk fed in late infancy. We have shown that the rate of growth in childhood may be influenced by both the type and volume of milk fed in infancy and suggest that details of milk intake should be measured in future research. Our findings strengthen the current American Academy of Pediatrics and United Kingdom Department of Health guidelines, which stress the need to not introduce cow milk as a main drink before 12 mo of age. Parents should be advised about the appropriate volume of milk to offer their children once complementary feeding is established.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

### Sugar in infants, children and adolescents: a position paper of the European society for paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition committee on nutrition [^11293AJL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The consumption of sugars, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; beverages or drinks that contain added caloric sweeteners (ie, sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates), in European children and adolescents exceeds current recommendations. This is of concern because there is no nutritional requirement for free sugars, and infants have an innate preference for sweet taste, which may be modified and reinforced by pre- and postnatal exposures. Sugar-containing beverages/free sugars increase the risk for overweight/obesity and dental caries, can result in poor nutrient supply and reduced dietary diversity, and may be associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and other health effects. The term "free sugars", includes all monosaccharides/disaccharides added to foods/beverages by the manufacturer/cook/consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey/syrups/unsweetened fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Sugar naturally present in intact fruits and lactose in amounts naturally present in human milk or infant formula, cow/goat milk, and unsweetened milk products is not free sugar. Intake of free sugars should be reduced and minimised with a desirable goal of < 5% energy intake in children and adolescents aged ≥ 2 to 18 years. Intake should probably be even lower in infants and toddlers < 2 years. Healthy approaches to beverage and dietary consumption should be established in infancy, with the aim of preventing negative health effects in later childhood and adulthood. Sugar should preferably be consumed as part of a main meal and in a natural form as human milk, milk, unsweetened dairy products, and fresh fruits, rather than as SSBs, fruit juices, smoothies, and/or sweetened milk products. Free sugars in liquid form should be replaced by water or unsweetened milk drinks. National Authorities should adopt policies aimed at reducing the intake of free sugars in infants, children and adolescents. This may include education, improved labelling, restriction of advertising, introducing standards for kindergarten and school meals, and fiscal measures, depending on local circumstances.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of cow's milk anaphylaxis specific immunotherapy: allergen unresponsiveness via the tolerance induction program [^111XAPgq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Cow's milk allergy is a leading food allergy in early childhood, with estimated prevalence between 0.5% and 3% until age 1 year. Cow's milk allergy has increased in incidence over the last decade. Although commonly outgrown by age 3 years, cow's milk allergy now presents into young adulthood. Anaphylaxis fatality rates remain between 0.65% and 2%, with food allergy a leading trigger. Despite avoidance practices, the current disease state of milk allergy led to various treatment approaches.

Baked cow's milk introduction in the format of a "ladder" has been published. The approach to baked milk immunotherapy is variable, with tolerance rates between 50% and 83% among multiple small studies. The "ladder" involves escalation of the baked good intake over time. Despite evidence of cow's milk tolerance over time, the "ladder" denotes a significant adverse event rate including anaphylaxis to the baked milk dose. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) using diluted, uncooked cow's milk has been described. Few studies promote long-term open consumption of cow's milk with OIT. However, the adverse event rate including nonanaphylactic and anaphylactic reactions remains elevated. De Schryver et alreported a milk OIT cohort mean anaphylactic reaction rate of 6 events per patient per year. Furthermore, 27% of the cohort discontinued treatment in total. Aiming to mitigate adverse events, the cow's milk patch epicutaneous immunotherapy approach remains under clinical trials. No published data to date demonstrate high efficacy cow's milk immunotherapy with minimal adverse events.

### Consumption of raw or unpasteurized milk and milk products by pregnant women and children [^112b2YJf]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Sales of raw or unpasteurized milk and milk products are still legal in at least 30 states in the United States. Raw milk and milk products from cows, goats, and sheep continue to be a source of bacterial infections attributable to a number of virulent pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Brucella species, and Escherichia coli O157. These infections can occur in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals, including older adults, infants, young children, and pregnant women and their unborn fetuses, in whom life-threatening infections and fetal miscarriage can occur. Efforts to limit the sale of raw milk products have met with opposition from those who are proponents of the purported health benefits of consuming raw milk products, which contain natural or unprocessed factors not inactivated by pasteurization. However, the benefits of these natural factors have not been clearly demonstrated in evidence-based studies and, therefore, do not outweigh the risks of raw milk consumption. Substantial data suggest that pasteurized milk confers equivalent health benefits compared with raw milk, without the additional risk of bacterial infections. The purpose of this policy statement was to review the risks of raw milk consumption in the United States and to provide evidence of the risks of infectious complications associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk and milk products, especially among pregnant women, infants, and children.

### Iron requirements of infants and toddlers [^11132LB3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide and young children are a special risk group because their rapid growth leads to high iron requirements. Risk factors associated with a higher prevalence of ID anemia (IDA) include low birth weight, high cow's-milk intake, low intake of iron-rich complementary foods, low socioeconomic status, and immigrant status. The aim of this position paper was to review the field and provide recommendations regarding iron requirements in infants and toddlers, including those of moderately or marginally low birth weight. There is no evidence that iron supplementation of pregnant women improves iron status in their offspring in a European setting. Delayed cord clamping reduces the risk of ID. There is insufficient evidence to support general iron supplementation of healthy European infants and toddlers of normal birth weight. Formula-fed infants up to 6 months of age should receive iron-fortified infant formula, with an iron content of 4 to 8 mg/L (0.6–1.2 mg⁻¹ · kg⁻¹ · day⁻¹). Marginally low-birth-weight infants (2000–2500 g) should receive iron supplements of 1–2 mg⁻¹ · kg⁻¹ · day⁻¹. Follow-on formulas should be iron-fortified; however, there is not enough evidence to determine the optimal iron concentration in follow-on formula. From the age of 6 months, all infants and toddlers should receive iron-rich (complementary) foods, including meat products and/or iron-fortified foods. Unmodified cow's milk should not be fed as the main milk drink to infants before the age of 12 months and intake should be limited to < 500 mL/day in toddlers. It is important to ensure that this dietary advice reaches high-risk groups such as socioeconomically disadvantaged families and immigrant families.

### Pre-operative fasting for breast milk, formula milks, and cow's milk: a narrative review of the literature and implications for fasting guidelines for children undergoing elective surgery [^113TSxZ9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

There exists, across the world, significant variation in pre-operative pediatric fasting guidance for breast, formula, and cow's milk. Alongside recent shifts toward liberal clear liquid intake in response to prolonged fasts, there is also a trend emerging toward more liberal milk fasts. This narrative review aims to shed light on the following questions on the topic of pre-operative fasting of milks in children: What current published guidelines exist, what do they recommend and why? What benefits might reduced fasting times provide? Is there evidence that shorter fasting rules are as safe as longer fasting rules? What is the physiology of gastric emptying for milks? What is the evidence that gastric emptying differs for cow's, formula, or breast milk, and does age have an influence? The extent to which we are currently able to answer these questions aims to both better inform those formulating perioperative fasting guidelines and to stimulate standardized research into gastric emptying and pre-operative fasting of milk in children.

### Screening for anemia in children: AAP recommendations – a critique [^115wD9QW]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening for anemia between the ages of 9 to 12 months with additional screening between the ages of 1 and 5 years for patients at risk. The screening may be universal or selective depending on the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in the population. Improved infant rearing practices-including wider availability, acceptance, and use of iron-fortified formulas; iron fortification of foods; and increased awareness of the importance of dietary iron supplementation especially early in life-have lead to significant decline in the incidence of anemia in the first year of life. However, incidence of iron deficiency and ensuing anemia in children between 1 and 2 years continues to be significant and an important issue. Although iron deficiency may develop soon after cessation of or inadequate iron intake, anemia secondary to iron deficiency develops gradually over a period of several weeks to months. For children who have received/are receiving iron-fortified infant formulas and foods, hemoglobin screening at 9 to 12 months of age is inappropriate as there may not have been sufficient time to develop anemia, despite the rapid growth rate at this age. Widespread implementation of hemoglobin electrophoresis included in the neonatal metabolic screening programs in many states in the United States now has resulted in earlier diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies. Screening children at 9 to 12 months of age for hemoglobinopathies is somewhat redundant now. Screening for anemia before or around 1 year of age should continue to be important for communities and children at risk. Universal screening of toddlers at a later time allows sufficient time for nutritional anemia to become evident after the child has been weaned off iron-fortified formulas, for the influence of toddler dietary fads to manifest, and for evaluation of tolerance of cow's milk protein. This may be addressed via 2 approaches. The first involves postponing the currently recommended screening or an additional screening for anemia between 15 to 18 months of age. Determination of hemoglobin (or hematocrit) is not the optimal way to identify children at risk from effects of iron deficiency as it fails to identify patients who are iron-deficient but are not anemic. Long-term psychomotor, behavioral, and developmental effects secondary to iron deficiency anemia are known but sufficient data are lacking regarding the role of iron deficiency without anemia. Development and evaluation of sensitive, specific, and cost-effective screening tools to identify children at risk for iron deficiency is important. Until such methods are instituted, the AAP should emphasize and recommend universal screening for anemia during the second year of life.

### Infant feeding practices and parental perceptions during the 2022 United States infant formula shortage crisis [^114ngCdm]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Infant feeding practices before and during the shortage

To understand how infant feeding changed in response to the infant formula crisis, parents were asked to select the foods and liquids their infants typically ate over a 7-day period right before and a 7-day period during the most challenging time of the infant formula shortage. Prior to the shortage, 80% of all infants were fed some amount of their mothers' own breast milk in combination with formula but this number did not significantly change in response to the infant formula shortage. However, other infant feeding practices significantly changed in response to the crisis. For example, consumers of banked donor milk significantly increased from 2 to 28% (p < 0.005) and consumers of human milk through informal sharing increased from 5 to 26% (p < 0.005). Use of infant formula also significantly changed in response to the crisis. 79% of parents fed their infants U.S. infant formula brands and 39% of parents fed their infants imported infant formula brands before the shortage and these percentages were significantly reduced during the shortage to 27% and 11%, respectively (p < 0.005). Additionally, the use of watered-down infant formula significantly increased from 2% before to 29% during the shortage (p < 0.005) (Fig. 1). In this cohort, users of homemade formula increased from 3 to 13%, but there was insufficient power to detect a significant difference (uncorrected p value < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the number of parents who fed expired infant formula to their infants in response to the infant formula shortage.

### The role of iodine for thyroid function in lactating women and infants [^1129QpDp]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Dietary Interventions for Infants, Weaning Infants, and Toddlers

During the first few months of life, infants should receive iodine through breast milk or infant formula. Dietary supplements aimed at this age group typically do not contain iodine. The WHO recommends infants aged 7 to 24 months in populations with poor coverage of iodized salt be given a daily dose of 90-µg iodine through fortified complementary foods (see Table 3). Daily iodine for this age group can be administered as crushable tables or iodine solutions, fortified infant formula or toddler milks, micronutrient powders (MNPs), or LNS. In the United States, consumption of iodine-containing dietary supplements in 12- to 23-month-old infants is infrequent (< 5%) and the estimated iodine intake in supplement users is only 14 µg/day.

Fortified follow-up infant formula and toddler milks are widely consumed in many parts of the world, although the iodine content varies substantially between countries and products (discussed earlier). In subgroups with low breast milk and/or cow's milk consumption, fortified commercial infant formulas or complementary foods may be particularly important. In resource-poor settings where weaning infants may be at particular risk of iodine deficiency, iodine-fortified in-home fortification products to be sprinkled onto home-prepared complementary foods may be beneficial. MNPs and LNS are available in more than 50 countries worldwide. They typically contain a blend of micronutrients and are added to semi-solid foods just before consumption. The iodine content in MNPs and LNS products for toddlers is typically 90 µg per daily portion, but the iodine content can be adapted to the target population.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of cow's milk anaphylaxis specific immunotherapy: allergen unresponsiveness via the tolerance induction program [^112ZtyUG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the analytics process organizes an incoming patient's specific markers against the molecular groupings of the database. Once analyzed, the patient's markers are assessed into an endotype solely on the basis of applied mathematical arrays. Endotype 1 requires clinical and laboratory markers of anaphylaxis to both plant and animal proteins. Endotype 2 requires a total IgG 1 SD below normal (age specific). Endotype 3 requires clinical and laboratory markers of anaphylaxis to only animal proteins. Endotype 4 requires the total IgE level less than 110 kU/L. Endotype 4 requires a pathologic diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis on biopsy at more than 15 eosinophils/HPF.

Mammalian milk proteins used in TIP include camel milk, mare milk, donkey milk, sheep milk, goat milk, and cow milk. Mammalian milks are organized in databases on the total whey and casein derivative proteins in an uncooked and fully denatured state. Fully denatured mammalian milk comprises boiled milk at 95ºC for 3 minutes. Cross-contamination of mammalian protein product sources was limited on the basis of specific manufactured product requirements.

Mammalian milk proteins were sourced from specific commercial vendors. Study participants were provided the milk proteins directly from the TPIRC for treatment and maintenance cycles. All proteins underwent sample testing of dairy protein content through Kjeldahl methods by Eurofins (Fresno, Calif). Camel milk protein 7 g/25 g mass was sourced from Desert Farms (Irvine, Calif). Mare milk protein 5.4 g/20 g mass was sourced from Saumal (Karaganda, Khazikhstan). Donkey milk protein 4 g/24 g mass was sourced from Montebaducco (Quattro Castella, Italy). Sheep milk protein 31 g/100 g mass was sourced from Spring Sheep (Auckland, New Zealand). Goat milk protein 7 g/28 g mass was sourced from Meyenberg (Salinas, Calif). Cow's milk protein 13 g/8 oz volume was sourced from Fairlife Milk (Chicago, Ill).

### Milk processing increases the allergenicity of cow's milk-preclinical evidence supported by a human proof-of-concept provocation pilot [^114uFfyw]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we demonstrate that raw (unprocessed) cow's milk has a lower allergenic potential than processed cow's milk. Similar results were observed when only looking at the whey protein fraction of the milk, suggesting that this fraction contributes to the observed differences. The preclinical evidence was supported by a proof‐of‐concept provocation pilot in which cow's milk allergic children could tolerate raw cow's milk but not commercially available processed milk. These results provide evidence that milk processing negatively influences the allergenicity of milk.

Today's Western society mainly consumes processed milk. Processed milk is safe in terms of pathogens, and the extended shelf life makes it easy to consume in everyday life. However, milk processing also induces unwanted changes in the milk composition. Proteins with potential beneficial health properties (partly) lose functionality, and the context of allergen presentation to the immune system may be altered. 3, 4, 5, 15 Current literature mostly demonstrates the adverse effect of milk processing on allergic diseases like asthma and atopy. 7, 12, 13 Milk processing, especially heating, abolishes the allergy‐protective effects observed after consumption of raw cow's milk. This loss of protection is often attributed to the denaturation, and subsequent loss of functionality of immunomodulatory proteins present in the whey fraction of the milk. 12, 14, 15 However, whether milk processing also affects the allergenicity of the milk is barely researched.

### Term infant formula macronutrient composition: an update for clinicians [^1152sXr4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

2.6 Non‐cow mammalian milks

Non‐cow mammalian milk also derives its protein from casein and whey. The casein haplotypes (α, β, and κ) contribute to the tolerance and allergenicity of formulas (Table 2). For instance, goat's milk has a similar casein and whey ratio as cow's milk, but with a higher proportion of β and κ casein, which may lead to faster gastric emptying. Some goat's milk‐based formulas add in cow's milk casein to more closely replicate the casein and whey ratio of cow's milk.

Table 2
Alternative protein sources for treatment and prevention of cow's milk protein allergy.

The protein structure of goat and sheep milk is more similar to cow's milk than camel, horse, and donkey milk. There is limited data on the use of alternative mammalian milk to prevent and treat cow's milk protein allergy, and the effectiveness of these milks likely depends on the milk source (Table 2). Very few infants with cow's milk protein allergy will tolerate goat's milk, likely due to protein structure similarities. Small studies suggest that camel, horse, and donkey milk may be an option for some people with cow's milk protein allergy, although their use is not recommended, and currently, there are no commercially available camel, horse, or donkey milk infant formulas in the United States.

2.7 Plant‐based formulas

Plant‐based formulas derive their protein from the plant itself. Vegetable and grain products tend to have a lower amount of essential amino acids compared to mammalian products. Like other formulas, plant‐based formulas sold in the United States meet minimal nutrition requirements for infants. Depending on the study, cross‐reactivity between cow's milk protein and soy protein is anywhere from 3% to 50%. A meta analysis showed that soy based infant formula did not prevent the development of food allergy. Soy based products may be used for infants older than 6 months of age but not younger per guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Plant‐based formulas are an important alternative option for individuals who may not tolerate or do not wish to use animal milk products.

### The basophil activation test is the most accurate test in predicting allergic reactions to baked and fresh cow's milk during oral food challenges [^117SspDZ]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cow's milk is the most common cause of food allergy and related fatalities. Consumption of baked milk (BM) has been associated with better prognosis, nutrition and quality-of-life.

Methods

The BAT 2 milk study (NCT03309488) was a diagnostic study of cow's milk allergy designed according to STARD guidelines. All children had an oral food challenge (OFC) to BM, and those who tolerated BM were offered an OFC to fresh milk (FM). The diagnostic performance of the basophil activation test (BAT), skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) was assessed in comparison with OFC.

Results

Out of the 150 children studied, 85% tolerated BM and 56% also tolerated FM. BAT had the best diagnostic accuracy (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve 0.90 for BM and 0.81 for FM) compared with the other tests for both BM (sIgE: 0.79 and SPT: 0.70) and FM (sIgE: 0.74 and SPT: 0.78) allergies. Using 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity cut-offs to select patients for OFC would have led to the following proportion of children having OFC (and positive OFC) to BM: 99% (13%) for SPT to baked milk, 82% (17%) for sIgE to boiled milk, and 49% (24%) for BAT to baked milk. In children younger than 2years, only 27% required an OFC following BAT to BM (compared to 100% and 81% following SPT or sIgE to milk extract, respectively), with 100% diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

BAT was the best test to identify children who reacted on OFC to BM or FM. Using 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity cut-offs, BAT ensured the lowest need for OFC and 100% diagnostic accuracy.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^114ypnBB]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Practical implications

Professional dietary management should encourage a healthy diet and provide options of what the allergic person can eat, not just what they cannot eat. Individuals of all ages should be given advice on allergen avoidance, foods free from the trigger allergen and suitable nutritional substitutes. Assessment of nutritional adequacy both at diagnosis and review should be undertaken irrespective of the food, to ensure dietary intake is not compromised due to the exclusion of one or more foods. Management of infants should include regular review of weight, length and head circumference (< 2 years), and dietary intake including vitamin/mineral supplementation, complementary feeding and dietary diversity, and support for breast feeding and any maternal dietary changes/elimination. This is especially pertinent to the management of cow's milk allergy which most commonly affects infants. Mothers of breast‐fed infants may need to exclude mammalian milks (or another culprit allergen) from their own diet (although this is rarely needed), or if their baby is formula‐fed, be advised on suitable replacements. This is usually an extensively hydrolysed casein/whey formula, or hydrolysed rice formula as first line, with an amino acid formula utilised as a second option, as well as on the exclusion of other mammalian milks, and the age‐appropriate use of fortified plant‐based drinks.,

Dietary management should also include advice on the interpretation of food labels and "may contain" statements, which for composite dishes may pose a problem, safe and healthy eating at school/college/restaurants, managing food allergies when travelling/relocating to other countries, and how co‐factors (e.g. exercise, intercurrent illness, alcohol, pain relief, drugs) could affect the likelihood of an allergic reaction. Dietary management also needs to take into account economic issues, food insecurity, and cooking facilities. Specialist 'free from' foods are usually more expensive and may have a lower nutritional value than standard food products so advice about alternative foods, recipes and practical help is often necessary. Dietary management should also support expansion of the diet when clinically indicated e.g. baked milk and/or egg, selective nut introduction or safe fruits and vegetables relating to pollen food syndrome. Avoidance of co‐factors is suggested for patients tolerating certain forms of the allergen, such as patients with pollen‐food syndrome consuming the culprit fresh fruits and vegetables. The emphasis of dietary management should be on inclusion, rather than avoidance, and a personalised approach, rather than one size fits all.

### ABM clinical protocol # 8: human milk storage information for home use for full-term infants, revised 2017 [^111K3Vrh]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #8 — areas for further research in human milk storage — notes critical gaps: there is no agreed-upon definition of unsafe milk, and the percentage loss of bactericidal activity that would render milk unsafe has not been determined. The document calls for a definition of adequate milk quality with guidelines on unsafe or lower-quality milk that would necessitate discarding. Evidence on long-term freezing is limited, with only one study of human milk quality after 6 months of freezing and reports that a few very small studies have shown vitamin declines after 3 months of freezing; because some infants rely entirely on frozen milk, studies should confirm that this is nutritionally safe.

2.3 Extensively hydrolyzed and amino acid‐based formulas

Extensively hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that have been broken down into small peptides by hydrolysis. These formulas can be used for patients with malabsorption and are the first‐line treatment for cow's milk protein allergy and IgE‐mediated cow's milk allergy.

Amino acid‐based formulas, also referred to as elemental formulas, contain protein in the form of free amino acids. These formulas are reserved for more severe cases of cow's milk allergy (nonresponsive to extensively hydrolyzed formula), eosinophilic GI disease, multiple food allergies, and impaired nutritional status.

Extensively hydrolyzed and amino acid‐based formulas are considered hypoallergenic, as clinical studies have shown that they do not provoke reactions in > 90% of infants or children with confirmed cow's milk allergy with 95% confidence. The main disadvantages of extensively hydrolyzed and amino acid‐based formulas include increased cost, poor palatability, higher osmolality, and increased renal solute load.

2.4 Protein source

Infant formulas with alternative sources of protein, including non‐cow mammalian products (goat, sheep, camel, horse, and donkey) and plant‐based products (soy and hydrolyzed rice), are more readily available and of interest to some families.

2.5 Casein and whey

Whey protein, which is liquid and readily digestible, provides efficient nutrition and boosts immunity by supplying key amino acids. A higher ratio of whey to casein may be beneficial during infancy, as it supports fast growth periods by facilitating effective digestion and absorption. Casein protein thickens in the acidic environment of the stomach, forming a curd that slows digestion and delays the release of nutrients. This delayed digestive process helps with continuous food delivery over a longer half‐life, which can be beneficial during times of fasting, such as overnight. The standard cow's milk formula casein to whey ratio is around 80:20, while mature human milk has a casein to whey ratio of 40:60. Whey‐enhanced cow and goat milk protein‐based formulas can achieve a 40:60 casein to whey ratio, similar to human milk.

### A survey on clinical presentation and nutritional status of infants with suspected cow' milk allergy [^112jcHHc]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Results

Cow's milk allergy was suspected in 513 of 9,478 consultations in the pediatric age range. In 211 patients, suspicion of the diagnosis was made at the first medical visit, and in 302 patients the diagnosis was suspected at follow-up visits. Therefore, the prevalence of diagnosed and suspected cow's milk allergy in the study population was 5.4% (513/9,478), and the incidence was 2.2% (211/9,478). At first consultation, pediatric gastroenterologists agreed with the diagnostic hypothesis of cow's milk allergy made by the referring pediatrician in 82.0% of the cases. Among patients who had suspected cow's milk allergy (n = 211) at first consultation, 49.3% were referred to the pediatric gastroenterologist having already been switched to a substitute infant diet. The milk substitute most frequently prescribed by general pediatricians was a soy formula (58%). Other inappropriate treatments, including lactose-free cow's milk infant formula or goat' milk (11%), were also prescribed. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas were used in 11% of patients, as well as amino acid-based formulas (5%). A diet without milk substitutes was prescribed in 5% of patients.

The following results refer to new cases of infants (≤ 24 months of age) with symptoms suggestive of cow's milk allergy. Weight and length were recorded in 159 (90.8%) of the 175 patients < 24 months of age. One hundred thirty patients (81.7%) were evaluated in the 1 st year of life. In this group, 79 (49.7%) patients were evaluated in their 1 st six months of life and 51 (32.1%) in their 2 nd six months. Twenty-nine (18.2%) patients were evaluated in the 2 nd year of life.

Demographic data, weight and length at birth, clinical presentation, and duration of symptoms according to age group are presented in Table 1. The comparisons of gender and weight and height at birth in the three age groups did not show any statistically significant differences. The mean duration of symptoms showed a directcorrelation with the child's age.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^115sKmrD]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Practical implications

In children with confirmed egg allergy, particularly if older than 4 years and/or considered to have persistent egg allergy, egg OIT can be offered using the actual food. In the future, should a standardised product be approved by regulators, this would be preferred. However, with the potential higher cost and reduced accessibility to patients. Like for peanut OIT, avoidance of co‐factors should be advised and tailored to the individual patient.

3.7 Cow's milk‐specific immunotherapy

3.7.1 Recommendation 13

In children (generally above 4 years of age) and adolescents with IgE‐mediated cow's milk allergy, milk oral immunotherapy is suggested to achieve desensitisation.

Reason for recommendation

Similar to egg allergy, cow's milk allergy is often outgrown, thus the recommendation included patients aged 4 years or older and excluded adults, for whom there is no evidence. The milk OIT studies were all at highrisk‐of‐bias and thus low risk‐of‐bias‐only meta‐analyses were not possible. There was statistically significant difference of milk OIT compared to avoidance (RR = 6.31, 95% CI 1.91–20.83) and to soya milk (RR = 21, 95% CI 1.34–328.86) but not compared to placebo (RR = 4.61, 95% CI 0.02–1253.17). These trends were also observed in the sub‐analyses for children and adolescents aged 4–17 years. The sub‐analyses for children younger than 4 years included only one study, which compared milk OIT with avoidance and showed a significant RR of 3.86 (95% CI 1.99–7.46).

Strength of recommendation

The quality of evidence supporting milk OIT was considered low and thus the recommendation was conditional.

Practical implications

Milk OIT is a treatment option for children with persistent milk allergy, and thus should be considered after a period of follow‐up to see whether spontaneous resolution of the allergy occurs. Like for egg, this is not a strict timeline and OIT can be started in younger children if considered beneficial. There is no regulatory approved product in the market and often fresh cow's milk is used for milk OIT. Like for peanut and egg OIT, avoidance of co‐factors should be advised and tailored to the individual patient undergoing milk OIT.

### Repeating the errors of the past: the hazards of a commercial human milk industry [^111Ujhoz]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the benefits of pasteurised human milk?

Many organisations recommend pasteurised human donor milk as the option of choice if milk from a baby's own mother is unavailable. The World Health Organisation (WHO) published guidelines in 2011 recommending that low birthweight infants in low-and middle-income countries who cannot be fed their own mother's milk should receive human donor milk, but accompanied this with the qualification that facilities must be available for safe and affordable human milk banking, in recognition that the cost of providing safe supplies of donor milk is not trivial. The American Academy of Pediatrics and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition also support use of pasteurised human donor milk as the supplementary feed of choice. However, clinical trials to-date do not show benefit when pasteurised human donor milk is compared with formula as a supplement to own mother's milk.

### Timing of cow's milk protein introduction and childhood adverse reactions to cow's milk [^113bYzu8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines emphasize early introduction to potentially allergenic foods, but the optimal timing, amount, and exposure routes for foods other than peanut are not well-established. Cow's milk is often the first allergenic food introduced through infant formulas.

Objective

To examine timing of cow's milk protein introduction (CMPI), including interaction with formula supplementation after delivery, in relation to reported cow's milk adverse reactions throughout childhood.

Methods

Among children in the Boston, Mass-area Project Viva cohort, we assessed timing of CMPI (< 2 weeks, 2 weeks- < 6 months, ≥ 6 months) with questionnaires administered in infancy. Outcomes were (1) parent-reported cow's milk adverse reactions via annual questionnaires from age 2 to 13 years (n = 1298) and (2) milk sensitization (n = 505) and IgE-mediated milk allergy (n = 491) at age approximately 8 years. We used multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for parental atopy history, delivery mode, gestational age at delivery, child race, and census tract median household income, and investigated effect modification by ever/never breast-fed status and formula supplementation in the delivery hospital.

Results

A total of 32% were introduced to cow's milk protein at age less than 2 weeks, 38% at age 2 weeks to less than 6 months, and 30% at age 6 months or more. Compared with children with CMPI at age less than 2 weeks, children with CMPI at age 6 months or more had a higher risk of cow's milk adverse reaction at age 2 to 5 years (odds ratio, 2.4 [1.2–4.7]). Children given formula after delivery + CMPI at age less than 2 weeks had the lowest risk overall. Among children not given formula after delivery, CMPI at age 2 weeks to 6 months appeared most protective. Results were similar among ever-breast-fed children. Timing of CMPI was not associated with milk sensitization or IgE-mediated milk allergy in mid-childhood.

Conclusions

Early, consistent cow's milk exposure appears protective against adverse reactions to cow's milk.

### The supplemental use of infant formula in the context of universal breastfeeding practices in Western Nepal [^115kmHzn]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The household financial impact of formula feeding has not been studied before in Nepal. At the time of the study we observed that the price of infant formula ranged 460–480 Nepali Rupees (which was equivalent to 3–4 USD at the time). Given that a quarter of the Nepali population lives on an income of less than1.25 USD per day, the expense of 3–4 USD for each formula packet is very costly for the majority of the local population. There is lack of study on the economic impact of formula feeding and further research is needed to provide more information.

Nepal follows the WHO guideline in infant feeding and encourages and promotes exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life. When mother's milk is no longer sufficient due to maternal illness and death, the child health guidelines of the Ministry of Health recommends clean and boiled cow's milk to avoid contamination and also protect from under nutrition in early infancy. The same recommendation is not given for infant formula for several reasons: (1) likelihood of contamination during preparation, (2) lower literacy rates of mothers and the senior women that is likely to impact their capacity to safely prepare and handle formula milk and (3) poor sanitation status, mainly in rural parts of the country. These factors would lead to an increased rate of childhood diarrhoea which is already one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among infants and children of Nepal.

Water and milk feeding.

Young children were always offered either water or home-produced cow/buffalo milk together with, or immediately after, food. Water from communal or household taps (delivered from unprotected sources) was commonly collected in thin copper or brass vessels that were observed uncovered (47%) or covered with a bowl (53%). None of the households boiled water before serving it to the children, and none of them reboiled milk when serving it at different times during the day. As revealed from video footage, all water treatment and 95% of milk boiling opportunities were missed by mothers. Though milk was usually boiled on receipt/after milking, a few households gave their children never-boiled milk to drink. Water, milk, and Jad samples were collected during mid-day. The mean TC and E. coli counts in 30 water samples collected during feeding were 1.62 log₁₀ cfu/100 mL and 0.92 log₁₀ cfu/100 mL, respectively. Milk samples were heavily contaminated with TC and E. coli, with mean counts of 5.15 log₁₀ cfu/mL and 1.26 log₁₀ cfu/mL, respectively, with a mean pH of 5.9. Twelve Jad samples were tested, and no TCs or E. coli were isolated (mean pH of 2.9).

### Baked milk and baked egg survey: a work group report of the AAAAI adverse reactions to foods committee [^112VavMo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Baked milk and baked egg in milk- and egg-allergic children — tolerance, introduction approach, and risks are summarized as follows: Cow's milk allergy affects 1% to 5% of children, and up to 70% to 80% of milk- or egg-allergic children develop tolerance to baked milk (BM) and baked egg (BE) before unheated forms. Introducing these foods is generally recommended using an observed oral food challenge (OFC); home introduction may be considered for carefully selected low-risk patients, but both methods carry a risk of reaction, including anaphylaxis, and reactions to BM and BE may take longer to develop and may be more severe than those seen during OFCs to other foods. Although severe reactions are not observed in all reports, the only known fatality during an OFC in North America was to BM, reported in 2017, and a BM-allergic 9-year-old child recently died from home ingestion of BM. Multiple guidelines recognize a "milk or egg ladder" in which patients are advised to progress from baked within a flour matrix to lesser cooked forms until unheated milk or lightly cooked egg is tolerated.

2 Rationale for Preschool

2.1 Failed Primary Prevention of Food Allergy in Infancy

There is evidence to suggest that early introduction of allergenic foods around 6 months of age, along with ongoing regular ingestion, has the potential to prevent food allergy development in those at increased risk for food allergy. The Learning Early About Peanut (LEAP) study found an 80% reduction in peanut allergy with early introduction and ingestion of 2 g of peanut three times per week (versus avoidance). However, results of more recent studies point towards implementation barriers, suggesting difficulty maintaining regular ingestion of the food following early introduction in the real world. Others have suggested there may be other risk factors to explain failed primary prevention, including racial differences or presence of eczema. In addition, other barriers remain, including inadequate education and poor adherence at a population level. Therefore, prompt initiation of OIT (ideally in infancy) is arguably an important treatment option for failed primary prevention.

2.2 The Natural History of Food Allergy Is Difficult to Predict

As illustrated above, case reports as early as 1905 demonstrated the potential benefit of preschool OIT. As much early success with OIT was with egg and cow's milk, some experts posited that because these allergies were commonly outgrown, a more appropriate approach would be active avoidance with regular monitoring rather than intervention with OIT. It is well established that a proportion of children will outgrow their allergies naturally (peanut: 22%–29%, tree nuts: 9%–14%, cow's milk: 41%–92%, egg: 47%–59%). In this light, European OIT guidelines in 2018 argued that OIT should not be considered until 4–5 years of age to allow for natural resolution.

Regarding preventative measures for food allergy, more specifically with respect to early introduction of foods, NIAID 2017 guidelines recommend to consider introducing age-appropriate peanut-containing food i infants with mild-to-moderate eczema around 6 months of age, in accordance with family preferences and cultural practices, to reduce the risk of peanut allergy. Introduce other solid foods before peanut-containing foods to show that the infant is developmentally ready.
Introduce dietary peanuts at home without an in-office evaluation, recognizing that some caregivers and healthcare providers may desire an in-office supervised feeding, evaluation, or both.

### Milk of nonhuman origin and infectious diseases in humans [^112eiEJG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Milk and milk products from domestic animals, which are potential infectious hazards, are made more so by modern milk production, because milk from thousands of animals is often pooled prior to bottling or before manufacturing derivative products. Thus, contaminated milk from 1 animal can result in a widespread problem. Pasteurization largely eliminates this hazard. Most disease transmission caused by contamination of the milk supply has been eliminated by hygienic production measures and pasteurization. However, contamination may occur after pasteurization, and no process works perfectly all of the time. Despite scientific opinion that pasteurized products are safer than raw ones — and are equally nutritious — segments of the population regard raw milk products as more nutritious and better tasting than pasteurized milk products. Thus, low levels of raw milk consumption persist in the United States and other developed nations. Occasional milk-associated disease outbreaks caused by raw milk consumption or by breakdowns in the proper production of pasteurized products still occur.

Intervention

From enrollment on, the infants were fed the allocated infant formula or BM exclusively for 112 days. No other food or drinks other than water, medication, and mineral/vitamin supplements were allowed during the intervention period.

Anthropometric measurements were performed in duplicate at baseline, at day 14 (visit 2), 28 (visit 3), 56 (visit 4), 84 (visit 5), and 112 (visit 6) by trained research nurses following a standardized protocol. Weight was measured using calibrated weighing scales to the nearest 5 grams with clothing and diaper removed. Crown-to-heel-length was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a neonatometer. Head circumference was measured using a non-flexible measuring tape to the nearest 0.1 cm. Stool characteristics and tolerability symptoms (i.e. reflux, colic, flatulence, and fussiness), and IF consumption were self-reported by the parents using a 3-day diary prior to each study visit. Stool consistency and color were assessed using the infant stool form scale, where lower scores indicated more watery stools. Occurrence of AE and medical treatments were orally discussed and assessed during the study visits. AE and diseases were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 20.1). AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study period. An AE could be any unfavorable sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not it is considered related to that product. An SAE was any AE that was a life-threatening AE, or results in death, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or was an important medical event.

4 Discussion

Cow's milk allergy is the most common food allergy worldwide. Cow's milk is the food most implicated in anaphylaxis fatalities, alongside nuts. Consumption of BM has been associated with a better prognosis in terms of likelihood of resolution of milk allergy and better quality of life. Most milk allergic children tolerate BM; however, currently used allergy tests are poor predictors of safe BM introduction and OFC is ultimately required to confirm tolerance. Given the limited capacity for OFC, the long waiting lists lead to delayed reintroduction of milk in the diet with an increased chance of persistent milk allergy. In the BAT2 milk study, we have challenged 150 children to milk and assessed the diagnostic performance of currently used tests and the BAT compared with the reference standard OFC. 85% of these children tolerated BM. BAT had high accuracy and was the best test in identifying children able to tolerate BM in the diet.

The BAT2 milk study is the largest diagnostic study of milk allergy to date, designed according to the STARD guidelines, using the most rigorous methodology, with all patients being submitted to OFC, namely DBPCFC (only infants had open OFC). We designed OFC with cumulative doses appropriate to different age groups to ensure that the cumulative dose tolerated during the OFC would enable patients to be safe consuming baked goods in the community, particularly of off the shelf produtcs and by patients who were still reactive to FM. Only 2 BM allergic patients reacted to more than 2 g of milk protein during the OFC to BM, and none of these experienced severe symptoms or required adrenaline as part of their treatment. This suggests that 2 g of milk protein is likely to be an appropriate cumulative dose for OFC to BM in all age groups. The cumulative dose of FM tolerated was more variable.

### Complementary feeding: a position paper by the European society for paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition (ESPGHAN) committee on nutrition [^115tGiCx]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

This position paper considers different aspects of complementary feeding (CF), focussing on healthy term infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge and practices, we have formulated these recommendations: Timing: Exclusive or full breast-feeding should be promoted for at least 4 months (17 weeks, beginning of the 5th month of life) and exclusive or predominant breast-feeding for approximately 6 months (26 weeks, beginning of the 7th month) is a desirable goal. Complementary foods (solids and liquids other than breast milk or infant formula) should not be introduced before 4 months but should not be delayed beyond 6 months.

Content

Infants should be offered foods with a variety of flavours and textures including bitter tasting green vegetables. Continued breast-feeding is recommended alongside CF. Whole cows' milk should not be used as the main drink before 12 months of age. Allergenic foods may be introduced when CF is commenced any time after 4 months. Infants at high risk of peanut allergy (those with severe eczema, egg allergy, or both) should have peanut introduced between 4 and 11 months, following evaluation by an appropriately trained specialist. Gluten may be introduced between 4 and 12 months, but consumption of large quantities should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and later during infancy. All infants should receive iron-rich CF including meat products and/or iron-fortified foods. No sugar or salt should be added to CF and fruit juices or sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided. Vegan diets should only be used under appropriate medical or dietetic supervision and parents should understand the serious consequences of failing to follow advice regarding supplementation of the diet.

Method

Parents should be encouraged to respond to their infant's hunger and satiety queues and to avoid feeding to comfort or as a reward.

Prevention of food allergy — infant feeding and supplementation guidance includes: Encourage exclusive breast-feeding for the first 4 to 6 months of life [Strength of recommendation: Weak; C Evidence]. For infants with a family history of atopy, consider a partially or extensively hydrolyzed infant formula for possible prevention of atopic dermatitis and infant cow's milk allergy if exclusive breast-feeding is not possible [Strength of recommendation: Moderate; B Evidence]; guidelines have suggested that soy or cow's milk formula do not have a protective effect on atopic disease or food allergy but that substitution with a hydrolyzed infant formula can be considered for infants at risk, who are typically defined as having a parent or sibling with an atopic disease. Do not recommend maternal allergen avoidance or avoidance of specific complementary foods for weaning because these approaches have not proved effective for the primary prevention of atopic disease [Strength of recommendation: Weak; C Evidence]. Do not routinely recommend supplementation of the maternal or infant diet with probiotics or prebiotics to prevent food allergy because there is insufficient evidence to support a beneficial effect [Strength of recommendation: Weak; C Evidence]. Experts recommend that introduction of solid foods, including potentially allergenic foods, should not be delayed beyond 4 to 6 months of age, and in general, there is insufficient evidence that maternal diet during pregnancy or lactation affects the development of food allergy.

Cryptosporidium prevention — food and produce handling advises that all vegetables or fruit to be eaten uncooked should be thoroughly washed, and if extra steps are required to make water safe, this safe water should be used to wash fruits and vegetables, with fruit to be eaten raw peeled after washing when possible. Unpasteurized dairy products, including raw milk, should not be consumed, and because cooking food kills Cryptosporidium, cooked food and heat-processed foods are generally safe if, after cooking or processing, they are not handled by someone infected with the parasite or exposed to contaminated water.

3.2 Current State of Evidence for the Safety and Tolerability ofin Preschoolers

Multiple publications after 2009 that included preschoolers focused on OIT for peanut allergy, as it is a common food allergen and less likely to be outgrown. Early results revealed success with a good safety profile. In 2017 Vickery et al. published a seminal study on preschool peanut OIT ('Determining the Efficacy and Value of Immunotherapy on the Likelihood of Peanut Tolerance' (DEVIL)), with no severe reactions and only one patient receiving epinephrine at home following a dose reaction.

Since then, clinical trial data on peanut OIT, and cow's milk OIT have reinforced the safety of OIT in preschoolers, particularly infants. Additionally, real‐world studies have contributed important safety data in preschool OIT for peanut, tree nuts, sesame, cow's milk, and multiple food OIT. Most of these studies have reported few reactions requiring epinephrine during buildup (0%–6.9%; Table 1), and even fewer during the maintenance phase (0%–3.5%; Table 1). For example, a Canadian real‐world study of 403 preschoolers reported superior safety outcomes, with only 0% and 0.9% experiencing severe reactions and 1.6% and 5.9% receiving epinephrine (infants and noninfants), respectively, contributing to gradually increased adoption of preschool OIT among Canadian allergists. Boné Calvo et al. similarly reported no epinephrine or severe reactions in a study of cow's milk OIT in 335 infants. A limitation of real‐world studies is the lack of baseline OFC prior to commencing OIT, which should be considered when interpreting the safety data presented.

### The beneficial effect of farm milk consumption on asthma, allergies, and infections: from meta-analysis of evidence to clinical trial [^113TQtyG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The low prevalence of asthma and allergies in farm children has partially been ascribed to the consumption of raw cow's milk. A literature search identified 12 publications on 8 pertinent studies. A meta-analysis corroborated the protective effect of raw milk consumption early in life (< 1 to 5 years, according to study) on asthma (odds ratio [OR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49–0.69), current wheeze (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55–0.78), hay fever or allergic rhinitis (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.82), and atopic sensitization (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.95). The effect particularly on asthma was observed not only in children raised on farms (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58–0.82) but also in children living in rural areas but not on a farm (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.48–0.74). This demonstrates that the effect of farm milk consumption is independent of other farm exposures and that children not living on a farm can theoretically profit from this effect. Because of the minimal but real risk of life-threatening infections, however, consumption of raw milk and products thereof is strongly discouraged. Raw farm milk and industrially processed milk differ in many instances including removal of cellular components, manipulation of the fat fraction, and various degrees of heating. Preliminary evidence attributes the effect to heat-labile molecules and components residing in the fat fraction. The Milk Against Respiratory Tract Infections and Asthma (MARTHA) trial is currently testing the protective effect of microbiologically safe, minimally processed cow's milk against standard ultra-heat-treated milk in children from 6 months to 3 years with the primary outcome of an asthma diagnosis until age 5 years. If successful, this approach might provide a simple but effective prevention strategy.

### Formula milk companies push allergy products despite flawed evidence [^113aYt6T]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The rules tighten up the claims that can be made about hydrolysed formula milk. Manufacturers now have to provide evidence that claims about reduced allergy risk have been "scientifically evaluated by an authoritative or scientific body".

Until very recently, Nestlé in the UK was promoting its SMA HA infant milk, a partially hydrolysed formula, which it says can "reduce the risk of developing allergy to cows' milk proteins". But in the run-up to the law change, Nestlé has discontinued the product in the UK market. The National Pharmacy Association has also taken down a Nestlé funded "learning module" for pharmacists that repeated claims that the product could prevent allergy and eczema in children.

For Robert Boyle, clinical reader in paediatric allergy at Imperial College London, Brexit gives the UK the opportunity to "get it right" regarding information provided to consumers about formula products, and he urged for the law to be further upgraded to better reflect the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes.

The code explicitly states that there should be no advertising or other form of promotion to the general public of any breast milk substitutes, including not just infant formula but any milks (or products that could be used to replace milk) specifically marketed for young children up to the age of 3 years.

Victoria Sibson, director of the First Steps Nutrition Trust, says, "The code is an international policy framework for protecting babies, young children, and their parents from marketing practices that commercialise infant feeding, mislead consumers, and threaten breastfeeding. The best way to put a stop to companies' nefarious marketing practices would simply be to adopt 'the code' law, and Brexit affords the UK an opportunity to do this".

Current UK regulation contains all sorts of loopholes that allow spurious nutritional claims to be made. These loopholes include the requirement for statements of intended use on formulas marketed as foods for special medical purposes (FSMPs), toddler milks, and follow-on formulas.

### Food-based strategies improve iron status in toddlers: a randomized controlled trial12 [^112BCAkx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Nonanemic iron deficiency is common in toddlers in developed countries. Food-based strategies are safe methods to control and prevent mild micronutrient deficiencies.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the efficacy of an increased intake of red meat, or the consumption of iron-fortified milk, in improvement of iron status in toddlers at a population level.

Design

In this 20-wk randomized placebo-controlled trial, 225 healthy nonanemic 12–20-mo-old children were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: red meat (toddlers encouraged to consume approximately 2.6 mg iron from red meat dishes daily), fortified milk [toddlers' regular milk replaced with iron-fortified (1.5 mg iron/100 g prepared milk) cow milk], or control [toddlers' regular milk replaced with nonfortified (0.01 mg iron/100 g prepared milk) cow milk]. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 20 wk for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein. The prevalence of suboptimal iron status (ie, depleted iron stores, iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and iron deficiency anemia) was determined, and body iron was calculated.

Results

No intervention effects were shown on the prevalence of suboptimal iron status. Serum ferritin increased by 44% (95% CI: 14%, 82%; P = 0.002) in the fortified milk group, did not change (+10%) in the red meat group (95% CI: -7%, 30%; P = 0.241), and tended to decrease (-14%) in the control group (95% CI: -27%, 1%; P = 0.063). By 20 wk, in comparison with the control group, serum ferritin and body iron were significantly higher in the fortified milk group (both P < 0.001), and serum ferritin was significantly higher in the red meat group (P = 0.033).

Conclusions

Consumption of iron-fortified milk can increase iron stores in healthy nonanemic toddlers, whereas increased intakes of red meat can prevent their decline. This trial was registered at actr.org.au as ACTRN12605000487617.
