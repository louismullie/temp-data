## Question

Mateo's $300 \mathrm{~km}$ trip from Edmonton to Calgary passed through Red Deer. Mateo started in Edmonton at 7 a.m. and drove until stopping for a 40 minute break in Red Deer. Mateo arrived in Calgary at 11 a.m. Not including the break, what was his average speed for the trip?
(A) $83 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$
(B) $94 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$
(C) $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$
(D) $95 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$
(E) $64 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for Mateo's average speed for a 300 km trip from Edmonton to Calgary, excluding a 40-minute break, given a 7 a.m. start and 11 a.m. arrival. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total elapsed time and convert the break to hours. Then, I should subtract the break to get the actual driving time. Next, I will apply the average speed formula. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and select the correct option from the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the total elapsed time from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.; that's 4 hours total, which I should keep in mind as the gross duration including the break [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the break conversion: 40 minutes is 40/60 hours, which equals 2/3 of an hour, or approximately 0.667 hours; I initially thought "about 0.6 hours", but 2/3 is closer to 0.667, so I should correct that to be precise [^notfound].

> I will now examine the actual driving time by subtracting the break from the total elapsed time: 4 hours minus 2/3 hour equals 10/3 hours, which is about 3.333 hours of driving; hold on, I should verify that 4 − 2/3 = 10/3, and yes, that checks out [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the average speed calculation: speed equals distance divided by time, so 300 km divided by 10/3 hours equals 300 × 3/10, which is 90 km/h; let me double-check that multiplication to ensure no error, and 300 × 3/10 is indeed 90 [^notfound].

> Looking at the options, 90 km/h corresponds to choice C; I should confirm that none of the other options match this result, and they do not, so the correct answer is C [^notfound].

---

The average speed is **90 km/h**. Total time is 4 hours, minus a 40-minute break (2/3 hour), leaving 3 1/3 hours of driving. Speed = 300 km ÷ 10/3 h = **90 km/h**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Total elapsed time**: 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. = 4 hours.
- **Break time**: 40 minutes = 40/60 hours = 2/3 hour.
- **Driving time**: 4 hours − 2/3 hour = 10/3 hours.
- **Average speed**: 300 km ÷ 10/3 h = 300 × 3/10 = 90 km/h.

---

The correct answer is **(C) 90 km/h**.

### Tracking emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in large and small communities by wastewater monitoring in Alberta, Canada [^b57d8d28]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The general trend demonstrated by this analysis of objective wastewater evidence is that large cities experienced the emergence of a newly introduced virus before smaller centers farther away from cities, but with notable exceptions. Banff, located 127 kilometers west of Calgary, experienced a more rapid onset of Omicron infection than anywhere else in the province despite its resident population (13,427 persons) being <1% of the Calgary population and the smallest among monitored communities (Appendix Figure 2, panel B). Banff is an international resort community in Banff National Park, Canada’s busiest national park, which attracts >4 million visitors annually from around the world. Early detection of Omicron in Banff might correspond to attracting tourists at the onset of the ski season in November and December. Of note, the nearby and slightly larger mountain town of Canmore (population 27,664), located 105 kilometers west of Calgary (22 km east of Banff and outside the national park), experienced a much later emergence of Omicron infections. This delay is likely related to Canmore hosting fewer international tourists than Banff and featuring less high-density dormitory-style housing, where much of the worker population supporting Banff's tourism industry resides.

More remote communities located a greater distance away from Alberta’s large international airports exhibited later emergence of the Omicron variant (Figure 1 ; Appendix Figure 2). The Calgary International Airport serves 16 million travelers per year with direct flights arriving from 15 countries, compared with 8 million travelers and 6 countries for Edmonton International Airport. Plotting Omicron dynamics in Alberta municipalities as a function of distance from Calgary (Appendix Figure 2, panel C) suggests a link to international travel whereby incoming travelers introduce a new virus into a large densely populated urban center, enabling its spread. International travel in and out of Alberta increased sharply in November and December; 22,700 passengers came through Alberta in November and 28,800 in December, compared with only 8,400 travelers during the first 10 months of 2021 combined.

Replication cohort (Edmonton)

When the analysis was repeated using the replication cohort in Edmonton, none of the statistically significant associations observed in Calgary were replicated (Table 3). The only significant association between UGIB secondary to PUD and any of the pollutants for all exposure durations was an inverse association with 5-day average PM 10.

Secondary analyses

Stratifying the results by age (above versus below 70 years) (Additional file 1 : Table S1), sex (Additional file 1 : Table S2), and season (Additional file 1 : Table S3) did not yield significant associations in Calgary that were replicated in Edmonton.

Fort McMurray offers an interesting example in relation to domestic air travel. Despite being a remote, relatively small (population 79,205) northern community farther from Calgary than any other municipality sampled in this study, Fort McMurray exhibited an Omicron emergence comparable to the rapid onset in Calgary. Fort McMurray has one of the busiest airports in Canada to accommodate shift workers commuting from across the country to work in the oil sands industry. This high level of contact with other parts of Canada is likely to result in rapid introduction of an emerging virus such as the Omicron variant. Workers traveling to Fort McMurray from other provinces or from major urban centers in Alberta likely contributed to accelerated Omicron emergence relative to other smaller or remotely situated Alberta municipalities.

The rapid emergence of Omicron in Calgary, Edmonton, Banff, and Fort McMurray is especially evident when this variant comprised lower proportions of the SARS-CoV-2 community burden. The time required for these 4 communities to surpass 10% Omicron was on average (+ SEM) 10.9 + 2.0 days faster than the other communities, highlighting the significantly earlier emergence of Omicron in these locations (p<0.0001 by unpaired t-test) (Figure 2, panel A). These significant differences are maintained by using Omicron cut-offs of 50% (6.3 + 2.7 days faster; p = 0.0331), and the trend is similar at 90% (5.0 + 2.6 days faster; p = 0.0686) (Figure 2, panels B and C). Later emergence of Omicron infections in the less populated outlying communities of Taber, Cold Lake, Lacombe, and Brooks is clearly evident using the 50% cutoff (Figure 2, panel B). In these 4 locations, Omicron surpassed Delta on average 9.8 + 1.8 days later than the other communities, highlighting the significantly slower emergence of infection in these smaller, more remote settings (p<0.0001). Some evidence suggests lower adherence to COVID-19 public health interventions in rural settings than in urban settings, including in Alberta, but less densely populated remote areas can experience slower spread of SARS-CoV-2 because of less frequent interaction events, which could potentially contribute to the patterns we report in this study.

### A stochastic model of randomly accelerated walkers for human mobility [^6455554c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Measuring the free-flow speed

Each trajectory is sampled at a spatial scale at most equal to 2 km or, in highways, at a time scale of 30 s. Using trajectory reconstructions, we estimate for each road the average speed for all the trajectories passing through that road. Using the distribution of the travel speed, the free-flow speed of a road is defined as the speed corresponding to the 85% of percentile. As a matter of fact, the free-flow speed corresponds to trajectories carried out during the night and the choice of 85% of percentile takes into account the individual heterogeneity: in many cases there are individuals driving at a speed much larger than the average and that are neglected in the computation of an average free-flow speed.

In Fig. 3a, we have computed the free-flow velocity for the used roads in each trajectory and for different travel time durations (0.5±0.1 h, 1.0±0.1 h and 1.5±0.1 h).

Details of the model

The model proposed here assumes that urban mobility is performed at a baseline speed of v 0 ≈18 km h −1. Very short trips hardly reach the base speed v 0 that we impose in our model. For this reason, in all the measures proposed in this paper, we considered only trips longer than 1 km and with duration larger than 5 min.

The upper bound of 130 km h −1 limits the number of jumps to k =(130 km h −1 − v 0)/ δv ≈3. We have a jumping rate of order p ′≈1 jump per hour and we expect significant deviations from our prediction for trips longer than 4 h. For such long trips, one cannot in principle approximate the area below the step function in Fig. 3b with a triangle. Indeed, the Poisson fit in Fig. 4 overestimates the frequency of trips faster than 110 km h −1 for t =120 and 180 min. In Supplementary methods, we show that if the acceleration kicks are limited by a finite number of layers, the speed grows linearly for small times and saturates to a finite limiting speed (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This saturation can be clearly observed at national level (see Fig. 2) and for five out of six of the cities represented in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Jet lag calculators—traveler tools—have been developed to provide travelers with recommendations on how to mitigate jet lag by adjusting the timing of sleep, light exposure, caffeine consumption, or use of melatonin in the days prior to, during, and following the trip. Light exposure and melatonin recommendations used by these jet lag calculators are often based on phase-response curves. An on-page example references a sample trip from Los Angeles to London, leaving at 5 p.m. on day 1 and arriving at 11 a.m. on day 2, and Figure 7.4.4 provides a screenshot of a day-by-day plan from a jet lag calculator.

Fleet-level distribution of key trip-level data.

A Trip Distances, (B) Average Trip Speeds, (C) Travel Times, and (D) Fuel Consumption. These histograms provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, illustrating the range and distribution of the variables analyzed in this study. Trip Distances show most trips under 50 km with an average of 24.8 km, Average Trip Speeds peak around 125 km/h with an average of 49.4 km/h, Travel Times are mostly under 50 minutes with an average of 22.5 min, Fuel Consumption is mostly below 30 L/100 km with an average of 14.7 L/100 km but some extreme outlier trips.

Supplementary Table 2 provides a summary of the various vehicles included in the data. Each unique make/model/series may have multiple trim variants with different engine technologies and sometimes different fuel types (primarily gasoline and diesel). We used EPA Tier 3 87AKI certification fuel values for any fuel lower heating value and fuel density conversions to ensure consistent fuel comparisons. As the table shows, the fleet contains a few electric vehicles. The dataset also shows a relatively high use of automated driving technologies, with more than 35% of trips involving ACC usage. We do not believe that drivers were specifically instructed to use the automated features in their vehicles; instead, it is likely a result of their natural inclination to explore and try new technologies. Drivers typically used one vehicle type/model for extended periods, although multiple drivers may have used similar vehicles. A driver-vehicle matrix shows that drivers occasionally switch to different vehicle models throughout the year. The driver log enables us to track such events.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^6d6e5c44]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Therefore, the analysis converted each building into a centroid, and each park into a set of points at 2 m intervals. Nearest neighbour analysis used the building centroid as a base, and identified only the nearest park point, thereby avoiding duplication. With each building centroid now equipped with a set of coordinate attributes for its nearest park, generation of the ‘from-to’ line (linking an origin-destination pair) became possible. The ‘from-to’ line and the road layer were then fed into the ‘shortest path’ analysis for routing. This effectively measured a walking route along the road network for each from-to pair. However, testing a prototype of the analysis, we found that the tool calculates distances between intersections, sometimes routing a walker to an intersection some distance from their actual park destination. Therefore, a ‘chopper’ tool was created to break every road into 10 m segments, ensuring that routing calculated routes that start and finish as close as possible to the relevant park and building points. Even with this improvement added, the shortest path tool struggled at times to find routes between buildings and parks where one end of the trip was that were slightly distant from a road, so we added a ‘snapping distance’ to the shortest path calculator, which automatically brought origin and destination vertices onto the network at a maximum distance of 100 m. This introduces a level of approximation to estimates of walking distance but avoids producing a high proportion of ‘path not found’ responses. Even with the snapping tool active, a portion of legitimate paths was not solved by the tool, and on inspection, these were often in locations where buildings closely abutted parks with no interceding road – an example of this problem is included in Supplementary 6.

This posed a risk of underestimating the accessibility of parks to these properties because recording the ‘300’ test result for these properties as ‘path not found’ would fail to recognise that these are often places that have very convenient park access. Accordingly, we added a final step which analysed any ‘path not found’ properties and determined whether they were in a crow-flies distance of under 50 m. We replaced any ‘path not found’ attributes for these buildings with the measured distance, thereby recognising these locations as likely ‘pass’ results for the 300 test.

Jet lag disorder—circadian rhythm mechanics and adaptation note that “advancing” the circadian rhythm moves the internal clock earlier and “delaying” moves it later; when traveling east the traveler must advance the biological clock, and when traveling west the traveler must delay it; westward travel is easier to adapt to than eastward travel, with an average rate of adaptation of 1.5 hrs/day for westward travel and 1 hr/day for eastward travel.

Adventure travel risk factors for illness and injury include that climate, terrain, and weather can be extreme, communication often is limited, even with modern technology, and destinations can be remote and lack access to medical care; physical exertion increases caloric, fluid, sleep, and thermoregulation requirements. Trips may span several weeks, months, or years and may be goal-oriented, which can cause travelers to exceed safety limits, and unexpected complications can occur with flight schedules, vehicle breakdowns, weather delays, and other factors.

### Understanding congested travel in urban areas [^5c73aeb8]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

We begin by analysing the efficiency of urban mobility for the five regions to understand the mechanisms underlying observed travel times. The main determinant of congestion is travel demand, which is heavily tied to commuting trip distances during weekday peak travel times. In Fig. 3a, we demonstrate that the straight-line (Euclidean) commuting distances, d, follow a lognormal distribution,with means ranging from 5 to 8 km (μ =1.6–2.1) and s.d. ranging from 2 to 4 km (σ =0.7–1.2) (see Supplementary Fig. 7). It can be observed that majority of trips span relatively short distances and trips over 25 km are uncommon. However, what makes a city more traversable are the speeds at which drivers can span these distances. In Fig. 3b we investigate the effective speeds in both free and congested traffic conditions. It can be observed that cities exhibit similar free travel-speed distributions, normally distributed with μ fluctuating around 50 km h −1 with mean values reported in the legend. The differences in road network supply(km vehicles per hour), where l e and C e are the length (km) and the flow capacity (vehicles per hour) of a road segment e, explains the slight differences in free flow speeds, as seen in Table 1. These differences are significantly more apparent in speed distributions under real traffic conditions: the effective OD travel speeds in Rio, the Bay Area and Boston decay considerably compared with those in free traffic conditions, whereas the speeds in Porto and Lisbon change less. We explore further these two different responses given the demand profiles of each city.

### The most effective strategy for recruiting a pregnancy cohort: a tale of two cities [^05f561f8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Recruitment activities such as advertising were initiated in January 2009 and APrON participant recruitment began in May 2009. Of the first 1,200 women recruited, 1,028 (86%) were in Calgary while only 172 (14%) were in Edmonton. In 2008 there were 50,164 live births in Alberta with 18,633 live births occurring in Calgary and 14,866 in Edmonton respectively. Thus based upon the proportion of live births alone, we could expect to recruit 56% (18,633/33,399) of our sample from Calgary and 44% (14,866/33,399) from Edmonton.

In the first year of the study, many of the women were not asked how and where they heard about the APrON project. Of those who were subsequently asked, Table 1 illustrates the number of participants recruited in Edmonton and Calgary through all recruitment strategies as reported by the women.

### Echinococcus multilocularis in urban coyotes, Alberta, Canada [^f6f52df2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The Study

Ninety-one hunted or road-killed coyotes were collected during October 2009–July 2011. Most (n = 83) of the carcasses were from the Calgary census metropolitan area (CMA) (Figure 1). The remainder (n = 8) were opportunistically collected from the Edmonton CMA. Of those from the Calgary CMA, the exact location of collection was known for 60 animals: 27 were from Calgary and 33 were from the rural fringe, including 2 near Strathmore. Of the carcasses from the Edmonton CMA, 7 were from Edmonton and 1 was from a periurban site. Sex and age of 90 of the coyotes were recorded.

Figure 1

Reference maps (2006) were obtained from the Geography Division, Statistics Canada. Urban core areas and surrounding rural fringes are indicated. For Edmonton, 5 (62.5%) of 8 carcasses were positive. For Calgary, 18 (20.5%) of 83 carcasses were positive: 9 (27.3%) of 33 from the rural fringe, 4 (14.8%) of 27 from the urban area, and 5 (21.7%) of 23 whose locations of collection were not accurate enough to be classified as urban or from the rural fringe.

### Effect of adaptive cruise control on fuel consumption in real-world driving conditions [^29672b63]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Further analysis (see Fig. 1) revealed that trips that average less than 50 km/h represent trips with the following characteristics:
– Higher functional class trips (> 2.5 means trips that are mainly local/non-highway). Functional class is a road type indicator, reflecting traffic speed and volume, as well as the importance and connectivity of the road.
– Maximum speed  < 90–100 km/h.

Fig. 1 
Relationship between trip speed and trip topology by looking at average trip functional class structure.

Our analysis here reveals that the effect of ACC on fuel consumption varies with average trip speed. While ACC engagement generally results in a slight increase in fuel consumption (+0.26 L/100 km), it tends to be more fuel-efficient at lower speeds, particularly below 50 km/h. This indicates that ACC systems can provide fuel consumption benefits in urban and suburban driving conditions. However, at higher speeds, the rigid speed maintenance of ACC leads to increased fuel consumption compared to human drivers. This interaction between ACC engagement and trip speed underscores the importance of considering different driving conditions when evaluating the energy impact of ACC systems. Additionally, these benefits are limited to a smaller number of trip profiles, which connects with the overall negative impact that was noted previously.

Situation-level analysis

The macro-level evidence presented above demonstrates that real-world use of ACC is overall not beneficial for trip-level fuel consumption. Furthermore, when benefits are present, they appear to be limited to certain trip conditions. A lower level analysis is needed to reinforce these findings and provide more granular explanations for ACC’s impact on FC in distinct road and traffic conditions.

On a given trip, vehicle speed changes tend to be caused by certain external factors, under specific situations due to road events. Examples of these situations include braking, stopping, and accelerating due to red lights or stop signs, cruising for a while, braking and accelerating due to red lights or sudden lane changes by a preceding vehicle, and so on. Isolating those events by segmenting a given trip into specific situations allows us to obtain more targeted ACC benefit estimates for specific maneuvers, improving our overall understanding of the system and providing a more nuanced analysis.

### Tracking emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in large and small communities by wastewater monitoring in Alberta, Canada [^4e84cf54]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Omicron variant SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Alberta community wastewater during late November and early December (corresponding to the displacement of the Delta variant) (Figure 1 ; Appendix Table). In Calgary, 4 consecutive samples collected during December 5–9 revealed the sustained presence of 3%–9% Omicron (compared with >90% Delta) among infected persons contributing to the sewershed in this cosmopolitan city of 1.3 million. Omicron was first detected in wastewater in the capital city of Edmonton (population 1.1 million) on December 10 (15% Omicron, 85% Delta). The rate of increase of Omicron in the international resort town of Banff was higher than in larger cities such as Calgary and Edmonton (Figure 1, panel A), and Omicron surpassed 80% in samples taken 3 times a week during December 20–23 (Appendix Table). By that time, Calgary and Edmonton had just passed 50% Omicron, and the proportion of Omicron infections was growing in smaller bedroom communities adjacent to these 2 large urban centers (e.g. Okotoks, High River, Strathmore, and especially Airdrie, which are all <70 km from Calgary) (Figure 1 ; Appendix Figure 2). Communities that experienced the most delayed emergence of Omicron were smaller and more remote; Brooks (population 14,451, 190 km from Calgary) and Taber (population 19,070, 263 km from Calgary) did not reach high proportions of Omicron until late December (Appendix Table).

### Brisk walking speed in older adults who walk for exercise [^041a9397]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the self-selected exercise intensity of older adults who report that they walk briskly for exercise. An additional aim of the study was to assess the contribution of self-reported physical activity to self-selected exercise intensity.

Design

Observational.

Setting

walking path.

Participants

Subjects consisted of 212 participants in the Study of Physical Performance and Age-Related Changes in Sonomans who stated in a detailed home interview that they walked briskly for exercise.

Measurements

Observed brisk walking speed was measured as the time it took participants to walk half a mile at "normal brisk walking speed." Self-reported physical activity was categorized as metabolic equivalent of the task (MET) in minutes of exercise reported in the previous 7 days. Physiological measures and body composition were obtained through laboratory evaluation.

Results

Men walked at an average speed+/-standard deviation of 5.72+/-0.69 km/h and women walked at an average speed of 5.54+/-0.64 km/h. Self-reported physical activity was not associated with brisk walking speed when adjusted for age and ratio of lean to fat mass.

Conclusion

This study found that older adults who report that they walk briskly for exercise do so at a pace considered moderate or greater in absolute intensity as indicated by their walking speed (4.83 km/h). Ninety-eight percent of men (93/95) and 97% of women (113/117) had an observed walking speed equivalent to 3 or more METs based on their calculated walking speed.

### The most effective strategy for recruiting a pregnancy cohort: a tale of two cities [^ceea499a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

There were, however other variations in recruitment methods that may have contributed to the differences in success between the two cities. In Edmonton a collaborative method was used through WCHRI, which may not have been as successful in providing access to eligible women because APrON was competing with other projects and the women did not have a choice as to which project they were assigned. Recruitment through WCHRI primarily involved obstetricians which also may account for the poor success in accessing women who were < 27 weeks gestation.

Another difference between Edmonton and Calgary was the variation in the scheduling of women attending radiology clinics for first and second trimester fetal screening. In Calgary, researchers were able to access numerous pregnant women who attended the ultrasound clinic via block scheduling while in Edmonton pregnant women were mixed in with other patients being seen for health concerns, limiting the number of pregnant women in the clinic at any one time.

Altitude acclimatization recommendations—Wilderness Medical Society guidance and protective staging—note that acclimatizing for a minimum of 2–3 nights at around 2,450 to approximately 2,750 m (8,000–9,000 ft) before proceeding to a higher altitude is markedly protective against acute mountain sickness (AMS). The Wilderness Medical Society recommends avoiding ascent to a sleeping altitude of 2,750 m (≥9,000 ft) in a single day; ascending at a rate of no greater than 500 m per night in sleeping altitude once above 3,000 m; and allowing an extra night to acclimatize for every 1,000 m of sleeping altitude gain, while acknowledging these recommendations can still be too fast for some travelers and too slow for others.

Although Walk Score has been extensively validated as a measure of walkability and walking, there are limited studies examining whether commonly used constructs of walkability are associated with traffic safety in children. This study examined the association between Walk Score and child pedestrian injury controlling for observed walking exposure in school zones in Calgary, Toronto and Montreal, Canada. Results indicate that a higher Walk Score was associated with more child pedestrian injuries in all three cities, even after controlling for walking exposure. School travel planning should consider established individual pedestrian collision risk and individual factors rather than assuming a highly walkable environment is also a safe pedestrian environment.

Adventure activities during travel—Travelers should use reputable companies, outfitters, and guides when pursuing adventure activities, and assess the situation for unacceptable hazards before engaging in these activities. A lack of rapid emergency trauma response, inadequate trauma care in remote locations, and sudden, unexpected weather changes can compromise safety and hamper rescue efforts, delay care, and reduce survivability. For recreational activities with a risk for falling, encourage travelers to use a helmet and to bring their own from home if helmets are unlikely to be available at the destination.

### Tracking emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in large and small communities by wastewater monitoring in Alberta, Canada [^ccd80aea]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 enables early detection and monitoring of the COVID-19 disease burden in communities and can track specific variants of concern. We determined proportions of the Omicron and Delta variants across 30 municipalities covering >75% of the province of Alberta (population 4.5 million), Canada, during November 2021-January 2022. Larger cities Calgary and Edmonton exhibited more rapid emergence of Omicron than did smaller and more remote municipalities. Notable exceptions were Banff, a small international resort town, and Fort McMurray, a medium-sized northern community that has many workers who fly in and out regularly. The integrated wastewater signal revealed that the Omicron variant represented close to 100% of SARS-CoV-2 burden by late December, before the peak in newly diagnosed clinical cases throughout Alberta in mid-January. These findings demonstrate that wastewater monitoring offers early and reliable population-level results for establishing the extent and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

### Sentinel fall presenting to the emergency department (seFallED)-protocol of a complex study including long-term observation of functional trajectories after a fall, exploration of specific fall risk factors, and patients' views on falls prevention [^46c299d3]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

After a two-minute break, participants randomized to the no perturbation group will walk twice for 4 min and 30 s with the individually determined treadmill walking speed. Participants will have a two-minute break between the two trials.

Participants randomized to the perturbation group will complete a perturbation protocol with similar duration and break time. The perturbation protocol will start with 30 s of the preferred treadmill walking speed, followed by 9 perturbations randomly presented to the participants. Time between perturbations will vary between 20–30 s, which is deemed a sufficient washout period. Perturbations will be triggered through the integrated force plates at initial foot contact through custom application (D-Flow version 3.34.2, Motek Medical BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Using the split belt option, each leg will be perturbed in anterior–posterior direction twice, mimicking slips and trips. Slips will be simulated by an acceleration of 3 m∙s −2 to a maximum of 180% of treadmill walking speed for 0.42 s. Trips will be provoked similarly with a deceleration of 3 m∙s −2 to a minimum of 40% of treadmill walking speed, which is in line with previous research. Besides these single leg perturbations, an emergency stop as in public transport will be imitated with both belts decelerating by 9 m∙s −2 for 0.12 s. Further, the protocol will include two contralateral sways, perturbing each leg once by a 5-cm platform translation in 3 m∙s −2. A pitch of + and—5° respectively, with a duration of 1.0 s will imitate small slope changes as present on sidewalks or at bus stops. Gait adaptations to these perturbations will be measured throughout the trials, using the aforementioned systems.

### Offshore transport of particulate organic carbon in the California current system by mesoscale eddies [^6a52828c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4 
Particulate organic carbon anomaly as a function of distance from the coast. Mean particulate organic carbon anomaly (mg m −3) and standard error within one eddy radius for cyclonic eddies formed inshore of 300 km from the coast (blue line) and for those formed offshore of 300 km (red line) as the eddies propagate offshore

For cyclonic eddies formed and located inshore of 300 km from the coast, the monthly mean POC anomaly is the highest during May–July (Fig. 5a), following a seasonal pattern that is consistent with the seasonality of eddy generation,, and upwelling, along the coast in the CCS. About 55% of cyclonic eddies formed inshore of 300 km from the coast propagate to the 300–600-km offshore region (Supplementary Table 1). The mean POC anomaly associated with these eddy peaks between November and January (Fig. 5b), about 4–6 months after the peak in the POC anomaly associated with the eddies is observed when they were located <300 km offshore (Fig. 5a). The distance that the eddies that are generated inshore travel to the offshore region, and the delay in the timing of the peak POC anomaly when the eddies are located inshore and offshore of 300 km, indicate propagation speeds of ~2 km day −1, which is consistent with the known eddy propagation speeds in the CCS,,. This consistency in eddy propagation speed and the time difference in the peak in POC anomaly between cyclones located inshore and offshore provides further evidence that cyclones are indeed transporting coastal water offshore. Cyclonic eddies generated offshore between 300 and 600 km show no clear seasonal trend in the POC anomalies, except for a small decrease during summer (Fig. 5c).

Air travel volume and health concerns—In 2019, 4.5 billion passengers took nearly 47 million international flights; the following year, global passenger air travel volume decreased by nearly two-thirds (1.8 billion passengers took 22 million flights), a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequently has reverted to pre-pandemic levels. Illness directly from air travel is not commonly reported, but main concerns include exacerbations of chronic medical conditions from changes in air pressure and humidity, relative immobility during flights leading to thromboembolic disease, and risk for infection due to proximity to others on board who could have communicable diseases.

Pre-travel preparation for travelers with chronic conditions—clinical advising and logistics emphasize that having 1 or more chronic health conditions does not usually mean “do not travel,” and healthcare professionals should advise patients with chronic conditions to seek pre-travel consultation before paying for non-refundable trips and to do so at least 4–6 weeks before departure. Adequate preparation requires the active participation of the traveler, their primary healthcare professional, and their disease-related specialists, in addition to their travel medicine specialist, and together they should take into consideration the destination, duration, and modes of travel, planned activities, time of year of the planned travel, and airline- and cruise-specific specifications. Assist the traveler with chronic conditions to prepare up to 4–6 weeks in advance of travel, ensure that the traveler has medications for the entire trip plus extra in case of unexpected delays, discuss when to take medications if travel involves changes in time zones, and note that all medications should be carried in hand luggage rather than in checked baggage; discuss vaccine and medication/prescription side effects and possible interactions with their current daily medication regimens and recommend medication or dosing schedule modifications as needed.

### Heart rate response to ultraendurance cycling [^6521c3a1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The heart rate (HR) response to ultraendurance cycling is poorly understood. This case report describes the exercise intensity of ultraendurance cycling by means of HR monitoring in a well trained male amateur cyclist performing the Otztal Radmarathon twice en bloque in a circuit of two identical laps (distance 460 km; cumulative altitude difference 11,000 m). The overall intensity was moderate (HR(mean) = 130 beats/min; HR(mean)/HR(max) = 0.71) corresponding to an average individual workload of 47% of VO(2)MAX. Almost the whole race was performed under aerobic conditions (99.6%); high intensity work was negligible (0.4%). The average speed and the HR response also declined in the course of the two laps, average speed by 17.2% (23.8 to 19.7 km/h), HR(mean) by 10.1% (138 to 124 beats/min), and HR(mean)/HR(max) by 10.7% (0.75 to 0.67). This scale of HR decrease corresponds to comparable data gained in the field of triathlon and represents a specific cardiac feature of ultraendurance exercise in general.

Diving and air travel—flying after diving—The risk of developing decompression sickness (DCS) increases when divers ascend to increased altitude too soon after a dive, and commercial aircraft cabins are generally pressurized to the equivalent of approximately 1,830–2,440 m (6,000–8,000 ft) above sea level. Asymptomatic divers should wait before any altitude exposures >610 m (>2,000 ft), with recommended pre-flight surface intervals of ≥12 hours after surfacing from a single no-decompression dive, ≥18 hours after multiple dives or multiple days of diving, and 24–48 hours after a dive that required decompression stops. These recommended pre-flight surface intervals reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk for DCS; longer surface intervals further reduce this risk. Symptomatic divers should seek evaluation to rule out possible decompression illness before attempting any exposure to increased altitude, and a diagnosis of decompression illness generally requires appropriate treatment before any flight or ascent to altitude.

### Methods for estimating the maximal lactate steady state in trained cyclists [^8ac238b5]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is the highest exercise intensity at which blood lactate concentration (HLa) remains stable. In this study, we examined the validity of simulated 5-km and 40-km time trials (TT) as methods for estimating average speed at MLSS in cyclists.

Methods

Nine trained cyclists reported to the laboratory for five to seven exercise trials. Testing included a VO2max test, a simulated 5-km and 40-km TT, and several 30-min MLSS trials.

Results

Mean VO2peak was 4.42 +/- 0.13 L.min-1, whereas VO2 at MLSS (N = 8) was 3.54 +/- 0.15 L.min-1, representing 80.1 +/- 4.1% of VO2peak. HR and HLa at MLSS were 174.7 +/- 2.6 b.min-1 and 6.9 +/- 0.8 mM, respectively. MLSS speed was 36.8 +/- 1.0 km.h-1, which corresponded to 92.1 +/- 1.2% of 5 km average speed (AVS5km). Mean AVS, HLa, and HR during the 40-km TT were 36.6 +/- 0.9 km.h-1, 6.3 +/- 0.7 mM, and 174.1 +/- 2.1 b.min-1, respectively, and did not differ from those at MLSS.

Conclusions

Both the (simulated) 5-km and 40-km TT can be used to estimate the MLSS in cyclists. In addition, HLa at MLSS shows a large degree of variation between riders.

### Causal effects of sedentary breaks on affective and cognitive parameters in daily life: a within-person encouragement design [^fc502c0a]. Npj Mental Health Research (2024). Medium credibility.

We implemented the central aspects (i.e. encouragement, treatment, and outcome) of the within-person encouragement design in the movisens xs (library v7464) sampling scheme as follows. Each working day between 8:40 a.m. and 9:40 p.m. the smartphone prompted participants based on a sedentary-triggered algorithm, activated after 30 consecutive minutes in a sitting/lying body position. In particular, the thigh sensor analyzed and transferred data on body position via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to the smartphone in real-time. Immediately after the 30-min sedentary bout, the participants received an alert on the study smartphone with randomization to either an encouragement message (i.e. “The next sedentary break is coming up! Take a 3-minute walking break at a relaxed pace.”) or a non-encouragement message (i.e. “ In a few minutes, a new survey will start.”). Over a study day, participants were prompted to complete a maximum of six momentary e-diary assessments. The treatments were equally balanced to 50% non-encouragement conditions (i.e. continuous being sedentary—Condition A) and 50% encouragement conditions (i.e. a 3-min sedentary break in different intensities, varying between standing [Condition B], self-selected slow walking [Condition C], or self-selected fast walking [Condition D]). Each of the six treatment conditions was randomized and selected once a day, which means that if a participant completed, for example, Condition C and answered the momentary e-diary then, in the following situations, the system randomized among the remaining five conditions (A, A, A, B, D). After the randomization and display of the treatment conditions, participants were given 5 min to complete the 3-min sedentary break or to remain in their sedentary position. One assessment point was finalized after completing the momentary e-diary ratings. Participants had the opportunity to postpone the prompts with a maximum delay of 15 min, that is three times for 5 min. Time-out phases of 30 min were integrated to minimize participant burden, which means after a completed e-diary rating, the participants were not prompted for at least 30 min. Under realistic conditions, adherence often will be less than perfect since participants may not be able or willing to show the intended behavior when prompted. Thus, during the in-person session, we asked participants to ignore prompts if they were unable or unwilling to complete e-diary questionnaire/tasks. Moreover, we were in contact with participants via smartphone messages to motivate them when adherence to the study design was low (e.g. ignoring several prompts per day). We considered adherence to a non-encouragement message met if the participant continued to spend the following 5 min in a sitting/lying position. In contrast, in the encouragement conditions (B, C, D), we considered adherence met if the participant spent at least 1 min in an upright position in the following 5 min. The adherence rate was calculated as a percentage score of being adherent. After the ambulatory assessment period concluded, participants had an in-person session where they returned the study equipment. Before as well as after the ambulatory assessment period, participants filled in questionnaires such as the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5)or the modified version of the German Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (mSBQ).

### Does disallowing body checking in non-elite 13-to 14-year-old ice hockey leagues reduce rates of injury and concussion? A cohort study in two Canadian provinces [^c4da3f5a]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare rates of injury and concussion among non-elite (lowest 60% by division of play) Bantam (ages 13-14 years) ice hockey leagues that disallow body checking to non-elite Bantam leagues that allow body checking.

Methods

In this 2-year cohort study, Bantam non-elite ice hockey players were recruited from leagues where policy allowed body checking in games (Calgary/Edmonton 2014-2015, Edmonton 2015-2016) and where policy disallowed body checking (Kelowna/Vancouver 2014-2015, Calgary 2015-2016). All ice hockey game-related injuries resulting in medical attention, inability to complete a session and/or time loss from hockey were identified using valid injury surveillance methodology. Any player suspected of having concussion was referred to a study physician for diagnosis and management.

Results

49 body checking (608 players) and 33 non-body checking teams (396 players) participated. There were 129 injuries (incidence rate (IR)=7.98/1000hours) and 54 concussions (IR=3.34/1000hours) in the body checking teams in games. After policy change, there were 31 injuries (IR=3.66/1000hours) and 17 concussions (IR=2.01/1000hours) in games. Policy disallowing body checking was associated with a lower rate of all injury (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.44; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.74). The point estimate showed a lower rate of concussion (adjusted IRR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.18), but this was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Policy change disallowing body checking in non-elite Bantam ice hockey resulted in a 56% lower rate of injury. There is growing evidence that disallowing body checking in youth ice hockey is associated with fewer injuries.

### Characteristics of real-world driving behavior in people with schizophrenia: a naturalistic study utilizing drive recorders [^048f5e22]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurement data

The analysis focused on the first 500 km of data collected by the drive recorder over 10 weeks. This inaugural study examined real-world driving behavior in PWS, so analysis was limited to participants’ routine driving activities. The analysis excluded (1) instances when someone other than the primary driver was in the vehicle, (2) driving outside the Northern Kanto region, 3) driving on expressways, and 4) trips exceeding 2 hours. Expressway driving and long-duration trips were excluded due to differing conditions from daily driving and the increased likelihood of destinations outside the regular driving area. Participants were also required to verify that they did not engage in drinking and driving during the 10-week period, a statement corroborated verbally by their family members or primary care workers.

Measured data included (1) average speed, (2) average maximum speed per trip, and 3) violation/dangerous driving behaviors, such as speeding (exceeding the limit by 20 km/h or more, and 30 km/h or more), running red lights, starting without observing traffic signals, ignoring stop signs, lane departures, failure to take proper safety precautions at intersections (e.g. illegal turns), and distracted driving (e.g. using a smartphone or operating a car navigation/audio system). Average speed, average maximum speed per trip, and violations involving sudden acceleration, steering, and braking were assessed via data from the drive recorder. Sudden acceleration, steering, and braking were defined as forces that exceeded 0.5 G. The remaining violations were analyzed per Japanese traffic laws, as outlined in Table 1. The first and second authors independently analyzed the recorded violations, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion.

Long-term travelers and expatriates—pre-travel risk and accessing care abroad—risk for illness or injury increases with duration of travel, and long-term travel is “commonly considered ≥6 months”; pre-travel discussions should include accessing routine and emergency care, vaccines, infectious diseases not prevented by vaccines, injury prevention, and cultural and mental health issues. Before departure, “all long-term travelers should undergo complete medical and dental examinations,” and “for expatriates, a mental health evaluation prior to travel could identify and help address underlying issues that often cause early repatriation.” Travelers “should anticipate that they will need care at some point during their stay and plan where they will obtain it and how they will pay for it.” People traveling for work or with an organization “might have a predetermined source for care,” whereas “other travelers should identify a healthcare source in advance.” Long-term travelers also “should determine whether they will need supplemental travel health insurance and evacuation insurance.”

International business traveler health—medication timing, in-flight sedatives, and post-travel responsibilities: Travelers should be counseled to limit or refrain from in-flight alcohol consumption and to be cautious in the use of hypnotic drugs (e.g., zolpidem) in flight or when the anticipated duration of sleep might be less than the duration of drug effects. Changing time zones can interfere with taking prescribed medicine on time, and adjusting the timing of regular medication during international travel might be a challenge; the healthcare professional can help create schedules for travelers taking medication(s), both on the way overseas and when returning. Anticipating possible baggage delays or loss, international business travelers should carry with them a travel health kit containing sufficient quantities of all necessary medications to last the duration of travel and extra doses for several days to a week or more in case of delays. International travel health programs provide international business travelers with both pre-travel and post-travel care, and because an international business traveler could be a sentinel for a health risk at an overseas facility or workplace, a correct diagnosis is important not only to the health and well-being of the traveler but also to that of other workers at the jobsite. Returning workers can assist by notifying employers of any work-related incidents or on-the-job exposures, and international business travelers also should provide information about any changes in the quality of available medical care, accommodations, security, and any other medical or legal issues that could adversely affect the health of future travelers.

Travel and breastfeeding—pre-travel preparation and feeding recommendations note that the preparation of a traveler who is breastfeeding differs only slightly from that of other travelers and depends in part on whether the breastfeeding traveler and child will be separated or together during travel. Most travelers should be advised to continue breastfeeding their children throughout travel. Before departure, travelers might benefit from compiling a list of local breastfeeding resources at their destination, as well as virtual resources.

Acute altitude illness prophylaxis—timing and duration: Pharmacologic prophylaxis should be started the day before ascent but still has beneficial effects if started on the day of ascent; for those staying at the same elevation for more than several days, prophylaxis may be stopped after 2 d at the highest altitude. Individuals ascending faster than recommended rates may consider continuing preventive medication for 2 to 4 d after arrival at the target altitude, but there are no data to support this approach, and in the absence of AMS/HACE symptoms preventive medications should be stopped when descent is initiated.

### Offshore transport of particulate organic carbon in the California current system by mesoscale eddies [^032fa2e9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Nonlinear eddies located in the CCS between 33°−43°N and 0–1500 km from the coast during the time period of the satellite POC data (1997–2010) were identified from the dataset for the analyses. Eddies are considered nonlinear if the ratio U / c > 1, where U is the maximum rotational speed and c is the translation speed of the eddy estimated at each point along the trajectory. In total, 553 cyclonic eddy tracks were studied. Calculations of the nonlinearity parameters indicated that the majority of the eddies were nonlinear for at least 80% of their lifetime. The distance between the coastline and the location of the eddy centers at each point along the eddy trajectories was calculated to distinguish eddies generated or located inshore and offshore of 300 km from the coast (Supplementary Fig. 1). The threshold of 300 km from the coast was chosen to define inshore and offshore based on the average width of the band of high POC concentrations along the coast. The band of high POC extends about 250 km from the coast on average. Since POC is used here as a tracer of coastal water, a distance larger than the average width of the band with high POC was chosen to distinguish between upwelled coastal water and offshore water. The distance of 300 km is also consistent with the average width of the coastal band with high sea surface temperature frontal activity and of the meandering upwelling jet. To check that the results are not sensitive to the distance threshold, the analyses were repeated by using other distances from the coast, e.g. 350 km, and the results were consistent to those presented here. The offshore region was divided into bands of 300 km in width for the analyses (300–600, 600–900, 900–1200, and 1200–1500 km from the coast). The width of the offshore bands was chosen to be the same as the inshore region (0–300 km).

### The most effective strategy for recruiting a pregnancy cohort: a tale of two cities [^dfe19a49]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Calgary

As is clear from Table 1, face-to-face recruitment was also the most effective strategy in Calgary: of 821 Calgary participants, 276 women were obtained from recruiters in doctors’ offices, and 180 from recruiters in ultrasound offices.

These results were consistent with those observed in the subsample of 196 women who participated via the satellite clinics established for the purpose of diversifying the Calgary sample. In that subgroup, the most successful strategy was to fully educate the family doctors, who then presented the study to those patients who were potentially interested. As most of the women with diverse cultural backgrounds and/or low SES sought care mostly, if not exclusively, through their family doctor, this approach allowed us the opportunity to access these women the best. The final result was that 62% (122/196) of these women were recruited after their family doctor first introduced the study and asked if they would be willing to hear more from a research assistant, 14% (27/196) were first approached by a research assistant, and 24% (47/196) were recruited by a handful of the other recruitment strategies.

Comparison of sociodemographic variables

Maternal age, income, education, employment status and ethnicity were similar in both cities (Table 2) and though Calgary had a slightly higher SES there were no significant differences in the data using non-parametric statistical analysis (Fisher’s exact test and Chi-square). However, Calgary was able to recruit a small number of participants without high school education whereas all of Edmonton’s participants had high school education or higher.

### No evidence for decision fatigue using large-scale field data from healthcare [^557df0bf]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

a) Overlap AM-PM shift. Here we want as much separation as possible in time spent at work (long for the AM shift, short for the PM shift) but also as large a sample as possible. For example, choosing only those nurses who start very early would mean increased separation (longer time until the overlap period) but at the cost of getting a smaller sample, because those who start later but are still in the AM shift would be excluded. We used the following main rules: Consider only decisions taken between 13:00–17:00 on Mon–Fri for workers who either take their first call 6:00–9:00 and their last call after 13:00 (AM worker), or take their first call 13:00–18:00 and their last call after 19:00 (PM worker). Then also exclude workers who take <12 calls because they are likely working on other tasks (e.g. admin) that we do not have data on. Further, we divide the relevant time window (13:00–17:00) in 30 min time bins (thus eight in total) and keep only those bins with >100 observations for each category of workers (AM and PM shifts, respectively). Applied to the pilot data these rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 9730 calls to k = 166 nurses; applied to the target data (stage 2), using these rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 9648 calls to k = 143 nurses.

b) Intense call sequences before vs. after breaks. Here we want sufficiently long and intense sequences, meaning many calls with little time in-between for rest, but also as large a sample as possible. We used the following main rules: Consider only sequences where a nurse handled at least five calls before and five calls after a break 8–40 min, and there are at most five min between each call. The exact values used here are arbitrary (unless changed substantially), e.g. using 7 or 9 min instead of 8 min as lower cutoff for a break should not make a difference; the important part for us was to decide on and specify these values exactly and in advance, in order to credibly restrict analytic flexibility later on when analyzing the new data. These rules resulted in a final sample size of n = 5120 calls to k = 116 nurses in the pilot data; and n = 4940 calls to k = 77 nurses in the target (stage 2) data.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease is not associated with air pollution: a case-crossover study [^0c6fbcf5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 1374 and 1159 incident cases of UGIB secondary to PUD in Calgary and Edmonton, respectively. Baseline characteristics stratified by city are described in Table 1. The proportion of perforated PUD was higher in Edmonton (3.4 %) as compared to Calgary (2.0 %) (p < 0.05). Also, Calgary residents suffering from UGIB secondary to PUD were less likely to have comorbidities (40.9 %) as compared to Edmonton (55.3 %) (p < 0.001). The median and interquartile range (IQR) for the air pollutants for Calgary, Edmonton, and pooled across cities are provided in Table 2.

The results found using the discovery cohort in Calgary are reported in Table 3. Pollutant concentrations were not associated with developing UGIB secondary to PUD when the exposure period was on the same day or the day prior to being hospitalized. However, the incidence of UGIB secondary to PUD was inversely associated with NO 2, PM 2.5, and PM 10 when accounting for average concentration over 3, 5, and/or 7 days.

### Migrating mule deer compensate en route for phenological mismatches [^78fc718e]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Billions of animals migrate to track seasonal pulses in resources. Optimally timing migration is a key strategy, yet the ability of animals to compensate for phenological mismatches en route is largely unknown. Using GPS movement data collected from 72 adult female deer over a 10-year duration, we study a population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Wyoming that lack reliable cues on their desert winter range, causing them to start migration 70 days ahead to 52 days behind the wave of spring green-up. We show that individual deer arrive at their summer range within an average 6-day window by adjusting movement speed and stopover use. Late migrants move 2.5 times faster and spend 72% less time on stopovers than early migrants, which allows them to catch the green wave. Our findings suggest that ungulates, and potentially other migratory species, possess cognitive abilities to recognize where they are in space and time relative to key resources. Such behavioral capacity may allow migratory taxa to maintain foraging benefits amid rapidly changing phenology.

### The feasibility of a multi-site, clinic-supported, and tailored neuro-oncology exercise program [^05987793]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Procedure, Participants, and Recruitment

This study was approved by the University of Calgary Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta (HREBA)—Cancer Committee (CC; HREBA. CC-20-0322). The complete study protocol is published separately.Briefly, the ACE-Neuro study recruited neuro-oncology patients from 2 clinical sites across Alberta—Calgary (Tom Baker Cancer Center) and Edmonton (Cross Cancer Institute). Eligibility for the study included: a diagnosis of a primary brain tumor, being pre-, on, or completed treatment and over 18 years of age, and the ability to consent in English. Patient referral occurred either via the electronic medical record (Calgary) or via self-referral (ie, contacting the study team after getting information from a study brochure, poster, or word of mouth; Calgary and Edmonton). In Calgary, once a patient was referred, a Neuro-Oncology Rehabilitation Triage Clinictriaged patients to either physiotherapy, occupational therapy, physiatry, exercise, or a combination of services to support access to wellness resources. The triage clinic assessed patients’ functional and cognitive status and determined referral to exercise based on no new/unmanaged medical conditions, as well as scores of ≥5 on the Short Physical Performance Battery protocol, <3 for ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), and >50 for KPS (Karnofsky Performance Status).In Edmonton, patients were initially meant to be referred via their usual occupational therapy assessment at the Cross Cancer Institute, but due to personnel changes at the start of recruitment, this was no longer an option. Thus, patients could only self-refer in Edmonton. To support participant safety and appropriate tailoring of the exercise intervention, pre-exercise screening procedures occurred across both clinical sites and included collecting clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, health history (ie, cancer history, other medical conditions), and exercise history and preferences.

### Working from home: experiences of home-working, health behavior and well-being during the 2020 UK COVID-19 lockdown [^222c58a4]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants reported that amenities were in closer proximity, so they tended to accrue minimal incidental physical activity in the course of the workday:

The toilet [at my workplace] is a few hundred metres away … I ' m getting a few hundred steps in just going to the toilet. Whereas obviously [at home], the bathroom ' s right next to my bedroom. (P21)

Consequently, while some participants reported feeling motivated to take regular activity breaks from sitting, they often found doing so unsatisfactory due to the negligible movement involved (“I ' m getting up quite a bit but not really having anywhere to go”; P11). Some participants adapted to this by taking breaks to undertake household chores and other non–work-related activities. For some, these breaks were designed to reduce sitting time (“I ' m always like running around, like washing the dishes—whenever I can get a chance to leave that chair. I do it.”; P22), whereas others were taken to obtain “thinking space” needed to solve work problems:

If I ' ve got some [mental] block. then I ' ll just take the dog [for a walk]. 15 minutes, 20 minutes just to go around the block. And try and calm my mind. Give me some reflection time. (P14)

Changes to Work-Life Balance

Participants described various benefits and challenges to work-life balance arising from working at home. The time savings from not commuting, and the flexibility of working at home, made some feel more able to engage in activities potentially beneficial to health and well-being. Some participants invested time savings in sleeping longer, which reportedly enhanced sleep quality (“I ' m sleeping better now, and having that time back from commuting has really helped”; P9), and some reported going to bed later. Others reported spending more time preparing fresh food or diversifying their diet (“ [I ' ve been able to] do a wider variety of meals because you ' ve got that bit of extra time from not commuting;” P19). Not having to travel was felt by some to conserve their physical energy, so allowed them to take more physical activity:

Contraindications to travel during pregnancy—absolute contraindications to travel are conditions for which the potential harm of travel during pregnancy always outweighs the benefits of travel to the pregnant traveler or their fetus, whereas relative contraindications are conditions for which travel should be avoided if the potential harm from travel outweighs its benefits. Travel rarely is contraindicated during a normal pregnancy. Pregnancies that require frequent antenatal monitoring or close medical supervision might warrant a recommendation that travel be postponed. Risk of obstetric complications is greatest in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Medical insurance for international travel—The US government does not provide medical insurance for US travelers overseas and will not pay costs for travelers receiving international medical care, and Medicare and Medicaid do not cover these costs, nor do many private domestic health insurance plans. Thus, travelers should purchase supplemental insurance prior to travel, and because travel insurance policy coverage varies, travelers should carefully read the terms to make sure the policy fits all their needs. Travelers might need additional insurance coverage for the costs of emergency medical care; medical transport back to the United States; travel and accommodation costs in the event of interrupted or delayed travel; 24-hour contact services; and treatment received overseas for any preexisting conditions, including pregnancy.

### Whole-genome analysis of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 4 causing outbreak of invasive pneumococcal disease, Alberta, Canada [^5bfdd2e4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

WGS

We conducted WGS analyses on 96 S. pneumoniae serotype 4 isolates from Calgary, 94 from Edmonton, and 37 background serotype 4 isolates from the National Microbiology Laboratory, collected from other provinces in Canada. Illumina MiSeq sequencing yielded an average 817,775 reads/genome, and average genome coverage was 91X. De novo assembly resulted in an average contig length of 45,875 nt and an N50 length of 85,135 nt.

The 190 S. pneumoniae serotype 4 genomes from Alberta clustered into 3 major phylogenetic clades (Figure 2); each clade was associated with an MLST. The largest number 93.7% (n = 159) of isolates were located in clade A and were MLST type ST244. Isolates in clade A were geographically relatively evenly distributed between Calgary (n = 69) and Edmonton (n = 90) and temporally after 2010 (n = 4); ≈19 isolates per year were found during 2011–2019. Clade B included 2 isolates from Edmonton, collected in 2010 and 2012, and 1 from Calgary, collected in 2018, that were ST695, a triple-locus variant of ST244 and ancestor of newly emergent serotype 19A/ST695 clone. Clade C was associated with ST205 (n = 23) and ST15531 (n = 2), a single-locus variant of ST205. Twenty-three of the 24 isolates in clade C were collected from the Calgary region. Although another ST205 isolate from Edmonton and the TIGR4 reference strain (National Center for Biotechnology Information accession no. NC_003028.3) were proximal to clade C in the phylogenetic tree, ClusterPicker excluded them from the clade based on the clustering thresholds used. A further 2 isolates from Calgary and a third from Edmonton were distant phylogenetic outliers of ST2213, ST7776, and ST11662. Most national background isolates collected from other provinces (n = 36) clustered within the ST205 clade C lineage (n = 23), but the ST244 clade A lineage was predominantly associated with Alberta, with fewer national isolates present (n = 10) (Appendix Figure 1).

Pre-post change in statin use

The overall prevalence of statin use in a 28-day period during the study period was 12.9% in the no diabetes/older than age 50 cohort and 25.4% in the diabetes cohort. The interaction terms between zone and pre-post change in slope were significant in both cohorts (Table 4, Figs. S 6, S 7). In analysis by zone, there was a small but statistically significant pre-post increase in slope for statin use for Calgary and Edmonton zones but not in Other zones. In both cohorts, the increase was larger in Edmonton zone than in Calgary zone. In the diabetes cohort, the pre-post increase represents an additional 75 people (95% CI 27–118) in Calgary Zone (cohort size 14,600) and 127 people (95% CI 87–167) in Edmonton zone (cohort size 12,500) who were dispensed a statin per 28-day period, over a one-year timeframe. In the no diabetes/over 50 cohort, it represents an additional 58 people (95% CI 4–112) in Calgary Zone (cohort size 37,000) and 89 people (95% CI 54–125) in Edmonton Zone (cohort size 19,500) who were dispensed a statin per 28-day period, over a one-year timeframe.

### Breaking up prolonged sitting to improve cardiometabolic risk: dose-response analysis of a randomized crossover trial [^52e40e89]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed nations and is associated with deleterious health outcomes. Physical activity guidelines recommend reductions in sedentary time; however, quantitative guidelines that inform how often and how long sedentary time should be interrupted have not been provided. The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of multiple doses of a sedentary break intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors, concurrently evaluating efficacy of varying frequencies and durations of sedentary breaks.

Methods

In a randomized crossover study, middle- and older-age adults ( n = 11) completed the following 8-h conditions on five separate days: 1 uninterrupted sedentary (control) condition and four acute (experimental) trials that entailed different sedentary break frequency/duration combinations: every 30 min for 1 min, every 30 min for 5 min, every 60 min for 1 min, and every 60 min for 5 min. Sedentary breaks entailed light-intensity walking. Glucose and blood pressure (BP) were measured every 15 and 60 min, respectively.

Results

Compared with control, glucose incremental area under the curve was significantly attenuated only for the every 30 min for 5-min dose (-11.8[4.7]; P = 0.017). All sedentary break doses yielded significant net decreases in systolic BP from baseline compared with control ( P < 0.05). The largest reductions in systolic BP were observed for the every 60 min for 1 min (-5.2 [1.4] mm Hg) and every 30 min for 5 min (-4.3[1.4] mm Hg) doses.

Conclusions

The present study provides important information concerning efficacious sedentary break doses. Higher-frequency and longer-duration breaks (every 30 min for 5 min) should be considered when targeting glycemic responses, whereas lower doses may be sufficient for BP lowering.

### Migrating mule deer compensate en route for phenological mismatches [^08027735]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the xeric habitats of the Red Desert, the green wave propagates gradually, but green-up becomes more rapid and fleeting as it progresses towards the mountainous summer range (Fig. 4a, c). Because of this, the foraging penalty for being mismatched (which is highest when green-up is most rapid) was 11% higher during the last quarter of migration than the first quarter of migration (p < 2.20 × 10 −16 ; Supplementary Fig. 3). The ability of mule deer to compensate for phenological mismatches en route thus reduces the foraging penalty they would have experienced if mismatched during later parts of their migration where green-up is more wave-like.

We investigated two complimentary behavioral mechanisms of compensation: movement rate and time spent on stopovers. How fast deer moved along their migratory route was strongly linked to whether they were ahead or behind the green wave when they started migration. Despite being overall worse surfers than early and mid-migrants, late migrants made the best of their strategy by accelerating their movement. In contrast to early migrants that moved slowly (2.9 ± 0.3 km/day) and spent extended time on stopovers (36 ± 5 days), late migrants moved 2.5 times faster (7.1 ± 0.7 km/day) and spent 72% less time on stopovers (10 ± 5 days; ANOVA rate, F 2,149 = 66.40, p = 2.40 × 10 −21 ; ANOVA stopover, F 2,124 = 33.55, p = 2.26 ×10 −12 ; Fig. 4d, e), allowing them to catch up with the green wave. Migration distance, age, pregnancy, and nutritional condition did not influence how fast or slow mule deer migrated (Supplementary Tables 9, 10), suggesting that movement rate and stopover use are largely linked to an animal’s position along the green wave. Mule deer seemingly gathered information along their migratory route to recognize their own temporal deviation from peak green-up and made movement decisions that allowed them to catch up to the green wave—or allowed the wave to catch up with them.

WARNING

Bumetanide injection is a potent diuretic which, if given in excessive amounts, can lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Therefore, careful medical supervision is required, and dose and dosage schedule have to be adjusted to the individual patient's needs [see Dosage and Administration] .

### Individualized cognitive effort to failure does not affect subsequent strenuous physical performance [^527bdb44]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2025). Medium credibility.

Sample

The study was preregistered, within participant, and counterbalanced. Before the familiarization visit, participants were randomly assigned to start the experimental protocol with one of the two experimental sessions (cognitive task to failure or control) based on balanced permutations generated by a Web-based computer program. As in previous studies, the sample size was chosen based on a Bayesian approach and the available human and material resources. The sample size was determined by using sequential tests with two-sided Bayes factor starting with a minimum of 20 participants and controlling the Bayes factor for the main index of physical performance (i.e. reduction of average time in running exercise after the cognitive task to failure) until it reached strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (BF 10 > 6) or the null hypothesis (BF 10 < 1/6). If the Bayes factor did not reach the criteria, additional participants would be collected in batches of two (to keep the randomization and counterbalancing) until the criteria were fulfilled. If not, we planned to stop the experiment when we would reach the maximum number of participants, in which we would be able to compensate economically (40 participants). In any case, even if we were not able to reach the 40 participants sample, we would have stopped the experiment by the end of July 2024. Finally, we stopped by the end of July, and we reached 21 participants (14 men and 7 women with an age of 25.4 ± 5.3 yr, 68.9 ± 12.2 kg, 176.1 ± 7.9 cm, and maximal aerobic speed of 16.1 ± 2.6 km·h −1). Data were only included if the participant completed both experimental sessions and uncompleted data were deleted. Two other participants completed the familiarization session, but they did not attend the experimental session for personal reasons. For some variables, we do not have the full data set because of technical issues; the sample size for each variable is indicated in the Results section.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline parameters (Table 1)

TABLE 1 
Baseline characteristics and vital signs of participants

The study population consisted of 10 subjects (40% female) with mean age of 36.5 ± 6.5 years and mean body mass index of 21.9 ± 1.7 kg/m 2. Participants had 4.25 ± 3.1 years of running experience, and ran 29 ± 9.1 km weekly. Mean pre‐exercise values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were 120 ± 11.6 mmHg, 72.8 ± 8.4 mmHg and 59 ± 6.7 beats per minute respectively. All participants were free of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.

Participants completed the 21 km treadmill run in an average time of 121.6 ± 16.1 minutes (122.7 ± 20 minutes for male subjects, compared with 120 ± 10.1 minutes for females). These timings correspond to the 60 to 70th percentile and 30 to 40th percentile for recreational male and female runners respectively, and 40 to 50th percentile overall. 21 Average heart rate during the run was 149.8 ± 11.5 bpm. This translated to 81.6 ± 5.1% of their age‐predicted maximum heart rate.

### Transforming work breaks to promote health [^84479ce0]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Public health, medicine, and nursing are disciplines charged with promoting health, preventing and treating disease, and improving quality of life. One of the most effective ways to achieve these objectives is to make health-promoting behaviors a part of people's everyday routines. Because many adults spend a substantial portion of the day in the workplace, and because it is common for workers to have two 10- to 15-minute work breaks each day, work breaks are a potentially important--but currently underutilized--venue in which to promote healthy behaviors. Unfortunately, work breaks frequently involve health-compromising behaviors. This paper presents an argument to restructure work breaks into "booster breaks" that improve public health by encouraging health-promoting practices. This new way of thinking about work breaks is described. The implications and challenges of this paradigm shift for workplace culture and public health are addressed.
