## Question

Gallbladder debris

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about gallbladder debris, including definitions, imaging features, pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical significance, diagnostic approach, and management, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and consensus definitions for sludge versus microlithiasis. Then, I should verify imaging characteristics and the diagnostic performance of ultrasound, EUS, and MRCP. Next, I will examine pathophysiology and risk factors, followed by clinical significance and complications. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic algorithm and finally propose management strategies, including when to observe, treat medically, intervene endoscopically, or operate surgically, while double-checking guideline alignment and correcting any inconsistencies I notice along the way.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Biliary sludge is best defined as discrete, hyperechoic material without acoustic shadowing that layers dependently in the gallbladder or bile ducts, whereas biliary microlithiasis refers to calculi 5 mm or smaller with acoustic shadowing; importantly, these are distinct and should not be used synonymously, and both can occur in the gallbladder or bile ducts, which aligns with the 2023 international consensus and expert voting results [^111gRh1C] [^116DGsUD] [^116ddpJX] [^112MQzXw].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging features and diagnostic performance so I don't overstate ultrasound. On ultrasound, sludge appears as nonshadowing, mobile echogenic material layering dependently, while microliths are echogenic foci with distal acoustic shadowing and are typically ≤ 5 mm. Transabdominal ultrasound is first-line but has limited sensitivity for small ductal sludge or microliths, whereas EUS is the reference modality with superior sensitivity and is preferred when suspicion remains high or when pancreatitis is unexplained, and MRCP is highly accurate for choledocholithiasis and can depict sludge as T2-intermediate signal layering material, though a completely debris-filled duct can be challenging and may mimic a stricture or mass on MRCP, so I should be cautious in interpretation [^116DGsUD] [^1174HagD] [^111oCz4A] [^117DYSym].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology before attributing causality. Sludge forms when bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol or calcium salts, often in the setting of gallbladder hypomotility or stasis. Inflammation and mucin hypersecretion accelerate nucleation, and emerging data implicate innate immune activation and NETosis in response to cholesterol crystals, linking sterile inflammation to crystal aggregation and impaired motility, which together promote progression from sludge to microliths to stones [^116AvZ32] [^112juCxu] [^116NonAt].

> I need to check the risk factors carefully and separate transient from chronic drivers. High-risk states include pregnancy, rapid weight loss, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide therapy, and organ transplantation, with additional associations to ceftriaxone, critical illness, and endocrine therapies. Female sex and metabolic syndrome increase risk via estrogen effects and insulin resistance, and genetic susceptibility contributes substantially, while occult pancreaticobiliary reflux may promote sludge via mucosal injury and altered bile composition, so I should stratify patients by modifiable versus nonmodifiable risks when counseling [^116AvZ32] [^113bewPm] [^114uXeVS] [^116MXV33].

> Next, I should review clinical significance and not jump to conclusions that sludge is benign. Symptomatic sludge carries a meaningful risk of biliary events: in a prospective cohort, the 5-year cumulative risk of cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis was 33.9% with sludge versus 15.8% without, and cholecystectomy reduced events, suggesting sludge can be causative; similarly, bile duct sludge behaves clinically like choledocholithiasis with comparable recurrence after endoscopic clearance, and in idiopathic pancreatitis, sludge and microliths account for a notable fraction of cases once EUS is used, with severity comparable to gallstone pancreatitis, so I should treat symptomatic sludge as a biliary disease driver rather than an incidental finding [^114hfBgz] [^112mMrCb] [^111gRh1C] [^1174HagD].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach and ensure I'm not missing a step. In patients with biliary symptoms or unexplained pancreatitis, start with right upper quadrant ultrasound and liver tests. If sludge or microliths are suspected but not seen, or if the pancreatitis remains idiopathic, proceed to EUS given its superior sensitivity for small biliary concrements. MRCP is appropriate when ductal anatomy must be delineated or when EUS is unavailable, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound can help distinguish tumefactive sludge from vascularized tissue when a pseudomass is suspected, so I should tailor the sequence to pretest probability and local expertise [^113J1knp] [^1174HagD] [^111oCz4A] [^1133HoZ4].

> I should double-check management principles and align with guidelines. For asymptomatic sludge, observation with lifestyle modification and risk factor control is reasonable, as many cases resolve spontaneously. For symptomatic sludge or microlithiasis, especially with recurrent pain, cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis, cholecystectomy is the definitive therapy and reduces recurrent biliary events. If cholecystectomy is contraindicated, ursodeoxycholic acid may dissolve cholesterol-rich sludge or microliths in selected patients, but recurrence is common and therapy requires months with limited durability, so patient selection and expectations are key. For choledocholithiasis or retained ductal debris, ERCP with sphincterotomy or balloon dilation is indicated, and same-admission cholecystectomy is generally advised when feasible to prevent recurrence, with EUS-guided gallbladder drainage as a bridge in high-risk surgical patients [^116AvZ32] [^1113ZqqS] [^11455ZZF] [^111RL31Y] [^11243JHF].

> But wait, what if the patient has high-risk features for gallbladder cancer or atypical imaging? I need to ensure I don't overlook malignancy mimics. Porcelain gallbladder, polyps larger than 1 cm, and chronic inflammatory gallbladders carry increased cancer risk and warrant prophylactic or definitive cholecystectomy with appropriate staging, and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis can mimic cancer radiologically; if imaging is indeterminate, contrast-enhanced ultrasound or MRCP can help differentiate tumefactive sludge from neoplasm, and selective histopathology protocols are acceptable in low-risk specimens, though I should maintain a low threshold for full histology when macroscopic features are suspicious [^114iWrdS] [^111rpsfP] [^1133HoZ4] [^1119JGWn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cholesterol stones comprised 10% of gallstones, but that seems off; let me verify and correct it. Mixed stones predominate in many series, and cholesterol stones can constitute the majority in Western populations, so my earlier 10% figure was too low and likely reflects a specific cohort or outdated source, whereas contemporary reviews emphasize cholesterol-rich stones as common, reinforcing the rationale for ursodiol in carefully selected, cholesterol-predominant sludge or microlithiasis [^112JW9r9] [^115EhAj6].

> I should confirm special scenarios so I don't miss nuances. In pregnancy, most sludge resolves postpartum, so conservative management is preferred unless complications arise. In cystic fibrosis, symptomatic gallbladder disease warrants cholecystectomy and choledocholithiasis should be managed with ERCP per CF consensus. In patients on somatostatin analogs, sludge and stones are common but often asymptomatic, so routine surveillance is not recommended unless symptoms occur. And in patients with suspected biliary pancreatitis, early cholecystectomy during the index admission reduces recurrence, so I should coordinate timing with surgery once inflammation subsides [^116jRt9E] [^111YSv42] [^117Cmkr1].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Define the entity using consensus sonographic criteria, assess symptoms and complications, stratify risk factors, choose imaging based on pretest probability with EUS as the reference for small concrements, manage asymptomatic cases conservatively, and treat symptomatic or complicated sludge or microlithiasis with cholecystectomy when feasible, reserving endoscopic therapy for ductal disease or high surgical risk, with medical dissolution as a selective, time-limited option. This approach balances evidence, guidelines, and patient-specific factors while minimizing both overtreatment and missed biliary events [^111gRh1C] [^1113ZqqS] [^111RL31Y] [^11455ZZF].

Gallbladder debris (biliary sludge) is a mixture of cholesterol crystals, calcium bilirubinate, and mucin that appears as **non-shadowing, mobile echogenic material** on ultrasound [^116DGsUD] [^116ddpJX]. It is common in pregnancy, rapid weight loss, TPN, and with certain drugs, and can cause biliary colic, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis [^116AvZ32] [^1174HagD]. Most sludge resolves spontaneously, but persistent or symptomatic cases may progress to stones or complications; cholecystectomy is indicated for recurrent symptoms or complications, while asymptomatic sludge is managed conservatively [^114hfBgz] [^116AvZ32].

---

## Composition and pathophysiology

Gallbladder debris is a suspension of **fine, non-shadowing echogenic particles** composed of:

- **Cholesterol monohydrate crystals**: from supersaturated bile [^115EhAj6].
- **Calcium bilirubinate granules**: from bilirubin precipitation [^116AvZ32].
- **Mucin glycoproteins**: from gallbladder epithelium, promoting nucleation and aggregation [^116NonAt].

Pathophysiology reflects **cholesterol supersaturation**, nucleation, and stasis; gallbladder hypomotility and inflammation accelerate formation and complications [^116JJVS6] [^112juCxu].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Although often incidental, gallbladder debris can cause **significant complications**:

- **Biliary colic**: transient cystic duct obstruction [^notfound].
- **Acute cholecystitis**: from persistent obstruction and inflammation [^112B6kfD].
- **Acute pancreatitis**: from sludge or microliths migrating into the bile duct [^111gRh1C] [^1174HagD].
- **Progression to gallstones**: approximately 20–30% over time [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors and associations

Several conditions predispose to **gallbladder debris**:

| **Risk factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Pregnancy | Hormonal changes causing gallbladder hypomotility [^114uXeVS] |
| Rapid weight loss | Increased cholesterol mobilization and bile supersaturation [^116AvZ32] |
| Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) | Gallbladder stasis due to lack of enteral stimulation [^113hoGpQ] |
| Octreotide therapy | Gallbladder hypomotility [^116AvZ32] |
| Ceftriaxone use | Biliary calcium-ceftriaxone precipitation [^113bewPm] |
| Hemolysis or cirrhosis | Increased unconjugated bilirubin leading to pigment sludge [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic imaging modalities

Ultrasound is the **first-line modality** for detecting gallbladder debris, with characteristic features:

- **Echogenicity**: hyperechoic, non-shadowing material layering dependently [^116DGsUD].
- **Mobility**: shifts with patient position [^notfound].
- **Absence of acoustic shadowing**: distinguishes from gallstones [^116DGsUD].

MRI/MRCP is useful when ultrasound is inconclusive or to distinguish sludge from other pathology, and **EUS** is highly sensitive for small sludge or microlithiasis, especially in idiopathic pancreatitis [^117H6sy6] [^1174HagD].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on symptoms, risk factors, and the likelihood of **complications**:

- **Conservative management**: Observation, dietary modification, and addressing underlying causes (e.g. TPN cessation, weight stabilization) [^notfound].
- **Medical therapy**: Ursodeoxycholic acid may dissolve cholesterol sludge in select patients, though recurrence is common [^notfound].
- **Surgical intervention**: Cholecystectomy is indicated for recurrent symptoms, complications (cholecystitis, pancreatitis), or persistent sludge despite conservative measures [^114hfBgz].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is generally favorable; many cases resolve spontaneously with removal of precipitating factors. Recurrence is common if underlying risk factors persist, and **cholecystectomy significantly reduces recurrence and complications** [^notfound].

---

Gallbladder debris is a **precursor to gallstones** and can cause significant biliary symptoms and complications. Accurate diagnosis with ultrasound and targeted management — conservative or surgical — based on symptoms and risk factors are essential to prevent progression and recurrence [^116AvZ32].

The precise mechanism by which neutrophils enter the biliary system and initiate this process has not been fully described. However, in both animal models and humans, the formation of cholesterol gallstones is preceded by inflammation of the gallbladder wall, including edema and the presence of inflammatory cells. Furthermore, bacteria have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both cholesterol and pigmented stones. A possible mechanism contributing to gallstone formation is the NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome is triggered by cholesterol crystals in atherosclerosis and MSU crystals in gout, as well as other endogenous crystals (calcium oxalate, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, and cystine) and exogenous crystals (asbestos, silica, aluminum adjuvant, and titanium dioxide).

Cholesterol Crystals and NETosis

Duewell et aldemonstrated that cholesterol crystals taken up by macrophages are incompletely degraded in phagosomes and transferred to lysosomes, where they induce the rupture of the phagolysosomal membrane. This results in the release of the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B, which acts as a signal to prime and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Undegraded cholesterol crystals released upon phagolysosomal membrane rupture may also act as DAMPs sensed by pattern recognition receptors, resulting in activation of the innate immune system. Cholesterol crystals thus induce inflammation via "frustrated phagocytosis" and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, with IL-1β and IL-18 release. In turn, this inflammation attracts neutrophils to the site of cholesterol crystals, resulting in potent stimulation of neutrophils by interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase and Receptor Interacting Protein Kinases (RIPK1–RIPK3)-mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein signaling and NET formation.

### Gallbladder function predicts subsequent biliary complications in patients with common bile duct stones after endoscopic treatment? [^111qaeGg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstracts

Background

In patients with common bile duct stones (CBDS) and intact gallbladder, further management for the gallbladder after the CBDS clearance is still controversial. The relationship between gallbladder motility and the biliary complications were seldom discussed. Our study is to predict the subsequent biliary complications by gallbladder function test using fatty meal sonography (FMS) in patients with CBDS who had been treated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Methods

Patients with an intact gallbladder and CBDS after endoscopic clearance of bile duct were enrolled. Patients received a fatty meal sonography after liver function returned to normal. The fasting volume, residual volume, and gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) in FMS were measured. Relationships of patients' characteristics, gallbladder function and recurrent biliary complication were analyzed.

Results

From 2011 to 2014, 118 patients were enrolled; 86 patients had calculus gallbladders, and 32 patients had acalculous gallbladders. After a mean follow- up of 33 months, 23 patients had recurrent biliary complications. Among 86 patients with calculus gallbladder, 15 patients had spontaneous clearance of gallbladder stones; 14 patients received cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis or recurrent colic pain with smooth postoperative courses. In the follow up period, six patients died of non-biliary causes. The GBEF is significant reduced in most patients with a calculus gallbladder in spite of stone color. Calculus gallbladder, alcohol drinking and more than one sessions of initial endoscopic treatment were found to be the risk factors of recurrent biliary complication.

Conclusions

Gallbladder motility function was poorer in patients with a calculus gallbladder, but it cannot predict the recurrent biliary complication. Since spontaneous clearance of gallbladder stone may occur, wait and see policy of gallbladder management after endoscopic treatment of CBDS is appropriate, but regular follow- up in those patients with risk factors for recurrence is necessary.

### Lithogenesis and bile metabolism [^112i4jQH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease exacts a considerable financial and social burden worldwide leading to frequent physician visits and hospitalizations. Based on their composition, gallstones are categorized as cholesterol, black pigment, and brown pigment, with each category having a unique structural, epidemiologic, and risk factor profile. Cholesterol crystal formation requires the presence of one or more of the following: (a) cholesterol supersaturation, (b) accelerated nucleation, or (c) gallbladder hypomotility/bile stasis. Some risk factors for cholesterol stones include age, gender, genetics, obesity, rapid weight loss, and ileal disease. Generally, pigment stones are formed by the precipitation of bilirubin in bile, with black stones associated with chronic hemolytic states, cirrhosis, Gilbert syndrome, or cystic fibrosis, and brown stones associated with chronic bacterial or parasitic infections.

### The bad gallbladder [^1158gAui]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a common operation; approximately 20 million Americans have gallstones, the most common indication. Surgeons who operate on the biliary tree must be familiar with the presentations and treatment options for acute and chronic biliary pathology. We focus on the difficult "bad" gallbladder. We explore the available evidence as to what to do when a gallbladder is too inflamed, too technically challenging, or a patient is too sick to undergo standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We discuss whether or not open cholecystectomy is a relevant tool and what can be done to manage common bile duct stones found unexpectedly intraoperatively.

### EUS-guided gallbladder drainage and subsequent peroral endoscopic cholecystolithotomy: a tool to reduce chemotherapy discontinuation in neoplastic patients? [^1114cdym]. VideoGIE (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) is emerging as a valuable treatment for acute cholecystitis (AC) in patients unfit for surgery. When lumen-apposing metal stents are used, large-caliber access to the gallbladder allows for subsequent direct peroral endoscopic cholecystoscopy (POEC) and eventual cholecystolithotomy (CL), offering a potentially "curative" solution for frailer patients. The aim of this series was to evaluate the outcome of these procedures in oncologic patients experiencing AC, with a specific focus on chemotherapy continuity.

Methods

A prospective registry of all consecutive therapeutic EUS procedures performed in the San Raffaele Institute between December 2020 and April 2021 was searched for EUS-GBD + POEC-CL performed in chemotherapy candidates. Clinical and technical variables were prospectively registered, as were days of chemotherapy delay and postprocedural outcomes.

Results

Three consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a malignancy (2 pancreatic cancers and 1 severe myeloproliferative disease with skeletal lesions) experienced AC and were primarily treated by EUS-GBD. After 4 weeks, they were systematically scheduled for POEC-CL and lumen-apposing metal stent exchange for a double-pigtail plastic stent. All procedures and revisions were successful, with rapid clinical improvement. All gallbladders were cleared of food debris and stones between 3 and 15 mm using grasping forceps, polypectomy snares, Dormia baskets, and mechanical lithotripsy. One mild adverse event without any clinical consequence was registered during POEC-CL. Revisions did not interfere with the chemotherapy schedule. Technical variables (eg, gastric vs duodenal drainage or need for coaxial double-pigtail plastic stent) are discussed.

Conclusions

EUS-GBD and subsequent POEC-CL allows a highly effective and minimally invasive solution for AC. These initial experiences promote further evaluation of this approach for all those individuals in whom surgical interventions are undesirable, such as oncologic patients whose prognosis depends on chemotherapy continuity, although further prospective confirmation in this setting should be pursued.

### Chenodiol [^114wCnFW]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Chenodiol is indicated for patients with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age. The likelihood of successful dissolution is far greater if the stones are floatable or small. For patients with nonfloatable stones, dissolution is less likely and added weight should be given to the risk that more emergent surgery might result from a delay due to unsuccessful treatment. Safety of use beyond 24 months is not established. Chenodiol will not dissolve calcified (radiopaque) or radiolucent bile pigment stones.

### Implications of gallbladder cholesterolosis and cholesterol polyps? [^112LH1L8]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical significance of cholesterolosis has not been well established but there are some provocative, if not robust, studies of the role it may play in the pathophysiology of pancreatitis and biliary dyskinesia, as well as hypercholesterolemia. Our aim was to take advantage of a very large cholecystectomy (CCY) database to support or refute these potentially important reported associations.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of 6868 patients who underwent CCY from 2001–2013 was performed. Comparisons were made using the student t-test for continuous and chi-square analysis for categorical, variables.

Results

Among patients for whom the CCY was the primary operation, 1053 (18%) had cholesterolosis and 4596 did not. Compared to those without cholesterolosis, those with cholesterolosis were no more likely to have elevated cholesterol levels (P = 0.64) nor low gallbladder ejection fraction (P = 0.2). To evaluate cholesterolosis as a cause of pancreatitis, all patients with gallstones were eliminated, leaving 639 patients. Among these, not only was cholesterolosis not associated with more pancreatitis, but rather there was not a single patient with or without cholesterolosis who had pancreatitis.

Conclusions

Despite prior reports of associations between cholesterolosis and elevated serum cholesterol, depressed ejection fraction, and increased risk of pancreatitis, careful analysis of this current, larger data set does not support these associations. Any patient with stones or sludge, or with biliary dyskinesia, and appropriate symptoms, should be considered for CCY, with or without suspected cholesterolosis.

Point-of-care gallbladder evaluation — long-axis and transverse views in the supine position may be included, and measurements of the anterior gallbladder wall should be considered and may aid in determining gallbladder wall thickening. If the patient presents with pain, tenderness to transducer compression should be assessed for the presence of the ultrasound Murphy sign, and the presence of pericholecystic fluid should be assessed. If the operator is uncertain about abnormalities found, a comprehensive right upper quadrant sonogram should be requested.

### Gallstone disease [^114gL3rX]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease is one of the most prevalent gastrointestinal diseases with a substantial burden to health care systems that is supposed to increase in ageing populations at risk. Aetiology and pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones still are not well defined, and strategies for prevention and efficient nonsurgical therapies are missing. This review summarizes current concepts on the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones with focus on the uptake and secretion of biliary lipids and special emphasis on recent studies into the genetic background.

### Imaging of gallstones and complications [^114D1RKd]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gallbladder pathologies caused by gallstones are commonly encountered in clinical practice, making accurate diagnosis critical for effective patient management. Radiologists play a key role in differentiating these conditions through imaging interpretation, ensuring that appropriate treatment is initiated. The imaging features of gallstone associated diseases are classified into various categories, such as inflammatory conditions, benign lesions, malignant tumors, and associated complications. A comprehensive understanding of these categories and their radiologic manifestations is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of gallbladder pathology. By integrating clinical knowledge with radiologic findings, clinicians and radiologists will be equipped with practical tools to identify and distinguish between different gallstone causing conditions.

### What happens to the lost gallstone during laparoscopic cholecystectomy? [^11669752]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Iatrogenic gallbladder perforation with resultant spillage of bile and gallstones is common during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Although it's assumed to be harmless, several complications may occur as a result of spillage. We present a 57-year-old woman with localized abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, jaundice, and itching because of retained stones in both common bile duct (CBD) and the abdominal cavity, who had undergone laparscopic cholecystectomy three years previously. After reoperation, stones in the CBD were removed after CBD exploration and a T-tube was inserted. A mass (8 x 5 cm) located in the gastrocolic omentum, which was not reported on imaging studies, was found coincidentally and was totally excised. Investigation of the mass resulted in the discovery of eight gallstones located in the abcess-like central cavity, which was surrounded by fibrous tissue. The patient had an uneventful recovery. Despite the unaffected long-term sequelae, any patients with gallbladder perforations and spillage should not be considered for extension of antibiotic prophylaxis to avoid early complications. Whenever gallstones are lost in the abdominal cavity, every effort should be made to find and remove them to prevent late complications.

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^113KDzT8]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Gallbladder inflammation is a common pathology encountered by general surgeons and gastroenterologists; most commonly this occurs secondary to the presence of stones, however many other aetiologies have been described. Cholecystitis in the setting of critical illness in a patient with systemic signs of insufficient end-organ perfusion and no evidence of gallbladder stones is the most consequential and presents unique challenges to clinicians. For these reasons, we believe ischaemic cholecystitis is a more accurate term to describe this pathophysiology, convey clinical severity and adequately distinguish this entity from other forms of non-obstructive cholecystitis. Creating this distinction is an important step towards being able to guide clinical and surgical management. While many of the initial steps in management, including resuscitation and antibiotic treatment, remain the same for all forms of cholecystitis, knowing the underlying aetiology in combination with the patient's clinical status direct the choice of intervention to address the acutely inflamed gallbladder — surgery, percutaneous drainage or endoscopic drainage. We hope that by introducing this new framework of thinking about gallbladder disease in the critically ill, clinicians will be able to recognise predisposing factors, take definitive steps towards diagnosis and ultimately provide the best treatment for this challenging clinical presentation.

### Consensus definition of sludge and microlithiasis as a possible cause of pancreatitis [^1178CcaZ]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, we conducted a systematic literature review followed by two rounds of an international expert survey and a live consensus meeting to arrive at a consensus definition for biliary sludge and biliary microlithiasis. The obtained definitions will permit to conduct prospective trials to determine the possibly different clinical relevance of these two entities as well as define the optimal treatment in order to prevent or treat pancreatitis of biliary origin.

### Long-term outcomes of symptomatic gallbladder sludge [^114hfBgz]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Goals and Background

Long-term outcomes of symptomatic gallbladder (GB) sludge are not fully established. This study aimed to determine whether patients with symptomatic GB sludge could experience subsequent biliary events.

Study

This study investigated consecutive patients who presented with typical biliary pain and underwent abdominal ultrasonography from March 2003 to December 2012. A prospectively maintained database of these patients, excluding those with gallstones, was reviewed retrospectively. We compared the development of biliary events such as acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis between both GB sludge and non-GB sludge cohorts.

Results

In all, 58 and 70 patients were diagnosed with and without GB sludge, respectively. The 5-year cumulative biliary event rate was significantly higher in the GB sludge (33.9% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.021) and the hazard ratio of subsequent biliary events was 2.573 (95% confidence interval, 1.124–5.889; P = 0.025) in patients with GB sludge. The 5-year cumulative rate of each biliary event was higher in the GB sludge cohort (15.6% vs. 5.3% in acute cholecystitis, 15.5% vs. 5.3% in acute cholangitis, 18.4% vs. 11.1% in acute pancreatitis, respectively), although it was not statistically significant. Among the GB sludge cohort, subsequent biliary events were less frequent in patients who underwent cholecystectomy compared with those who did not (2/16, 12.5% vs. 17/42, 40.4%; P = 0.067).

Conclusions

GB sludge accompanying typical biliary pain can cause subsequent biliary events and cholecystectomy may prevent subsequent biliary events. Therefore, GB sludge would be considered as a culprit of biliary events.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^115ArJbZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a lack of consensus in selecting patients who do or do not benefit from surgery when patients present with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones are present. This review aimed to give an overview of results from recent trials and available literature to improve treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

Methods

First, an overview of different symptom criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is given, based on national and international guidelines. Second, treatment outcomes (absence of biliary colic, pain-free state, biliary and surgical complications) are summarized, with data from three clinical trials. Finally, personal advice for treatment decisions in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis is provided, based on recent trials, the available literature, and expert opinion.

Results

This review describes different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis, provides an overview of outcomes after cholecystectomy, and advises on treatment decisions in patients with abdominal pain and gallbladder stones. After cholecystectomy, biliary colic is resolved in 95 per cent of patients. However, non-specific abdominal pain persists in 40 per cent. Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia significantly increase the risk of persistent pain. Age, previous abdominal surgery, baseline pain score on a visual analogue scale, pain characteristics, nausea, and heartburn are part of the SUCCESS criteria, and are associated with clinically relevant pain reduction after gallbladder removal.

Conclusion

The surgical community can now give more personalized advice on surgery to improve care for patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis.

### The significance of cystic duct stones encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^113DsdAL]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic duct stones (CDS) are occasionally encountered during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). They may be noticed during the dissection of the cystic pedicle or seen to extrude from the cystic duct (CD) when it is divided or opened to perform the intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC). The procedures for dealing with CDS range from the simple removal of stones that fall out when the duct is opened to incising the duct over an impacted stone to facilitate its removal or converting to open surgery due to a large stone in a CD adherent to the bile duct (e.g. Mirizzi syndrome). Therefore, we set out to establish criteria that might be predictive of CDS, to examine the technical problems caused by them, to look for the most effective ways of avoiding adverse consequences, especially the risk of missing bile duct stones.

Methods

We performed a review and analysis of a database that included preoperative, operative, and postoperative data for all patients treated at our hospital who were found to have CDS.

Results

In a series of 520 LC performed over a period of 5 years, 64 cases of CDS were documented (12.3%). The preoperative risk factors in 45 of these cases (70.3%) were recent sever acute pain with or without liver function test (LFT) derangement (34.3%), jaundice (14%), pancreatitis (14%), and previous acute cholecystitis (7.8%). At operation, a single stone was found in the CD in 64% of the cases; multiple stones were found in 36%. Dissection of the pedicle was difficult in 21 cases and had to be carried out fundus-first in four cases. The CD was reported to be wide in 18 cases; five of them eventually needed to be closed with endoloops. Operative difficulty was reported in three of 19 cases where there were no preoperative risk factors. Simple removal of the stones was possible in most cases. CDS needed be crushed, the CD incised, or the procedure converted to open in only five cases (7.8%). IOC was attempted in all cases; it was normal in 39 (61%) and failed in two cases (3%). Eighteen patients (28%) were found to have bile duct stones; another five (7.8%) had CBD dilation or debris indicating possible recent passage of stones. Fourteen transcystic and nine direct bile duct explorations were performed.

Conclusion

Some CDS may slip from the gallbladder into the CD or the CBD during dissection. Careful retraction and manipulation should therefore be done to minimize this risk. Most CDS are easy to deal with, but some of them can result in increased operative difficulty. If IOC is not carried out on a routine basis, it becomes mandatory if CDS are encountered because 35% of them may be associated with bile duct stones.

Additional drainage from the gallbladder and peritoneal cavity. Drainage tubes were percutaneously inserted into the gallbladder and the peritoneal cavity.

First, we exchanged the nasobiliary catheter for a 7F straight-type plastic stent through the fistula between the duodenal bulb and the gallbladder (Fig. 5). We placed a guidewire into the abdominal cavity through the fistula toward the migrated stent, and proceeded with alligator forceps to bite the guidewire. Finally, the migrated stent was grasped and pulled out through the fistula (Fig. 6). The fistula was not clipped because of its small size. The guidewire could prevent organ injury caused by the alligator forceps. No adverse events occurred, and the percutaneous drainage tubes were removed 1 week after the procedure.

Figure 6
Removal of a migrated double-pigtail stent from the peritoneal cavity by grasping it and pulling it out through the fistula.

Cases in which a migrated plastic stent can be removed from the peritoneal cavity have never been reported, although a migrated metal stent has been endoscopically removed from the peritoneal cavity. In this case, we chose a relatively short stent because the distance between the gallbladder and duodenum is short. However, a longer stent might be better for preventing release-related migration. Moreover, a pull-back stent may be useful for retrying the deployment if the length of the stent is inappropriate or stent advancement is impossible across the fistula. Endoscopic removal using alligator forceps, as reported here, shows promise for stents that migrate into the abdominal cavity.

### Postnatal outcome after ultrasound findings of an abnormal fetal gallbladder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116xX5Gs]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe postnatal outcome following the prenatal diagnosis of an abnormal fetal gallbladder.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of studies from January 1980 to January 2023 that described FGB abnormalities, which included agenesis or non-visualisation, abnormal content presence of sludge, abnormal shape or size and abnormal position, and postnatal outcome to determine the association with pathology.

Results

In 51 studies, 842 fetuses had abnormal FGB. Non-visualisation of the FGB was the most common diagnosis (521 fetuses, mean gestational age 21.6 weeks, range 14–29). The FGB was subsequently visualised prenatally in 128 out of 521 cases (24.6%; 95% CI, 20.9%-28.3%). Of the 393 cases with persistent FGB non-visualisation (75.4%; 95% CI, 71.7–79.1), 48 cases (12.2%; 95% CI, 9.0–15.5) underwent termination of pregnancy (TOP) with FGB agenesis confirmed in 16 out of 26 fetuses that had a postmortem examination (61.5%; 95% CI, 42.8–80.2). After excluding cases with missing outcomes (n = 121), postnatal ultrasound was performed in 82.4% of cases with persistent non-visualised FGB (224/272; 95% CI, 77.8%-86.9%). The gallbladder was not visualised in 63.4% (142/224; 95% CI, 57.1–69.7), confirming GB agenesis. This was an isolated finding in 41.1% of cases (92/224; 95% CI, 34.6–47.5). Of 272 known outcomes, biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, and structural or chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed in 8.5% (n = 23), 12.5% (n = 34), 18.0% (n = 49) and 6.3% (n = 17) cases, respectively. The sensitivity (true positive rate) of ultrasound for GB agenesis in fetuses with persistently non-visualised FGB was 58.1% (158/272; 95% CI, 52.2%-64.0%). Fetal gallbladder stones/sludge were described in 100 fetuses mainly in the third trimester of pregnancy (mean gestational age 33.8 weeks). Resolution of postnatally followed up cases occurred in around one-third of the cases (37.3%) within 1 month after birth. There was a low reported association with severe conditions (2%).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that when the fetal gallbladder was absent in mid-trimester, it was visualised in subsequent fetal ultrasound examinations in around 25% of cases. If persistently absent on prenatal ultrasound, the confirmed rate of GB agenesis was around 50%, with the neonates having biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, or structural abnormalities. Because of the association with severe conditions, if persistent FGB agenesis is suspected, prenatal diagnosis should be offered. FGB abnormalities such as stones/sludge tended to resolve by 1 year of age with around half of all cases resolving by 1 month postnatal.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^111oCz4A]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3

MRI is another very effective tool for diagnosing gallstones and associated pathological processes. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is typically performed using heavily T2-weighted sequences, supplemented by fat-saturated T1- and T2-weighted MRI, and with steady-state gradient-echo acquisitions. Heavily T2-weighted image sequences are particularly helpful in delineating ductal anatomy. Gallstones typically appear as low signal or signal void on T2-weighted imaging surrounded by T2 hyperintense bile (Fig. 5). MRCP has largely replaced endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as the gold standard for diagnosing choledocholithiasis due to its high sensitivity of 90–94% and specificity of 95–99% without the use of ionising radiation or ERCP-related complications such as pancreatitis which can result in significant morbidity and even mortality.

Fig. 5
Axial T2-weighted MRI of the abdomen. There is a large gallstone within the gallbladder which is markedly hypointense relative to the surrounding hyperintense bile. The gallbladder wall is thickened with surrounding pericholecystic fluid consistent with acute cholecystitis

Nuclear medicine imaging with scintigraphy and with SPECT/CT can be used to dynamically assess the gallbladder. Technicium-99 labeled mebrofenin is administered and taken up by bile producing cells and subsequently excreted into the biliary system. The patient is typically imaged at 1 h and at 4 h post-administration of radioisotope. A normal gallbladder will be well delineated as it fills with radioactive bile. In cases of cholecystitis or gallbladder obstruction due to an impacted stone in the cystic duct, the gallbladder will not be visualised as the radioactive will not accumulate within the gallbladder. If the gallbladder is not visualised, morphine analogues can be given to induce sphincter of Oddi contraction and aid gallbladder filling. Cholescintigraphy for acute cholecystitis has a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 94%. This is actually superior to ultrasound; however, this technique is more expensive and time consuming and also confers a radiation dose to the patient and staff and thus is generally not a first-line investigation (Fig. 6).

### Gallbladder function predicts subsequent biliary complications in patients with common bile duct stones after endoscopic treatment? [^113kPmz3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Gallbladder ejection fraction was poorer in patients with gallbladder stones, but it could not predict further recurrent biliary complications. Alcohol restriction would probably help to reduce recurrent biliary symptoms. Since spontaneous clearance of gallbladder stone may occur, wait and see policy of gallbladder management after endoscopic treatment of CBDS is appropriate, but regular follow- up in those patients with risk factors for recurrence is necessary. Cholecystectomy is warranted only in patients with recurrent gallbladder-related symptoms.

### An update on the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease [^115EhAj6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gallstone disease is a major epidemiologic and economic burden worldwide, and the most frequent form is cholesterol gallstone disease.

Recent Findings

Major pathogenetic factors for cholesterol gallstones include a genetic background, hepatic hypersecretion of cholesterol, and supersaturated bile which give life to precipitating cholesterol crystals that accumulate and grow in a sluggish gallbladder. Additional factors include mucin and inflammatory changes in the gallbladder, slow intestinal motility, increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol, and altered gut microbiota. Mechanisms of disease are linked with insulin resistance, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The role of nuclear receptors, signaling pathways, gut microbiota, and epigenome are being actively investigated.

Summary

Ongoing research on cholesterol gallstone disease is intensively investigating several pathogenic mechanisms, associated metabolic disorders, new therapeutic approaches, and novel strategies for primary prevention, including lifestyles.

### Association between C-reactive protein to lymphocyte ratio and gallstones: a cross-sectional study [^114edjDa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

A growing body of research has established a significant association between gallstone formation and both local and systemic inflammatory responses. Inflammation of the gallbladder wall has been identified as an early event in gallstone formation. Studies in animal models have shown that inflammatory markers, such as myeloperoxidase and interleukins, are markedly elevated in the gallbladder wall. This inflammatory response alters the absorptive and secretory functions of the gallbladder epithelium, ultimately influencing stone formation. Impaired absorption by the gallbladder weakens its natural defense mechanisms against gallstones, thereby promoting stone formation. CRP is a key inflammatory biomarker utilized to assess the activity of inflammatory diseases, evaluate treatment efficacy, and predict disease risk. In a prospective cohort study, researchers found a significant association between elevated high-sensitivity CRP levels and the development of gallstone disease. Upon controlling for relevant confounders, individuals with elevated hs-CRP levels exhibited a greater risk of developing gallstones, indicating that CRP may act as an independent risk factor for gallstone disease. Furthermore, immune cell density (mast cells and T cells) in the gallbladder wall is significantly increased in patients with gallstones. Activation of these immune cells may lead to gallbladder dysfunction, exacerbating both inflammation and stone formation. In particular, T cells are thought to play a crucial role in cholesterol stone formation. Given these insights, we analyzed the correlation between CLR and gallstone prevalence using data from the NHANES database, revealing that higher CLR levels were associated with higher gallstone prevalence. These findings support a potential link between inflammation and gallstones, which could inform future prospective studies or risk stratification research.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^113R8ekX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The management of acute calculous cholecystitis still offers room for debate in terms of diagnosis, severity scores, treatment options and timing for surgery.

Material and Methods

A systematic review about the treatment of acute cholecystitis has been completed. The recommendations of recent guidelines have also been examined taking into account the results of the review.

Results

The evidence available in the literature supports the recommendation about laparoscopic cholecystectomy as treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible after the diagnosis because early treatment reduces total hospital stay and does not increase complication or conversion rates. The antibiotics can play different roles and attention should be posed to the risk of emerging resistance. A surgical or percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is advocated by some authors in the advanced forms of inflammation or patients with severe co-morbidities; however, the available evidence does not support it, and further studies are necessary to clarify its role.

### Chenodiol (chenodal) [^111nBQQE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Chenodiol is indicated for patients with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age. The likelihood of successful dissolution is far greater if the stones are floatable or small. For patients with nonfloatable stones, dissolution is less likely and added weight should be given to the risk that more emergent surgery might result form a delay due to unsuccessful treatment. Safety of use beyond 24 months is not established. Chenodiol will not dissolve calcified (radiopaque) or radiolucent bile pigment stones.

### MR imaging of the gallbladder: a pictorial essay [^117H6sy6]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

The gallbladder serves as the repository for bile produced in the liver. However, bile within the gallbladder may become supersaturated with cholesterol, leading to crystal precipitation and subsequent gallstone formation. The most common disorders of the gallbladder are related to gallstones and include symptomatic cholelithiasis, acute and chronic cholecystitis, and carcinoma of the gallbladder. Other conditions that can affect the gallbladder include biliary dyskinesia (functional), adenomyomatosis (hyperplastic), and postoperative changes or complications (iatrogenic). Ultrasonography (US) has been the traditional modality for evaluating gallbladder disease, primarily owing to its high sensitivity and specificity for both stone disease and gallbladder inflammation. US performed before and after ingestion of a fatty meal may also be useful for functional evaluation of the gallbladder. However, US is limited by patient body habitus, with degradation of image quality and anatomic detail in obese individuals. With the advent of faster and more efficient imaging techniques, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has assumed an increasing role as an adjunct modality for gallbladder imaging, primarily in patients who are incompletely assessed with US. MR imaging allows simultaneous anatomic and physiologic assessment of the gallbladder and biliary tract in both initial evaluation of disease and examination of the postoperative patient. This assessment is accomplished chiefly through the use of MR imaging contrast agents excreted preferentially via the biliary system.

### Gallbladder function predicts subsequent biliary complications in patients with common bile duct stones after endoscopic treatment? [^11474xKB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Comparing with gallbladder stone, patients without it had a significantly higher incidence of chronic lung disease, a larger common bile duct diameter, larger stones, a higher incidence of the non-visualization of the gallbladder in ERCP, a larger mean diameter of the dilating balloon used, a higher frequency to use mechanical lithotripsy, and a larger percentage of gallbladder contraction of > 50% at 30 min after a fatty meal (Table 2).

b Only the 113 patients who received EPBD were included

According to the univariate Cox regression analysis, the presence of gallbladder stones, the drinking of alcohol, renal failure, and more than one sessions of initial treatment for bile duct clearance significantly affect recurrent biliary complications (P < 0.05, Table 3). Moreover, the multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only the presence of gallbladder stones, the drinking of alcohol and more than one sessions of initial treatment for bile duct clearance are significantly associated with recurrent biliary complications (P < 0.05, Table 4). No significant differences existed between any of the parameters of gallbladder function by FMS between patients with different stone colors, patients with recurrent biliary complications, and patients who spontaneously passed their gallbladder stones.

### Radiological biliary intervention for stone disease [^116eU55L]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones are crystalized particles composed mainly of cholesterol and sometimes bilirubin, typically developing in the gallbladder. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of those calculi (stones) in the common bile duct (CBD). It is the primary cause of non-malignant bile duct obstruction. The formation of gallstones is influenced by various clinical conditions and factors, including bile composition, gallbladder motility, genetics, obesity, female sex, and age. The most common etiological factor for choledocholithiasis is the migration of gallbladder stones to the CBD and intrahepatic ducts through the cystic duct. This occurs in approximately 3–15% of patients who undergo cholecystectomy. Another common cause of choledocholithiasis is inadequate bile drainage due to obstructions, such as postsurgical bile duct strictures, which can lead to acute cholangitis or other inflammatory conditions. Hepatolithiasis is the formation of stones in the intrahepatic biliary tract. This condition is often recurrent and requires multiple therapeutic interventions. Treatment for choledocholithiasis is necessary for symptomatic patients, and is recommended for asymptomatic patients given the risk of serious complications, such as cholangitis, obstructive jaundice (which can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis), and pancreatitis.

Introduction — epidemiology and pathophysiology of gallstones are summarized, stating that "Bile duct stones (choledocholithiasis) most frequently result from the migration of gallstones from the gallbladder into the biliary tree" and that "Gallstones are the consequence of cholesterol supersaturation in bile, inadequate bile salt levels or function, and diminished contractility of the biliary epithelium because of the multifactorial effects of diet, hormones, and genetic predisposition". The introduction adds that "Prospective population data reveal that 10% of American adults will develop symptomatic gallstones over the course of a decade", and that "Greater than 700,000 will undergo outpatient cholecystectomy".

### Postnatal outcome after ultrasound findings of an abnormal fetal gallbladder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115bL8N9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusions

Non‐visualisation and stones/sludge are the most common FGB abnormalities, with non‐visualisation/GB agenesis being most associated with pathology. Where the fetal gallbladder was absent in mid‐trimester, it was visualised in subsequent fetal ultrasound examinations in around 25% of cases. If persistently absent on prenatal ultrasound, the confirmed rate of GB agenesis was 58%, with the neonates having biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, or structural abnormalities. Because of the association with severe conditions, if persistent FGB agenesis is suspected, prenatal diagnosis should be offered. FGB abnormalities such as stones/sludge tended to resolve by 1 year of age with around half of all cases resolving by 1 month postnatal. Abnormally shaped FGB such as duplication was confirmed after birth, and neonates with a diagnosis of enlarged FGB had a normal GB appearance at postnatal follow up. The optimum time for neonatal follow‐up depends on the type of specific FGB abnormality.

### More than just stones: a pictorial review of common and less common gallbladder pathologies [^1146aEFp]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although stone disease is by far the most commonly encountered pathology of the gallbladder, there are several other important disease processes affecting it. These include adenomyomatosis, cholesterolosis, polyps, porcelain gallbladder, acalculous cholecystitis, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis, gallbladder cancer, and gallbladder hemorrhage. The purpose of this article was to review the different gallbladder pathologies encountered in everyday radiological practice and to describe their features in the standard imaging modalities.

### Acute gallbladder perforation with gallstones spillage in a cirrhotic patient [^114NjgJD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Also the sonographic appearances of gallbladder perforation are diverse and nonspecific. They include wall thickening (> 3 mm), distension (largest diameter > 3.5–4.0 cm), gallstones, coarse intracholecystic echogenic debris and bile duct dilatation. Distention of the gallbladder and edema of its wall may be the earliest detectable signs of imminent perforation. The 'hole sign' (a defect in the gallbladder wall) is the most specific finding. An intrahepatic perforation is suggested by the presence of a liver abscess with direct continuity into the gallbladder or containing echogenic stones in the absence of a pericholecystic abscess. Also the impossibility to visualize the gallbladder in the presence of a liver abscess is highly suggestive of an intrahepatic perforation.

Although ultrasound remains the preferred initial examination for evaluation of suspected gallbladder perforation, unfortunately it often fails to demonstrate the perforation because of increased intestinal gas and pain. In the current case the blood in and around the gallbladder led to a misinterpretation of the sonographic image. In contrast, CT imaging is the most sensitive tool to diagnose gallbladder perforation. CT scan findings can be divided into primary gallbladder changes, pericholecystic changes and findings of extra-gallbladder organs. Primary gallbladder changes include wall thickening, wall enhancement, wall defect, intramural abscess, intramural gas, mural hemorrhage, presence of gallstones, common bile duct stones or cystic duct stones, intraluminal membrane and intraluminal gas. Pericholecystic changes include pericholecystic fat stranding, pericholecystic fluid collection, pericholecystic abscess or biloma formation and presence of extraluminal stones. Findings in organs other than the gallbladder consist of pericholecystic liver enhancement, liver abscess, portal vein thrombosis, reactive mural thickening of adjacent hollow organ (hepatic flexure of colon and duodenum), presence of lymph nodes, intraperitoneal free air, ascites, ileus and Mirizzi syndrome. The gallbladder perforation signs can be divided into direct and indirect signs: the demonstration of either calculi outside the gallbladder or a ruptured segment of the gallbladder wall are direct indicators according to Pedrosa et al. Indirect indicators include the presence of an abscess outside the gallbladder and the presence of gallstones together with thickening of the gallbladder wall. In the current case the best diagnostic clue of the first CT scan was the misinterpreted hyperdense fluid surrounding the gallbladder, the liver and the spleen. Measurement of the attenuation values should have led to the diagnosis of blood in as well as around the gallbladder, supporting the correct diagnosis.

### The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones? [^112mMrCb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy.

Methods

The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 ± 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning.

Results

Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups.

Conclusions

The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage of choledocholithiasis.

### Improving diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with US: new paradigms [^112B6kfD]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is an inflammatory condition of the gallbladder typically incited by mechanical obstruction. Accurate diagnosis of this common clinical condition is challenging due to variable imaging appearances as well as overlapping clinical manifestations with biliary colic, acute hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangiopathies. In acute cholecystitis, increased dilatation and high intraluminal pressures lead to gallbladder inflammation and may progress to gangrenous changes, focal wall necrosis, and subsequent perforation. In acute calculous cholecystitis, gallstones are the cause of obstruction and are often impacted in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, leading to gallbladder inflammation. In acalculous cholecystitis, patients are typically critically ill, often with hypotensive episodes and prolonged gallbladder stasis, which lead to obstruction, gallbladder ischemia, and inflammation. Helpful sonographic findings of acute cholecystitis include a dilated gallbladder; increased intraluminal pressures in the gallbladder, resulting in a bulging fundus (tensile fundus sign); intraluminal sludge in the setting of right upper quadrant pain; wall hyperemia, which may be quantified by elevated cystic artery velocities or hepatic artery velocities; mucosal ischemic changes, characterized by loss of mucosal echogenicity; pericholecystic inflammation, characterized by hyperechoic pericholecystic fat; and mucosal discontinuity. Extruded complex fluid next to a wall defect is definitive for gallbladder wall perforation, and further evaluation with CT or MRI allows evaluation of the full extent of perforation and other potential complications. The sonographic Murphy sign, while helpful if positive, is relatively insensitive for accurate diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Thus, overreliance on the sonographic Murphy sign results in surprisingly low diagnostic accuracy in practice.

### The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections [^114jMms2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2016). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections — adverse events of endoscopic therapy include that serious adverse events may arise after endoscopic drainage of PFCs with listed complications, and less common events such as cardiac air embolism, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and inadvertent gallbladder puncture. In one series of 148 patients undergoing EUS-guided transmural drainage, 8 adverse events (5.4%) occurred, including 2 perforations, 4 infections, 1 bleeding episode, and 1 stent migration, whereas another series reported higher adverse event rates of 18% to 19%. A systematic review of 17 studies (881 patients) found no significant difference in adverse event rates between plastic (16%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14%-39%) and metal (23%, 95% CI, 16%-33%) stents. Adverse events appear to be increased during draining and debriding of necrosis, and it is recommended that endoscopic drainage of PFCs be performed only if surgical and interventional radiology support are available. Infectious adverse events usually occur from inadequate drainage of fluid and/or removal of solid debris; if drainage is performed solely by the transpapillary route, stent exchange, increasing the stent size, or conversion to a transmural approach may resolve the infection.

### Biliary sludge: the sluggish gallbladder [^116AvZ32]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Biliary sludge is a mixture of particulate matter which has precipitated from bile. It generally consists of cholesterol monohydrate crystals, calcium bilirubinate or other calcium salts. In a clinical setting, biliary sludge is almost always an ultrasonographic diagnosis. Although it is less clinically applicable, direct microscopic examination of gallbladder bile is far more sensitive than ultrasonography into sludge detection, and has to be regarded as the diagnostic gold standard. The overall prevalence of sludge in the general population is relatively low. However, several clinical conditions are associated with a particularly high prevalence of biliary sludge, including pregnancy, rapid weight loss, total parenteral nutrition, octreotide therapy, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. The clinical course of biliary sludge varies, and complete resolution, a waxing and waning course, and progression to gallstones are all possible outcomes. It may cause complications usually associated with gallstones, such as biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, and acute pancreatitis. The main pathogenic mechanism involved in sludge formation is probably gallbladder dismotility, and in selected patients measures aimed to maintain adequate gallbladder contractions has been shown to effectively prevent sludge development.

### Pathways of cholesterol crystallization in model bile and native bile [^111z9n1W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Hypersecretion of hepatic cholesterol, chronic supersaturation of bile with cholesterol and rapid precipitation of cholesterol crystals in the gallbladder from cholesterol-enriched vesicles represent the primum movens in cholesterol gallstone formation. Physical-chemical factors and pathways leading to cholesterol crystallization can be investigated in artificial model biles and ex vivo in fresh human bile. Depending on modulatory factors (i.e., lipid concentration, bile salt or phospholipid species, humidity, mucins, etc.), cholesterol can precipitate in several forms (i.e., monohydrate, anhydrous) and habits (i.e., plate-like, needle-like, intermediate arcs, filaments, tubules, spirals). Careful analysis of biliary cholesterol crystals includes biochemical analysis of precipitated crystals, polarizing quantitative light microscopy, and turbidimetric methods. In this paper, recent concepts on cholesterol crystallization in artificial model biles as well as in human bile will be reviewed.

### Consensus definition of sludge and microlithiasis as a possible cause of pancreatitis [^112MQzXw]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for biliary microlithiasis

In the experts' survey, 93% of respondents selected EUS as the diagnostic tool of choice for diagnosing biliary microlithiasis as well as biliary sludge. Moreover, 76% of the experts voted against the obligatory use of phase-contrast and polarising light microscopy for making the diagnosis of microlithiasis. An explicit voting was recorded regarding the sonographic features of biliary microlithiasis. Regarding concrements' size, 92% of the experts voted in favour of defining biliary microlithiasis as for cases in which examination of the biliary tree or gallbladder reveals the presence of stones ≤ 5 mm. Moreover, 76% voted for a size definition of size of less than 3 mm, 16% of the experts voted for a cut-off size of 5 mm. As most consistent definition derived from the survey a size definition of microlithiasis with stones ≥ 3 mm and ≤ 5 mm received 65.3% agreement (abstention: 13%, rejection: 21.7%) in the online voting process. In the expert survey round 2 with corresponding prior presentation of the systematic literature review and the audience online voting results, there was no majority for the microlithiasis size range ≥ 3 mm ≤ 5 mm (46.2% agreement). On the other hand, there was a majority for an upper microlithiasis limit of ≤ 5 mm with 57.7% agreement. As such the definition of microlithiasis which aimed highest consensus is as follows: The term 'biliary microlithiasis' should be used exclusively for calculi in the biliary tract and gallbladder of ≤ 5 mm in diameter with acoustic shadowing (see table 2, online supplemental table S3). Accordingly, biliary stones would be defined as calculi in the biliary tract and gallbladder of > 5 mm in diameter with acoustic shadowing.

### T-cell function is critical for murine cholesterol gallstone formation [^1169fHH8]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The formation of cholesterol gallstones is a complex process involving contributions from genes and environmental factors. Although gallbladder inflammation is believed to be common during cholelithogenesis, the role of immunologic factors is unknown.

Methods

The role of adaptive immunity in cholesterol cholelithogenesis was analyzed utilizing immunocompetent Helicobacter spp.-infected and -uninfected BALB/c and congenic immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) (Rag) mice. Lymphocyte transfer studies were performed to determine which cellular subset was responsible for cholesterol gallstone formation. Also, gallbladder inflammation was quantified to determine the nature of the inflammatory response associated with cholelilithogenesis.

Results

When fed a lithogenic diet for 8 weeks, wild-type mice developed significantly more cholesterol gallstones (27%-80% prevalence) than Rag mice (approximately 5%, P < .05). Helicobacter spp.-infected BALB/cJ mice displayed statistically significant increases in cholesterol gallstone prevalence compared with uninfected mice (81% vs. 39%; P < .05). Transfer of splenocytes or T lymphocytes to Rag2(-/-) mice increased stone prevalence markedly (26% and 40% respectively; P < .05), whereas transfer of B cells was not appreciably cholelithogenic (13%). The adaptive immune response increased the expression of gallbladder Muc genes and accumulation of mucin gel. In addition, T cells and cholesterol monohydrate crystals induced proinflammatory gene expression in the gallbladder, which likely contributes to gallbladder dysfunction.

Conclusions

These studies indicate that T cells are critical in murine cholesterol cholelithogenesis. Furthermore, cholesterol monohydrate crystals induce expression of proinflammatory cytokines in a T-cell-dependent fashion. Acquired immunity and inflammation are likely to be crucial factors in cholesterol gallstone pathogenesis, rather then merely the result of cholelithogenesis.

Gallbladder cancer risk factors and prophylaxis: Cholelithiasis with chronic inflammation is the most prevalent risk factor and risk increases with stone size. Calcified gallbladder wall (porcelain gallbladder) has historical cancer estimates in up to 22% with calcification, though later reports show gallbladder cancer present in 7% to 15%. Additional risk factors include anomalous pancreaticobiliary duct junction, gallbladder polyps (> 1 cm), chronic typhoid infection, primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and possibly adenomyomatosis. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is probably beneficial for high-risk patients (eg, porcelain gallbladder, polyps > 1 cm). The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound proposed 3 risk categories for gallbladder polyps and recommend a surgical consult for extremely low risk and low risk polyps ≥ 1.5 cm and for indeterminate risk polyps ≥ 0.7 cm. Patients with chronic cholecystitis or pancreatiobiliary malfunction have a greater prevalence of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gallbladder cancers.

### Targets for current pharmacologic therapy in cholesterol gallstone disease [^114buDBz]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Gallstone disease is a frequent condition throughout the world and, cholesterol stones are the most frequent form in Western countries. The standard treatment of symptomatic gallstone subjects is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The selection of patients amenable for nonsurgical, medical therapy is of key importance; a careful analysis should consider the natural history of the disease and the overall costs of therapy. Only patients with mild symptoms and small, uncalcified cholesterol gallstones in a functioning gallbladder with a patent cystic duct are considered for oral litholysis by hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic acid, in the hope of achieving cholesterol desaturation of bile and progressive stone dissolution. Recent studies have raised the possibility that cholesterol-lowering agents that inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis (statins) or intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe), or drugs acting on specific nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, may offer, alone or in combination, additional medical therapeutic tools for treating cholesterol gallstones. Recent perspectives on medical treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease are discussed in this article.

### Pathogenesis of gallstones [^116NonAt]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cholesterol gallstone formation is a complex process and involves phase separation of cholesterol crystals from supersaturated bile. In most cases, cholesterol hypersecretion is considered the primary event in gallstone formation. The sterol is transported through the hepatocytic canalicular membrane by ABCG5-G8. Expression of this transport protein is regulated by transcription factor Liver X Receptor-alpha, which may be responsible for biliary hypersecretion. Hydrophobic bile salt pool, bile concentration, excess pronucleating mucin, and impaired gallbladder and intestinal motility are secondary phenomena in most cases but nevertheless may contribute to gallstone formation.

Introduction

Gallstones are solid rounded particles composed of a combination of cholesterol and bilirubin that form within the gallbladder and within the biliary system. The size and number of gallstones is variable with some patients forming multiple small gallstones and others forming single or few large stones.

The incidence of gallstones is increasing in Western populations as obesity levels rise. In the USA, 8.6% of Caucasian men and 16.6% of women have gallstones. The vast majority of gallstones are asymptomatic and require no follow-up; however, approximately 10–15% of gallstones will become symptomatic over a period of 10–15 years of follow-up. The symptomatic manifestations of gallstones are variable and range from mild symptoms such as biliary colic to severe acute presentations such as pancreatitis, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a patient that has suffered a symptomatic manifestation of gallstones, the incidence of a further manifestation over their lifetime is approximately 3% per year. The risk for gallstone-related pathology is also related to the number and size of stones with numerous larger stones more likely to cause symptoms. For this reason, it is suggested that once symptoms present, the patient should be offered a cholecystectomy.

The main risk factors for gallstone formation are outlined in Table 1, and the factors protective against gallstones are outlined in Table 2.

Table 1
Main risk factors for gallstone formation

Table 2
Factors protective against gallstones

There are three main types of gallstones: cholesterol, mixed and pigmented. Cholesterol gallstones account for 10% of gallstones and are composed of at least 50% cholesterol and form with supersaturation of bile. Patients with high-fat diets and high serum lipids are more likely to have a higher cholesterol composition. Pigmented gallstones, which are darker in colour and are composed mainly of bilirubin with < 20% cholesterol, form with supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. There are two subtypes of pigmented gallstones: black pigmented gallstones which are formed due to chronic haemolysis, cirrhosis or intestinal malabsorption, and brown pigmented gallstones which are formed secondary to bacterial and parasitic infections such as Clonorchis sinensis or due to stasis of bile. Finally, mixed gallstones account for 80% of gallstones and have a cholesterol content of 20–50%.

### Choledocholithiasis… [^115Dg4WG]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Baiu I, Hawn MT. Choledocholithiasis. JAMA. 2018; 320:

1506. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2018. 11812 Choledocholithiasis occurs when a gallstone blocks the common bile duct and bile cannot flow past it, instead backing up into the liver. The gallbladder is a pouch the size of a lime that sits under the liver and stores bile. Bile is produced by the liver and helps with digestion of fat. Sometimes the cholesterol in bile can deposit and form thick crystals or stones. These stones can get stuck in the gallbladder, in the duct that goes from the gallbladder to the large bile duct, or in the large duct that goes from the liver and gallbladder to the bowel. Patients often have right-sided abdominal pain and may have yellowing of the skin or eyes. Patients may also experience clay-colored stools and dark urine.

If the stone is stuck in the common bile duct in such a way that the enzymes from the pancreas also cannot flow to the small intestine, it can lead to gallstone pancreatitis, which can cause right, middle, and left upper abdominal pain; nausea; and vomiting. Treatment depends on the location of the blockage and what problems develop because of it. Choledocholithiasis requires a gastroenterologist to extract the stone. This is usually done with heavy sedation, not general anesthesia. A long tube with a camera is introduced through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and into the small bowel. The point where the bile duct opens into the small bowel is then identified and the stone is pulled out. This procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Gallstone pancreatitis is usually treated with hydration through intravenous fluids and pain medication. Acute cholecystitis is treated with antibiotics and surgery.

Cholangitis is treated with antibiotics and removal of the stone caught in the duct. All of these conditions require surgical removal of the gallbladder to prevent future attacks. A blocked stone usually causes pain, nausea, and vomiting. Lack of pain in the presence of jaundice and abnormal liver tests should raise concern for other disease processes such as hepatitis or, less frequently, bile duct or pancreatic cancer.

### Mechanisms of disease: the genetic epidemiology of gallbladder stones [^116MXV33]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Cholelithiasis is one of the most prevalent and most expensive gastroenterologic diseases. It belongs to the group of complex metabolic disorders that affect humans, and its critical pathogenic mechanisms are not well defined. As a result, primary or secondary prevention strategies are sparse, and the only effective treatment is cholecystectomy. Here we provide an update on the molecular pathogenesis of gallbladder stones, evidence supporting the hypothesis that genetic factors are key elements predisposing to gallstones, and progress in human genetic studies of cholesterol stones. Data from recent identical twin, family and linkage studies provide conclusive evidence for a strong genetic component to gallstone disease. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies in at-risk populations indicate that gallstone formation is caused by multiple environmental influences and common genetic factors and their interactions. By contrast, monogenic subtypes of cholelithiasis, such as ATP-binding-cassette transporter deficiencies, appear to be rare. The summary of human association studies illustrates that distinct common gene variants might contribute to gallstone formation in different ethnic groups. The characterization of lithogenic genes in knockout and transgenic mice and the identification of many gallstone-susceptibility loci in inbred mice provide the basis for studies of the corresponding genes in patients with gallstones. The transfer of findings from mouse genetics to the bedside might lead to new strategies for individual risk assessment and reveal novel molecular targets for prevention and medical therapies.

### Coordinate regulation of gallbladder motor function in the gut-liver axis [^116JJVS6]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Gallstones are one of the most common digestive diseases with an estimated prevalence of 10%-15% in adults living in the western world, where cholesterol-enriched gallstones represent 75%-80% of all gallstones. In cholesterol gallstone disease, the gallbladder becomes the target organ of a complex metabolic disease. Indeed, a fine coordinated hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal function, including gallbladder motility in the fasting and postprandial state, is of crucial importance to prevent crystallization and precipitation of excess cholesterol in gallbladder bile. Also, gallbladder itself plays a physiopathological role in biliary lipid absorption. Here, we present a comprehensive view on the regulation of gallbladder motor function by focusing on recent discoveries in animal and human studies, and we discuss the role of the gallbladder in the pathogenesis of gallstone formation.

Introduction

Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly lethal disease, predominantly identified at an advanced stage owing to its atypical symptoms. Early-stage GBC is often diagnosed incidentally after cholecystectomy for a presumed benign disease by pathologists. Surgical resection is currently a recognised treatment for GBC, yet a limited number of cases qualify for such resection and most adjuvant therapy has shown an undesirable response rate. Therefore, to improve GBC management, several critical challenges have to be addressed including the identification of reliable biomarkers for screening, clinical management and prognosis prediction.

Covering a spectrum from benign to malignant conditions, gallbladder diseases pose a significant medical challenge. Approximately 95% of GBCs originate from epithelial cells and adenocarcinoma (AC) is the predominant histological type, accounting for over 90% of cases. The pathogenesis of GBC often follows metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma or adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Persistent inflammation exists in both pathogenic ways and plays a pivotal role in driving the tumourigenesis of GBC, regardless of its lithogenicor non-lithogenic origin. Although 90% of patients with GBC exhibit gallstones, only 1% of gallstone patients progress to GBC. Chronic inflammationalso intertwines with risk factors such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi infection, pancreaticobiliary duct anomalies, metabolic syndromeand gallbladder polypoid lesions to complicate the process. Thus, the transition of GBCs from precancerous lesions could be intervened with a better understanding of inflammation-driven tumour initiation and progression.

### Postnatal outcome after ultrasound findings of an abnormal fetal gallbladder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143LrnT]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Objective

To describe postnatal outcome following the prenatal diagnosis of an abnormal fetal gallbladder.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of studies from January 1980 to January 2023 that described FGB abnormalities, which included agenesis or non‐visualisation, abnormal content presence of sludge, abnormal shape or size and abnormal position, and postnatal outcome to determine the association with pathology.

Results

In 51 studies, 842 fetuses had abnormal FGB. Non‐visualisation of the FGB was the most common diagnosis (521 fetuses, mean gestational age 21.6 weeks, range 14–29). The FGB was subsequently visualised prenatally in 128 out of 521 cases (24.6%; 95% CI, 20.9%–28.3%). Of the 393 cases with persistent FGB non‐visualisation (75.4%; 95% CI, 71.7–79.1), 48 cases (12.2%; 95% CI, 9.0–15.5) underwent termination of pregnancy (TOP) with FGB agenesis confirmed in 16 out of 26 fetuses that had a postmortem examination (61.5%; 95% CI, 42.8–80.2). After excluding cases with missing outcomes (n = 121), postnatal ultrasound was performed in 82.4% of cases with persistent non‐visualised FGB (224/272; 95% CI, 77.8%–86.9%). The gallbladder was not visualised in 63.4% (142/224; 95% CI, 57.1–69.7), confirming GB agenesis. This was an isolated finding in 41.1% of cases (92/224; 95% CI, 34.6–47.5). Of 272 known outcomes, biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, and structural or chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed in 8.5% (n = 23), 12.5% (n = 34), 18.0% (n = 49) and 6.3% (n = 17) cases, respectively. The sensitivity (true positive rate) of ultrasound for GB agenesis in fetuses with persistently non‐visualised FGB was 58.1% (158/272; 95% CI, 52.2%–64.0%). Fetal gallbladder stones/sludge were described in 100 fetuses mainly in the third trimester of pregnancy (mean gestational age 33.8 weeks). Resolution of postnatally followed up cases occurred in around one‐third of the cases (37.3%) within 1 month after birth. There was a low reported association with severe conditions (2%).

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta‐analysis found that when the fetal gallbladder was absent in mid‐trimester, it was visualised in subsequent fetal ultrasound examinations in around 25% of cases. If persistently absent on prenatal ultrasound, the confirmed rate of GB agenesis was around 50%, with the neonates having biliary atresia, cystic fibrosis, or structural abnormalities. Because of the association with severe conditions, if persistent FGB agenesis is suspected, prenatal diagnosis should be offered. FGB abnormalities such as stones/sludge tended to resolve by 1 year of age with around half of all cases resolving by 1 month postnatal.

### Sex and ethnic / racial-specific risk factors for gallbladder disease [^114uXeVS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Sex disparities in the incidence of several diseases have been reported. For GBD, the rates reported are 1.5–3-times higher in women compared to men. Possible explanations for these discrepancies may be due to sex hormones and potentially other differences in dietary patterns and tobacco and alcohol exposures or other lifestyle-related behaviors. Overall, in agreement with our study, pregnancy has been found to be the most consistent risk factor for GBD in previous studies, in particular among overweight or obese women. Pregnancy is a critical time period of increased risk of insulin resistance (gestational diabetes) as well as biliary sludge, a suspected to be a potential precursor to gallstones. Biliary sludge, a mixture of cholesterol and calcium bilirubinate crystals in bile, develops in up to 30% of women and likely represents a precursor of gallstones. We observed the highest risk of GBD among women who reported having a child before age 20. No other reproductive variables were significant in our study, except for post-menopausal use among White women only. A previous meta-analysis found highly inconsistent results across studies for oral contraceptives; the summary estimate was RR = 1.36 (95% CI = 1.15–1.62). Secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials of post-menopausal hormones among largely non-Hispanic Whites have observed significantly elevated risk of GBD among women randomized to the treatment arm compared to placebo; in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study, RR (estrogen + progestin) = 1.38 (95% CI, 1.00–1.92) and the Women's Health Initiative, RR (estrogen-only) = 1.67 (95% CI = 1.35–2.06) and RR (estrogen + progestin) = 1.59 (95% CI = 1.28–1.97).

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines.

We describe a debris-filled biliary system as a difficult diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). A male patient aged 60 years showed a nonvisualized biliary system due to complete filling with debris. The following imaging features were observed: mild heterogeneity of intermediate signal on T2-weighted, MRCP and T1-weighted images and mild heterogeneous enhancement of periportal tissue on early and late postcontrast images. The absence of simple-appearing bile on T2 or MRCP images made the diagnosis of dilated, debris-filled biliary system challenging.

Among decompensated cirrhotic patients with suspected acute cholecystitis deemed not fit for surgery, endoscopic gallbladder drainage is an alternative to percutaneous drainage that requires a multidisciplinary approach. EUS-guided gallbladder drainage with placement of a LAMS is safe and effective. However, issues of bleeding, stent migration, infection, and the potential adverse event of future liver transplantation should be considered. It has been described that cholecystoduodenostomy/gastrostomy repair during the time of transplantation can be challenging and potentially lead to adverse events and morbidity. Therefore, if it is technically feasible, transpapillary drainage should be considered first. This avoids potential technical surgical challenges, and stents may be left in place for up 2 years while the patient awaits transplantation. In the selection of a transgastric or transduodenal location for LAMS placement, some reports have suggested that transgastric placement may be associated with LAMS migration resulting from increased wall tension between the stomach and the decompressed gallbladder and may require a longer length stent to be placed.

### Consensus definition of sludge and microlithiasis as a possible cause of pancreatitis [^111gRh1C]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Acute pancreatitis accounts for the most prevalent benign GI-disease leading to hospital admission. Up to 50% of cases are of biliary origin according to a combination of transabdomial ultrasound, clinical chemistry and EUS. At least up to 20% of the remaining idiopathic cases are caused by microlithiasis or biliary sludge often only diagnosed after recurrency.

It is, therefore, surprising that no uniform definition to accurately describe this frequent finding presently exists. Questions of clinical relevance regarding the terms biliary sludge and microlithiasis remain unsolved and have not been investigated in prospective studies for the lack of a universally valid definition of biliary sludge and microlithiasis. A recent study from the Netherlands with 41 participating experienced endosonographers showed that even in this preselected group of endoscopy experts, no diagnostic consensus could be reached regarding the findings of biliary sludge and microlithiasis (biliary sludge with slight agreement and microlithiasis with moderate agreement, measured according to Fleiss' kappa). Regarding the therapeutic recommendations (based on video fragments), 51% of the experts voted in favour of ERCP and 49% of the experts voted against ERCP in patients with biliary sludge.

In our retrospective evaluation stratified using the new consensus definition, no difference in pancreatitis severity was found between the initiating biliary entities gallstone versus microlithiasis versus sludge-induced pancreatitis. This indicates that the pathophysiological risk of sludge and microlithiasis in the pancreatitis context may be no less significant than that of gallstones and that a prospective evaluation for a more precise risk assessment is urgently needed to provide data for appropriate initial treatment as well as prevention of recurrence.

In this paper, we propose for the first time a unified and consented definition of biliary sludge and the size and echogenicity of biliary microlithiasis. The term biliary sludge should be reserved for sonomorphologically discrete, hyperechoic material, without acoustic shadowing and sedimenting in the most dependent part of the gallbladder and in the CBD. For biliary microlithiasis, a majority vote for a threshold ≤ 5 mm with acoustic shadowing in the EUS expert panel and the congress online vote was obtained. The cut-off of 5 mm is a reasonable threshold as lithiasis of this diameter, and lower will not provoke dilatation of the biliary tree as an immediate sign of CBD stones. Indeed, widely accepted guidelines emphasise the role of biliary duct dilatation as a key symptom in therapeutic decision-making, with a diameter ≤ 5 mm being accepted as a referenced cut-off for a regular diameter of the CBD on ultrasound imaging.

Introduction

Gallstones small enough to migrate from the gallbladder into the duodenum can trigger pancreatitis. Pancreatic outflow obstruction as proposed by Opie is the critical event for the disease onset. Already the presence of gallbladder stones on imaging (most frequently on ultrasound) in the presence of pancreatitis suggests the diagnosis of biliary pancreatitis according to international guidelines. Visualisation of the common bile duct (CBD) by transabdominal ultrasound to diagnose sludge or microlithiasis is highly insensitive (roughly 55%) and unspecific. It is thus unsurprising that only in the last decade of the 20th century with the introduction of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to investigate the CBD reports by Ros et al and Lee et al made biliary microlithiasis and biliary sludge widely recognised as causes of acute pancreatitis. The remarkable progress in imaging techniques, especially the development of EUS allowed changing the diagnosis of previously presumed 'idiopathic' pancreatitis towards a biliary aetiology caused by microliths or biliary sludge.EUS, being even more sensitive than microscopic examination of duodenal bile let alone MRCP to diagnose bile duct stones not detected by transabdominal ultrasonography, is widely recognised as a reference diagnostic technique for biliary microlithiasis. On the other hand, reports on the incidence of microlithiasis or biliary sludge in acute pancreatitis vary substantially. A recent meta-analysis has shown that biliary aetiology is the the most common cause of 'idiopathic' pancreatitis, with a prevalence of 30%. However, the authors did not discriminate between biliary sludge or microlithiasis in this analysis.

Interestingly, despite a high number of reports, no meta-analysis directly relates to or distinguishes between biliary sludge and microlithiasis in pancreatitis. This situation is probably due to a need for an agreement on the basic definitions regarding (endo)sonographic features, size of microliths and location of the described material in the biliary system, precluding a methodologically sound meta-analysis. The diversity of definitions poses a risk of misunderstanding between clinicians and results in a lack of high-quality clinical trials. This translates directly to the decision-making of gastroenterologists and surgeons regarding therapeutic strategies, which are nowadays based only on a single, rather controversial prospective observation. Furthermore, the pathophysiological relevance of biliary sludge and or microlithiasis causing pancreatitis has not been determined for lack of definition and disease models. As many definitions of biliary sludge and microlithiasis are applied, our goal was to establish universally acceptable definitions for these frequent findings by conducting an international expert survey with subsequent participant voting during a consensus conference.

### Non-neoplastic hepatopancreatobiliary lesions simulating malignancy: can we differentiate? [^111rpsfP]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Gallbladder-associated pseudomasses

Adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder is one of the deadliest hepatobiliary cancers. Some small cancers are incidental discoveries at cholecystectomy. When diagnosed with GB cancer by imaging, most patients are at an advanced stage with local lymph node metastases and parenchymal liver invasion. For these reasons, correct diagnosis is of critical importance and potential mimics should be considered.

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare variant of chronic cholecystitis. Despite the fact that it is a benign disease, the inflammatory process may be infiltrative and locally destructive. There is asymmetrical thickening of the gallbladder wall, with the inflammatory process extending into liver parenchyma, omentum, and duodenum (Fig. 24). Because of close resemblance of the imaging findings, patients with XGC might undergo radical surgical procedures with a misdiagnosis of primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma. The adjacent liver parenchyma may also show abnormal enhancement which may falsely suggest parenchymal invasion. Enlarged lymph nodes may be seen in both gallbladder cancer and XGC, and cholelithiasis is common in both. Intramural hypoattenuating nodules on CT in the thickened gallbladder wall may serve as a helpful finding for diagnosing XGC over gallbladder adenocarcinoma. On MRI, the detection of the fatty content in these nodules could be detected by chemical-shift MR imaging. Cholecystectomy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis in certain patients.

### Safe, selective histopathological examination of gallbladder specimens: a systematic review [^1119JGWn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease is among the most frequently performed surgical procedures worldwide. For decades, it has been standard practice to send all gallbladder specimens for histopathological examination in order to exclude the presence of gallbladder cancer (GBC). This routine policy is costly and constitutes a significant workload for pathology departments, whereas the prevalence of unsuspected gallbladder cancer (incidental GBC) is low. To save costs and reduce the workload of pathologists, selective histopathological examination has been proposed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This entails macroscopic examination by the surgeon, sending only specimens with suspicious findings to the pathologist. Some fear that surgeons might not recognize GBC, resulting in missed diagnoses with potentially disastrous consequences. However, previous studies 6, 7 have shown that gallbladder specimens without macroscopic abnormalities rarely contain GBC. Moreover, if no macroscopic abnormalities are present, the cancer is usually of early stage and without clinical consequence, as the previously performed cholecystectomy suffices. In 2014, the Dutch guideline for gallstone disease was updated, proposing selective histopathological examination after cholecystectomy 8, but implementation was suboptimal 9. Less than half of hospitals adopted the selective strategy, and the need for more evidence on safety was expressed.

### Risk factors and clinical characteristics of occult pancreaticobiliary reflux in benign gallbladder diseases [^113bewPm]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Significantly, gallbladder sludge emerged as a consistent independent risk factor for PBR in both Group A and B, with patients possessing gallbladder sludge presenting a striking 48.0% likelihood of developing OPBR. Gallbladder sludge, defined as a mixture of particulate debris suspended in bile, sometimes contains larger, distinct particles known as microlithiasis (1–3 mm). The onset of gallbladder sludge is influenced by an array of factors, including total parenteral nutrition, rapid weight loss, pregnancy, organ transplantation, and use of ceftriaxone or octreotide. Furthermore, PBR can exacerbate gallbladder sludge formation by inducing chronic inflammatory damage to the gallbladder mucosa, thus accelerating cholesterol crystallization. This suggests that gallbladder sludge could be the precursor stage of GS spurred by OPBR. For gallbladder sludge formation, we believe the combined effects of the following mechanisms occur: pancreatic juice reflux into the gallbladder hydrolyzes bile phospholipids, disrupting the balance among bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids. This disruption reduces lipid solubility and results in cholesterol supersaturation. Additionally, pancreatic juice and its hydrolysis products, such as lysophosphatidylcholine, free fatty acids, and various inflammatory factors, cause mucosal inflammation and damage, impairing the gallbladder epithelium's lipid absorption capacity. This ongoing inflammatory damage can induce gallbladder hypomotility, promote mucin production, and enhance secretion, thus facilitating cholesterol crystal nucleation and growth, ultimately forming sludge and stones.

Limitations

Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, as a single-center investigation of cholecystectomy patients with benign gallbladder disease, referral and selection biases may limit the generalizability of our findings. Second, because the incidence of gallbladder cancer at our center is low, we excluded cancer cases and were therefore unable to compare OPBR incidence or bile amylase levels between benign and malignant conditions. Third, OPBR diagnosis depended on a single preoperative MRCP and one-time bile amylase measurement, which cannot capture temporal fluctuations in reflux or sphincter of Oddi function. Finally, follow-up data on long-term outcomes — such as biliary malignancy development or sludge recurrence — were not yet available. Future multicenter, prospective studies with inclusion of gallbladder cancer cases and extended serial assessments will be essential to validate and expand upon these results.

### Higher relative fat mass was associated with a higher prevalence of gallstones in US adults [^116tka5X]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (GSD) ranks among the prevalent digestive system diseases, accounting for significant health care utilization and expenses. It significantly affects quality of life and places a significant strain on the healthcare system. GSD affects up to 15–20% of the American and European population. There is a risk of developing gallstone-related symptoms in 10–25% of patients. Some of these symptoms may include acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, obstruction of the biliary system, and gallbladder cancer, leading to significant suffering and posing life-threatening risks to the patients. Currently, invasive surgical treatment remains the dominant approach for symptomatic gallstones. Due to discontent with clinical outcomes, the etiology and prevention of gallstones have been investigated in greater detail. Therefore, recognizing the risk factors associated with gallstones is especially critical for preventing their development.

Diagnostic criteria for biliary sludge

Regarding the location of sludge or microlithiasis, 84% of the experts answered that both can be found in the gallbladder and in the bile tract. As the diagnostic imaging tool employed for detecting biliary sludge and microlithiasis, 93% of experts considered endosonography the most accurate based on their personal experience. Four per cent of respondents preferred transabdominal ultrasound, and 4% did not specify their gold standard. The statement that the term biliary sludge and microlithiasis should be used to define sonographic findings in both, the bile duct and the gallbladder was presented for online voting and received an 89.7% agreement (3.5% abstained from voting and 6.7% of online voters disagreed). In the expert survey, 76% agreed that biliary sludge should be diagnosed sonomorphologically as discrete, hyperechoic material inside the gallbladder or the bile duct, without acoustic shadowing, which sediments in the most dependent part of the gallbladder. This definition was accepted by online voting with 70.6% agreement (23.5% abstention and 5.9% rejection). In the final expert consultation round 2 with presentation of the literature results and congress voting results for review by the EUS expert panel, there was 100% agreement with the definition statement (see table 1, online supplemental table S3). Based on the controversial results of the literature search, an expert survey was made on the question of localisation, sonomorphology and the diagnostic tool of choice. The audience agreement was obtained through an online vote. The participants of the session 'biliary pancreatitis' had the opportunity to vote on the definition proposals consented.

### Consensus definition of sludge and microlithiasis as a possible cause of pancreatitis [^115Fhk87]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In up to 20% of patients, the aetiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) remains elusive and is thus called idiopathic. On more detailed review these cases can often be explained through biliary disease and are amenable to treatment. Findings range from biliary sludge to microlithiasis but their definitions remain fluid and controversial.

Design

A systematic literature review (1682 reports, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines) analysed definitions of biliary sludge and microlithiasis, followed by an online international expert survey (30 endoscopic ultrasound/hepatobiliary and pancreatic experts; 36 items) which led to definitions of both. These were consented by Delphi voting and clinically evaluated in a retrospective cohort of patients with presumed biliary pancreatitis.

Results

In 13% of original articles and 19.2% of reviews, microlithiasis and biliary sludge were used synonymously. In the survey, 41.7% of experts described the term 'sludge' and 'microlithiasis' as identical findings. As a consequence, three definitions were proposed, agreed on and confirmed by voting to distinctly discriminate between biliary sludge (hyperechoic material without acoustic shadowing) and microlithiasis (echorich calculi of ≤ 5 mm with acoustic shadowing) as opposed to larger biliary stones, both for location in gallbladder and bile ducts. In an initial attempt to investigate the clinical relevance in a retrospective analysis in 177 confirmed cases in our hospital, there was no difference in severity of AP if caused by sludge, microlithiasis or stones.

Conclusion

We propose a consensus definition for the localisation, ultrasound morphology and diameter of biliary sludge and microlithiasis as distinct entities. Interestingly, severity of biliary AP was not dependent on the size of concrements warranting prospective randomised studies which treatment options are adequate to prevent recurrence.

### Radiologic assessment for endoscopic US-guided biliary drainage [^1137rxjZ]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic US-guided biliary drainage (BD) is performed for various types of biliary obstruction and is mainly indicated for unsuccessful conventional transpapillary endoscopic retrograde cholangiodrainage. In endoscopic US BD, an extra-anatomic drainage route between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the biliary system is created with a covered metallic stent or plastic stent. Procedural types of endoscopic US BD include hepaticogastrostomy, hepaticojejunostomy (after gastrectomy), choledochoduodenostomy, hepaticoduodenostomy, and endoscopic US-guided gallbladder drainage. The technical and clinical success rates of endoscopic US BD are reported to be 94%-97% and 88%-100%, respectively. CT is crucial both in preprocedural assessment and postprocedural monitoring. CT is used to determine the indications for endoscopic US BD, which include the type of biliary obstruction, collateral vessels in the puncture route, ascites, the volume of the liver segment, the distribution of an intrahepatic tumor, and GI tract patency. After endoscopic US BD, common subclinical findings are a small amount of intraperitoneal gas, localized edematous change in the GI tract, a notch in the placed stent, and localized biliary dilatation caused by stent placement. Stent malfunction after endoscopic US BD is caused by impaction of debris and/or food, stent migration into the GI tract, or tumor overgrowth and/or hyperplasia. Complications that can occur include internal stent migration, intraperitoneal biloma, arterial bleeding or pseudoaneurysm, perforation of the GI tract, and portobiliary fistula. The incidence of clinical endoscopic US BD-related complications is 11%-23%. © RSNA, 2020.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

In up to 20% of patients, the aetiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) remains elusive and is thus termed idiopathic.
A biliary origin explains a sizeable proportion of idiopathic AP cases that have not been identified on routine workup but are detectable on endoscopic ultrasound. The reported spectrum ranges from biliary sludge to microlithiasis, but their definitions remain imprecise and controversial.
These incongruities in the literature preclude an accurate assessment of the risk of recurrent biliary pancreatitis.

### Consensus definition of sludge and microlithiasis as a possible cause of pancreatitis [^116ddpJX]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

The literature analysis exposed an evident lack of unified definition concerning biliary microlithiasis, especially with respect to lower and upper diameter limits. Most original publications and reviews used a cut-off value of more than 3 mm as lower limit. A majority of our experts voted for a cut-off value ≤ 5 mm. Microlithiasis in this case corresponds to small gallstones with a corresponding acoustic shadow. Since transabdominal ultrasound and endosonography are widely used as pancreaticobiliary diagnostic tool, the polarised light microscopy of bile obtained by cannulation of the bile duct is no longer used in clinical routine. The first pioneering studies described biliary sludge sonomorphologically as hyperechoic, non-shadowing material which is located in the most dependent part of the gallbladder. This definition is also consistent with the one used frequently in more recent reports.

An inevitable variability can be observed in the literature concerning the pattern of the sludge-triggered echo signal. However, since the term (slightly) hyperechoic has predominantly been used to describe the echo behaviour over the last 20 years, this description was put forward for voting. A strong agreement rate of 96.15% in the expert survey and 70.6% in the participant voting confirmed the definition derived from the literature. In the literature, a sonomorphological description of sludge detected in the gallbladder is given in most publications, however, only one publication directly refers to sludge in the CBD. Therefore, participant voting with as very strong agreement of 100% confirmed the consensus definition that biliary sludge can also be detected in the CBD. We found an obvious controversy whether the terms 'biliary sludge' and 'biliary microlithiasis' describe an identical finding (please see survey question no. 28).
