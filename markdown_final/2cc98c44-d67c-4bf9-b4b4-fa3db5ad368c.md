## Question

What pertinent physical examination should be performed for lower-extremity venous insufficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pertinent physical examination should be performed for lower-extremity venous insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the bedside exam in a standing patient, focusing on visual signs that map to CEAP classes. Then, I should verify arterial status with pulse palpation and ABI before considering compression. Next, I will review selective venous maneuvers and immediately acknowledge their limitations compared to duplex ultrasound. After that, I need to ensure findings are captured in CEAP, and, if an ulcer is present, that wound documentation is precise. Finally, I should identify red flags warranting urgent referral and emphasize the limits of physical examination and the role of duplex imaging in planning care.

> Let me first confirm the importance of inspection with the patient standing, because venous abnormalities and edema declare themselves in the dependent position. I will systematically examine both legs for skin changes (hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, atrophie blanche, lipodermatosclerosis), telangiectasias and corona phlebectatica, edema distribution, and any ulcer characteristics, deliberately linking these to CEAP clinical classes C1 through C6 to anchor severity. Initially, I noted "varicose veins: look for hyperpigmentation", but wait, let me verify — this conflates varicose veins with skin changes; I should correct that to "varicose veins are dilated, tortuous superficial veins along great and small saphenous distributions", whereas hyperpigmentation and lipodermatosclerosis indicate more advanced C4 disease. Venous ulcers are usually shallow with irregular shapes and well-defined borders near the medial malleolus, and their presence corresponds to C6. This structured visual assessment ensures consistency with CEAP, which ESVS recommends for clinical audit and communication [^114ptVyw] [^112RrdNW].

> Next, I should review palpation and tactile assessment, and I need to ensure I do not overlook arterial disease that could alter management. I will palpate dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally, assess temperature gradients, confirm pitting versus non-pitting edema at the gaiter area, and palpate along superficial veins for tenderness suggesting thrombophlebitis, while remembering that calf tenderness is nonspecific in chronic disease. Hold on, I should verify the mandate here: both SVS/AVF and EDF guidelines emphasize documenting arterial pulses and performing an objective arterial assessment because compression can be unsafe in PAD, so pulse palpation is necessary but not sufficient. Clinically, any cool skin or diminished pulses should heighten suspicion for PAD and prompt ABI confirmation before compression [^113WETzQ] [^111EEWJo].

> I will now examine the need for an ankle-brachial index (ABI), and I should double-check thresholds that guide compression. Before initiating compression or treating any venous ulcer, ABI should be obtained using Doppler-derived systolic pressures in both arms and both ankles, calculating ABI for each limb as higher ankle pressure divided by higher arm pressure. As a practical rule: ABI greater than about 0.8 generally supports standard compression; ABI 0.5 to 0.8 warrants reduced-pressure compression with caution; ABI less than 0.5 suggests significant PAD and contraindicates compression pending vascular evaluation. Wait, let me verify — multiple high-credibility sources align that objective arterial testing precedes compression and ulcer care, and ABI is superior to pulse palpation alone for detecting PAD that would alter therapy. If ABI is noncompressible or unreliable, toe pressures or TBI can be considered, but the key point remains: confirm arterial inflow before compression [^113WETzQ] [^111EEWJo] [^1131ybzR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosing reflux at the bedside; specialized maneuvers can suggest patterns but cannot replace imaging. As adjuncts, I may perform a Brodie-Trendelenburg maneuver to infer superficial versus perforator incompetence, a Perthes test to assess deep venous patency, and a cough impulse at the saphenofemoral junction. But wait, I should verify that these are optional and context-dependent; the evidence base is limited, and current guidance treats them as supportive at best. Therefore, I will use them selectively to guide whether duplex is urgent, not to finalize anatomic diagnosis [^112VCAWU].

> Let me consider the critical next step: recognizing that physical examination alone is insufficient to map reflux or obstruction for treatment planning. I should confirm that a complete lower-extremity venous duplex ultrasound in the standing or reverse Trendelenburg position is the primary imaging modality to document reflux and obstruction and to plan interventions. For venous leg ulcers, comprehensive duplex is recommended to characterize the superficial, perforator, and deep systems. If proximal outflow obstruction is suspected, cross-sectional imaging (MRV/CTV) is added, and in selected supra-inguinal obstruction, venography or IVUS may be needed if noninvasive tests are inadequate. This ensures my physical findings are integrated with definitive imaging before procedural decisions [^112VCAWU] [^115LFxCB] [^1158ihVc].

> I need to ensure consistent documentation using CEAP, and I should confirm the current update nuances. From the bedside exam, I can assign the Clinical class (C0–C6) and note symptoms. Determining Etiology (primary, secondary, congenital), Anatomy (superficial, perforator, deep), and Pathophysiology (reflux, obstruction, or both) requires duplex and sometimes additional imaging. Let me verify the classification refinements: CEAP now includes corona phlebectatica as C4c and other modifiers; ESVS endorses CEAP for audit and research, and pairing CEAP with severity scores like r-VCSS can improve longitudinal assessment. I will record the date and level of investigation when I document CEAP to maintain clarity over time [^112RrdNW] [^113BS5pe] [^111Qrsw8].

> If an ulcer is present, I should review ulcer-specific documentation because it influences both diagnosis and monitoring. I will measure length, width, and depth, describe the wound base (granulation, slough, eschar), quantify exudate, probe gently for undermining or sinus tracts, and photograph to track healing, while also documenting periwound skin for maceration, dermatitis, or cellulitis. Wait, let me verify typical venous features again: venous ulcers are usually shallow and irregular with well-defined margins around the medial malleolus, often with surrounding edema and dermatitis. Guidelines emphasize serial measurement and objective arterial assessment alongside duplex to confirm venous etiology and guide compression and intervention [^1174yqpi] [^113b197y] [^114ptVyw].

> But wait, what if I encounter warning signs that suggest urgent conditions beyond uncomplicated CVI? I should confirm red flags: severe pain out of proportion (think ischemia, compartment syndrome, or aggressive infection), rapidly spreading erythema and systemic signs (cellulitis or necrotizing infection), black or gangrenous tissue indicating critical limb ischemia, ABI less than 0.5, or any diagnostic uncertainty where venous findings do not fit the usual pattern. In these scenarios, I will expedite vascular or acute care referral and escalate imaging for arterial or thrombotic disease as appropriate. A persistently high suspicion for DVT with inconclusive ultrasound should prompt repeat or alternative imaging per diagnostic pathways to mitigate PE risk [^114QPr4r] [^116DmLqg] [^1138wHHH].

> I should double-check limitations and contextual factors that can degrade the reliability of the exam. Physical examination is only modestly sensitive for DVT and cannot exclude it; imaging is mandatory when clinical suspicion persists. In morbid obesity, visualization and palpation can be challenging, and some patients exhibit severe cutaneous changes with minimal duplex-detectable reflux, so I must keep diagnostic humility and consider alternative contributors like popliteal venous compression and lymphatic dysfunction. Interobserver variability exists for CEAP, and training improves consistency; pairing CEAP with standardized severity scores and imaging reduces misclassification over time [^111zkbGL] [^115uzoEx] [^111oGSx2].

> Stepping back, let me reconsider the full bedside flow to ensure no gaps. Start with a standing inspection tightly linked to CEAP clinical signs, correct any mislabeling between varicosities and skin changes, and palpate pulses and temperature while confirming edema characteristics. Before any compression or ulcer protocol, obtain an ABI and adjust plans to PAD risk. Use selective bedside venous maneuvers cautiously, then proceed to comprehensive duplex to define anatomy and hemodynamics for planning. Document CEAP comprehensively, and if ulcers are present, measure, stage, and photograph systematically while reassessing arterial sufficiency. Finally, screen for red flags and escalate urgently when indicated. This methodical, verification-driven approach aligns with ESVS and SVS/AVF guidance and safeguards patients against missed arterial disease while preparing for definitive venous management [^113dFEH9] [^113WETzQ] [^112VCAWU].

The physical exam for lower-extremity venous insufficiency should be performed with the patient standing [^notfound] and should include inspection for **varicose veins, edema, hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, and venous ulcers** [^114ptVyw]. Palpate for pitting edema, induration, and tenderness; assess venous reflux with the **Brodie-Trendelenburg and Perthes tests**; and auscultate for femoral bruits to exclude arterial disease [^notfound]. Document findings with the **CEAP classification and VCSS** [^1135zm4N] [^113BS5pe], and confirm the diagnosis with **duplex ultrasound**, the gold standard for detecting reflux and obstruction [^113dFEH9] [^112VCAWU].

---

## Patient positioning and environment

For **positioning**, perform the exam with the patient standing [^111d6QMa] to maximize venous distension and reveal reflux; if standing is not possible, use a dependent seated position. The **environment** should provide adequate lighting and privacy to allow full exposure of the lower extremities from groin to feet.

---

## Inspection

Inspect both lower extremities, comparing sides for **asymmetry** [^111zRgPL], and note the following:

- **Varicose veins**: Dilated, tortuous superficial veins, often along the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) distributions [^111zRgPL].

- **Edema**: Typically pitting, worsening with dependency, and improving with elevation.

- **Skin changes**: Hyperpigmentation (hemosiderin deposition), lipodermatosclerosis (induration, "inverted champagne bottle" appearance), eczema (stasis dermatitis), atrophie blanche (white scarred patches), and corona phlebectatica (ankle telangiectasias) [^114ptVyw].

- **Ulceration**: Venous ulcers are usually shallow, irregular, with granulating bases, and located over the medial malleolus or gaiter area [^114ptVyw].

- **Venous claudication**: Observe for discomfort or heaviness with prolonged standing or walking, relieved by rest [^111M8viv].

---

## Palpation

Palpate systematically to confirm **pitting edema** by pressing over the medial malleolus or shin and to detect firm, woody induration suggestive of lipodermatosclerosis. Assess for localized tenderness that may indicate inflammation or **thrombophlebitis**, and compare limb temperature — warmth suggests inflammation, whereas coolness suggests arterial insufficiency [^114bft53].

---

## Special tests

Several bedside tests can help assess **venous reflux** and valve competence:

| **Test** | **Method** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Brodie-Trendelenburg test | - Elevate leg <br/> - Empty veins <br/> - Apply tourniquet at thigh <br/> - Have patient stand | - Rapid filling upon release indicates superficial reflux <br/> - Filling with tourniquet indicates deep reflux |
| Perthes test | - Apply tourniquet at thigh <br/> - Have patient walk | - Collapse of varicosities indicates competent deep veins <br/> - Persistent distension suggests deep vein incompetence |
| Cough impulse test | - Palpate saphenofemoral junction <br/> - Have patient cough | Palpable impulse indicates saphenofemoral incompetence |
| Tap test | - Tap proximal vein segment <br/> - Palpate distally | Transmitted impulse indicates incompetent valves |

---

## Auscultation

Auscultate over the femoral artery for **femoral bruits** to exclude arterial disease, which may coexist with venous insufficiency [^114bft53].

---

## Functional assessment

Evaluate the **calf muscle pump** by testing ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion strength, as dysfunction contributes to venous insufficiency [^113ptkmq]. Also perform a **gait analysis** to identify abnormalities that may exacerbate venous hypertension [^116HpgRS].

---

## Documentation and classification

Use the **CEAP classification** (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology) to standardize disease severity and guide management [^1135zm4N] [^111zRgPL], and apply the **Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS)** to quantify severity and monitor treatment response [^113BS5pe].

---

## Limitations of physical examination

Physical examination has notable limitations: **interobserver variability** and subjective interpretation limit accuracy, and obesity can obscure varicosities and edema. Early or mild venous insufficiency may have no overt clinical signs, and deep venous reflux or obstruction **cannot be reliably detected** by physical exam alone [^111zkbGL].

---

## Adjunctive diagnostic tests

Given these limitations, **adjunctive tests** are essential:

- **Duplex ultrasound**: Gold standard for detecting venous reflux, valve incompetence, and obstruction; guides treatment planning [^113dFEH9] [^112VCAWU].

- **Ankle-brachial index (ABI)**: Essential to exclude arterial disease before initiating compression therapy [^1131ybzR] [^113WETzQ].

- **Plethysmography**: Quantifies reflux and obstruction, particularly when duplex findings are inconclusive [^115uWGqF] [^114MjA2M].

- **Venography/IVUS**: Reserved for complex cases or suspected iliac vein obstruction [^1158ihVc] [^113f4hLN].

---

The physical exam for lower-extremity venous insufficiency includes inspection, palpation, special tests, and functional assessment, with documentation using CEAP and VCSS. Duplex ultrasound is the **gold standard** to confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^113dFEH9].

### Venous ulcers: Diagnosis and treatment [^114ptVyw]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Venous ulcers are the most common type of chronic lower extremity ulcers, affecting 1% to 3% of the U.S. population. Venous hypertension as a result of venous reflux (incompetence) or obstruction is thought to be the primary underlying mechanism for venous ulcer formation.

Risk factors for the development of venous ulcers include age 55 years or older, family history of chronic venous insufficiency, higher body mass index, history of pulmonary embolism or superficial/deep venous thrombosis, lower extremity skeletal or joint disease, higher number of pregnancies, parental history of ankle ulcers, physical inactivity, history of ulcers, severe lipodermatosclerosis, and venous reflux in deep veins. Poor prognostic signs for healing include ulcer duration longer than three months, initial ulcer length of 10 cm or more, presence of lower limb arterial disease, advanced age, and elevated body mass index.

On physical examination, venous ulcers are generally irregular and shallow with well-defined borders and are often located over bony prominences. Signs of venous disease, such as varicose veins, edema, or venous dermatitis, may be present. Other associated findings include telangiectasias, corona phlebectatica, atrophie blanche, lipodermatosclerosis, and inverted champagne-bottle deformity of the lower leg.

Chronic venous ulcers significantly impact quality of life. Severe complications include infection and malignant change. Evidence supports treatment of venous ulcers with compression therapy, exercise, dressings, pentoxifylline, and tissue products. Referral to a wound care specialist may be necessary for managing complex cases.

### Recommendations for multimodal noninvasive and invasive screening for detection of extracranial venous abnormalities indicative of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency: A position statement of the International Society for Neurovascular Disease [^111utEua]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Under the auspices of the International Society for Neurovascular Disease (ISNVD), four expert panel committees were created from the ISNVD membership between 2011 and 2012 to determine and standardize noninvasive and invasive imaging protocols for the detection of extracranial venous abnormalities indicative of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI). The committees created working groups on color Doppler ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, catheter venography (CV), and intravascular US. Each group organized a workshop focused on its assigned imaging modality. Non-ISNVD members from other societies were invited to contribute to the various workshops.

More than 60 experts from the fields of neurology, radiology, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology participated in these workshops and contributed to the development of standardized noninvasive and invasive imaging protocols for the detection of extracranial venous abnormalities indicative of CCSVI. This ISNVD position statement presents the MR imaging and intravascular US protocols for the first time and describes refined color Doppler US and CV protocols. It also emphasizes the need for the use of noninvasive and invasive multimodal imaging to adequately diagnose and monitor extracranial venous abnormalities indicative of CCSVI for open-label or double-blinded, randomized, controlled studies.

### Vascular tests for dermatologists [^114HFbTT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Dermatologists encounter patients with a variety of lower extremity ulcers, including those related to venous insufficiency and peripheral arterial disease. Vascular studies, such as ankle brachial pressure index, toe pressure, toe brachial index, Doppler arterial waveform, Duplex ultrasonography, and angiography, play an essential role in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of vascular diseases. In fact, dermatologists are often the first medical providers to see patients with complex vascular conditions. Knowledge of the appropriate indications, interpretations, limitations, and advantages of the various vascular studies is critical to the successful and swift management of each patient presenting with a lower extremity ulcer. This study reviews the most commonly ordered arterial and venous studies and discusses the appropriate indications and interpretation of these studies.

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^116hK4y5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common disease that causes discomfort and impairs the quality of life of affected individuals. Treatments such as physical exercise, which aim to increase the movement of the ankle joint and strengthen the muscle pump in the calf of the leg, may be useful in reducing the symptoms of CVI.

- **Objectives**: To assess and summarize the existing clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of physical exercise programs for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (May 2016). Additionally, the CIS searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) and trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise with no exercise programs.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the search results and selected eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Details from included studies were summarized and double-checked. We attempted to contact trial authors for missing data but obtained no further information.

- **Main results**: We included two trials involving 54 participants with CVI. Many of our review outcomes were not reported or were reported by only one of the two studies. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies, but using different scales; thus, we were unable to pool the data. One study reported no difference between the exercise and no exercise groups.

### Physical exercise for the treatment of non-ulcerated chronic venous insufficiency [^1154Kg1k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a condition related to chronic venous disease that may progress to venous leg ulceration and impair the quality of life of those affected. Treatments such as physical exercise may be useful in reducing CVI symptoms. This text updates an earlier Cochrane Review.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of physical exercise programs for the treatment of individuals with non-ulcerated CVI.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 28 March 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise programs with no exercise in people with non-ulcerated CVI.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Standard Cochrane methods were used. Primary outcomes included intensity of disease signs and symptoms, ejection fraction, venous refilling time, and incidence of venous leg ulcers. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, exercise capacity, muscle strength, incidence of surgical intervention, and ankle joint mobility. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: Five RCTs involving 146 participants were included. The studies compared a physical exercise group with a control group that did not perform a structured exercise program. Exercise protocols differed between studies. Three studies were assessed to have an overall high credibility.

### Efficacy of complex decongestive therapy on venous flow, internal saphenous diameter, edema, fat mass of the limbs and quality of life in patients with chronic venous insufficiency: A randomized clinical trial [^116ZeL3X]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). High credibility.

The clinical history of the participants showed that the majority (76.19%) had a family history of venous insufficiency, predominantly from the mother and her family (57.14%). Additionally, 9.52% had undergone surgery for venous insufficiency, and 19.04% had received sclerotherapy. A large majority of patients (80.95%) did not take drugs to alleviate symptoms. Regarding the use of compression stockings before the intervention, most participants (71.4%) did not use them; 23.8% used them occasionally, and only 4.8% used them continuously.

- **CEAP classification**: The clinical diagnosis of participants, according to the CEAP classification, showed that most patients (61.93%) had edema (C3); 33.33% had skin alterations (C4), and only 4.76% had telangiectasias and reticular varicose veins (C2). None of the participants classified as C5 met the inclusion criteria.

- **Ultrasound diagnosis**: When ultrasound diagnosis of the extremities was performed, a significant percentage of participants exhibited deep venous insufficiency in both the right and left extremities (42.86% and 57.14% mild, 33.33% and 23.81% moderate, and 9.52% and 9.52% severe, respectively). Additionally, a majority of participants showed mild to moderate superficial venous insufficiency in the right and left extremities (19.05% and 71.43% mild, 66.67% and 23.81% moderate, and 4.76% in the right extremity, respectively).

### Screening for lower extremity venous disease [^116bjFg6]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is frequently found in the general population. However, CVD is often overlooked by both healthcare providers and patients due to an underappreciation of the magnitude and impact of this condition. The importance of CVD relates to its prevalence, the natural history of the disease, and the socioeconomic impact of its manifestations. The aim of this article is to improve awareness of lower extremity venous disease and encourage screening to identify undiagnosed CVD and to identify patients at earlier stages of disease to prevent progression to more advanced states at the time of initial diagnosis.

### Diagnosis of chronic iliac venous obstruction [^111sKWrq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of CIVO involves a careful evaluation of clinical manifestations, complemented by appropriate diagnostic testing. The interventionalist should be aware of the performance characteristics of individual diagnostic tests and utilize them to assess whether a patient merits IVUS assessment, the gold standard for diagnosis of CIVO, or not. Such IVUS interrogation, using the normal minimal luminal area, should ultimately guide stenting in a patient with a quality-of-life-impairing presentation who has failed conservative therapy. There is no indication for IVUS interrogation and/or stenting in an asymptomatic patient (prophylactic) or even in a symptomatic patient without quality-of-life-impairing symptoms.

### Investigation of chronic venous insufficiency: A consensus statement (France, March 5–9, 1997) [^115of6gm]. Circulation (2000). Low credibility.

This consensus document provides an up-to-date account of the various methods available for the investigation of chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs (CVI), outlining their history, usefulness, and limitations. CVI is characterized by symptoms or signs produced by venous hypertension as a result of structural or functional abnormalities of veins. The most frequent causes of CVI are primary abnormalities of the venous wall and valves, and secondary changes due to previous venous thrombosis, which can lead to reflux, obstruction, or both.

Because the history and clinical examination will not always indicate the nature and extent of the underlying abnormality (anatomic extent, pathology, and cause), a number of diagnostic investigations have been developed. These can elucidate whether there is calf muscle pump dysfunction and determine the anatomic extent and severity of obstruction or reflux. The difficulty in deciding which investigations to use and how to interpret the results has stimulated the development of this consensus document.

The aim of this document was to provide an account of these tests, outlining their usefulness and limitations and indicating which patients should undergo the tests, when they should be performed, and what clinical decisions can be made. This document was written primarily for clinicians who wish to learn the latest approaches to the investigation of patients with CVI, and the new applications that have emerged from recent research. It is also intended for novices who are embarking on venous research.

Lower leg ulcers can be associated with various underlying pathologies, including venous insufficiency, arterial disease, and diabetes, or a combination thereof. Proper assessment and diagnosis are important to choose the appropriate course of treatment. When venous disease is suspected, Doppler and Duplex scanning should be used to evaluate the venous and arterial circulations and confirm the diagnosis.

Compression is the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic chronic venous disease (CVD) and venous ulcers. It is underutilized because of a lack of clinician knowledge, unclear referral pathways, local unavailability of compression, patient unwillingness to receive compression, and fear of adverse events. However, adverse events are very rare if compression is used correctly, and contraindications are taken into consideration. Compression, nevertheless, is not a long-term solution by itself, and the option of interventional correction should be offered early to prevent or slow disease progression and reduce recurrence.

### Imaging of deep venous pathology [^114AiKu4]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Venous disease encompasses a broad spectrum of vascular abnormalities for which various imaging modalities, as described in this article, are more or less suitable for assessment depending on the anatomic level of the abnormalities.

In general, the strength of a careful non-invasive analysis lies in the ability to combine information from different modalities about both the superficial and deep venous systems. This approach minimizes patient exposure to more invasive diagnostic procedures involving iodinated contrast and ionizing radiation. Future research should enhance our ability to assess venous disease non-invasively, providing interventionalists with an optimal roadmap for patients eligible for treatment, thereby achieving the best outcomes.

### Investigation of venous ulcers [^114E1j3F]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with venous ulceration primarily includes noninvasive methods to elucidate the distribution and extent of the pathology. Duplex ultrasound is the first line of investigation, as it provides assessment of both reflux and obstruction conditions. In patients with iliofemoral pathology, axial imaging with a computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed. If the treatment of iliofemoral vein obstruction is warranted, then invasive assessment using venography and/or intravascular ultrasound should be used to guide the interventional procedure. Venous valve reflux can be identified and accurately characterized by duplex ultrasound, whereas the ultrasound assessment of functional abnormality associated with obstruction is less reliable. In patients with ulceration, the evaluation for and treatment of proximal venous obstruction has resulted in improved ulcer healing.

### ACR appropriateness criteria suspected lower extremity deep vein thrombosis [^1138wHHH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Suspected lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is a common clinical scenario in which providers seek a reliable test to guide management. The importance of confidently making this diagnosis lies in the 50% to 60% risk of pulmonary embolism with untreated deep vein thrombosis and subsequent mortality of 25% to 30%, balanced with the risks of anticoagulation. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Vascular Imaging reviews the literature regarding lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and compares various imaging modalities, including ultrasound, MR venography, CT venography, and catheter venography.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Revision of the CEAP classification for chronic venous disorders: Consensus statement [^111ayiwR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The CEAP classification for chronic venous disorders (CVD) was developed in 1994 by an international ad hoc committee of the American Venous Forum, endorsed by the Society for Vascular Surgery, and incorporated into "Reporting Standards in Venous Disease" in 1995. Today, most published clinical papers on CVD use all or portions of CEAP. Rather than have it stand as a static classification system, an ad hoc committee of the American Venous Forum, working with an international liaison committee, has recommended a number of practical changes, detailed in this consensus report.

These include:

- **Refinement of several definitions**: Definitions used in describing CVD have been refined to improve clarity and utility.
- **Refinement of the C classes of CEAP**: This involves clarifying and specifying the different clinical classes within the CEAP system.
- **Addition of the descriptor n**: Introduction of "n" to denote no venous abnormality identified.
- **Elaboration of the date of classification and level of investigation**: Enhancing the details provided on classification dates and investigation levels.
- **Introduction of a basic CEAP version**: As a simpler alternative to the full (advanced) CEAP classification, a basic version has been suggested.

It is important to stress that CEAP is a descriptive classification, whereas venous severity scoring and quality of life scores are instruments for longitudinal research to assess outcomes.

### The association between chronic venous disease and measures of physical performance in older people: a population-based study [^113GHdvJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

As a conclusion, we highlight the importance of dermatological evaluation of the lower extremities for older people. Skin examination enables the early identification of CVD and enhances the prospects of optimal treatment. Older subjects with clinical signs of CVD should be evaluated to assess their need for further investigations. They should be instructed about the use of compression bands whenever possible and proper foot care as means to diminish symptoms and prevent the progression of chronic ulcers. In addition, while physical activity has its evident benefits for health, we recommend lower limb activation for older persons with CVD because it might improve the venous return and therefore prevent the progression of CVD.

### Hyperemic maximal venous outflow unmasks symptomatic lower extremity venous obstruction [^111M8viv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Venous obstruction is an underappreciated and often unrecognized component of the pathophysiology of symptomatic chronic venous disease (CVD). Standard methods used to detect venous obstruction, such as maximal venous outflow, are inadequate because they typically test patients at rest and in the supine position, while the pathophysiology of CVD is defined in the upright patient performing exercise. This report describes a patient with incapacitating venous claudication in whom standard noninvasive venous function tests were normal and whose phlebography showed no evidence of venous obstruction. A postocclusive reactive hyperemic technique was used to unmask significant outflow obstruction, leading to operative correction and subsequent symptom resolution.

### Duplex ultrasound findings and clinical classification of lower extremity chronic venous insufficiency in a Thai population [^1119QYos]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the clinical classification of chronic venous insufficiency and duplex ultrasound findings.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,010 limbs with clinically suspected chronic venous insufficiency were stratified according to the Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification and underwent duplex ultrasound evaluation consecutively between January 2012 and June 2015. Venous thrombosis, venous reflux, and anatomic distribution of the deep and superficial venous systems were investigated across the CEAP clinical classes.

- **Results**: There were 259 male limbs (25.6%) and 751 female limbs (74.4%) in clinical class C0 (24 limbs [2.4%]), C1 (130 limbs [13.1%]), C2 (452 limbs [44.8%]), C3 (183 limbs [18.1%]), C4 (163 limbs [16.1%]), C5 (31 limbs [3.1%]), and C6 (27 limbs [2.7%]). The mean age in clinical class C4-C6 (60.77 ± 14.67 years) was statistically significantly higher than in C0-C3 (55.73 ± 18.85 years; P < .001). Male limbs were shown to have a predilection for presenting with clinical class C4-C6 over female limbs (36.3% vs. 16.9%; odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.0–3.8). Positive findings were predominantly displayed in clinical class C4-C6 compared with C0-C3 (deep venous thrombosis, 3.2% vs. 1.3%; deep venous reflux, 30.8% vs. 26.9%; superficial vein thrombosis, 2.7% vs. 2.0%; superficial venous reflux, 56.6% vs. 47.6%; perforator vein reflux, 12.7% vs. 8.2% [P = 0.049]). A low prevalence of small saphenous vein and perforator vein reflux in C1 limbs (0.3% and 4.6%) and C3 limbs (3.0%) was noted.

### Severe chronic venous insufficiency: Magnitude of the problem and consequences [^111Y8j6b]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to characterize patients requiring hospitalization for severe chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) at both local and national levels and to analyze factors related to primary amputation. An administrative database (Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1988–2000) and a single institution (1992–2000) were reviewed using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification, codes for CVI, excluding codes for phlegmasia and concomitant peripheral vascular occlusive disease. Demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were assessed. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistical analyses were used; p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Nationally, CVI occurred with a mean incidence of 92 per 100,000 admissions, 55% of whom were women with a mean age of 65 years and a median length of stay of 7 days. Mean hospital charges were $13,900 and did not change significantly over time. Acute deep vein thrombosis affected 1.3% of patients; amputation was performed in 1.2%, and in-hospital mortality was 1.6%.

The local cohort included 67 patients with a mean age of 51 years. A majority were men (60%), and 85% were classified as C6 (according to the Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiology [CEAP] classification). Patients averaged 23 clinic visits and a median of one hospitalization for CVI care over a 44-month follow-up. Twelve patients (18%) underwent a CVI-related amputation, which included one transmetatarsal amputation, nine below-knee amputations, and two above-knee amputations. These patients had fourfold more CVI-related hospitalizations and greater preoperative chronic narcotic use than non-amputee patients (85% vs. 58%).

### Advanced levels of chronic venous insufficiency are related to an increase in arterial stiffness [^112LjgzH]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterized by progressive inflammatory changes. Inflammatory damage occurs in the veins and adjacent tissues and can lead to structural changes in the arteries. The aim of this study is to analyze whether the degree of CVI is associated with arterial stiffness.

- **Methods**: Cross-sectional study including patients with CVI classified by clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological classification (CEAP) 1 to 6. We performed correlation between the degree of CVI, central and peripheral arterial pressure, and arterial stiffness measured by brachial artery oscillometry.

- **Results**: We evaluated 70 patients, 53 of whom were women with a mean age of 54.7 years. Patients with advanced degrees of venous insufficiency (CEAP 4, 5, 6) had higher levels of systolic, diastolic, central, and peripheral arterial pressures compared to those with early stages (CEAP 1, 2, 3). The CEAP 4, 5, 6 group had higher arterial stiffness indices than the CEAP 1, 2, 3 group: pulse wave velocity (PWV) 9.3 m/s vs. 7.0 m/s, P < 0.001; augmentation pressure (AP) 8.0 mm Hg vs. 6.3 mm Hg, P = 0.04. There was a positive correlation between the degree of venous insufficiency measured by the venous clinical severity score, Villalta score, and CEAP classification, and the arterial stiffness indices (Spearman's coefficient = 0.62 for PWV and CEAP, P < 0.01). The factors influencing PWV were age, peripheral systolic arterial pressure (SAPp), and AP.

- **Conclusions**: There is a correlation between the degree of venous disease and arterial structural changes characterized by increased arterial stiffness.

### Approach to diagnosing lower extremity ulcers [^117Wbbba]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic leg ulcers, distinct from wounds of the foot, are most commonly caused by venous disease, arterial insufficiency (peripheral arterial disease), or a combination of both. Treatment strategies vary according to the ulcer's etiology, making an accurate diagnosis crucial. Similar to most medical conditions, determining the cause of these wounds relies on history taking, physical examination, and appropriate testing.

### Popliteal vein compression, obesity, and chronic venous disease [^115zNoQV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Obesity is a known risk factor for the development of chronic venous disease (CVD). However, some obese patients with lower limb skin changes suggestive of venous disease do not demonstrate venous reflux or obstruction. Popliteal vein compression (PVC) caused by knee hyperextension during standing has been postulated by others to be more common in the obese due to the increased adipose content of the popliteal fossa. This compression may contribute to the development of venous disease. The objective was to examine the prevalence of PVC in obese and non-obese subjects, with and without venous disease.

- **Methods**: Participants were recruited across the range of Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) clinical classifications and body mass. Those referred for venous studies had full venous ultrasound assessments. To assess for PVC, the popliteal vein was assessed via B-mode ultrasound while the subject stood and performed two maneuvers: knee hyperextension and a bilateral toe stand. Video clips of each maneuver were analyzed offline.

- **Results**: There were 309 limbs (158 subjects), of which 131 were non-obese (body mass index [BMI]: 26 ± 3 kg/m²) and 178 obese (BMI: 43 ± 8 kg/m²). PVC with toe stand (PVC(toe stand)) was more common in obese limbs (89% vs 64%, P < .001). It occurred mainly in the distal popliteal vein, associated with contraction of the gastrocnemius muscles. PVC with knee hyperextension (PVC(lock)) was also more frequent in obese limbs (39% vs 10%, P < .0001) and was distinct as it occurred more proximally in the popliteal vein.

Varicose veins and associated venous insufficiency are among the most common vascular conditions requiring specialist evaluation and treatment. Over 80% of people studied in a population-based evaluation were found to have visible evidence of venous disease. In this article, the epidemiology of venous disease is reviewed with specific attention to the common symptom patterns displayed by patients with superficial venous disease. Based on physical examination, the clinician can determine the likely sites of venous insufficiency and efficiently direct the use of various diagnostic modalities, such as duplex ultrasound. The importance of the CEAP clinical classification is discussed as a guide to choosing therapy from the multitude of available options for patients with venous insufficiency.

### Venous leg ulcers: A review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^111s72cb]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Low credibility.

Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are a manifestation of long-term chronic venous disease (CVD), also termed chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) when describing the more advanced stages of the disease. This is defined as an abnormally functioning venous system caused by venous valvular incompetence. Venous outflow may or may not be obstructed, and the abnormal function may affect the superficial venous system, the deep venous system, or both. The development of this condition is influenced by multiple factors, including genetics, female sex, pregnancies, age, prolonged standing, trauma, and obesity. Some of these factors can be mitigated through lifestyle changes, such as increasing exercise, controlling body weight, and avoiding smoking. However, others are not modifiable, and many individuals will inevitably develop CVD over time. This condition is diagnosed based on history, clinical presentation, and diagnostic tests, with duplex ultrasound being the gold standard. Understanding how this disease progresses and how it can be slowed or prevented is critical in managing it.

An assessment tool to precisely describe cases of CVD has been developed with two parts: a classification of CVD and a severity scoring system. The classification system describes the stages of chronic venous disease using the Clinical manifestations, the Etiologic factors, the Anatomic distribution of disease, and the underlying Pathophysiologic findings (CEAP). The severity scoring is achieved by reporting the anatomic segments involved with either reflux or obstruction. This classification system was first published in 1995 and has been an important tool in the evaluation and management of CVD.

### The value of hemodynamic measurements by air plethysmography in diagnosing venous obstruction of the lower limb [^113rQmRL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Air plethysmography (APG) is a functional, noninvasive test that can assess volumetric changes in the lower limb and might, therefore, be used as a diagnostic tool in chronic deep venous disease. However, the use of APG in chronic deep venous obstructive disease remains debatable. This study assessed the clinical value of APG in identifying chronic deep venous obstruction.

- **Methods**: All patients referred to our tertiary outpatient clinic between January 2011 and August 2013 with chronic venous complaints and suspected outflow obstruction underwent an outflow fraction (OF), ejection fraction (EF), and residual volume fraction (RVF) test using APG. Duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance venography were used to establish whether and where obstruction was present. Diagnostic values of these tests were assessed for obstructions at different levels of the deep venous system.

- **Results**: A total of 312 limbs in 248 patients were tested. The mean age was 45.5 ± 14.0 years, and 62.5% were female. In post-thrombotic disease, specificity and positive predictive value for OF were as high as 98.4% and 95.0%, respectively; however, sensitivity was 34.8% and negative predictive value was 29.6%, with no clinically relevant positive or negative likelihood ratios. No clinically relevant differences were observed in stratifying for the level of obstruction. EF and RVF were as inconclusive. Neither could these parameters be used in diagnosing nonthrombotic iliac vein compression.

- **Conclusions**: We found a poor correlation between OF, EF, or RVF, determined by APG, and the presence of chronic deep venous obstruction.

### The beneficial role of complex decongestive therapy in patients with symptomatic chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction with phlebolymphedema [^117A5y58]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Lymphedema due to chronic venous insufficiency has been demonstrated to be the most common cause of lymphedema in the lower extremity in Western societies, accounting for 41.8% of limbs with lymphedema. Such lymphedema, termed "phlebolymphedema", has been noted to be present in approximately 20% to 30% of patients with chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction (CIVO). CIVO can lead to the development of venous hypertension, with consequent overloading of the lymphatic transport capacity, leading to the development of phlebolymphedema.

The treatment of patients with CIVO impairing their quality of life (QoL) despite conservative therapy (i.e. use of compression stockings, leg elevation when feasible, exercise as tolerated) traditionally has been through intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) interrogation to confirm the diagnosis, followed by stenting to relieve the confirmed obstruction. However, after stent placement for correction of such obstructions, up to 30% of patients will experience no relief from their edema. This brings forth the potential role of alternative therapies for such patients either before or after stenting.

To address this, a protocol of complex decongestive therapy (CDT) was pursued first for limbs with CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) clinical C3 disease, and stent correction of CIVO was prioritized for those with more advanced CEAP C4-C6 disease. This approach was hypothesized to provide symptomatic relief and reduce the need for femoroiliocaval stenting in patients with CEAP C3 disease.

### Comparative evaluation of duplex-derived parameters in patients with chronic venous insufficiency: Correlation with clinical manifestations [^1165Z3BN]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Quantification of venous reflux is still a matter of debate. Our goal was to compare the duplex-derived parameters between patients with early and advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and to determine indicative parameters reflecting the progression of CVI.

- **Study design**: A total of 1,132 limbs in 914 patients with primary valvular incompetence were included. Clinical manifestations were categorized according to the CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic) classification. The patients were divided into two groups: group I, those with relatively early CVI (C(1–3)E(P), A(S, D, P), P(R)), and group II, those with advanced CVI (C(4–6)E(P), A(S, D, P), P(R)). The distribution of venous insufficiency was determined, and the parameters assessed were the duration of reflux (s), the peak reflux velocity (cm/s), and the flow at peak reflux (mL/s).

- **Results**: There was no notable difference in overall superficial venous reflux between the groups, and the frequency of isolated deep and perforator incompetence did not differ. The duration of reflux did not improve the discrimination power between the groups. In contrast, the peak reflux velocity had significant discrimination power at the saphenofemoral junction (p < 0.0001), the saphenopopliteal junction (p = 0.0002), the greater saphenous vein (p < 0.0001), the superficial femoral vein (p = 0.0041), and the popliteal vein (p = 0.003). The peak reflux flow was significantly higher in group II at the saphenofemoral junction (p < 0.0001) and the saphenopopliteal junction (p = 0.002).

### Relationship between clinical classification of chronic venous disease and patient-reported quality of life: Results from an international cohort study [^1156HRiH]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, pathophysiologic) clinical classification for chronic venous disease (CVD) is based on physician-evaluated clinical signs of CVD. The relationship between CEAP clinical classification and patient-perceived quality of life (QOL) has not been evaluated but is important for the selection and interpretation of outcomes in clinical studies of patients with CVD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether CVD, as classified with CEAP, is related to patient-reported QOL, and to identify patient characteristics associated with CEAP class and QOL that need to be considered when interpreting outcomes in CVD.

The Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study (VEINES) population is an international cohort of 1531 patients with CVD recruited in Belgium, France, Italy, and Canada. At the baseline visit, patients were categorized into one of seven CEAP clinical categories on the basis of a clinical examination and completed standardized generic (Short-Form Health Survey, 36 items [SF-36]) and venous disease-specific (QOL [VEINES-QOL] and symptom severity [VEINES-Sym]) QOL questionnaires. Multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationship between CEAP class and QOL.

The proportion of patients in the seven CEAP classes (class 0–6) was 3.8%, 13.3%, 24.1%, 12.8%, 36.4%, 7.3%, and 2.3%, respectively. In univariate analyses, SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores and VEINES-QOL and VEINES-Sym scores decreased significantly, indicating poorer QOL with increasing CEAP class.

### Physical examination findings in deep venous thrombosis [^111zkbGL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a potentially serious disease and can serve as a marker for pulmonary embolism (PE), an entity with even higher morbidity. Thus, it is critically important that emergency physicians consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with suspicious symptoms. Recognition of alternative conditions, such as compartment syndrome, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, is also important for optimal care.

Because physical examination is only 30% accurate for DVT, it serves to increase clinical suspicion in patients at risk but cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of thromboembolic disease. Due to this limitation, the diagnosis of DVT should be pursued using adjunctive testing in any patient with unexplained limb pain or swelling. Duplex sonography is currently the initial diagnostic study of choice for evaluation of DVT, and if test results are negative, it should be repeated serially if the clinical suspicion is high.

### Clinical role of the "venous" ultrasound to identify lower extremity pathology [^111UzKim]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Accreditation in peripheral venous testing can be obtained based on femoropopliteal (FP) duplex ultrasound evaluation, and many laboratories limit their examination to this segment only. This simplified protocol detects acute FP deep venous thrombosis (DVT) but misses calf vein DVT, superficial venous thrombosis, chronic DVT, venous reflux, and other nonvenous findings potentially responsible for the patients' presenting conditions. A protocol limited to the FP segment results in additional unnecessary testing and can create patient dissatisfaction. We evaluated the differences in diagnosis between a limited FP versus a complete approach to the venous ultrasound evaluation of the lower extremities in patients examined in an outpatient vascular laboratory.

- **Methods**: A database with the complete ultrasound examinations of the lower extremity, including the common femoral, deep femoral, popliteal, tibial, and peroneal veins; calf muscular veins; and great and lesser saphenous veins, performed in 812 consecutive patients over an 8-month period was queried.

- **Results**: Acute FP DVT was found in 3.94% (32 of 812) of the patients. Chronic FP DVT was found in 6.65% (54 of 812). Acute infrapopliteal DVT was found in 4.06% (33 of 812). Chronic infrapopliteal DVT was found in 5.04% (41 of 812). Superficial venous thrombosis of lower extremities was found in 15.27% (124 of 812). In addition, deep venous insufficiency (> 500 msec) was found in 49.75% (404 of 812) and superficial venous insufficiency in 31.28% (254 of 812; > 500 msec). A mass (cyst, hematoma, solid mass, or aneurysm) was also identified in several instances.

### The hemodynamics and diagnosis of venous disease [^112z129U]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The venous system is, in many respects, more complex than the arterial system, and a thorough understanding of venous anatomy, pathophysiology, and available diagnostic tests is required in the management of acute and chronic venous disorders. The venous system develops through several stages, which may be associated with a number of developmental anomalies. A thorough knowledge of lower extremity venous anatomy, anatomic variants, and the recently updated nomenclature is required of all venous practitioners. Effective venous return from the lower extremities requires the interaction of the heart, a pressure gradient, the peripheral muscle pumps of the leg, and competent venous valves. In the absence of pathology, this system functions to reduce venous pressure from approximately 100 mm Hg to a mean of 22 mm Hg within a few steps.

The severe manifestations of chronic venous insufficiency result from ambulatory venous hypertension, or a failure to reduce venous pressure with exercise. Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, venous hypertension is thought to induce the associated skin changes through a number of inflammatory mechanisms. Several diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of acute and chronic venous disease. Although venous duplex ultrasonography has become the standard for detection of acute deep venous thrombosis, adjuvant modalities such as contrast, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance venography have an increasing role. Duplex ultrasonography is also the most useful test for detecting and localizing chronic venous obstruction and valvular incompetence.

This systematic review has identified relationships between reflux patterns and the clinical findings in chronic venous disease (CVD). It has shown that isolated and combined reflux patterns are related to severity, symptomatology, and progression of CVD, with increased involvement of venous systems leading to more severe CVD. This review has also identified gaps in the literature that should be addressed and proposed future directions in which research should be directed.

### Duplex evaluation of venous insufficiency [^111d6QMa]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Duplex ultrasound is the most useful examination for the evaluation of venous valvular incompetence. Multi-frequency 4 to 7-MHz linear array transducers are typically used for the assessment of superficial and deep reflux. The examination is conducted with the patient standing, and manual compression maneuvers are used to initiate reflux. Automatic rapid inflation and deflation cuffs may be employed when a standard stimulus is necessary. Cutoff values for reflux have been defined. Perforating veins must be identified, and flow direction during compression recorded. When ulcers are present, duplex ultrasound is used to investigate veins of the ulcerated legs. Venous outflow obstruction is also studied by duplex ultrasound, and chronic changes in deep and superficial veins following deep venous thrombosis are noted.

The main drawback in evaluating chronic obstruction is the inability to quantify hemodynamic significance. Anatomic variations in superficial and deep veins are common, and their identification is necessary. Reporting results of duplex ultrasound studies must consider the proper classification of venous disease as well as the new anatomic terms that have been accepted.

### Duplex ultrasound evaluation of lower extremity venous insufficiency [^111N4Ktv]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Physicians unfamiliar with venous insufficiency, particularly disorders of the superficial venous system, often underestimate the complexity of the problem and the importance of proper evaluation before initiating treatment. In addition to a directed history evaluation and physical examination, use of a variety of noninvasive diagnostic instruments, including duplex ultrasound, may be necessary when determining the cause, severity, and best treatment options available for a particular patient. After such evaluation, the treating physician should have a precise map of the patient's pathways of venous insufficiency, including sources of reflux (e.g. saphenofemoral junction, saphenopopliteal junction, perforators), tributaries, vein size, and vein morphology.

### Diagnosis of chronic iliac venous obstruction [^111oGSx2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The CEAP classification was originally developed in 1993, updated in 1996, revised in 2004, and updated again in 2020. The classification describes the clinical presentation of each limb at the time of examination, etiology of the pathological condition (congenital/primary/secondary/no identifiable cause), anatomy of venous involvement (superficial/perforator/deep/no identifiable location), and pathophysiology (obstruction/reflux/combined/no identifiable pathophysiology). The latest version includes changes such as incorporating corona phlebectatica as the C4c clinical subclass, expanding secondary etiology into intravenous and extravenous causes, and replacing numeric descriptions of venous anatomic segments with their common abbreviations.

Advantages of the CEAP classification include its simplicity and ease of use, with an intraobserver reproducibility of 85% and a good correlation with both generic and disease-specific quality of life and venous reflux. However, limitations include the absence of a specific description for some symptoms (e.g. leg pain, indicating low content validity), the static nature of the description (making longitudinal follow-up impossible), and a low interobserver reproducibility of 47%.

The VCSS combines patient-reported and physician-identified items using a 30-point score based on 10 items, with a range of 0 to 3 points each. These items include venous pain/discomfort, varicose veins, venous edema, skin pigmentation, inflammation, induration, active ulcer number, active ulcer duration (longest), active ulcer size (largest), and the use of compression therapy.

### PPG, APG, duplex: Which noninvasive tests are most appropriate for the management of patients with chronic venous insufficiency [^117TgRke]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Numerous noninvasive tests have been described to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). These tests include venous duplex ultrasound examination in the supine and standing positions, photoplethysmography (PPG), and air plethysmography (APG). The goal of these studies is to provide accurate information describing the anatomic or hemodynamic characteristics of the patient with CVI, precluding the need for invasive studies.

- **Typical information obtained**: These tests will be reviewed to discuss the information typically obtained from them.
- **Usefulness of information**: The usefulness of this information will be evaluated.
- **Relevance for clinical management**: The relevance of noninvasive testing information for the clinical management of patients with CVI will be examined.

Based on the clinical class, recommendations for a noninvasive testing protocol are outlined.

### The association between chronic venous disease and measures of physical performance in older people: a population-based study [^116HpgRS]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Muscle pump dysfunction is an essential component of chronic venous disease (CVD) pathology. Aging reduces muscle strength, which further weakens venous return. However, the epidemiology of CVD and its relationship with physical performance in older individuals is poorly studied. We investigated the prevalence of CVD in subjects aged over 70 years and its association primarily with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the 10-meter walk test.

- **Methods**: An accurate clinical leg examination was performed, and the Clinical-Etiological-Anatomical-Pathophysiological classification (CEAP, clinical classification of chronic venous disorders, C1-C6) was determined by dermatologists in 552 subjects aged between 70 and 93 years. These subjects belonged to the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 - Parents' Study (NFBC-PS). Linear regression analyses were used to examine the association between CVD and functional tests and anthropometric measurements.

- **Results**: The prevalence of CVD (C1-C6) was 54.3%. C1 was diagnosed in 22.1% (n = 84), C2 in 15.2% (n = 45), C3 in 8.2% (n = 45), C4 in 7.8% (n = 43), C5 in 0.4% (n = 2), and C6 in 0.5% (n = 3). The prevalence and severity of CVD increased with age (p < 0.05). Males presented more with severe stages of CVD (C4-C6) (p < 0.001). Subjects with CVD had significantly lower total SPPB scores and longer times in the 10-meter walk test (p < 0.001). The association between CVD severity and SPPB remained statistically significant in females after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and number of children. The 10-meter walk test times were associated with CVD when adju

### The impact of duplex scanning in phlebology [^113YALMn]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a significant medical and economic burden on society. Over the past two decades, duplex ultrasound has become the diagnostic method of choice for the diagnosis and management of CVD. In this article, we describe the specific techniques used in assessing the superficial, perforating, and deep venous systems. We also discuss methods for evaluating ulcer beds and chronic obstruction. The contributions of duplex ultrasound to understanding the pathophysiology and improving treatments for chronic venous disease are reviewed.

### Efficacy of complex decongestive therapy on venous flow, internal saphenous diameter, edema, fat mass of the limbs and quality of life in patients with chronic venous insufficiency: A randomized clinical trial [^116qmq4T]. Journal of Vascular Surgery, Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding the severity of venous insufficiency as determined by the VCSS questionnaire, the results showed the following distribution for the heaviness dimension: 4.76% reported no heaviness, 14.29% mild heaviness, 66.67% moderate heaviness, and 14.29% severe heaviness. Regarding the dimension of pain, 14.29% had no pain, 57.14% had mild pain, and 28.57% had moderate pain.

In addition to assessing edema with the patient's physical examination, participants' extremities were also classified using ECW/TBW impedanciometry measurements for each extremity separately. Normal values for the ECW/TBW ratio must be between the values 0.360 and 0.390. We found 13 edematous extremities and 29 nonedematous extremities. It is worth noting that these findings do not take into account the mild edema observed during physical examination, indicating a higher number of non-edematous extremities.

Lastly, on comparing the data of the control and experimental groups, it was observed that, in general, they were homogeneous, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups, except in CM and impedance measurements, which were significantly higher in the experimental group, except for BMI, ECW/TBW, and FML.

### Utility of unilateral versus bilateral venous reflux studies for venous insufficiency [^114ZcpNv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Duplex ultrasonography is the reference standard for diagnosing chronic venous insufficiency. Bilateral venous reflux ultrasound studies are among the most time-consuming and physically demanding tests for vascular ultrasound technologists to perform. Furthermore, if a venous procedure is required, many insurance policies mandate that a diagnostic venous ultrasound scan for reflux must be performed within one year of the procedure. If the intervention is scheduled for more than one year after the ultrasound scan, the insurance company might require a repeat venous ultrasound scan before granting insurance authorization. Hence, ordering bilateral venous duplex ultrasound scans to evaluate for reflux when an intervention might only be performed on one limb within the year could be a waste of time and resources. The aim of the present study was to determine the utility of ordering bilateral versus unilateral studies to evaluate for reflux in patients with suspected chronic venous insufficiency and to assess whether a resource-saving potential exists for vascular laboratories through optimization of the process of ordering venous duplex ultrasound studies.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all patients who had undergone bilateral lower extremity ultrasound scanning to evaluate for reflux from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016, at the Massachusetts General Hospital vascular laboratory was performed. The demographics, indications for ultrasound scanning, comorbidities, time required to perform the ultrasound study, and interval to intervention were documented.

### The 2020 update of the CEAP classification system and reporting standards [^111Qrsw8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The CEAP (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology) classification is an internationally accepted standard for describing patients with chronic venous disorders and is used for reporting clinical research findings in scientific journals. Developed in 1993, updated in 1996, and revised in 2004, CEAP is a classification system based on the clinical manifestations of chronic venous disorders, understanding of the etiology, the involved anatomy, and the underlying venous pathology. As the evidence related to these aspects of venous disorders, and specifically of chronic venous diseases (CVD, C2-C6), continues to develop, the CEAP classification needs periodic analysis and revisions.

In May 2017, the American Venous Forum created a CEAP Task Force charged with critically analyzing the classification system and recommending revisions where needed. Guided by four basic principles — preservation of the reproducibility of CEAP, compatibility with prior versions, being evidence-based, and practicality for clinical use — the Task Force adopted the revised Delphi process and made several changes. These changes include adding corona phlebectatica as the C4c clinical subclass, introducing the modifier "r" for revaricose veins and revenous ulcers, and replacing numeric descriptions of the venous segments with their common abbreviations. This report describes all these revisions and the rationale for making these changes.

### Does severe venous insufficiency have a different etiology in the morbidly obese? Is it venous [^115uzoEx]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is the most common cause of leg ulcers, with patients suffering from morbid obesity showing particularly recalcitrant ulcers. Because obesity is not specifically incorporated in CEAP or other venous scoring systems, this study sought to characterize this group of patients more completely.

- **Methods**: Patients with severe CVI (CEAP clinical class 4, 5, and 6) and class III obesity (body mass index [BMI] > 40) were reviewed. Findings from clinical and duplex ultrasound scan (DU) examinations were compared with the CEAP classification, its adjunctive venous clinical severity score, and sensory thresholds.

- **Results**: A review of clinic records identified 20 ambulatory patients with a mean age of 62 years, a mean BMI of 52, and a mean weight of 164 kg (361 lbs); all but one had bilateral symptoms. No evidence of venous insufficiency was detected with DU in 24 of the 39 limbs. Although some valvular incompetence was detected with DU in 15 of 39 limbs, these abnormalities were widely dispersed between 28 sites; eight limbs had findings at only one site.

	- Ulceration (mean area, 29 cm²) was present in 25 limbs, necessitating 7 months for healing; 13 (52%) recurred at least once during a mean observation period of 36 months. The mean sensory threshold of 5.21 exceeded risk thresholds used in diabetic screening programs. The distribution of CEAP clinical class was C4 (n = 14), C5 (n = 14), and C6 (n = 11). Increasing CEAP class correlated with an increased mean BMI of 47, 52, and 56, respectively (P < .01). CEAP also correlated with a rising mean sensory threshold.

### Does the clinical examination predict lower extremity peripheral arterial disease [^114bft53]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common and associated with significant increases in morbidity and mortality. Physicians typically depend on the clinical examination to identify patients who need further diagnostic testing.

- **Objective**: To systematically review the accuracy and precision of the clinical examination for PAD.

- **Data sources, study selection, and data extraction**: MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2005) and Cochrane databases were searched for articles on the diagnosis of PAD based on physical examination published in the English language. Included studies compared an element of the history or physical examination with a reference standard of ankle-brachial index, duplex sonography, or angiogram. Seventeen of the 51 potential articles identified met inclusion criteria. Two of the authors independently extracted data, performed quality review, and used consensus to resolve any discrepancies.

- **Data synthesis**: For asymptomatic patients, the most useful clinical findings to diagnose PAD are the presence of claudication (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–4.80), femoral bruit (LR, 4.80; 95% CI, 2.40–9.50), or any pulse abnormality (LR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.40–6.60). While none of the clinical examination features help to lower the likelihood of any degree of PAD, the absence of claudication or the presence of normal pulses decreases the likelihood of moderate to severe disease. When considering patients who are symptomatic with leg complaints, the most useful clinical findings are the presence of cool skin (LR, 5.90).
