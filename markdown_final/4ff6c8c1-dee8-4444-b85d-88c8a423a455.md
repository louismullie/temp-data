## Question

when should you be concerned for growing pains

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to be concerned about growing pains in children and how to distinguish benign growing pains from serious pathology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic features that define growing pains. Then, I should verify the red flags that warrant concern and further evaluation. Next, I will consider the differential diagnosis and the appropriate diagnostic approach, including when to order labs or imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and counseling points for families, while reminding myself that growing pains are a diagnosis of exclusion and that mislabeling can delay care for serious disease.

> Let me first confirm the typical features of growing pains so I don't jump to conclusions. Growing pains usually occur in children aged roughly 3–12 years, present as bilateral lower-extremity muscle pain in the calves, shins, or thighs, cluster in the evening or night, and resolve by morning without residual symptoms; the child is otherwise well, active, and has a normal physical examination without limp, swelling, or erythema, and episodes are intermittent with pain-free intervals, which aligns with pediatric reviews and case series [^111NoEMB] [^112r6SwP] [^115XKV9r].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — growing pains are a diagnosis of exclusion, so I need to check for red flags that should trigger concern and further workup. Unilateral pain, persistent daytime pain, joint involvement, a limp or refusal to bear weight, localized swelling or erythema, fever, weight loss, night sweats, bone tenderness, or pain that worsens over time are not consistent with growing pains and should prompt evaluation for alternative diagnoses; likewise, upper-limb pain, morning stiffness, or pain that does not respond to simple measures are worrisome features that warrant investigation [^112LhaiD] [^115XKV9r].

> Wait, let me verify the differential so I don't miss important mimics. Serious causes to consider include malignancy such as leukemia or osteosarcoma, infection including osteomyelitis, inflammatory arthritis such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, metabolic bone disease, complex regional pain syndrome, and rare entities like Fabry disease or sacroiliitis from familial Mediterranean fever. Case reports and reviews emphasize that early presentations can be subtle and mislabeled as growing pains, delaying definitive care, so a high index of suspicion is prudent when red flags are present [^112LhaiD] [^112Yqgad] [^111XNrem] [^113HmRUF].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach when features are atypical. If the history and exam are classic for growing pains — bilateral, nocturnal, muscle-localized pain with normal exam and no systemic features — then no labs or imaging are needed and reassurance is appropriate; however, if any red flags are present, I need to ensure a targeted workup that may include CBC, ESR/CRP, and imaging such as plain radiographs, ultrasound, MRI, or bone scan depending on the suspected diagnosis, recognizing that unnecessary bone scans have been overused in children labeled with growing pains [^112P49fr] [^112r6SwP].

> Let me consider the musculoskeletal examination carefully, because missing subtle signs changes management. I should confirm there is no limp, inspect gait, and perform a basic screening musculoskeletal exam such as pGALS when indicated; children with inflammatory arthritis may have minimal overt pain yet show joint swelling, limited range of motion, or functional impairment, so a normal exam strengthens the likelihood of benign growing pains, whereas any abnormal finding should redirect evaluation away from growing pains [^114soRB2].

> But wait, what if the pain is truly nocturnal and bilateral yet unusually severe or refractory to simple measures? I need to ensure I'm not dealing with an amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome or pediatric fibromyalgia, which can present with widespread pain, sleep disturbance, and functional disability. In such cases, early multidisciplinary management with physical therapy, psychological strategies, and school-based accommodations is recommended rather than labeling the pain as growing pains [^111ZTDW5] [^114P5yve].

> I will now examine the practical decision framework to keep this clinically actionable. If the child is 3–12 years old with bilateral lower-extremity muscle pain that occurs at night, resolves by morning, has a normal exam, and no systemic features, I can confidently reassure and avoid testing; if any red flag is present — unilateral pain, daytime persistence, joint swelling, limp, fever, weight loss, bone tenderness, or progressive course — I should escalate to targeted labs and imaging and consider urgent referral to pediatric rheumatology, orthopedics, or hematology-oncology based on the leading concern [^112P49fr] [^112LhaiD].

> Hold on, I should verify counseling points for families to reduce anxiety and prevent unnecessary tests. I need to explain that growing pains are common, benign, and self-limited, often improve with gentle massage or stretching, and do not cause long-term harm; I should also clarify that the label fits only when the story is classic, and that new or changing features warrant re-evaluation so we do not miss evolving disease, which aligns with the principle that growing pains are a diagnosis of exclusion [^112r6SwP] [^112kikaq] [^113HmRUF].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "night pain that wakes the child and does not respond to analgesics" was a classic feature of growing pains. Let me reconsider and correct that. Nighttime awakening is compatible with growing pains, but pain that remains severe despite simple analgesics and comfort measures, or that persists into the day, should raise concern for pathology rather than benign growing pains, so I should not anchor on the diagnosis if analgesic-refractory or persistent features emerge [^111NoEMB] [^112LhaiD].

> In summary, I need to ensure I am using a disciplined, red flag–based approach: classic bilateral, nocturnal, muscle-localized pain with normal exam and no systemic features supports growing pains and warrants reassurance. Any deviation — unilateral pain, daytime persistence, joint involvement, limp, fever, weight loss, bone tenderness, or progressive course — should trigger concern and prompt targeted evaluation for alternative diagnoses, because growing pains are a diagnosis of exclusion and missing serious disease has real consequences [^112P49fr] [^113HmRUF] [^112LhaiD].

You should be concerned about growing pains when the pain is **unilateral, persistent, or localized to joints** [^111ZxZqL], or when accompanied by **red flags** such as limping, swelling, redness, warmth, morning stiffness, fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, or poor appetite [^112LhaiD]. Persistent daytime pain, refusal to bear weight, or functional impairment also warrant evaluation [^115XKV9r]. These features suggest possible serious conditions (e.g. juvenile idiopathic arthritis, leukemia, osteomyelitis, or malignancy) and require prompt medical assessment [^notfound].

---

## Typical features of growing pains

Growing pains are characterized by the following:

- **Age**: Typically occurs in children aged 3–12 years [^111NoEMB].
- **Location**: Bilateral lower extremity pain, particularly in the calves, shins, thighs, or popliteal fossa [^111NoEMB].
- **Timing**: Pain occurs in the evening or at night, often waking the child from sleep [^112r6SwP].
- **Duration**: Episodes last from minutes to hours, typically resolving by morning [^111NoEMB].
- **Frequency**: Episodic, with pain-free intervals ranging from days to months [^112r6SwP].
- **Physical examination**: Normal physical examination without signs of inflammation or systemic illness [^115XKV9r].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring medical evaluation

Parents and caregivers should seek medical evaluation if any of the following **red flag symptoms** are present:

| **Red flag symptom** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Unilateral pain | Pain localized to one limb or joint [^112LhaiD] |
| Persistent daytime pain | Pain that persists throughout the day or interferes with daily activities [^115XKV9r] |
| Limping or refusal to bear weight | Altered gait or reluctance to use the affected limb [^114soRB2] |
| Swelling, redness, or warmth | Signs of inflammation or localized infection [^116DKnC6] |
| Morning stiffness | Persistent stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes [^116DKnC6] |
| Systemic symptoms | Fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, or poor appetite [^112LhaiD] |
| Functional impairment | Difficulty with daily activities, school attendance, or social interactions [^111Vtmaq] |

---

## Potential underlying conditions

When red flag symptoms are present, **underlying conditions** that may be responsible include:

- **Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)**: Chronic inflammatory arthritis presenting with joint swelling, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms [^notfound].
- **Leukemia**: Bone pain, fatigue, pallor, and systemic symptoms [^notfound].
- **Osteomyelitis**: Bone infection causing localized pain, swelling, redness, and fever [^notfound].
- **Malignancy**: Bone tumors or other malignancies presenting with persistent pain, swelling, and systemic symptoms [^notfound].
- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Chronic pain condition with autonomic and motor disturbances [^112Yqgad].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

When red flag symptoms are present, a thorough diagnostic evaluation is recommended, including:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed characterization of pain, associated symptoms, and family history [^114soRB2].
- **Physical examination**: Comprehensive musculoskeletal and systemic examination [^114soRB2].
- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and other inflammatory markers [^112r6SwP].
- **Imaging studies**: X-rays, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or bone scan as indicated [^113S8k66].

---

## Management strategies

Management of growing pains primarily involves reassurance, education, and symptomatic relief. Recommended strategies include:

- **Parental education**: Explaining the benign nature of growing pains and providing reassurance [^112kikaq].
- **Symptomatic relief**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen, massage, and stretching exercises [^111NoEMB].
- **Regular follow-up**: Monitoring for the emergence of red flag symptoms or persistent pain [^112LhaiD].

---

Growing pains are a common, benign condition in children, but certain red flag symptoms warrant medical evaluation. Persistent, unilateral, or joint-localized pain, along with systemic symptoms or functional impairment, should prompt further investigation to exclude serious underlying conditions [^115XKV9r].

### Can we conquer pain? [^111ZHSv5]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

Pain can be an adaptive sensation, an early warning to protect the body from tissue injury. By the introduction of hypersensitivity to normally innocuous stimuli, pain may also aid in repair after tissue damage. Pain can also be maladaptive, reflecting pathological function of the nervous system. Multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms operate alone and in combination within the peripheral and central nervous systems to produce the different forms of pain. Elucidation of these mechanisms is key to the development of treatments that specifically target underlying causes rather than just symptoms. This new approach promises to revolutionize pain diagnosis and management.

### Pediatric complex regional pain syndrome: a review [^112Yqgad]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Musculoskeletal pain is the most common reason for referral to pediatric rheumatologists. Causes of chronic musculoskeletal pain include a wide variety of inflammatory or non-inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis, hypermobility, fibromyalgia, growing pains, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and more. Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome (AMP) is a generic and descriptive term used to describe chronic pain syndromes of unconfirmed etiology, such as fibromyalgia and CRPS. In AMP, pain signals are amplified, thus mildly painful or non-painful stimuli are registered by the body as very painful, and this leads to a functional disability – as the patient tries to avoid the induction of pain.

In this review we will focus on the condition of pediatric chronic peripheral pain, more commonly referred to as pediatric complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Various nomenclature are used to describe this condition, including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), reflex sympathetic dystrophy, reflex neurovascular dystrophy, causalgia, and localized idiopathic pain. Matles was the first to describe a case of reflex sympathetic dystrophy in a child.

CRPS is a condition of chronic peripheral pain, usually of a distal extremity. This syndrome is characterized by spontaneous or stimuli-induced pain, which is amplified to a very high visual analog scale (VAS) score, disproportionate to the actual incident trauma/stimulus, in the presence of a wide variety of autonomic and motor disturbances. CPRS is divided into two types. CRPS type I, previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, usually develops after a preliminary event; usually minor a trauma or fracture, without any significant nerve injury. In contrast, CRPS type II, which is very rare in childhood, previously named causalgia, is induced by partial injury of a nerve or one of its major branches. This review summarizes the current information regarding the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of pediatric CRPS.

Epidemiology

Among the pediatric population (children under 18 years of age), CRPS type I is more common among girls. The mean age at diagnosis is around 12 years of age. The lower extremity is more commonly involved than the upper, with some reports stating a predilection towards involvement of the foot.

Information regarding the epidemiology of pediatric CRPS type II is wanting. There are case reports of CRPS type II among children as young as 3 years of age.

Currently, there are no data available regarding the incidence of pediatric CRPS.

### Depression in adolescents growing pains or true morbidity? [^112aYyx8]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2000). Low credibility.

This review discusses the prevalence and characteristics of depression in childhood and adolescence. Depression in this age group is a major public health concern, but is often under-recognised and dismissed as 'growing pains'. Interviewing the patient and their parents is essential for accurate diagnosis and structured interviews may be helpful. Prevalence increases with age. Risk of recurrence is high and is influenced by family conflict. Childhood onset depression has a 60–70% risk of continuing into adulthood and 20–40% develop bipolar disorder within 5 years. The nature of the disorder is affected by family history and symptoms vary with age. Comorbidity is common and influences treatment choice and long-term outcome. It is hoped that complications such as poor academic performance, impaired social functioning, and substance abuse may be prevented by early intervention.

### Reducing pain in children with cancer: methodology for the development of a clinical practice guideline [^112D7YRu]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although pain is one of the most prevalent and bothersome symptoms children with cancer experience, evidence‐based guidance regarding assessment and management is lacking. With 44 international, multidisciplinary healthcare professionals and nine patient representatives, we aimed to develop a clinical practice guideline (following GRADE methodology), addressing assessment and pharmacological, psychological, and physical management of tumor‐, treatment‐, and procedure‐related pain in children with cancer. In this paper, we present our thorough methodology for this development, including the challenges we faced and how we approached these. This lays the foundation for our clinical practice guideline, for which there is a high clinical demand.

### Under-or overtreatment of pain in the patient with cancer: how to achieve proper balance [^114wR9yj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Achieving balance in the appropriate use of opioids for the treatment of cancer pain is complex. The definition of "balance" is continually being modified. Palliative care professionals, pain specialists, and oncologists have long been advocating for the aggressive management of pain for patients with advanced cancer. Some progress has been made in this arena but barriers persist. Fear of addiction by patients, family members, and oncology professionals presents a serious obstacle to the provision of adequate pain control. This is further complicated by societal factors that receive extensive media coverage, such as diversion of prescribed opioids for recreational use and increasing deaths as a result of this inappropriate use of prescription opioids. This growing concern has led to more opioid regulation, which increases obstacles to pain management in this population. Another evolving concern is whether the long-term use of opioids is safe and effective. Data from the chronic nonmalignant pain literature suggest that toxicities may result and misuse has been underestimated, yet little information is available in the cancer population. These issues lead to serious questions regarding how balance might be successfully achieved for patients in an oncology setting. Can pain relief be provided while reducing negative consequences of treatment? Which patient should be prescribed what medications, in what situations, for what kind of pain, and who should be managing the pain?

Back pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents. Here we review the important causes, of which defects and stress reactions of the pars interarticularis are the most common identifiable problems. More serious pathology, including malignancy and infection, needs to be excluded when there is associated systemic illness. Clinical evaluation and management may be difficult and always requires a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic imaging is obtained when symptoms are persistent or severe. Imaging is used to reassure the patient, relatives and carers, and to guide management.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^111FDRw2]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Patient subpopulations — pediatric patients — Aggressive and proactive pain management is necessary to overcome the historic undertreatment of pain in children, and perioperative care for children undergoing painful procedures or surgery requires developmentally appropriate pain assessment and therapy. Analgesic therapy should depend upon age, weight, and comorbidity and, unless contraindicated, should involve a multimodal approach; behavioral techniques should be applied whenever feasible; sedative, analgesic, and local anesthetics are all important components of appropriate analgesic regimens; and because many analgesic medications are synergistic with sedating agents, it is imperative that appropriate monitoring be used during the procedure and recovery.

### Growing pains in children [^114M4kGD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future studies

GP is very common and easy to diagnose once the typical clinical characteristics are presented.

The natural history is benign with disappearance of most attacks of pain by adolescence. However it is not clear whether some of these children develop symptoms of other non-inflammatory pain syndromes. It would be important to progressively follow the pain thresholds of children with GP and to correlate the findings with their symptoms. Long-term outcome studies are suggested to investigate whether the children with GP who has a lower pain threshold, are prone to develop other non-inflammatory pain syndromes in the musculoskeletal or other systems later in adolescence or adulthood. If many children with GP do develop non-inflammatory pain syndromes later in adolescence or adulthood, a trial of early intervention, with cognitive behavioral therapy for example, may prevent progression to other syndromes later in life.

Further studies into the pathogenesis of GP should be performed. Further larger and genetically homogenous studies are required to determine whether the statistically significant findings of decreased bone SOS in our series of children with GP have clinical implication

### Terminology, criteria, and definitions in complex regional pain syndrome: challenges and solutions [^114xGwrL]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) has remained one of the most enigmatic of disease entities since first described over 150 years ago. Primarily presenting as a chronic pain condition that usually affects a single limb, it is defined by a composite of characteristic symptoms and signs. The central feature is severe, often debilitating pain. This is accompanied by a collection of sensory, motor, autonomic, skin, and/or bone abnormalities. A key feature is allodynia, where otherwise innocuous stimulation will cause pain and hyperalgesia, where there is exaggerated pain to a known painful stimulus. The patient will present with varying degrees of pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, swelling, and color and temperature change. There are often changes in motor function, such as muscle stiffness or even involuntary movements. Regional osteopenia, changes to hair and nail growth, and dystrophic cutaneous changes may occur.–The magnitude of each of these features will vary between individuals, each existing on a spectrum. The resulting clinical phenotype is characteristic and defines the condition. CRPS has high impact in terms of individual, health care, and economic burden yet despite this continues to lack a clear biological explanation and predictable effective treatment. Despite its sizable disease burden, its long history of identification, and a concentrated research effort many significant challenges remain. These relate to issues of terminology, diagnostic criteria, pre-disposing factors, triggers, pathophysiology, and the ideal treatment path. There is also the challenge of the well-guarded notion that CRPS is not a true disease state, but rather a condition that is the result of psychological foundations. This review focuses on the challenges that exist in diagnosing and classifying CRPS and to consider tenable solutions.

### Ca-HELP: adaptation of a communication tool to help geriatric cancer patients in rural settings talk to their doctors about pain [^117HP1zk]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Effective pain management is one of the largest population health challenges among older adults in the United States. Older adults living in rural areas are disproportionately affected due to the following factors: concerns about the over-use of pain medication, less access to care, patients' preferences for nonpharmacological interventions, and patients' reluctance to talk about pain. Among the older adult population living in the rural United States, undertreated cancer pain is very common. Older patients often hide symptoms of pain and avoid communicating their need for pain relief. Older adults with cancer are commonly afraid to voice pain concerns as they believe it reflects worsening cancer, is just part of life, and do not want to burden others. Pain management communication between patients and doctors in rural settings exists against the backdrop of a growing opioid crisis disproportionately affecting these communities. There is an urgent need for interventions targeting pain management communication between older adults with cancer in rural communities and their doctors; however, this need outpaces the current evidence base targeting this vulnerable population. Adaptation of an existing evidence-based pain intervention may improve the speed at which clinicians can respond to pain in this vulnerable population. In this pilot study, we proactively engaged stakeholders (patients, informal caregivers, and providers) in a rural cancer clinic to adapt the Ca-HELP intervention, and its delivery, for use among geriatric cancer patients in this setting.

### Reoperation for recurrence after groin hernia repair in adolescents: a nationwide register-based cohort study [^112z3WKX]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonmesh repair may be sufficient for primary groin hernia repair in adolescents which could have clinical implications as the evidence on mesh‐related complications is conflicting. For young patients, postoperative chronic pain may be the most worrisome complication after hernia surgery — a concern also raised by surgeons in relation to mesh‐based repairs. For patients experiencing postoperative chronic pain, management can be difficult, escalating from an initial wait‐and‐see strategy to systemic painkillers, injections, and ultimately surgical treatment. The cause of postoperative chronic pain is probably multifactorial, and the pathogenesis may vary between individuals, but the implantation of synthetic meshes in human tissue is a concern. Data have indicated that open mesh repair for inguinal hernia may cause postoperative chronic pain in young patients, and the recently updated international guideline on groin hernia management suggests that simple annulorrhaphy could be sufficient in young men with small indirect inguinal hernia. Still, evidence on chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair in the general adult population has not found a difference between mesh and nonmesh repair. In theory, implanting a foreign material may be troublesome in growing tissue. The long‐term tension on the mesh and surrounding tissue occurring as the groin and pelvis grow during adolescence, and as the mesh shrinks with time, may contribute to chronic pain. Additionally, although no impact on fertility has been shown in adults, concerns remain regarding potential effects in young male patients after mesh implantation, which, to our knowledge, has not been studied in adolescents. To improve our understanding of potential long‐term harms after groin hernia repair in adolescents, future studies focusing on patient‐reported outcomes, including postoperative chronic pain, in young patients are encouraged.

### Reducing pain in children with cancer: methodology for the development of a clinical practice guideline [^115UajjR]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

2.12 Formulation of recommendations; evidence‐to‐decision table

For each clinical question, the WGs completed an evidence‐to‐decision (EtD) framework. Recently, GRADE published the EtD‐framework, which is a systematic and transparent approach to formulating healthcare recommendations. This framework consists of 11 questions in six domains and facilitates taking both the evidence and the represented expert knowledge into account. After an EtD framework was completed, we formulated an overall conclusion in which the benefits and harms are weighed. On the basis of these conclusions, recommendations for clinical care were formulated. These EtD frameworks and accompanying recommendations were also discussed in a separate meeting with the patient representatives, to explore their values and preferences and so validate and/or expand decision‐making. If the latter led to alterations in the recommendations, these were discussed again in the relevant WG. Final recommendations had also to be supported unanimously by the patient representatives panel.

bone and muscle problems. Accutane may affect bones, muscles, and ligaments and cause pain in your joints or muscles. Tell your doctor if you plan hard physical activity during treatment with Accutane. Tell your doctor if you get:

- back pain

- joint pain

- broken bone. Tell all healthcare providers that you take Accutane if you break a bone.

Stop Accutane and call your doctor right away if you have muscle weakness. Muscle weakness with or without pain can be a sign of serious muscle damage.

Accutane may stop long bone growth in teenagers who are still growing.

hearing problems. Stop using Accutane and call your doctor if your hearing gets worse or if you have ringing in your ears. Your hearing loss may be permanent.
vision problems. Accutane may affect your ability to see in the dark. This condition usually clears up after you stop taking Accutane, but it may be permanent. Other serious eye effects can occur. Stop taking Accutane and call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your vision or dryness of the eyes that is painful or constant. If you wear contact lenses, you may have trouble wearing them while taking Accutane and after treatment.
lipid (fats and cholesterol in blood) problems. Accutane can raise the level of fats and cholesterol in your blood. This can be a serious problem. Return to your doctor for blood tests to check your lipids and to get any needed treatment. These problems usually go away when Accutane treatment is finished.
serious allergic reactions. Stop taking Accutane and get emergency care right away if you develop hives, a swollen face or mouth, or have trouble breathing. Stop taking Accutane and call your doctor if you get a fever, rash, or red patches or bruises on your legs.
blood sugar problems. Accutane may cause blood sugar problems including diabetes. Tell your doctor if you are very thirsty or urinate a lot.
decreased red and white blood cells. Call your doctor if you have trouble breathing, faint, or feel weak.
The common, less serious side effects of Accutane are dry skin, chapped lips, dry eyes, and dry nose that may lead to nosebleeds. Call your doctor if you get any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

An R&B album that was released on December 18, 2007, by Geffen Records, it debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200, selling 629, 000 copies in its first week, and reached number one in January 2008. Growing Pains was ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007 and was eventually certified Platinum by RIAA. Background In an interview for Blues & Soul, Blige explained the significance of the album's title, stating: I started writing the record right after that whole gigantic day I had at the Grammies last year. So it was important to me to get across to my fans that whole feeling I was going through of 'How do I sustain this breakthrough. How do I continue to remind myself I'm in a better place. '. And the only way to continue to stay in that place is to GROW.

I believe the majority of people out there, if something uncomfortable is going on in their lives, are forced to either go back to where they were, or to GROW – and that that tension is called PAIN. So the light, happy songs on the album are celebrating my growth. While the less poppy, darker tracks represent the places I'm forced to grow out of. So in that way the title represents the growth, as well as the understanding that – in order for anything to develop – it has to have some kinda tension behind it. — Mary J. Blige. Growing Pains received positive reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 17 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".

Allmusic editor Marisa Brown gave it four out of five stars and called it "a mature, polished, and utterly professional set of well-crafted songs", noting that "the album takes an even greater step toward pop". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian complimented its themes of Blige's "past and present", while citing the track "Roses" as "one of the best songs of her career". NME commented that it "finds Blige on chirpier form". Michael Arceneaux of PopMatters complimented Blige's "cheerful demeanor" on the album and called it "a good addition to the Mary J. Blige catalogue". USA Today's Edna Gundersen wrote that "Her vulnerability and vocal prowess are undeniable, and resistance melts away as her voice commands and communicates with startling clarity". Steven Hyden of The A. V. Club commended Blige for "reaching beyond the relative stability of her personal life and playing up the vulnerable everywoman persona that's long resonated with her female fanbase".

BBC Online's Talia Kraines commended Blige for "keeping it real" and complimented her "empowering emotion". However, Andy Gill of The Independent commented that "it's hard to tell whether the whiplash snares and crisp handclap grooves are suited to needs here" and criticized "Blige's capitulation to R&B cliché, with all women downtrodden and all men culpable, and a corrosively bling-driven worldview". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson called the album an "overstuffed collection of affirmations, self-definitions, and keepin'-it-real-isms" and wrote that "what's both most compelling and most limiting about Blige's Growing Pains: She keeps her most salable characteristic, her emotiveness, under duress, which provides tension but no release". Alfred Soto of The Village Voice noted "no more drama, but plenty of melodrama", adding that "as her acting chops diminish, her command over plush, slightly jagged Contempo r&b improves".

### Parental accounts of the prevalence, causes and treatments of limb pain in children aged 5 to 13 years: a longitudinal cohort study [^111z4r5T]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

The frequency, cause and treatment of limb pain were ascertained in a cohort of children at six time points between the ages of 5 and 13 years. Data were collected using self-completion questionnaires sent to the chief carers of children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Reports of limb pain over the study period doubled from 15.1% of children aged 5 to 32.5% aged 13; 3.4% of children had limb pain at all time points, 43.4% never reported limb pain and 56.6% reported limb pain on at least one occasion. Growing pains were the most common 'cause' given for limb pains. Limb pain and growing pains were each associated with a family history of arthritis and rheumatism. Limb pain prevalence may have been under-reported in this study due to gradual attrition, particularly in the less educated mothers among whom the highest prevalence of limb pain was reported.

### Denosumab (bilprevda) [^115So8PB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture

Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.

Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture.

During Bilprevda treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Bilprevda therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.

5.6 Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons

Clinically significant hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization and complicated by acute renal injury has been reported in denosumab product-treated patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with growing skeletons. Hypercalcemia has been reported within the first year after treatment discontinuation. After treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, assess serum calcium periodically, reevaluate the patient's calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements and manage patients as clinically appropriate [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.7 Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation

Multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) have been reported following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab products. Patients at higher risk for MVF include those with risk factors for or a history of osteoporosis or prior fractures.

When Bilprevda treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient's risk for vertebral fractures [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Improving pain self-management among rural older adults with cancer [^111TCAaq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The burden of pain in people living with cancer is well documented, and effective pain management is one of the largest population health challenges among older adults in the US. It is estimated that as many as 80% of people diagnosed with cancer experience pain. Among the older adult population living in the rural US, undertreated cancer pain is especially common. Older adults living in rural areas are disproportionately affected due to concerns about the overuse of pain medication, less access to care, preferences for nonpharmacological interventions, and reluctance to talk about pain.

Older adults with cancer are commonly afraid to voice pain concerns as they believe it reflects worsening cancer, is just part of life, and do not want to burden others. As such, older adults may experience greater pain burden than the general patient population with cancer due to failing to bring up pain management as a concern to their clinicians. Further burdening older adults in rural settings is the reality that communication about pain in these settings exists against the backdrop of a growing opioid crisis that disproportionately impacts these communities. This backdrop can impact patients' willingness to seek out pain management and clinicians' need for considering nonpharmacological treatment options to manage pain. There is an urgent need for interventions targeting pain management communication between older adults with cancer in rural communities and their clinicians; however, this need outpaces the current evidence base.

To address this need, we conducted a National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded pilot study to adapt and test a promising evidence-based intervention, Cancer Health Empowerment for Living without Pain (CA-HELP). Prior research indicates CA-HELP demonstrated significant improvement among patients with cancer in their self-efficacy to communicate with their physicians about their pain. Grounded in social-cognitive theory, which posits that behavior change and maintenance depends largely on individuals' ability and self-efficacy to execute a specific behavior, CA-HELP coaches patients to ask questions, make requests, and signal distress to their clinicians to achieve improved cancer pain control. Although a promising tool among older adults with cancer, the original CA-HELP intervention was not designed for optimal implementation in rural settings or among older adults.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^116sXSAU]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Back pain is common in children and adolescents. Most cases of back pain are non-specific and self-limiting. In children and adolescents, pain is usually related to the posterior elements of the spine and disc-related problems are rare. Serious pathology, including malignancy and infection needs to be excluded. Evaluation and management is challenging and requires a thorough history and physical exam, and understanding of the immature skeleton. Diagnostic imaging is useful in the evaluation of a child or adolescent with low back pain and can help guide management. This article will review common causes of back pain in the pediatric population.

### "I' D like more options! ": interviews to explore young people and family decision-making needs for pain management in juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^114qbNpt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

HCPs

Consistent with parents' reports, HCPs described difficulty assessing youths' pain. HCPs indicated this was due partly to discrepancies between youths' and parents' report of pain, and between reported pain and participation in their daily activities, as well as the youths' difficulty in remembering pain over time, especially among younger children and those who do not experience a flare. A few HCPs mentioned not always assessing pain if families do not raise the issue.

A few HCPs reported that pain is not the predominant issue that families bring forward. HCPs thought that some young people may be reluctant to mention their pain to avoid escalating treatment. A few HCPs stated that even when young people report pain, they do not volunteer a lot of information about it, especially younger youths. Similar to parents, HCPs mentioned that youths, especially younger ones, have difficulty identifying and describing pain. A few HCPs voiced that pain is very subjective and cannot be predicted by physical findings. HCPs felt the need to assess the child's self-report of pain and its functional impact in an accurate manner.

(2) Need to address pain in pediatric rheumatology consultations

Young people and parents/caregivers

Young people and parents stated that discussions with pediatric rheumatologists and nurses revolved mostly around disease activity and arthritis medication (medication targeting disease remission). They had less thorough discussions specifically about pain and its treatments, including non-pharmacological options. Families mentioned that they discussed pain management options in more depth with HCPs, including a wider range of non-pharmacological options, when pain was the main disease feature and when they were referred to allied HCPs or a chronic pain team. Most felt that there is a need to address pain management in pediatric rheumatology.

HCPs

Similar to young people's and parents' reports, rheumatologists mentioned that consultations do not usually focus on pain since it is usually not the dominant problem in JIA. They also mentioned having more thorough discussions about pain when youth have persistent pain with low disease activity.

Consistent with families' responses, rheumatologists and nurses reported that their first goal was to control disease activity, which they felt should address the pain. Thus, their interventions focused on medication to control disease activity, followed by medication and non-pharmacological options to reduce residual pain. Allied HCPs and rheumatologists working in chronic pain clinics tended to focus more on symptom management (including pain) and improving function, which they achieved by discussing and recommending various options including a wider range of non-pharmacological options.

### Suicidality in chronic pain: a review of the prevalence, risk factors and psychological links [^115hx6cL]. Psychological Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

This paper reviews and integrates the growing literature concerning the prevalence of and risk factors for suicidality in chronic pain.

Method

A series of systematic searches in MEDLINE and PsychINFO identified 12 relevant articles examining suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation in chronic pain. A selection of theoretical and empirical work identifying psychological processes that have been implicated in both the pain and suicide literature and which may be related to increased suicidality was also reviewed.

Results

Relative to controls, risk of death by suicide appeared to be at least doubled in chronic pain patients. The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was between 5% and 14% in individuals with chronic pain, with the prevalence of suicidal ideation being approximately 20%. Eight risk factors for suicidality in chronic pain were identified, including the type, intensity and duration of pain and sleep-onset insomnia co-occurring with pain, which appeared to be pain-specific. Helplessness and hopelessness about pain, the desire for escape from pain, pain catastrophizing and avoidance, and problem-solving deficits were highlighted as psychological processes relevant to the understanding of suicidality in chronic pain.

Conclusions

Programmatic research is urgently required to investigate the role of both general and pain-specific risk factors for suicidality, to examine how the psychological processes mentioned above mediate or exacerbate suicidality, and to develop enhanced interventions for pain patients at risk.

### Physical activity and education about physical activity for chronic musculoskeletal pain in children and adolescents [^117Pu7mS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is a major health and socioeconomic burden, which is prevalent in children and adolescents. Among the most widely used interventions in children and adolescents are physical activity (including exercises) and education about physical activity.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity, education about physical activity, or both, compared with usual care (including waiting-list, and minimal interventions, such as advice, relaxation classes, or social group meetings) or active medical care in children and adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, and LILACS from the date of their inception to October 2022. We also searched the reference lists of eligible papers, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared physical activity or education about physical activity, or both, with usual care (including waiting-list and minimal interventions) or active medical care, in children and adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently determined the eligibility of the included studies. Our primary outcomes were pain intensity, disability, and adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, fear avoidance, quality of life, physical activity level, and caregiver distress. We extracted data at postintervention assessment, and long-term follow-up. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study, using the RoB 1. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We reported continuous outcomes as mean differences, and determined clinically important differences from the literature, or 10% of the scale.

Main Results

We included four studies (243 participants with juvenile idiopathic arthritis). We judged all included studies to be at unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, and detection bias, and at high risk of attrition bias. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for each outcome to very low due to serious or very serious study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. Physical activity compared with usual care Physical activity may slightly reduce pain intensity (0 to 100 scale; 0 = no pain) compared with usual care at postintervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.08; 2 studies, 118 participants; recalculated as a mean difference (MD) -12.19, 95% CI -21.99 to -2.38; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence). Physical activity may slightly improve disability (0 to 3 scale; 0 = no disability) compared with usual care at postintervention assessment (MD -0.37, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.19; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 170 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no clear evidence of a difference in quality of life (QoL; 0 to 100 scale; lower scores = better QoL) between physical activity and usual care at postintervention assessment (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.35; 4 studies, 201 participants; very low-certainty evidence; recalculated as MD -6.30, 95% CI -18.23 to 5.64; I² = 91%). None of the included studies measured adverse events, depression, or anxiety for this comparison. Physical activity compared with active medical care We found no studies that could be analysed in this comparison. Education about physical activity compared with usual care or active medical care We found no studies that could be analysed in this comparison. Physical activity and education about physical activity compared with usual care or active medical care We found no studies that could be analysed in this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

We are unable to confidently state whether interventions based on physical activity and education about physical activity are more effective than usual care for children and adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain. We found very low-certainty evidence that physical activity may reduce pain intensity and improve disability postintervention compared with usual care, for children and adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We did not find any studies reporting educational interventions; it remains unknown how these interventions influence the outcomes in children and adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Treatment decisions should consider the current best evidence, the professional's experience, and the young person's preferences. Further randomised controlled trials in other common chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, with high methodological quality, large sample size, and long-term follow-up are urgently needed.

### Innovating pain research: bridging gaps and shaping the future [^113i3U6r]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain remains one of the most significant challenges in medicine not only due to its widespread prevalence but also because of its profound impact on quality of life. Despite decades of research and significant advancements, effective pain relief remains elusive for many, underscoring the urgent need for a paradigm shift. Future pain research must challenge entrenched models, embrace innovation, and integrate diverse approaches to uncover new mechanisms and therapeutic targets. By adopting a multidisciplinary and translational framework, the next generation of research can drive groundbreaking discoveries, leading to more effective, long-lasting pain treatments and improved patient outcomes.

### Defining growing pains: a scoping review [^111ZxZqL]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Up to one third of children may be diagnosed with growing pains, but considerable uncertainty surrounds how to make this diagnosis. The objective of this study was to detail the definitions of growing pains in the medical literature.

Methods

Scoping review with 8 electronic databases and 6 diagnostic classification systems searched from their inception to January 2021. The study selection included peer-reviewed articles or theses referring to "growing pain(s)" or "growth pain(s)" in relation to children or adolescents. Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers.

Results

We included 145 studies and 2 diagnostic systems (ICD-10 and SNOMED). Definition characteristics were grouped into 8 categories: pain location, age of onset, pain pattern, pain trajectory, pain types and risk factors, relationship to activity, severity and functional impact, and physical examination and investigations. There was extremely poor consensus between studies as to the basis for a diagnosis of growing pains. The most consistent component was lower limb pain, which was mentioned in 50% of sources. Pain in the evening or night (48%), episodic or recurrent course (42%), normal physical assessment (35%), and bilateral pain (31%) were the only other components to be mentioned in more than 30% of articles. Notably, more than 80% of studies made no reference to age of onset in their definition, and 93% did not refer to growth. Limitations of this study are that the included studies were not specifically designed to define growing pains.

Conclusions

There is no clarity in the medical research literature regarding what defines growing pain. Clinicians should be wary of relying on the diagnosis to direct treatment decisions.

### Musculoskeletal manifestations of childhood malignancies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LhaiD]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The most of pediatric rheumatic diseases are associated with musculoskeletal manifestations, including bone pain, arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia. Systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis and some types of vasculitis are the most common of this group of diseases. For the differential diagnosis of these diseases, the presence of signs and symptoms of involvement of other organs and paraclinical findings are helpful, but in some cases, it is necessary to rule out malignancy with appropriate tests such as bone marrow aspiration.

Benign musculoskeletal pains such as growing pains are common in children. Red flags for differentiating pathological pain from benign pain including unilateral limb pain, upper limbs pain, pain that wakes up the child and does not respond to analgesics. Also, the presence of arthritis, fever, weight loss and systemic symptoms are red flags. In these cases, examination for pathological causes including malignancy is necessary.

In the case of other childhood cancers, it seems that more than a third of affected children face musculoskeletal complications. Of course, it should be kept in mind that in cancers related to the skeletal system, it is obvious that a significant part of affected children have musculoskeletal manifestations. As the prevalence of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with bone malignancies, spine cancers and central nervous system malignancies, the prevalence of musculoskeletal involvement will be much higher. Of course, there are very few studies on the mentioned manifestations among non-hematological malignancies and it is not possible to evaluate them systematically at the moment. The limitation of this study is that we investigated common malignancies and meta-analysis was not possible.

### Current practices of health care providers in recommending online resources for chronic pain self-management [^116e2ZA7]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The common concerns expressed in recommending online resources were mainly related to safety risk to patients misinterpreting the information online and to the lack of evidence-based information. There is a general consensus that the quality of online resources for persistent pain is poor and there is limited evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of online resources. A recent scoping review of pain management websites providing information about core self-management skills (eg, self-efficacy building, self-monitoring, problem solving, goal setting) identified 27 websites globally, of which only two websites had been evaluated for efficacy in people with persistent pain. Similarly, a comprehensive review of smartphone apps for pain self-management identified no available comprehensive app that met core self-management skills. Importantly, only 8% (22/279) of the identified apps had some form of health care providers' input. A recent review of apps for pain self-management available in NZ app stores (Android and iOS) found none of the included apps (n = 19) were validated in people with persistent pain and none provided culturally tailored information. However, there is a growing body of evidence on assessing the validity and reliability of self-monitoring apps in people in persistent pain. The concerns identified from the study are similar to those reported by other health care providers when asked about concerns with recommending online resources for management of other persistent conditions (eg, anxiety and depression; mental health) and other practices (eg, eHealth in general practice). Developers should be encouraged to collaboratively work with health care providers and end-users with persistent pain in testing of the efficacy and risks of using online resources for persistent pain management. Some of the safety concerns may be realistic risks that need to be addressed before uptake of online resources is widely promoted. Other concerns may be alleviated by knowing more about how people with persistent pain use online resources to self-manage their symptoms.

### Dextroamphetamine (Xelstrym) [^114RJwRp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

Advise patients that XELSTRYM may cause slowing of growth including weight loss [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Circulation problems in fingers and toes [Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon]

Instruct patients beginning treatment with XELSTRYM about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change from pale, to blue, to red. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes. Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking XELSTRYM. Further clinical evaluation (e.g. rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of XELSTRYM and other serotonergic drugs including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others such as linezolid [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4), WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)]. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

### Psychiatry and pain management: at the intersection of chronic pain and mental health [^116FYhT8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic pain impacts millions of people in the USA. At the heart of the problem of chronic pain remains the complex psychosocial aspects associated with living with chronic pain. Given the overlap between chronic pain and mental health, a promising treatment approach is to improve how we integrate psychiatry into pain management.

Recent Findings

Treatment of chronic pain and comorbid mental health issues requires a multidisciplinary approach. Advancements in how pain is understood, especially centralized pain, have helped inform both pharmacological and behavioral interventions for pain. Given the growing concerns about the opioid epidemic and the lack of data supporting the use of opioids for long-term pain management, new treatment approaches are needed. Psychiatrist may be uniquely suited to help address comorbid mental health disorders and addiction in the context of chronic pain management. Addressing the psychiatric needs of chronic pain patients remains challenging and there is much room to improve how we address the complex issues associated with living with chronic pain. We believe psychiatrists are an important piece of the pain management puzzle.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: a structured approach to the management of a child or adolescent with back pain [^1171gr42]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Back pain in childhood is relatively unusual, although as a child matures through adolescence it becomes much more common. At any age, potentially serious illnesses need to be excluded. There are some useful red flags to be aware of when taking a history and performing an examination. We outline a systematic approach when faced with this clinical presentation in a general paediatric setting, with suggestions for initial investigations and when to consider referral to a specialist.

Objective

To provide a structured approach for the paediatrician to appropriately manage a child or adolescent who presents with back pain.

Method

Review of the literature and description of the approach commonly adopted in a paediatric setting. Extended matching case questions are used to help the reader test their understanding.

Conclusions

A focused history, specifically asking about red flags, and a careful examination are essential to reach an appropriate differential diagnosis and management plan. Onward referral to a specialist may be required.

### AI for chronic pain in children: a powerful resource [^111GC5F9]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain in children is certainly a hot topic, both in terms of research and assistance. Conducting rigorous and well-structured studies in this field is difficult and expensive. This difficulty translates into a lack of evidence that complicates pain management in this population. Consequently, pain physicians deal with chronic pediatric pain with difficulty. In this situation, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a powerful resource. For example, the lack of well-established tailored approaches is a key issue. Personalized pathways should evaluate not only the patient in his entirety, but also and above all in his uniqueness. This is even more true and evident in the case of children. The word "children" includes very different categories of patients, from patients of just a few months of age to adolescent featuring completely different anatomical-physiological and pathological characteristics. Approaching the same painful pathology in an infant or adolescent certainly involves not only two different therapies, but also two distinct diagnostic procedures. Completing this intricate picture is the correlation between rare pathologies and pain, thus representing children who are sometimes orphans among orphans. Notably, the WHO establishes that these are precisely the patients who deserve the gold standard of pain treatment.

Gold standards which to date, precisely because of what was expressed above, can be assured.

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) can prove to be a powerful resource. When properly developed, this complex set of technologies has the potential to deliver remarkable benefits. For example, AI can analyze very large and multidimensional datasets allowing easier diagnosis of pain, especially in patients in whom cultural and/or cognitive barriers are present.

Moreover, pain assessment and management in patients with cognitive impairment is often extremely challenging. The use of AI approaches, embedding objective features useful for automatic pain assessment such as facial expressions and crying with vital signs and the patient's history, would allow a more accurate and timelier diagnosis. Additionally, AI-based methods such as those derived from machine learning models have been implemented for defining pain trajectories. More properly, AI could predict those morbid conditions at real risk of developing chronic pain. The ability to quickly analyze a huge flow of data would allow the creation of alerts that would allow the physician to make the final diagnosis.

Developmental Perspectives on Pain Must Include the Study of Functional Pain

Longitudinal research on pain in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the natural history of functional pain. In the last decades, pain in infancy and childhood has finally gained recognition and due respect, leading to increased research on pain in childhood and its relation to adult pain experience, and many promising findings. However, this developmental work is also dominated by pathological pain; it is largely limited to how acute pain or stressors in childhood increase risk of pain problems later in life, or how pediatric pain symptoms are a risk factor for adult chronic pain. Little if any research exists on understanding functional pain from a developmental perspective.

Research on deprivation in early life and its impact on neurologic development demonstrates that if deprived of "the types and amount of stimulation the brain needs to organize its pathways, then the brain may suffer". By extension, could this mean that exposure to pain inducing stimuli is necessary in some forms in order to develop a healthy pain system, one capable of functional pain? Given neuroplasticity's role in pain perception and processing, early life interventions may impact health of the pain system over the lifespan beyond simply increasing risk of adult chronic pain. For example, what may be excessive analgesia in childhood and what is its impact on the still developing somatosensory system? What are the range of common pain experiences in childhood and how are these related to healthy somatosensory system development? Other than congenitally driven disorders or diabetic neuropathy, is there a phenomenon of acquired insensitivity to pain and what are its risk factors? For example, we know pain sensitivity may change with age but little else is known. Given that research tends not to examine functional pain, it is hard to know the health consequences of its potential impairment through insult, medication or degeneration. As a result, research on pediatric pain and developmental research on pain may benefit from more directly considering the functional role of pain.

### Identifying the content and context of pain within paediatric rheumatology healthcare professional curricula in the UK: a summative content analysis [^116dohDF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Types of conditions

Together, the documents referred to a wide range of specific musculoskeletal pain conditions such as chronic regional pain syndrome, generalized idiopathic pain syndrome, pain amplification syndrome, growing pains, mechanical pains, biomechanical pains, over-use syndromes, back pain, abdominal pain, knee pain, referred pain and biomechanical pain. Two documents considered the importance of acute pain in practice, encouraging nurses to identify and manage (RCN Competency Framework for Rheumatology Nurses) and doctors to understand sedation for painful procedures (RCPCH Paediatric Rheumatology Syllabus Level 3). Two of the documents aimed at doctors (RCPCH Generic Syllabi Level 1 and 2) discussed the importance of pain in the context of palliative care.

Pain features

None of the documents identified which features and characteristics of pain are of particular importance. For example, there was no reference to pain intensity, location, emotion/affect or interference. The BSPAR Competencies for Paediatric Rheumatology Clinical Nurse Specialists and the RCPCH Generic Syllabus Level 2 for doctors highlighted that these professionals should be aware of how to manage 'painful joints'. In the RCPCH Framework of Competencies for Doctors Specialising in Paediatric Rheumatology, 'joint' pain and 'muscle' pain were specified.

Identifying and managing pain symptoms in inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions

There was a clear distinction between inflammatory and non-inflammatory pain in terms of identifying and managing the causes of pain, with many of the documents tending to consider pain in the context of only one of these pain types. Two of the documents considered causes of pain from an inflammatory pathology perspective such as inflammatory causes of joint and back pain (RCPCH Framework of Competencies for Doctors Specialising in Paediatric Rheumatology) and arthritis (BSPAR Allied Health Professional Competencies). Content on the management of pain symptoms primarily focused on non-inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions such as hypermobility, growing pains, back pain and pain amplification syndrome in the RCPCH Paediatric Rheumatology Syllabus Level 3. The BSPAR Competencies for Paediatric Rheumatology Clinical Nurse Specialists document specifically developed for guidance around the administration of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biologic therapies highlighted that pain should be managed within the context of chronic inflammatory disease.

The RCPCH Generic Syllabus Level 1 and the RCPCH Framework of Competencies for Doctors Specialising in Paediatric Rheumatology were the only documents to highlight the importance of pain management as a feature of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.

### OxyContin and the mcDonaldization of chronic pain therapy in the USA [^113mqoXN]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Principles and practices gleaned from successful business enterprises have been used to transform the practice of medicine for decades. McDonaldization is the process in which principles which govern fast-food businesses, are applied to the practice of medicine. When left unchecked, the application of these principles can have devastating consequences, as in the treatment of chronic, non-malignant pain with OxyContin. At a time when there was growing concern about the under treatment of pain, Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin, providing an efficient, predictable way of treating chronic pain. The liberal prescription of this drug contributed, and continues to contribute, to the opioid epidemic we see today. So, in confronting this epidemic, we must first understand the process of McDonaldization that has brought us here and then provide safe and effective chronic pain therapies even if they are expensive, time-consuming to deliver, difficult to measure, and unpredictable in their outcomes — all things we've grown to detest in our McDonaldized healthcare system.

Stop taking Sotret and call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your vision or dryness of the eyes that is painful or constant. If you wear contact lenses, you may have trouble wearing them while taking Sotret and after treatment.
lipid (fats and cholesterol in blood) problems. Sotret can raise the level of fats and cholesterol in your blood. This can be a serious problem. Return to your doctor for blood tests to check your lipids and to get any needed treatment. These problems usually go away when Sotret treatment is finished.
serious allergic reactions. Stop taking Sotret and get emergency care right away if you develop hives, a swollen face or mouth, or have trouble breathing. Stop taking Sotret and call your doctor if you get a fever, rash, or red patches or bruises on your legs.

Correspondence: M. Nashawi

Introduction: Growing pains (GP) are frequent in children. They usually encompass mostly bilateral, nocturnal pains, with changing localization, especially in the lower extremities, which respond well to symptomatic therapy and resolve until the next day. It is however a diagnosis of exclusion, and selected cases warrant further investigation.

Objectives: Our objective is to point out that growing pain is a diagnosis of exclusion by presenting a case that had been falsely diagnosed as a growing pain in the beginning.

Methods: we present a case report.

Results: We present a 3-yo girl with recurrent pain of the lower extremities which was initially diagnosed with growing pains. Upon further investigation, we found severe bilateral sacroiliitis. Considering the mediterranean origin of the family we sought to investigate the MEFV Gene and found a homozygous single nucleotide mutation strongly associated with familial mediterranean fever (FMF).

Conclusion: Especially in the pediatric population, sacroiliitis (SI) is a rare and uncommon localization for FMF-associated arthritis. In this case, the patient was very young and nocturnal pains were the only manifestation of this disorder. In the population with a susceptible genetic background, we recommend further investigation of limb and lower back pains, to rule out FMF-associated arthritis.

### Painful truth: the need to Re-center chronic pain on the functional role of pain [^111e9Fa8]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Understanding the Functional Role of Pain Requires Research on Evidence of the Benefits of Pain

As noted above, almost all research on pain is on its negative consequences for health and well-being. However, as pain is crucial for health and well-being, it follows that there must be some evidence of this and some benefit to better understanding it for public health and clinical practice. Research on pain should address questions in this area as well. For example, how much of the burden of pain is functional pain? Even research that is cited above as inadvertently providing evidence of the beneficial role of pain for improved health outcomes does not itself actively address that question. Moreover, what are the health-related benefits of pain? These questions and those in the previous section are just some of the relevant research questions not currently examined. Essentially, research must also try to understand the ways in which pain is beneficial for health and well-being to help identify where and how to leverage this benefit and identify where medicating or ignoring pain as a symptom may have negative impacts on health.

### Back pain in children and adolescents [^113S8k66]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Back pain has long been considered an uncommon complaint in the pediatric population. When present, teaching had been that pediatric back pain almost always has a diagnosable cause, many of which are progressive and potentially debilitating. Recent evidence has suggested that pediatric back pain is not only more common than once thought but also, within certain populations, benign and idiopathic. This, in turn, places an increasing amount of pressure on pediatricians to accurately assess and manage their patients presenting with complaints of back pain. The aim of this article is to serve as a review of the current literature on pediatric back pain. The article reviews the epidemiology, basic anatomy, and important elements of a history and examination, which should be considered when a child presents complaining of back pain. Last, a common differential diagnosis with evaluation and management is also given to help guide pediatricians through their medical decision making.

### Assessment and management of pain syndromes and arthritis pain in children and adolescents [^113pwPh3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic musculoskeletal pain, whether it is idiopathic or disease-related, is common in childhood. Pediatric rheumatologists and other pediatric health care providers must understand the epidemiology of musculoskeletal pain as part of childhood, diagnose pain syndromes in children and rule out rheumatic disease, and be willing to initiate treatment of pain in children and adolescents. Practitioners' ability to carry out these tasks is enhanced by an awareness of the biopsychosocial model of pain, which integrates biologic, environmental, and cognitive behavioral mechanisms in describing the causes and maintenance of children's pain. A growing body of research in rheumatic diseases, such as JIA, and idiopathic musculoskeletal pain syndromes, such as JPFS, highlights the importance of environmental and cognitive behavioral influences in the pain experience of children in addition to the contribution of disease activity. These influences include factors innate in the child, such as emotional distress, daily stress, coping, and mood, and familial factors, such as parental psychologic health, parental pain history, and the nature of family interactions. Addressing these issues, while providing aggressive traditional medical management, optimizes pain treatment and improves overall quality of life for children who have musculoskeletal pain.

### Dextroamphetamine [^115MXtCW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

Advise patients that dextroamphetamine sulfate, may cause slowing of growth including weight loss (see WARNINGS).

Circulation problems in fingers and toes [Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon]

Instruct patients beginning treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red.
Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes.
Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution.
Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients.

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate and other serotonergic drugs including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others such as linezolid (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS). Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette's Syndrome

Advise patients that motor and verbal tics and worsening of Tourette's Syndrome may occur during treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Instruct the patients to notify their healthcare provider if emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette's syndrome occurs (see WARNINGS).

Amphetamines may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or vehicles; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.

### Reducing pain in children with cancer: methodology for the development of a clinical practice guideline [^115dfKeX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

In addition, we encouraged patient representatives to share their values and preferences as so to contribute to formulating the recommendations. Working together closely with patient representatives, and providing them with training in evidence‐based guideline development, will facilitate a CPG in which the patient perspective is interweaved.

The lack of identified high‐quality studies also emphasizes the importance of undertaking studies focusing on effective pain measurement and management, as pain has been acknowledged repeatedly as one of the most important adverse effects of childhood cancer and its therapy. Large randomized studies are needed, and as patient numbers are relatively small we encourage these to be multicentered and international in scope. In our upcoming CPGs, detailed research recommendations will be included which can serve to inform the research agenda for the coming decade.

In conclusion, with the improving cure rates of childhood cancer, it is of the utmost importance to develop high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines for supportive care, to reduce variabilities in care and improve patient outcomes. In this project, we took the first steps toward a comprehensive CPG regarding assessment and pharmacological, psychological, and physical management of tumor‐, treatment‐, and procedure‐related pain in children with cancer.

### Introduction to special issue: translational research on pain and pain management in later life [^114NkB4u]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Next Steps

The articles in this special issue point to the promise and challenge of translational research on pain. They shed light on potential short- and long-term consequences of pain, new approaches to measurement, as well as promising nonpharmacological interventions for its management. A critical need, however, is to link these areas of inquiry, moving from the production of basic knowledge about pain to evidence-based approaches to prevention and treatment. Creating a more seamless translational pipeline requires innovative approaches to stakeholder involvement, so that interventions have immediate real-world relevance. Given the continued growth in the older population, and the tremendous amount of suffering generated by untreated or undertreated pain, fostering collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and affected older people themselves should be a top priority for the field.

### Pain in children: recent advances and ongoing challenges [^114Ws34T]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Significant advances in the assessment and management of acute pain in children have been made, and are supported by an increase in the availability and accessibility of evidence-based data. However, methodological and practical issues in the design and performance of clinical paediatric trials limit the quantity, and may influence the quality, of current data, which lags behind that available for adult practice. Collaborations within research networks, which incorporate both preclinical and clinical studies, may increase the feasibility and specificity of future trials. In early life, the developing nervous system responds differently to pain, analgesia, and injury, resulting in effects not seen in later life and which may have long-term consequences. Translational laboratory studies further our understanding of developmental changes in nociceptor pathway structure and function, analgesic pharmacodynamics, and the impact of different forms of injury. Chronic pain in children has a negative impact on quality of life, resulting in social and emotional consequences for both the child and the family. Despite age-related differences in many chronic pain conditions, such as neuropathic pain, management in children is often empirically based on data from studies in adults. There is a major need for further clinical research, training of health-care providers, and increased resources, to improve management and outcomes for children with chronic pain.

### Chronic pain: what does It mean? A review on the use of the term chronic pain in clinical practice [^114FKv1F]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic Pain: Some Reflections on the Term and Its Meanings

Based on the above historical reconstruction, it appears that the term "chronic pain" started to be adopted in the seventies, while pain medicine was also founded, probably becoming crucial in delineating the problem encountered by clinicians at that time: a very intractable and persistent pain. This term was initially used referring to pain regarded as a symptom or to group different diseases with a similar prevailing clinical manifestation, ie, pain which persists over a long period of time, even after the resolution of the generating cause. However, over the years, "chronic pain" has also been increasingly used to define a disease in its own right. Consequently, it is clear that a term identifying both a symptom and a disease risks to create ambiguity and confusion.

### From mechanism to cure: renewing the goal to eliminate the disease of pain [^1139SP1n]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Persistent pain causes untold misery worldwide and is a leading cause of disability. Despite its astonishing prevalence, pain is undertreated, at least in part because existing therapeutics are ineffective or cause intolerable side effects. In this review, we cover new findings about the neurobiology of pain and argue that all but the most transient forms of pain needed to avoid tissue damage should be approached as a disease where a cure can be the goal of all treatment plans, even if attaining this goal is not yet always possible.

Design

We reviewed the literature to highlight recent advances in the area of the neurobiology of pain.

Results

We discuss barriers that are currently hindering the achievement of this goal, as well as the development of new therapeutic strategies. We also discuss innovations in the field that are creating new opportunities to treat and even reverse persistent pain, some of which are in late-phase clinical trials.

Conclusion

We conclude that the confluence of new basic science discoveries and development of new technologies are creating a path toward pain therapeutics that should offer significant hope of a cure for patients and practitioners alike. Classification of Evidence. Our review points to new areas of inquiry for the pain field to advance the goal of developing new therapeutics to treat chronic pain.

### Distal extremity pain as a presenting feature of Fabry's disease [^111XNrem]. Arthritis Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Fabry's disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease. Distal extremity pain can be an early finding and renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications may lead to complications and mortality. Treatment is now available for these patients, who may not be diagnosed correctly for years if the neuropathic nature of the pain is not recognized. The aim of our study was to describe early clinical features in a cohort of patients with FD and to emphasize the importance of distal extremity pain for early diagnosis.

Methods

The medical charts of 35 patients with FD followed in a single center were reviewed. When data were incomplete, a detailed pain questionnaire was sent to patients. Nonresponders were contacted by telephone.

Results

Distal extremity pain was present in the majority of cases (25 of 35). The mean age at diagnosis of FD was 43.5 years (range 5–77 years). Distal extremity pain was more prevalent in males than females and occurred mostly in childhood or adolescence. When present at onset, the disease progressed with subsequent organ system involvement. Misdiagnoses were frequent and included growing pains, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, connective tissue disease, and gout.

Conclusion

Clinical manifestations of FD, including episodes of severe pain in the feet and hands, often start in childhood. Distal extremity pain may be the only symptom for a considerable period of time. Patients may be wrongly labeled as having rheumatologic conditions, resulting in long diagnostic and therapeutic delays. Rheumatologists should be aware of the clinical aspects of FD and include it in the differential diagnosis of distal extremity pain in childhood and adolescence.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^116DKnC6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Anterior knee pain (see Figure 1) is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints seen in the pediatric population. A fairly extensive differential diagnosis exists as anterior knee pain is a fairly nonspecific phenomenon. A thorough history and physical examination with attention to anatomic location of the pain, inciting factors, relationship of associated symptoms as well as a general assessment of growth and development will aid in the evaluation and treatment of this disorder. An awareness of typical injury patterns can aid the physician in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Identification of worrisome signs and symptoms will also help in defining which cases may require further evaluation. All pediatric patients presenting with knee pain require evaluation for ipsilateral hip and lumbar spine disorders. This article will review common causes of chronic anterior knee pain in the pediatric population with a focus on patellofemoral pain. It is not meant to be an exhaustive review and will not review acute traumatic knee injuries. Lateral, medial or posterior knee pain will be covered in a subsequent article.

Figure 1
Patients with anterior knee pain localize the pain to the anterior knee and will point to the entire extensor mechanism, rather than to specific anatomic regions [1].

Clinical history

The clinical history should include a thorough description of the pain characteristics (location, character, onset, duration, change with activity or rest, aggravating and alleviating factors, night pain); trauma (acute macrotrauma, repetitive microtrauma, recent/remote); mechanical symptoms (locking or extension block, instability, worse during or after activity); inflammatory symptoms (morning stiffness, swelling); effects of previous treatments and the current level of function of the child. Patients with overuse anterior knee pain may report a sensation of giving way or instability. This sensation is usually a pseudo-giving way due to what is coined the "quadriceps inhibitory reflex" or a neuromuscular inhibition that occurs secondary to pain, muscle weakness, patellar instability or joint instability. It is important to note that true instability is suggestive of internal derangement of the knee most commonly associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears or meniscal injury.

A history of previous injury or knee surgery, chronic inflammatory joint disease or bleeding diathesis, is significant, especially if knee swelling is present.

### Growing pains in children [^116rhjwQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Low pain threshold

GP belong to the non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Non-inflammatory pain syndromes, especially fibromyalgia, are associated with a lower pain threshold and with more characteristic tender points when measured by dolorimeter as compared to people without pain syndromes. In fibromyalgia lower pain threshold and characteristic tender points are a dominant feature, which is found in the acute stage of the syndrome and resolves following remission.

Since GP is also a pain syndrome, our hypothesis was that the pain threshold in children with GP is lower compared to controls. We assessed the pain threshold by dolorimeter in 44 children with GP and indeed found that children with GP have a decreased pain threshold compared to age and gender matched controls. It was interesting to note that the pain threshold at the anterior tibia was the highest in the body, including among children with GP. This is the region most commonly reported by children with GP as painful during attacks. This indicated that GP represents a generalized pain syndrome, not only a localized disorder. Thus it is possible that GP represents the pattern of non-inflammatory pain syndromes in early childhood.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^111MqFbY]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

High-quality clinical trials of opioids, nonopioid medications, and nonpharmacologic approaches — evidence gaps include the very small number of randomized controlled trials comparing opioids with nonopioids, the need to guide multimodal pain management, and examination of how to combine nonopioid medications and nonpharmacologic treatments to avoid or minimize opioid use; researchers should study a range of conditions rather than narrowly defined pain conditions, and the ideal dose, schedule, and duration as well as clinical endpoints for stopping or tapering should be developed with guidance from patients and family members.

### The experience of aging and perceptions of "Aging well" among older migrants in the Netherlands [^112ELnep]. The Gerontologist (2020). Medium credibility.

I like to grow older. It's not like that. uhm. I see some people who would like to have a pound off here and there. But I feel happy and I am satisfied with who I am. I enjoy playing football with my [ex-]colleagues on Monday. Now and then I also volunteer.

In discussion, two Moroccan men explained furthermore that in the Netherlands the "doctor is better", "it is safe", and "it is a free country where nothing is a must". One of them, however, also detailed that: "We lack inner peace but life here [in the Netherlands] is comfortable".

As the aforementioned quote suggests, there are not only positive aspects of growing older in the Netherlands. A number of difficulties were also discussed to a varying degree between and within the groups. For example, the majority of Moroccan informants were concerned with financial problems and unfulfilled filial expectations, whereas some Antillean and Western older adults discussed old age prejudice and how this dictates what they ought to and ought not to do. The participants with Western background lamented furthermore their scarce social life and mentioned feelings of loneliness. The Turkish older adults were more than others concerned with future care arrangements and the role of the government in this regard whereas the Surinamese participants, Indo-Dutch, and Moluccans shared to be highly concerned with their slowly decaying health using the expression HPDP — "hier pijn daar pijn" (pain here, pain there) — to describe their current health situation. In fact, slowly decaying health and insecurities about future care arrangements were mentioned to a varying degree by virtually all participants and seemed to underpin one of the three fundamental concepts defining a good old age — to remain healthy.

### PGALS-paediatric gait arms legs and spine: a simple examination of the musculoskeletal system [^114soRB2]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2013). Low credibility.

When should pGALS be performed?

When there are indicators of potential MSK disease, a "top-to-toe" basic examination, such as pGALS, is helpful in the clinical assessment. Given the broad spectrum of MSK presentations, a low threshold for performing pGALS is advised, of particular importance in certain clinical scenarios (List 1), and when inflammatory joint disease is suspected (List 2); children with JIA may not complain overtly of pain and symptoms can be vague and illocalised. We also suggest pGALS in the context of the child who is "clumsy" – a term often used by parents concerned about their child's mobility or co-ordination. Traditionally a "clumsy child presentation" directs the observer to consider a neurological cause; however it is not unusual for children with MSK problems, including inflammatory disease, to present with abnormal gait, proneness to falling, or dexterity problems and we would recommend that the assessment includes pGALS as a minimum.

List 1 When to perform pGALS

- Unwell child with pyrexia

- Child with limp

- Delay or regression of motor milestones

- Child with chronic disease and known association with MSK presentations (such as inflammatory bowel disease)

- The 'clumsy' child in the absence of neurological disease

List 2 When inflammatory joint disease is suspected

- The lack of reported pain does not exclude arthritis

- There is need to probe for symptoms such as

○ gelling (e.g. stiffness after long car rides)

○ altered function (e.g. play, handwriting skills, writing, regression of milestones)

○ deterioration in behaviour (irritability, poor sleeping)

- There is need to examine all joints as often joint involvement may be 'asymptomatic'

pGALS was developed in the context of detecting inflammatory joint disease but has been shown to be useful in identifying other joint problems (e.g. orthopaedic problems at the hip, scoliosis, hypermobility), joint involvement in mucopolysaccharidoses [Chan M, submitted], as well as other pathologies (stroke and sepsis) so findings need to be interpreted in the context of the physical examination elsewhere (e.g. chest, abdomen, neurological examinations).

Investigations and diagnosis

Currently, the diagnosis is based only on typical clinical symptoms as outlined above. There are no sensitive or specific laboratory tests, although children often undergo extensive investigations for other diseases. At least 19% of the children with GP undergo bone scans for evaluation of their pain. When patients have typical clinical characteristics there is no need to do any laboratory or imaging tests. However, if the symptoms are atypical, the diagnosis of GP should not be assumed without evaluating other causes.

### Current status of pain management in children [^116pego7]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Many changes have taken place in pediatric pain management since the undertreatment of children's pain was first reported. Notable advances include an increase in understanding pain during development and improvements in the management of acute pain. Although much more about the safe and effective management of pain in children is now known, this knowledge has not been widely or effectively translated into routine clinical practice. Lack of suitable research on which to firmly establish evidence-based care is likely to have contributed to this situation. A subject of considerable interest recently is the discovery that the experience of pain in early life may lead to long-term consequences. New research findings from laboratory and clinical studies have clearly identified possible mechanisms and provided evidence that long-term behavioral changes can extend far beyond what would be considered the normal period of postinjury recovery. Timing, degree of injury, and administered analgesia and its nature may be important determinants of the long-term outcome of infant pain. Chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, is far more common in children than was thought. The assessment and treatment of this pain and its functional consequences present a considerable unmet challenge. There is a pressing need for further research and clinical development in the management of pain in children.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^116tYSf7]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

High-quality empirical evidence is important, but information provision is not enough

Providing pain relief in infants and young children is challenging (Table 1). Pain is a complex multifaceted individual experience that is difficult to describe. Fundamentally, pain is protective: it signals damage to an individual, it provides a mechanism to promote healing, it drives compassionate care in others, and it educates us on how to protect our bodies. When children undergo painful necessary invasive procedures, pain can be perceived as a mechanism for future protection. This complexity makes it difficult for parents to know how to respond to induced pain in the healthcare setting. Expectations that children should 'man-up', 'cope', or 'be brave' are confusing. This conceptual confusion about the value of pain (by both parents and healthcare professionals) can be reduced through the provision of high-quality, accessible material that describes best evidence-based practice. Consensus-finding within this author-group identified key facts that need to be communicated to healthcare professionals and parents (Table 2). While these key aspects have been identified, further attention needs to be given to how this information is presented and delivered.

### A new way of thinking about pains [^1114gHdd]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The traditional construct of acute pain vs chronic pain is arbitrary and obscures fundamental differences in clinical pain phenomena. A more powerful dichotomy between peripherally generated pain and centrally maintained pains can facilitate advances in both pain research and clinical care. We should abandon the temporally based pain classification scheme because it does not accurately reflect the underlying principles inherent in the phenomena of pain.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^117FiV8N]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) that do not raise concern and parent education — Key Action Statement 5 emphasizes observation and counseling. In a primary care setting, the majority of IHs are not problematic and require no active intervention, yet even low‑risk IHs may cause significant parental anxiety; formal educational efforts can reduce anxiety and enhance comfort with a plan to observe for unexpected or worrisome changes. Key Action Statement 5 specifies that clinicians should educate parents of infants with an IH about the condition, including the expected natural history, and its potential for causing complications or disfigurement (grade X, strong recommendation). Parents may be advised that most superficial IHs have a maximum growth potential between 1 and 3 months of age and that the majority of growth is complete by 5 months of age; during growth, clinicians should encourage parents to call, schedule an office visit, or share photographs of the IH if there are concerns about appearance, unexpectedly rapid growth, ulceration, bleeding, or pain. Parents should be advised that by age 5 to 12 months most IHs have stopped growing and are beginning to involute, and newer studies have demonstrated that 90% of IH involution is complete by 4 years of age.

### What low back pain is and why we need to pay attention [^113XbUP3]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Low back pain is a very common symptom. It occurs in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries and all age groups from children to the elderly population. Globally, years lived with disability caused by low back pain increased by 54% between 1990 and 2015, mainly because of population increase and ageing, with the biggest increase seen in low-income and middle-income countries. Low back pain is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. For nearly all people with low back pain, it is not possible to identify a specific nociceptive cause. Only a small proportion of people have a well understood pathological cause-eg, a vertebral fracture, malignancy, or infection. People with physically demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at greatest risk of reporting low back pain. Disabling low back pain is over-represented among people with low socioeconomic status. Most people with new episodes of low back pain recover quickly; however, recurrence is common and in a small proportion of people, low back pain becomes persistent and disabling. Initial high pain intensity, psychological distress, and accompanying pain at multiple body sites increases the risk of persistent disabling low back pain. Increasing evidence shows that central pain-modulating mechanisms and pain cognitions have important roles in the development of persistent disabling low back pain. Cost, health-care use, and disability from low back pain vary substantially between countries and are influenced by local culture and social systems, as well as by beliefs about cause and effect. Disability and costs attributed to low back pain are projected to increase in coming decades, in particular in low-income and middle-income countries, where health and other systems are often fragile and not equipped to cope with this growing burden. Intensified research efforts and global initiatives are clearly needed to address the burden of low back pain as a public health problem.

### Ethical concerns in the management of pain in the neonate [^112ovn4b]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

The debate about the management of pain in the neonate has continued to evolve over the past 30 years. This controversy can be understood as evolving through now three eras of thought about the effect of pain and its management in newborns and infants. The first generation was characterized by a widespread belief that newborns lacked the complete development of the neuroanatomical and neuroendocrine components necessary to perceive pain. During this period, newborns often received inadequate anesthesia and analgesia for painful procedures, if not no treatment at all. The second generation was heralded by research that demonstrated that newborns did demonstrate similar or even exaggerated physiological and hormonal responses to pain compared with those observed in older children and adults and that exposure to prolonged or severe pain may increase neonatal morbidity. Controversy in this generation focused around the dosage of analgesia to newborns as well as the risks and benefits of pain management techniques. We are now in a third generation of thought about pain in the neonate, defined by intense debate over the significance of a growing number of studies in immature animal models that demonstrate degenerative effects of several anesthetics on neuronal structure. The challenge of this era is to integrate the advances in diagnosis and treatment achieved in previous generations with ongoing adaptation of clinical practice as dictated by research advances in the field. In this review, we examine the evolution of medical thought and ethical concerns regarding pain treatment in the neonate.

### Suzetrigine approval breaks a 25-year silence: a new era in non-opioid acute pain management [^116DHd7p]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain management remains a critical priority in clinical practice. Meanwhile, traditional analgesics, including non-opioid and opioid medications, often pose substantial risks, including adverse effects and potential for addiction. The recent approval of Suzetrigine by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) represents a pivotal advancement in non-opioid analgesia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Suzetrigine, a selective NaV1.8 sodium channel inhibitor, provides effective pain relief by targeting peripheral pain pathways, minimizing the risk of addiction commonly associated with opioids, and has good safety profile according to clinical trials. Given the growing concerns surrounding opioid use, Suzetrigine offers a promising therapeutic alternative in acute pain management, with future research needed to assess its long-term effectiveness in diverse populations.

### Chronic musculoskeletal pain in children: assessment and management [^114P5yve]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Paediatricians and paediatric rheumatologists review a large number of children with ongoing pain (disease and non-disease related). A small number of these develop chronic pain conditions that are complex and distressing. Over recent years studies of the epidemiology, aetiology and rehabilitation of pain and pain-associated disability in children have revealed a large prevalence of clinically relevant pain, and have emphasized the need for early recognition and intervention. Medication has a role when part of a multidisciplinary framework, although there is little evidence for or against the effectiveness of most pharmacotherapy. There is strong evidence to support early targeted psychological and physical intervention, and an understanding that parental education and involvement is essential if progress is to be maintained. In this review, an overview of the assessment is presented and management of childhood chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions with reference to main research findings to date.

### Prevention of chronic pain after whiplash [^111DxHE2]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The acute whiplash injury is a significant health burden for patients and the healthcare system. Traditional approaches to treatment fail to resolve this ever growing medicolegal and social problem. A new biopsychosocial model of whiplash disorder encourages new ways of treating and preventing of the chronic disability. This biopsychosocial model takes into account the mechanism by which acute pain becomes chronic pain, and how this can be prevented. Specific education and treatments encourage a behaviour after whiplash injury that is conducive to more rapid recovery, and provides the whiplash patient with insight into the mediators of chronic pain. The article describes in practical terms how to use education, reassurance, a more judicious use of therapy, and exercise to achieve this goal. Practical guidelines are provided on educating the patient about other symptoms that may cause concern.

### Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome: a review-treatment and prognosis [^111ZTDW5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a primary reason for referrals to pediatric rheumatologists. It can be caused by a variety of inflammatory or non-inflammatory conditions, including arthritis, hypermobility, fibromyalgia (FM), growing pains and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome is a generic, descriptive term used to describe chronic pain syndromes of unconfirmed etiology, such as FM, CRPS and idiopathic musculoskeletal pain. For individuals with this syndrome, pain signals are augmented; thus, mildly painful and nonpainful stimuli are registered by the body as very painful, which leads to attempts to avoid the induction of pain, leading to functional disability.

Our previous review focused on CRPS. Yunus and Masi were the first to describe and use the term juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS), in a clinical study published in 1985, in which they suggested diagnostic criteria based on 33 juveniles ages 17 years or younger, who suffered from chronic pain.

JPFS is defined by chronic diffuse musculoskeletal aching and pain, which is the hallmark of this condition, and multiple predictable tender points. Part one of this review summarized the current information regarding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of JPFS. This part of the review focuses on treatment and prognosis.

### Prognosis… [^115XKV9r]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Growing pains are recurring pain symptoms that are relatively common in children aged 3 to 16. The pains normally appear at night and can affect the calf or thigh muscles of one or both legs. The pain usually stops on its own before morning. Growing pains are one of the most common causes of recurring pain in children. Although these pains reliably stop when the child has completely finished growing, it likely has nothing to do with growth. Signs and symptoms Growing pains usually affect both legs, especially the calf muscle in the lower leg or the muscles in the front of the thighs. Pain may also occur in the ankle muscles and tops of the feet. Less commonly, the arms are affected. The pain is frequently, but not always, felt on both sides, simultaneously. Typically, the pains are felt in the muscles, rather than in the joints. The amount of pain can vary from mild to quite severe. The pains most often begin in the evening or at night.

When the pains appear while the child is sleeping, they often wake the child up at night. The pains can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours or more, and are usually, but not always, gone by morning. Typically, the pains appear once or twice each week, but can occur more or less frequently. The pains are not in the same place as an injury, including overuse injuries such as shin splints, and the child does not limp while walking. Cause The causes of growing pains are unknown. They are not associated with growth spurts, and some authors suggest alternative terms as providing a more accurate description, such as recurrent limb pain in childhood, paroxysmal nocturnal pains, or benign idiopathic paroxysmal nocturnal limb pains of childhood.

Theories of causation include:

- poor posture or other mechanical or anatomical defects, such as joint hypermobility;
- vascular perfusion disorder,
- lower pain threshold or a Amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome,
- tiredness, perhaps especially among children with weaker bones than average who have overexerted themselves; and
- psychological factors, such as stress within the family. Some parents are able to associate episodes of pain with physical exercise or mood changes in the child. Diagnosis This diagnosis is normally made by considering the information presented by the child and family members, and by doing a physical exam to make sure that the child seems to be otherwise healthy. When the child has the typical symptoms and appears to be healthy, then laboratory investigations to exclude other diagnoses is not warranted. When a child has growing pains, there are no objective clinical signs of inflammation, such as swollen joints.

Children with growing pains do not have signs of any systemic diseases, any abnormal pain sensations, tender spots, or joint disorders. Children do not have growing pains if the pain worsens over time, persists during the daytime, only involves one limb, or is located in a joint. It should be excluded if the child is limping, loses the ability to walk, or has physical signs that suggest other medical conditions. Childhood-onset restless legs syndrome is sometimes misdiagnosed as growing pains. Other possible causes of pain in the limbs include injuries, infections, benign tumors such as osteoid osteoma, malignant tumors such as osteosarcoma, and problems that affect the shape and function of the legs, such as genu valgum. Treatment Parents and children can be substantially reassured by explaining the benign and self-limiting nature of the pains.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^112J5woq]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic pain has been notoriously defined as the pain that lasts longer than the usual course of an acute injury or disease or the pain that recurs for months or years. The value of this definition is its ability to describe all the conditions that can be defined as chronic pain even if it does not refer to the impairment brought about by the pain, the presence of specific symptoms, and the supposed etiologic framework. This is also because chronic pain is a term employed to define several diverse conditions whose common feature is the presence of persistent pain.

According to a 2014 study on the global burden of chronic pain, at least 10% of the world's population is affected by a chronic pain condition and every year, an additional 1 in 10 people develops chronic pain. Even if these data are confirmed also for the low-income and middle-income countries, the unequal distribution of risk factors and pain management options leads the most disadvantaged to bear higher burdens of persistent pain and less effective treatment. A 2012 study of the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health shows that nearly 50 million American adults have chronic or severe pain; according to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, in the USA, pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. The data from Europe present similar results: the 2006 enquiry on the prevalence of chronic pain shows that 19% of adult Europeans are affected by this condition, seriously compromising their quality of life.

### Perspectives on the clinical significance of functional pain syndromes in children [^113P7kcU]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

In both the clinic and in the domain of research

Pick a name: Decide on proper, nonjudgmental nomenclature that destigmatizes these conditions, such as the proposed term, primary pain disorders.
All use the same name: Ensure that this nomenclature is implemented across specialists to ensure clinicians treating these patients and researchers studying these patients are speaking a common language.
Put some of these theories to the test: It is possible that patients with the same symptom presentation may actually have different drivers that serve to maintain their condition, thus perhaps it is worthwhile to group patients not by their phenotype (eg, abdominal pain) but rather the underlying mechanism (eg, neuronal sensitization) to formulate treatment recommendations and new research hypotheses. The use of "big data" can also aid this effort.

In closing, the momentum is building to garner better answers and treatment for children with FPS, and there are many reasons to believe it will only get better. With this being said, FPS should become a high-priority topic for future research.

### Pain as a disease: an overview [^1143stA2]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The acknowledgment of pain as a pathologic entity in its own right remains debated. Notwithstanding the data showing the burden of pain as a disease, an ultimate recognition of the pathologic nature of this condition is lacking. In this study, we analyze the notion of pain as a disease through an historical overview of its several conceptualizations and report the main evidence supporting this notion. We believe that a clear definition of pain as a disease is necessary, especially considering the enormous global burden of this condition. Indeed, the recognition of pain as a definite pathologic state is crucial to raise awareness about this neglected global health problem and to promote the exploration of new specific therapeutic approaches.

### A psychosocial approach to female genital pain [^116rW6Tg]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Genital pain is a prevalent, complex, and disabling health concern in women. Efforts to study this chronic pain condition have been complicated by the fact that genital pain is heterogeneous and exists at the intersection of different biopsychosocial disciplines. Thus, organization of theoretical ideas and empirical findings across research areas is required to improve our understanding of how biopsychosocial factors affect the development and maintenance of the pain, the reporting of symptoms, and the choice of treatment. In the past, the study of physical markers has received the most research attention; an assimilation of the psychosocial variables underlying genital pain is, therefore, particularly needed to inform the field about the rapidly growing literature and stimulate interdisciplinary work. Current research lacks specificity, fails to capture the unique features of different pain conditions, and yields conflicting evidence, which makes it difficult to draw uniform conclusions. Although considerable advances have been made, confusion remains at the nosological, aetiological, theoretical, methodological, and treatment levels. This lack of consensus has important theoretical and clinical implications because inconsistent criteria and empirical disagreement can lead to misdiagnoses and interfere with the development of sound theoretical models and effective treatments to manage female genital pain and its physical and psychological sequelae.

### Growing pains in children [^113UxxKk]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Family environment

Naish and Apley assumed that emotional disturbances are more common in children with GP, and that recurrent abdominal pain, headaches, and limb pains are a group of pain syndromes expressing a reactive pattern to familial emotional disturbances. Oster suggested that painful experiences during the parents' childhood are a precipitating factor for development of a pain syndrome among their children. In a study by Oberklaid et al, children with musculoskeletal pains (without the homogenous criteria of GP used for our studies) were often rated by their parents as having different temperamental and behavioral profiles than healthy normal controls, suggesting a psychosocial contribution to their pain, similar to that seen with other pain syndromes. In others studies, the family environment and psychological distress were also found to contribute to the development of musculoskeletal pain syndromes.

We evaluated the quality of life, depression, and anxiety levels of parents to children with GP and found that the depression levels of the parents were similar to those from other non-inflammatory pain syndromes, with mothers having increased depression levels. Parents of children with GP and children without pain had similar quality of life scores, not surprising considering the episodic nature of GP.

### Virtual reality as an analgesic for acute and chronic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ASV2h]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain management is a growing health-care concern in the US. An estimated 100 million adults in the US suffer from chronic pain, and approximately $17.8 billion is spent prescribing pain medication annually. Historically, opioid medications have been used for pain management, but there are negative side effects associated with opioid use, including a potential delay in recovery and increased risk of permanent disability. In addition, opioid use has been associated with increased hospital admissions, increased health-care costs, and deaths. Even with these risks and health-care burdens, the US consumes 80% of the world's opioids. Alternative pain management strategies are important to consider in an effort to mitigate some of these risks.

A growing body of evidence supports VR as an alternative strategy for management of acute, burn, and experimental pain in adults and children.–Additional experiments demonstrated the positive effect of virtual reality (VR) on pain during a variety of medical procedures including chemotherapy-and wound care. Other studies also support VR as an adjunct to pain medications. Furthermore, evidence from systematic reviews-conclude that VR is effective in the management of acute pain associated with medical procedures, wound debridement, and experimental pain.

Despite emerging evidence, consensus on the effectiveness of VR on chronic pain remains inconclusive. The most recent systematic review on VR both in acute and in chronic pain was performed over 8 years ago. A number of the studies included in that review are less applicable to the clinical setting because they explored the impact of VR on experimental pain, including painful thermal and pressure stimulation. Furthermore, much of the research has focused on children, which limits generalizability to adult populations. Finally, VR technology can be expensive and nonportable. However, the emergence of more affordable devices such as head mounted displays (HMD) has made VR more feasible for clinical use. Given these concerns, an updated systematic review comparing acute and chronic pain in adults is warranted.

The purpose of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of VR in reducing acute and chronic pain in adults compared to standard care without VR or to a sham treatment of nonVR.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^114a5YPi]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Untreated needle pain and needle fear can have profound consequences

The World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines (2015) state that the lack of analgesic provision for vaccination pain is inexcusable. Yet, pain caused by 'minor' procedures can all-too-frequently be dismissed as inconsequential — ignoring the fact that when repeated over weeks, months and years, each momentary pain experience is compounded and highly traumatic. What can be presented as 'just one poke' can have profound and lasting consequences on personal and public health. For example, our co-author who experienced childhood bone cancer articulately describes how healthcare professionals can trivialise or dismiss pain caused by routine medical procedures because it is assumed that her early life trauma means she is more able to tolerate pain — this is not true and can negatively impact the clinician-patient alliance.

A serious consequence of untreated vaccination pain is the establishment or exacerbation of needle fear, where 20–50% of adolescents report fear of needles. Needle fear can delay or prevent the uptake of essential medical procedures and is a leading cause of vaccine hesitancy in ~ 20% of the under-vaccinated population. In the UK, while the number of vaccinations offered to children is increasing, uptake of vaccinations is decreasing. This trend is concerning, especially considering that children from lower socio-economic groups, Black and Asian communities, and girls are less likely to be vaccinated. The consequences of falling vaccination rates can be profound, as exemplified by the recent UK measles crisis, in which measles vaccination has now dropped below the 95% needed to protect the population. A lack of vaccine uptake for measles has resulted in unvaccinated symptomatic children and their siblings being told they cannot attend school for up to 21 days and cannot have contact with vulnerable people, despite the dire consequences of these actions, already exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. If pain caused by vaccination prevents a single family from vaccinating their children, this is difficult to defend, as we have the tools to provide effective pain relief. The regular contact between healthcare professionals, children, and their families during routine vaccinations provides an opportunity to demonstrate best practices to manage pain and reduce needle-related fear. Furthermore, acknowledging and appropriately treating pain enables children to be actively involved in their care, gives them a sense of control, creates better memories of their experiences, and provides them with skills to cope with future pain.

### Current practices of health care providers in recommending online resources for chronic pain self-management [^116CQDe5]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Plain language summary

There is a growing gap between the number of people with persistent pain and the number of people who can be seen in a timely manner by pain management services. One way to bridge the gap could be by providing education via online resources such as websites, apps and social media. We conducted an online survey of health care providers in New Zealand. We asked about their background, their current practice in recommending online resources to their clients, what resources they recommend, and what concerns they have with recommending online resources. The main findings were:
About half of the respondents (111/210) recommend online resources.
Respondents who had a specialist interest in pain, and higher confidence in recommending online resources were more likely to be recommending online resources.
Many respondents were concerned about the safety issues related to the risk of clients misinterpreting online information and to the lack of evidence-based resources.

Increasing the opportunities for ongoing education on evidence-based online resources is required for health care providers. In addition, having access to a curated repository of online resources will help them to feel confident in recommending online resources as a tool for supporting self-management in people with persistent pain.

### Pediatric pain management: the multidisciplinary approach [^111Vtmaq]. Journal of Pain Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a growing problem among children and adolescents, with some epidemiological studies indicating that approximately 30% of children and adolescents experience pain that lasts for 3 months or longer. The most common pediatric chronic pain complaints include migraine, recurrent abdominal pain, and general musculoskeletal pain, including limb pain and back pain.–Chronic pain is often associated with functional disability. In the pediatric population this disability most frequently manifests as school impairment, difficulty maintaining social contacts, decreased participation in recreational activities, impairments in health related quality of life, and an increase in health care utilization.–As a result, these patients exact high costs on the health care system. Clinch and Eccleston described childhood chronic pain as "a modern public health disaster".

This complex health problem requires comprehensive treatment approaches. In recent years, multidisciplinary pediatric pain rehabilitation centers have gained increasing support as the treatment of choice for chronic pain conditions. Multidisciplinary teams typically consist of multiple providers of varying specialties who work together to assess and develop a treatment plan for a patient and his or her family. Typical disciplines include medicine, psychology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, and psychiatry, sometimes in conjunction with alternative medicine practitioners (eg, acupuncture, massage therapy, etc). This treatment approach should be differentiated from the interdisciplinary model, which is also comprised of several different specialists but who work together under a more fluid structure with flexible collaboration and shared treatment goals, which in the case of chronic pain programs, typically emphasize functional restoration. From this point forward, the term "multidisciplinary" will be used to encompass both treatment approaches.

Although pain is one of the most prevalent and bothersome symptoms children with cancer experience, evidence-based guidance regarding assessment and management is lacking. With 44 international, multidisciplinary healthcare professionals and nine patient representatives, we aimed to develop a clinical practice guideline (following GRADE methodology), addressing assessment and pharmacological, psychological, and physical management of tumor-, treatment-, and procedure-related pain in children with cancer. In this paper, we present our thorough methodology for this development, including the challenges we faced and how we approached these. This lays the foundation for our clinical practice guideline, for which there is a high clinical demand.

### Pain management in pediatrics: what the IR has to offer [^116QLTuy]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric pain management presents unique challenges due to the intrinsic characteristics of children such as their developmental stages, communication barriers, and varying pain perceptions. Life-limiting conditions affecting children are a growing medical concern, requiring a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life or ensure a dignified end of life. Interventional radiology (IR) plays a critical role in this strategy, similar to its role in adult care. Not only life-limiting conditions pose a challenge in pediatric chronic pain management, but also other benign chronic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders). This review focuses on specific IR strategies for pediatric pain management, including ablation, embolization/chemoembolization, and nerve blocks. It emphasizes the importance of tailored approaches for pediatric patients, considering genetic disorders and oncological diseases, which may require a diverse range of IR treatments. The aim is to provide a summary of these interventional techniques and highlight the unique considerations necessary for effective pediatric pain management.

### Growing pains in children [^111NoEMB]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A 6 year-old boy is awakened at 02:00 AM, screaming of painful legs. His parents appreciate severe pain, but do not see anything wrong with his legs. They rub his legs and give him acetaminophen and he returns to sleep with pain resolution within 30 minutes. In the morning he is running about as if nothing occurred at night. The following week he has a similar episode. This causes significant anxiety in the family, and they immediately visit the primary physician.

The family worries. What does he have? Is this a serious disease? A tumor?

What should the family physician do?

In this paper we will review the clinical presentation of this very common pain syndrome, try to understand current knowledge on the pathogenesis and natural course, what the family physician should do, especially in alleviating the family's anxiety.

Extremity pain is a common presenting complaint of visits to pediatricians. The most common cause of childhood musculoskeletal pain is termed "growing pains" (GP) that exemplifies a type of non-inflammatory pain syndrome. These pains are much more common than all other inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The prevalence of GP ranges from 3–37% of children. Oster found that as many as 15% of school-age children have occasional limb pain, and recently Evans and Scutter in a very large community study in Australia reported a prevalence of 37% in children aged 4–6 years. GP mainly affects children between the ages of 3–12 years.

GP has typical clinical characteristics; it is usually nonarticular, in 2/3 of children is located in the shins, calves, thighs or popliteal fossa and is almost always bilateral. The pain usually appears late in the day or is nocturnal, often awaking the child. The duration ranges from minutes to hours. The intensity can be mild or very severe. By morning the child is almost always pain free. There are no objective signs of inflammation on physical examination. GP is episodic, with pain-free intervals from days to months. In severe cases the pain can occur daily. In our series of 44 children with GP, 43% had frequency of at least once a week. Often parents can predict when the child will have pain on days of increased activity or when the child is more moody.

### Isotretinoin (Amnesteem) [^113kJNuX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of Amnesteem?

Amnesteem can cause birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby, and early (premature) births. See "What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?"
Amnesteem may cause serious mental health problems. See "What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?"
serious brain problems. Amnesteem can increase the pressure in your brain. This can lead to permanent loss of eyesight and, in rare cases, death. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you get any of these signs of increased brain pressure:
bad headache
blurred vision
dizziness
nausea or vomiting
seizures (convulsions)
stroke
skin problems. Skin rash can occur in patients taking Amnesteem. In some patients a rash can be serious. Stop using Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you develop conjunctivitis (red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye"), a rash with a fever, blisters on legs, arms or face and/or sores in your mouth, throat, nose, eyes, or if your skin begins to peel.
stomach area (abdomen) problems. Certain symptoms may mean that your internal organs are being damaged. These organs include the liver, pancreas, bowel (intestines), and esophagus (connection between mouth and stomach). If your organs are damaged, they may not get better even after you stop taking Amnesteem. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor if you get:
severe stomach, chest or bowel pain
trouble swallowing or painful swallowing
new or worsening heartburn
diarrhea
rectal bleeding
yellowing of your skin or eyes

### Paul goodman… [^114WSYH1]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

His 1960 book of social criticism, Growing Up Absurd, established his importance as a mainstream, antiestablishment cultural theorist. Goodman became known as "the philosopher of the New Left" and his anarchistic disposition was influential in 1960s counterculture and the free school movement. Despite being the foremost American intellectual of non-Marxist radicalism in his time, his celebrity did not endure far beyond his life. Goodman is remembered for his utopian proposals and principled belief in human potential. Goodman's insolvent father abandoned the family prior to his birth, making Paul their fourth and last child, after Alice and Percival. Their mother worked as a women's clothes traveling saleswoman, which left young Paul to be raised mostly by his aunts and sister in New York City's Washington Heights, with petty bourgeois values.

By 1946, Goodman was a popular yet "marginal" figure in New York bohemia, and he began to participate in psychoanalytic therapy with Alexander Lowen. Through contact with the eminent analyst Wilhelm Reich, he began a self-psychoanalysis. Around the same time, Goodman and his brother, the architect Percival, wrote Communitas. It argued that rural and urban living had not been functionally integrated and became known as a major work of urban planning following Goodman's eventual celebrity. Mid-decade, Goodman entered a life crisis when publishers did not want his epic novel The Empire City, a new lay therapist licensing law excluded Goodman, and his daughter contracted polio. He embarked to Europe in 1958 where, through reflections on American social ills and respect for Swiss patriotism, Goodman became zealously concerned with improving America.

Social criticism Goodman's 1960 study of alienated youth in America, Growing Up Absurd, established his importance as a mainstream cultural theorist and pillar of leftist thought during the counterculture. Released to moderate acclaim, it became the major book by which 1960s American youth understood themselves. The book of social criticism assured the young that they were right to feel disaffected about growing up into a society without meaningful community, spirit, sex, or work. While continuing to lecture, Goodman participated in the 1960s counterculture war protests and draft resistance, including the first mass draft-card burning. Goodman's son, a Cornell University student, was also active in draft resistance and was under investigation by the FBI before his accidental mountaineering death in 1967, which launched Goodman into a prolonged depression. Vanguardist groups turned on Goodman towards the end of the decade.

Believing his politics to stifle their revolutionary fervor, they began to heckle and vilify him. Goodman, who enjoyed polemics, was undeterred by their words but dispirited by the movement's turn towards insurrectionary politics. In the early 70s, Goodman wrote works that summarized his experience, such as New Reformation and Little Prayers & Finite Experience. Goodman's intellectual development followed three phases. His experience in marginal subcommunities, small anarchist publications, and bohemian New York City through the 1940s formed his core, radical principles, such as decentralization and pacifism. His first transformation was in psychological theory, as Goodman moved past the theories of Wilhelm Reich to develop Gestalt therapy with Fritz Perls. Politics and social thought Goodman was most famous as a political thinker and social critic.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^115pSp1h]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome is highly complex and given the large number of potential signs and symptoms, it can be challenging to diagnose. There is no gold standard radiological, laboratory, genetic, or electrical diagnostic test for CRPS. Over time, several clinical tools specifying signs and symptoms have been developed; however, they vary in their description of the disease. Having clear diagnostic criteria would allow clinicians to identify the disease accurately and initiate appropriate treatments. A screening tool would further allow clinicians to expedite access to treatments and referrals to specialists. From a research lens, a consensus on diagnostic criteria would aid in defining study populations, allowing comparisons between studies.

The primary objective was to identify and summarize the measurement properties and feasibility of screening and diagnostic tools for CRPS in all ages. A secondary objective was to identify and summarize screening and diagnostic tools used for CRPS in children and adolescents up to 21 years of age.

### Growing pains: a study of 30 cases and a review of the literature [^112r6SwP]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Data from the literature regarding the clinical profile of growing pains are limited. The purpose of this study was to define the clinical features, familial history, laboratory findings, and therapeutic outcome of growing pains in children.

Methods

Thirty children (18 male and 12 female; 3 to 14 y of age) who presented with growing pains between January 2006 and December 2007 were enrolled and prospectively followed up for 1 year. The inclusion criterion was lower extremity pain, which was recurrent and lasted for > 3 months. The exclusion criteria were any abnormal systemic or local symptoms and signs, joint involvement, and limp or limitation of activity. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum calcium and phosphorus levels, were performed in all children.

Results

The study group had pain during the night and afternoon in 43.3% and 56.7% of cases, respectively. Both lower limbs were involved in 80% of cases, causing awakening and crying episodes in 40% and 37% of cases, respectively. The frequency of pain was as follows: daily, 5%; weekly, 45%; monthly, 35%; and every 3 months, 15%. The pains were relieved by massaging the affected site in 95% of cases and by analgesics in 5% of children. A family history of growing pains was positive in 20% of patients. All patients had laboratory tests within normal values.

Conclusion

Growing pain is a frequent noninflammatory syndrome consisting of intermittent, often annoying, pains that affect the lower extremities of children. Clinical diagnosis is easy if precise inclusion and exclusion criteria in the history and physical examinations are strictly followed. Patients and family reassurance is mandatory.

Level Of Evidence

This is a Level I prospective study.
