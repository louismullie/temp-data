## Question

Appendix removal Mounjaro

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Mounjaro (tirzepatide) affects the need for, timing of, or perioperative management of appendix removal (appendectomy). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether tirzepatide has any direct pharmacologic effect on the appendix or appendicitis risk. Then, I should verify whether tirzepatide changes surgical indications or timing for appendectomy. Next, I will examine perioperative considerations, especially gastric emptying and aspiration risk. After that, I need to check for any indirect effects that could mimic appendicitis or complicate diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and confirm there are no overlooked contraindications or special precautions in the FDA labeling that would change management.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled risks. Tirzepatide is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist that slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite, and improves glycemic control; it does not have a direct effect on the appendix or on appendiceal inflammation, and there is no mention of appendicitis or appendix-related adverse effects in the FDA labeling or major safety summaries, which instead emphasize gastrointestinal adverse effects, gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, and aspiration risk around anesthesia [^920d7e65] [^998d2f85] [^5548377b].

> Wait, let me verify the surgical indications and timing. Appendectomy decisions are driven by clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, imaging findings, and patient-specific factors; there is no evidence that tirzepatide alters the diagnostic threshold, the need for surgery, or the urgency of operative management, and contemporary surgical guidelines do not list GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 agonists as factors modifying indications or timing for appendectomy [^6ba9acd7] [^35429af2].

> I will now examine perioperative considerations, because this is where tirzepatide could matter. Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying, and there are rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration during elective procedures despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting; the FDA explicitly instructs patients to inform healthcare providers before planned surgeries or procedures, and available data are insufficient to define a specific fasting or discontinuation strategy, so I should confirm that anesthesia teams are notified early and consider aspiration precautions rather than assume standard fasting is adequate [^920d7e65] [^998d2f85] [^5548377b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping the drug. I initially thought to recommend holding tirzepatide for a fixed interval before surgery, but I should double-check the label; the FDA does not provide a mandated preoperative hold period, so any decision to pause tirzepatide should be individualized and coordinated with anesthesia and surgery, balancing aspiration risk against glycemic and weight-management needs, and documenting shared decision-making if continued perioperatively [^920d7e65] [^998d2f85].

> Next, I should review indirect effects that could complicate diagnosis or recovery. Tirzepatide commonly causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, which could overlap with appendicitis symptoms and potentially delay recognition; however, this is a diagnostic challenge rather than a change in surgical indications, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion while using standard diagnostic pathways and imaging when appendicitis is suspected [^c5360781] [^6ba9acd7].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications. There are no specific tirzepatide-related contraindications to appendectomy, and no dose adjustments are required for renal or hepatic impairment; the main perioperative caution remains delayed gastric emptying and aspiration risk, which should be managed proactively with anesthesia consultation and aspiration precautions rather than altering the surgical plan itself [^3cc4cb1c] [^920d7e65].

> I should confirm practical recommendations. For patients on tirzepatide who need an appendectomy, I would inform the anesthesia team in advance about delayed gastric emptying, consider aspiration precautions such as rapid sequence induction and appropriate postoperative monitoring, and coordinate any temporary holding of tirzepatide based on clinical judgment and local protocols; I would not delay indicated surgery solely due to tirzepatide use, and I would continue standard appendicitis care pathways with imaging and antibiotics as indicated [^920d7e65] [^6ba9acd7].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: tirzepatide does not directly affect the appendix or change the indications or timing for appendectomy, but it does create a perioperative aspiration risk due to delayed gastric emptying; therefore, the key management step is proactive anesthesia planning and communication, with individualized decisions about temporary discontinuation rather than any change in surgical indications or urgency [^920d7e65] [^998d2f85] [^6ba9acd7].

---

Mounjaro (tirzepatide) **does not directly affect the appendix** or increase the risk of appendicitis. However, it can **delay gastric emptying** [^920d7e65], which may complicate anesthesia and increase aspiration risk during appendectomy [^998d2f85]. Surgeons and anesthesiologists should be informed of Mounjaro use preoperatively, and **temporary discontinuation may be considered** to reduce aspiration risk, though there is no definitive guidance on timing. There is no evidence that Mounjaro increases appendicitis risk or alters surgical management.

---

## Pharmacological effects of Mounjaro relevant to appendectomy

Mounjaro is a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist that **slows gastric emptying** [^d6bb135b], which can leave residual gastric contents despite fasting and increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia [^998d2f85]. This is the primary perioperative concern, not direct effects on the appendix itself.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding Mounjaro and appendectomy

There is **no direct clinical evidence** linking Mounjaro to an increased risk of appendicitis or to specific perioperative complications unique to appendectomy. The main concern is delayed gastric emptying and aspiration risk, which is a known class effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists [^998d2f85].

---

## Perioperative considerations and recommendations

Given the risk of delayed gastric emptying, the following **perioperative considerations** are recommended:

- **Preoperative communication**: Patients should inform their surgical and anesthesia teams about Mounjaro use well in advance of scheduled procedures [^920d7e65].

- **Temporary discontinuation**: Consider holding Mounjaro before elective surgery, but there is no definitive guidance on timing; decisions should be individualized based on patient risk, dose, and procedural urgency [^998d2f85].

- **Aspiration precautions**: Anesthesia teams should employ aspiration precautions, such as rapid sequence induction, even if fasting guidelines are met [^notfound].

- **Postoperative resumption**: Mounjaro can typically be resumed postoperatively once the patient is eating normally and there is no concern for aspiration or gastrointestinal complications.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus emphasize the need for **individualized perioperative management** of patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Mounjaro. There are no specific guidelines for appendectomy, but general principles include:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate patient-specific factors such as dose, duration of therapy, and procedural risk.

- **Multidisciplinary coordination**: Involve surgery, anesthesia, and endocrinology teams in decision-making.

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential perioperative risks and the rationale for temporary discontinuation.

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Clinical consideration** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Direct effect on appendix | No evidence of direct effect or increased appendicitis risk |
| Gastric emptying delay | Well-documented class effect increasing aspiration risk |
| Perioperative management | Individualized; consider temporary discontinuation and aspiration precautions |
| Clinical guidelines | No specific appendectomy guidelines; general GLP-1 RA principles apply |

---

Mounjaro does not directly affect the appendix or increase appendicitis risk, but its **delayed gastric emptying** can complicate anesthesia and increase aspiration risk during appendectomy. Surgeons and anesthesiologists should be informed, and temporary discontinuation may be considered, though timing is not definitive.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. (7.2)

7.1 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g. Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin

When initiating MOUNJARO, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

7.2 Oral Medications

MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Caution should be exercised when oral medications are concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO.

Monitor patients on oral medications dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy and those with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin) when concomitantly administered with MOUNJARO.

Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO. Hormonal contraceptives that are not administered orally should not be affected [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

Data

Animal Data

In pregnant rats given twice weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg tirzepatide (0.03-, 0.07-, and 0.5-fold the MRHD of 15 mg once weekly based on AUC) during organogenesis, increased incidences of external, visceral, and skeletal malformations, increased incidences of visceral and skeletal developmental variations, and decreased fetal weights coincided with pharmacologically-mediated reductions in maternal body weights and food consumption at 0.5 mg/kg. In pregnant rabbits given once weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03, or 0.1 mg/kg tirzepatide (0.01-, 0.06-, and 0.2-fold the MRHD) during organogenesis, pharmacologically-mediated effects on the gastrointestinal system resulting in maternal mortality or abortion in a few rabbits occurred at all dose levels. Reduced fetal weights associated with decreased maternal food consumption and body weights were observed at 0.1 mg/kg. In a pre- and post-natal study in rats administered subcutaneous doses of 0.02, 0.10, or 0.25 mg/kg tirzepatide twice weekly from implantation through lactation, F1pups from F0maternal rats given 0.25 mg/kg tirzepatide had statistically significant lower mean body weight when compared to controls from post-natal day 7 through post-natal day 126 for males and post-natal day 56 for females.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tirzepatide in animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for MOUNJARO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from MOUNJARO or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Use of MOUNJARO may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives due to delayed gastric emptying. This delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes over time. Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin

Patients receiving MOUNJARO in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.

5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported in patients treated with MOUNJARO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of MOUNJARO; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with MOUNJARO.

5.5 Acute Kidney Injury Due to Volume Depletion

There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, in some cases requiring hemodialysis, in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, or MOUNJARO [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The majority of the reported events occurred in patients who experienced gastrointestinal adverse reactions leading to dehydration such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to MOUNJARO that could lead to volume depletion, especially during dosage initiation and escalation of MOUNJARO.

5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

Use of MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO (5 mg 1.3%, 10 mg 0.4%, 15 mg 1.2%) than placebo (0.9%).

MOUNJARO is not recommended in patients with severe gastroparesis.

Acute Gallbladder Disease

Inform patients of the risk of acute gallbladder disease. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider for appropriate clinical follow-up if gallbladder disease is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

Inform patients that MOUNJARO may cause their stomach to empty more slowly which may lead to complications with anesthesia or deep sedation during planned surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking MOUNJARO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Pregnancy

Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise women to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Contraception

Use of MOUNJARO may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Administration

Instruct patients how to prepare and administer the correct dose of MOUNJARO and assess their ability to inject subcutaneously to ensure the proper administration of MOUNJARO. Instruct patients using the single-dose vial to use a syringe appropriate for dose administration (e.g., a 1 mL syringe capable of measuring a 0.5 mL dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Missed Doses

Inform patients if a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible within 4 days after the missed dose. If more than 4 days have passed, the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose should be administered on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, inform patients to resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

12.6 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the trials described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other trials.

During the 40- to 104-week treatment periods with ADA sampling conducted up to 44 to 108 weeks in seven clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14)], 51% (2,570/5,025) of MOUNJARO-treated patients developed anti-tirzepatide antibodies. In these trials, anti-tirzepatide antibody formation in 34% and 14% of MOUNJARO-treated patients showed cross-reactivity to native GIP or native GLP-1, respectively.

Of the 2,570 MOUNJARO-treated patients who developed anti-tirzepatide antibodies during the treatment periods in these seven trials, 2% and 2% developed neutralizing antibodies against tirzepatide activity on the GIP or GLP-1 receptors, respectively, and 0.9% and 0.4% developed neutralizing antibodies against native GIP or GLP-1, respectively.

There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-tirzepatide antibodies on pharmacokinetics or effectiveness of MOUNJARO. More MOUNJARO-treated patients who developed anti-tirzepatide antibodies experienced hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions than those who did not develop these antibodies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Pool of Two Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials

The data in Table 1 are derived from 2 placebo-controlled trials [1 monotherapy trial (SURPASS-1) and 1 trial in combination with basal insulin with or without metformin (SURPASS-5)] in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.4)]. These data reflect exposure of 718 patients to MOUNJARO and a mean duration of exposure to MOUNJARO of 36.6 weeks. The mean age of patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 54% were male. The population was 57% White, 27% Asian, 13% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3% Black or African American; 25% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 9.1 years with a mean HbA1c of 8.1%. As assessed by baseline fundoscopic examination, 13% of the population had retinopathy. At baseline, eGFR was ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² in 53%, 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m² in 39%, 45 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m² in 7%, and 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m² in 1% of patients.

Subgroup analyses of follow-up durations

The efficacy of GLP-1RA drugs can be affected by the follow-up duration. We categorised follow-up durations into short term (3–6 months), medium term (6–12 months), and long term (> 12 months), and conducted subgroup analyses to address this issue. The efficacy of tirzepatide in lowering concentrations of HbA 1c and fasting blood glucose, and lowering body weight was directly proportional to the length of follow-up duration (appendix 15). Semaglutide and exenatide kept relatively steady efficacy on HbA 1c with different follow-up durations.

Of note, several GLP-1RAs showed a gradual decline in effects on body weight throughout the long term intervention. In comparison to placebo, semaglutide resulted in a reduction of body weight from a mean difference of −3.28 kg (95% confidence interval −4.20 to −2.37) with medium term intervention to −2.75 kg (−4.60 to −0.89) with long term intervention. Liraglutide and dulaglutide also showed a similar trend (appendix 15). These results indicate potential limitations of GLP-1RAs for sustained long term weight loss efforts.

Subgroup analyses of single versus dual or triple agonists

We conducted subgroup analyses of single versus dual or triple agonists. The specific drug classification can be found in table S2.2. Evidence synthesis indicated that dual agonists (tirzepatide, mazdutide, and CagriSema) and triple agonists (retatrutide) displayed overall better efficacy than regular GLP-1RA drugs in reducing HbA 1c concentrations, fasting blood glucose concentrations, and body weight (appendix 16). These four dual or triple agonists are all newly developed in the past few years, showing a new trend of drug development in this field.

Risk Summary

Available data with MOUNJARO use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-related risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to tirzepatide during pregnancy. MOUNJARO should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

In pregnant rats administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions and fetal abnormalities occurred at clinical exposure in maternal rats based on AUC. In rabbits administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions were observed at clinically relevant exposures based on AUC. These adverse embryo/fetal effects in animals coincided with pharmacological effects on maternal weight and food consumption (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6–10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7% and has been reported to be as high as 20–25% in women with an HbA1c > 10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.

HbA1c

A total of 40 studies (26,490 patients) were included in the main analysis evaluating the change from baseline in HbA1c. Pairwise meta-analysis results are presented in Supplementary Appendix S6.1. Network meta-analysis results are presented in Fig. 3 a, Table 1 and Supplementary Appendix S7. All innovative GLP-1RA-based treatment strategies significantly reduced HbA1c compared to placebo. Tirzepatide 15 mg ranked first in terms of HbA1c lowering efficacy (6 studies, 1320 patients, MD −2.00%, 95% CI [−2.22; −1.78], high certainty). The HbA1c lowering efficacy of tirzepatide 15 mg and 10 mg was comparable (10 studies, 4553 patients, MD −0.14, 95% CI [−0.31; 0.04], moderate certainty), while tirzepatide 15 mg was superior to tirzepatide 5 mg (9 studies, 3941 patients, MD −0.37%, 95% CI [−0.56; −0.18], moderate certainty), iDegLira (MD −0.40%, 95% CI [−0.66; −0.14], low certainty), iGlarLixi (MD −0.48%, 95% CI [−0.75; −0.21], low certainty), GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination (MD −0.69%, 95% CI [−1.07; −0.30], low certainty), and high-dose GLP-1RA (vs. semaglutide 2 mg MD −0.81%, 95% CI [−1.40; −0.23], low certainty; vs. dulaglutide 4.5 mg MD −0.89%, 95% CI [−1.31; −0.48], low certainty; vs. dulaglutide 3 mg MD −1.00, 95% CI [−1.41; −0.59], low certainty), as shown in Table 1. Tirzepatide 10 mg was superior to all other treatments except tirzepatide 15 mg and iDegLira. The efficacy of tirzepatide 5 mg, GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination, semaglutide 2 mg, iDegLira and iGlarLixi was comparable, while dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 3 mg was less effective compared to tirzepatide and GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC but still comparable to the rest of the above treatments in reducing HbA1c. All the latest GLP-1RA-based treatment strategies but high-dose GLP-1RA were more efficacious than basal insulin, while no significant difference was found with basal bolus insulin therapy.

Drug Interactions Studies

Potential for Tirzepatide to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs

In vitro studies have shown low potential for tirzepatide to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit drug transporters.

MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

The impact of tirzepatide on gastric emptying was greatest after a single dose of 5 mg and diminished after subsequent doses.

Following a first dose of tirzepatide 5 mg, acetaminophen maximum concentration (Cmax) was reduced by 50%, and the median peak plasma concentration (tmax) occurred 1 hour later. After coadministration at week 4, there was no meaningful impact on acetaminophen Cmaxand tmax. Overall acetaminophen exposure (AUC0-24hr) was not influenced.

Following administration of a combined oral contraceptive (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.25 mg norgestimate) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide 5 mg, mean Cmaxof ethinyl estradiol, norgestimate, and norelgestromin was reduced by 59%,66%, and 55%, while mean AUC was reduced by 20%, 21%, and 23%, respectively. A delay in tmaxof 2.5 to 4.5 hours was observed.

Acute Gallbladder Disease

In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, acute gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, biliary colic and cholecystectomy) was reported by 0.6% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Dysesthesia

In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, dysesthesia was reported by 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.4% of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. No events were reported by patients receiving placebo.

Dysgeusia

In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, dysgeusia was reported by 0.1% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.

Laboratory Abnormalities

Amylase and Lipase Increase

In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, treatment with MOUNJARO resulted in mean increases from baseline in serum pancreatic amylase concentrations of 33% to 38% and serum lipase concentrations of 31% to 42%. Placebo-treated patients had a mean increase from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 4% and no changes were observed in lipase. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with MOUNJARO is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of MOUNJARO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions

In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO than placebo (placebo 20.4%, MOUNJARO 5 mg 37.1%, MOUNJARO 10 mg 39.6%, MOUNJARO 15 mg 43.6%). More patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg (3.0%), MOUNJARO 10 mg (5.4%), and MOUNJARO 15 mg (6.6%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time.

The following gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently in MOUNJARO-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (frequencies listed, respectively, as: placebo; 5 mg; 10 mg; 15 mg): eructation (0.4%, 3.0%, 2.5%, 3.3%), flatulence (0%, 1.3%, 2.5%, 2.9%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (0.4%, 1.7%, 2.5%, 1.7%), abdominal distension (0.4%, 0.4%, 2.9%, 0.8%).

Hypoglycemia

Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemic events in the placebo-controlled trials.

Hypoglycemia was more frequent when MOUNJARO was used in combination with a sulfonylurea [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In a clinical trial up to 104 weeks of treatment, when administered with a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia (glucose level < 54 mg/dL) occurred in 13.8%, 9.9%, and 12.8%, and severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.5%, 0%, and 0.6% of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively.

Acute Pancreatitis

In clinical studies, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 MOUNJARO-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure).

WARNING: RISK OF THYROID C-CELL TUMORS

In both male and female rats, tirzepatide causes dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent thyroid C-cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].
MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2) [see Contraindications (4)]. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors

In both sexes of rats, tirzepatide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in a 2-year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.

MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).

Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values > 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.

5.2 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, or MOUNJARO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

After initiation of MOUNJARO, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue MOUNJARO and initiate appropriate management.

Heart Rate Increase

In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, treatment with MOUNJARO resulted in a mean increase in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute in placebo-treated patients. Episodes of sinus tachycardia, associated with a concomitant increase from baseline in heart rate of ≥ 15 beats per minute, also were reported in 4.3%, 4.6%, 5.9% and 10% of subjects treated with placebo, MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. For patients enrolled in Japan, these episodes were reported in 7% (3/43), 7.1% (3/42), 9.3% (4/43), and 23% (10/43) of patients treated with placebo, MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. The clinical relevance of heart rate increases is uncertain.

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with MOUNJARO in the pool of placebo-controlled trials, sometimes severe (e.g., urticaria and eczema); hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3.2% of MOUNJARO-treated patients compared to 1.7% of placebo-treated patients.

In the pool of seven clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 106/2,570 (4.1%) of MOUNJARO-treated patients with anti-tirzepatide antibodies and in 73/2,455 (3.0%) of MOUNJARO-treated patients who did not develop anti-tirzepatide antibodies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

Lipid Profile

Tirzepatide was associated with dose-dependent favourable effects on lipid profile, including reductions in triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in SURPASS-1–5. In SURPASS-4, tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg reduced triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol, and increased HDL-C, compared with baseline and the active comparator in the high CV risk population (82% on lipid-lowering therapy at baseline, which was continued throughout the study). In SURPASS-2, reductions in triglycerides and VLDL-C with tirzepatide (all doses) exceeded those seen with semaglutide 1 mg.

Insulin Use

In SURPASS-5, participants on tirzepatide required significantly less background basal insulin than those on placebo (p < 0.001, all doses). By the end of the study, mean daily insulin dose decreased from baseline by 3.8 U (− 11.4%) in participants receiving insulin glargine plus tirzepatide 15 mg but increased by 25.1 U (75%) in those receiving insulin glargine plus placebo. (Participants self-adjusted background daily insulin glargine dose on the basis of self-monitored blood glucose using a treat-to-target algorithm.)

Tolerability

The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were similar to those seen with GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), namely gastrointestinal (GI) events such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. These were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and transient, occurring more frequently during the dose escalation phase of each study (Fig. S3, Supplementary Appendix). Severe diarrhoea and severe vomiting were uncommon with tirzepatide, affecting 0.31% and 0.25% of participants, respectively. In SURPASS-2, the rates of all reported GI side effects — including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, constipation and abdominal pain — occurring with tirzepatide (40–44.9%) were generally comparable to those seen with semaglutide (41.2%).

FPG and PPG

Change in FPG was reported in 38 studies (26,000 patients) while change in PPG was reported in 21 studies (16,392 patients). Results of pairwise meta-analyses for both outcomes are presented in Supplementary Appendix S6.2 and S6.3. Network meta-analysis results are presented in Fig. 3 b and c and Supplementary Appendix S12 and S17. All innovative GLP-1RA-based treatment strategies significantly reduced FPG and PPG compared to placebo. IGlarLixi ranked as the most efficacious treatment in reducing FPG (MD −52.61 mg/dL, 95% CI [−62.10; −43.11], moderate certainty) and especially PPG (MD −79.37 mg/dL, 95% CI [−91.85; −66.89], moderate certainty) (Fig. 3 b and c). GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC and tirzepatide 15 mg and 10 mg had comparable effects on FPG and were superior to tirzepatide 5 mg and high-dose GLP-1RA. No significant difference was found among GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and GLP-1RA plus basal insulin FRC and all doses of tirzepatide, whereas tirzepatide 5 mg and GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination were superior to most high-dose GLP-1RA (Supplementary Appendix S12). The effect of iGlarLixi and GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination on PPG lowering was similar (MD −17.70 mg/dL, 95% CI [−40.92; 5.51], low certainty). IGlarLixi was superior to all other treatment strategies on PPG reduction, while no significant differences were detected between GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination, all doses of tirzepatide and iDegLira. GLP-1RA plus SGLT-2i combination and tirzepatide 15 mg and 10 mg were more efficacious than high-dose GLP-1RA (dulaglutide 4.5 mg and 3 mg), while the effects of tirzepatide 5 mg and high-dose GLP-1RA were similar (Supplementary Appendix S17).

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease

Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing.

In MOUNJARO placebo-controlled clinical trials, acute gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, biliary colic, and cholecystectomy) was reported by 0.6% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.

5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking MOUNJARO, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing MOUNJARO could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking MOUNJARO.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^5461ff60]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite their demonstrated efficacy and safety, patient access to incretin mimetics has been severely limited for two primary reasons. The first reason is supply shortages which have left many patients unable to fill their prescriptions. The second reason, which is a more daunting and likely persistent problem, is the very high cost of these medications. Often in excess of $1000 per month without insurance, these medications are simply not financially feasible for many individuals who stand to benefit from them. At the national scale, these high costs prompted a US Senate Committee hearingamidst fears that this new generation of anti‐obesity medications could bankrupt the US healthcare system. In fact, providing each eligible US adult with a GLP‐1 would roughly double the total prescription drug spending in the US.

In this paper, we use mathematical modelling and simulation to investigate the weight loss efficacy of GLP‐1 receptor agonists under alternative dosing regimens. We seek dosing regimens which both (i) reduce cost and (ii) maintain high efficacy compared with the standard once per week dose. The specific incretin mimetics that we investigate are semaglutide (brand name Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic and Rybelsus for type 2 diabetes) and tirzepatide (brand name Zepbound for weight loss and Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes). We further investigate how alternative dosing regimens could affect public health on the national scale.

1 Introduction

The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF)'s report indicates a noteworthy rise in the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Projections from this report suggest that approximately 783 million people globally could be affected by diabetes, with many patients being from African countries by 2035. Furthermore, studies have reported that T2DM is the seventh leading cause of mortality in the United States.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite numerous advances in the clinical management of DKD, its prevalence is rising steadily.

The increase in patients with DKD, demonstrating a high risk of progressing to end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and necessitating renal replacement therapies such as haemodialysis (HD). Effective management of blood glucose is crucial in preventing DKD because the level of glucose control and onset of DKD are directly correlated. Additionally, the administration of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors for controlling blood pressure appears to impart renoprotective effects.

In T2DM, the intestine's L cells release incretin hormones, including glucagon‐like peptide (GLP‐1), which is pivotal in the regulation of blood glucose levels. GLP‐1 operates by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion. In contrast, intestinal K cells secrete glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in response to food intake, stimulating insulin secretion to regulate blood glucose. Recently, the GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonist tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Lilly) has been approved for T2DM treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration. Tirzepatide induces a significant body weight loss, primarily by decreasing energy intake and enhancing energy expenditure in preclinical models, and has shown robust body weight reduction in patients with T2DM.

A combination of sodium‐glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors, incretin‐based therapies, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, namely the 'DKD fantastic four', has been proposed for managing DKD. However, the risk of ESRD persists despite the efficacy of these agents. Consequently, a significant optimism surrounds tirzepatide, a novel incretin‐based therapeutic agent, for its potential in treating DKD.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide as well as changes in body composition using bioimpedance analysis in patients with T2DM undergoing HD.

Tirzepatide — adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and obesity: In a Phase 2 trial of adults with MASH and moderate or severe fibrosis, treatment with tirzepatide for 52 weeks was more effective than placebo for resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis, with resolution 10% with placebo versus 44% with 5 mg, 56% with 10 mg, and 62% with 15 mg (P < 0.001 for all three comparisons). Reported weight effects include up to 17.8% body weight change and weight loss of 20.9% at the maximum dose of 15 mg compared to a 3.1% weight loss with placebo. Dosing begins at 2.5 mg SQ weekly, with dose titration in 2.5 mg SQ weekly increments after at least 4 weeks to a maximum of 15 mg weekly; maintenance doses are 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg SQ once weekly. Indications listed include "Mounjaro: FDA approved to treat T2DM ≥ 18 years old", "Zepbound: FDA approved for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbid condition", and "FDA approved for treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with obesity". Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, indigestion, diarrhea, and contraindications include personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 with anaphylaxis and angioedema to tirzepatide noted.

### Laparoscopic versus open surgery for suspected appendicitis [^22167628]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The removal of the acute appendix is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Open surgery associated with therapeutic efficacy has been the treatment of choice for acute appendicitis. However, in consequence of the evolution of endoscopic surgery, the operation can also be performed with minimally invasive surgery. Due to smaller incisions, the laparoscopic approach may be associated with reduced postoperative pain, reduced wound infection rate, and shorter time until return to normal activity. This is an update of the review published in 2010.

Objectives

To compare the effects of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) and open appendectomy (OA) with regard to benefits and harms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE and Embase (9 February 2018). We identified proposed and ongoing studies from World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trials Register (9 February 2018). We handsearched reference lists of identified studies and the congress proceedings of endoscopic surgical societies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LA versus OA in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the Peto odds ratio (OR) for very rare outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (or standardised mean differences (SMD) if researchers used different scales such as quality of life) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We identified 85 studies involving 9765 participants. Seventy-five trials included 8520 adults and 10 trials included 1245 children. Most studies had risk of bias issues, with attrition bias being the largest source across studies due to incomplete outcome data. In adults, pain intensity on day one was reduced by 0.75 cm on a 10 cm VAS after LA (MD -0.75, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.45; 20 RCTs; 2421 participants; low-quality evidence). Wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.51; 63 RCTs; 7612 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses was increased following LA (Peto OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.43; 53 RCTs; 6677 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The length of hospital stay was shortened by one day after LA (MD -0.96, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.70; 46 RCTs; 5127 participant; low-quality evidence). The time until return to normal activity occurred five days earlier after LA than after OA (MD -4.97, 95% CI -6.77 to -3.16; 17 RCTs; 1653 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies showed better quality of life scores following LA, but used different scales, and therefore no pooled estimates were presented. One used the SF-36 questionnaire two weeks after surgery and the other used the Gastro-intestinal Quality of Life Index six weeks and six months after surgery (both low-quality evidence). In children, we found no differences in pain intensity on day one (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.65 to 0.05; 1 RCT; 61 participants; low-quality evidence), intra-abdominal abscesses after LA (Peto OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.22; 9 RCTs; 1185 participants; low-quality evidence) or time until return to normal activity (MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.30 to 0.30; 1 RCT; 383 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, wound infections were less likely after LA (Peto OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.42; 10 RCTs; 1245 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and the length of hospital stay was shortened by 0.8 days after LA (MD -0.81, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.62; 6 RCTs; 316 participants; low-quality evidence). Quality of life was not reported in any of the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Except for a higher rate of intra-abdominal abscesses after LA in adults, LA showed advantages over OA in pain intensity on day one, wound infections, length of hospital stay and time until return to normal activity in adults. In contrast, LA showed advantages over OA in wound infections and length of hospital stay in children. Two studies reported better quality of life scores in adults. No study reported this outcome in children. However, the quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate and some of the clinical effects of LA were small and of limited clinical relevance. Future studies with low risk of bias should investigate, in particular, the quality of life in children.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^ab6df2c5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This 12‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 2 study was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of tirzepatide (12 and 15 mg [two groups]) using three different dose‐escalation regimens. The dose‐escalation regimens evaluated different starting doses and magnitudes of each dose escalation. Tirzepatide treatment doses were escalated over an 8‐week period to a final dose of 12 or 15 mg, which was administered during the remaining 4 weeks of the treatment period. Although the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on changes in HbA1c at 12 weeks, a key secondary objective was to evaluate the tolerability of tirzepatide within each of the dose‐escalation regimens.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^6df4b601]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is currently being investigated in several phase 3 trials (n = 210–900 participants) in patients with overweight/obesity. It may be associated with less gastro-intestinal side effects compared to GLP-1 agonists. The FDA has recently granted tirzepatide a Fast Track designation to investigate its effect as a treatment for individuals with obesity or overweight with metabolic co-morbidities.

Suggested algorithm

All obesity treatment guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy, in addition to lifestyle modification and behavioral therapy, when BMI is ≥ 30 kg/m², or ≥ 27 kg/m² in the presence of comorbidities related to excessive weight. Lifestyle modifications are the first line treatment for all. Given that the short, and longterm efficacy of different diets are the same, the prescribed diet should be a one with a proved efficacy, taking into consideration safety data, patient preference and health status. In addition, reviewing the patient's medications is crucial, to identify the ones that might be contributing to weight gain, and potentially withhold them, after communication with the primary physician. In fact, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017–2018) showed that 20% of US adults are on weight inducing medications.

### The SIFIPAC / WSES / SICG / SIMEU guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis in the elderly (2019 edition) [^68177102]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 11. In elderly patient with acute appendicitis, once operation is indicated, we suggest to perform appendectomy as soon as possible (Conditional recommendation based on very low quality evidences).
12 Is the removal of the appendix recommended in case of macroscopically normal appendix during abdominal exploration in elderly patients?

Great debate exists about the removal of a normal appendix found during abdominal exploration for a suspected acute appendicitis. Guidelines for adult patients recommend the removal of the appendix with a very low level of evidence and a weak recommendation, based on expert opinions and few controversial evidences (Di Saverio S B. A.).

No data dedicated to this issue in elderly patients are available in literature. Some authors demonstrated that the accuracy of the surgeon in defining a "normal" appendix is very poor with almost apparently normal appendices being inflamed histologically. Similarly, Trong and colleagues confirmed this "inaccuracy" of the surgeon's judgement with 27.8% of appendix classified as normal and resulted inflamed by histology.

On the other hand, the study by Van den Broek et al. demonstrated that leaving a normal looking appendix in absence of other diagnosis in case of abdominal exploration for suspected appendicitis is safe with no complication and a recurrence rate of 6% after a median of 8 months. Moreover, Lee and colleagues demonstrated that the morbidity and complication rate were similar when a normal appendix is removed compared to acute appendicitis. At the light of the contrasting results available in literature and the absence of data dedicated to elderly patients, after an intense debate among participants, no consensus on a statement could be reached and consequently no recommendation could be made.

Statement 12. There is no consensus about the removal of a normal appendix with very low quality and indirect evidences; therefore, no recommendation could be made.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^c2731d90]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide treatment using three different dose-escalation regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. The tirzepatide dose groups and dose-escalation regimens were: 12mg (4mgweeks 0–3; 8mgweeks 4–7; 12mgweeks 8–11), 15mg-1 (2.5mgweeks 0–1; 5mgweeks 2–3; 10mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11) and 15mg-2 (2.5mgweeks 0–3; 7.5mgweeks 4–7; 15mgweeks 8–11). The primary objective was to compare tirzepatide with placebo in HbA1c change from baseline at 12weeks.

Results

Overall, 111 patients were randomized: placebo, 26; tirzepatide 12mg, 29; tirzepatide 15mg-1, 28; tirzepatide 15mg-2, 28. The mean age was 57.4years, HbA1c 8.4% and body mass index 31.9kg/m². At week 12, absolute HbA1c change from baseline (SE) was greater in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo (placebo, +0.2% [0.21]; 12mg, -1.7% [0.19]; 15mg-1, -2.0% [0.20]; 15mg-2, -1.8% [0.19]). The incidence of nausea was: placebo, 7.7%; 12mg group, 24.1%; 15mg-1 group, 39.3%; 15mg-2 group, 35.7%. Three patients discontinued the treatment because of adverse events, one from each of the placebo, 12mg and 15mg-1 groups.

Conclusions

Tirzepatide treatment for 12weeks resulted in clinically significant reductions in HbA1c. This suggests that lower starting doses and smaller dose increments are associated with a more favourable side effect profile.

### Clinical consequences of delayed gastric emptying with GLP-1 receptor agonists and tirzepatide [^f512d546]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

It should be appreciated that, in general, the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in these studies was associated with a higher risk of intestinal obstruction than GLP-1RAs. This is surprising, since the overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events is much higher with the latter class. This raises the question as to whether, if there is an effect, the underlying mechanisms do not relate to inhibitory effects on motility, since DPP-4 inhibitors appear to have little to no effect on this parameter in either obese subjects or those with T2D.

In summary, available data on the association of bowel obstruction or ileus with the use of GLP-1 RAs are inconsistent, and no definitive conclusions can be made. While some studies suggest up to 3-fold increase in risk, others report no association.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Summary of treatment‐emergent adverse events (AEs)

The number of patients with the combined AEs of nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea was numerically greater in the tirzepatide 15 mg‐1 treatment group (57.1%) compared with the 12 mg group (48.3%) and the 15 mg‐2 group (46.4%); all of the tirzepatide treatment groups reported more nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea than placebo (11.5%). The severity of the nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea events was mild to moderate in intensity. None of the nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea events were severe.

Further evaluation of GI AEs incidence from the first onset data showed that the AEs most probably to occurred following the first dose (4 or 2.5 mg), and the incidence and prevalence may have been reduced with lower starting doses when comparing the incidence of nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea in the tirzepatide 4 mg dose (12 mg group) with the 2.5 mg doses (15 mg‐1 and 15 mg‐2 groups) (Table 3). Also, smaller subsequent dose escalations were more probably associated with a lower incidence of the combined nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea AEs, as noted when comparing 2.5 mg (15 mg‐1 group) and 4 mg increments (12 mg group) with 5 mg (15 mg‐1 and 15 mg‐2 groups) or 7.5 mg (15 mg‐2 group) increments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Treatment with glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) addresses multiple pathophysiological abnormalities of type 2 diabetes, providing an important therapeutic option for patients with this disease. GLP‐1 RAs improve glucose‐dependent insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion, and decrease the rate of gastric emptying. 1, 2, 3 They are also associated with a reduction in appetite with consequent weight loss. 1, 2, 3 These agents are associated with dose‐limiting side effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, 4, 5 and efforts have been made to improve efficacy and tolerability by investigating dose‐escalation regimens that allow attainment of higher doses, which are associated with greater efficacy, while limiting side effects. It has been reported that a slow escalation in dose can limit side effects while increasing the therapeutic utility of GLP‐1 RAs. 6, 7, 8, 9 In addition to the need to improve the tolerability of GLP‐1RAs, further improvement in their efficacy is of importance because not all patients treated with GLP‐1 RAs reach their glycaemic target and/or body weight reduction goals with currently available agents. 10

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^bb3951cc]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

T2D is responsible for an average two-fold-higher risk for cardiovascular events, such as coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and vascular death, independent of other established risk factors.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are now considered the first choice of injectable therapy for many people with T2D, with several members of the class having proven cardiovascular efficacy. Building on that concept, the combined glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1RAs have been proposed as a novel therapeutic option for T2D. Tirzepatide is one such molecule that has shown marked glycemia and weight benefits in a series of trials. For example, when compared to placebo, semaglutide 1 mg per week, dulaglutide 1.5 mg per week and insulin degludec or insulin glargine 100 U mL⁻¹, tirzepatide was more effective in reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight in people with T2D over a 26−52-week treatment period. Tirzepatide might improve glycemic control beyond that of GLP-1RAs through direct and indirect actions on the pancreas and other tissues, including enhancing pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion, reducing glucose-adjusted glucagon secretion and improving insulin sensitivity beyond the levels usually explained by weight loss –. Additionally, tirzepatide's anorexigenic effect might exceed that of GLP-1RAs by integrating the activation signals of both GIP and GLP-1 receptor pathways in the brain. Among other beneficial effects, tirzepatide is also associated with improvements in lipoprotein profiles (more than GLP-1RAs), blood pressure and several biomarkers of inflammation. Notably, glycemic and weight effects appear to be maintained for at least 2 years while receiving tirzepatide, the longest observation period for this drug.

Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3.3 Safety and tolerability

No deaths occurred during the study. One patient from the tirzepatide 12 mg treatment group reported two SAEs: diarrhoea and high white blood cell count. No patient discontinued the study because of GI AEs. There were two patients from the tirzepatide treatment groups (12 mg and 15 mg‐1) who discontinued the study drug because of a GI‐related AE of diarrhoea.

There was a higher incidence of TEAEs in the tirzepatide treatment groups compared with placebo, mainly because of a higher incidence of GI AEs in the tirzepatide treatment groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs overall (Table 2) were diarrhoea (27.0%), nausea (27.0%), decreased appetite (16.2%), vomiting (14.4%) and headache (13.5%). The incidence of events was similar in each of the tirzepatide treatment groups with the exception of lower rates of nausea in the tirzepatide 12 mg group. The percentages of patients who reported nausea were: placebo, 7.7%; 12 mg group, 24.1%; 15 mg‐1 group, 39.3%; and 15 mg‐2 group, 35.7%. Graphs showing the prevalence and severity of nausea over time for each treatment group are provided in the supporting material (Figure S2).

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^df690311]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) have emerged as an efficacious treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have demonstrated substantial weight loss effects. This systematic review compares two prevalent GLP‐1RAs, tirzepatide and semaglutide, with their weight loss effects and rates of adverse events (AEs).

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library for direct comparative studies between tirzepatide and semaglutide. A meta‐analysis was conducted via a random‐effects model to analyse the differences in weight loss outcomes between study cohorts.

Results

Four studies, with 28,827 patients (14,870 tirzepatide/13,928 semaglutide), mean age of 55.7 years (52.0 to 63.7) and mean follow‐up of 35.9 weeks (23.6 to 44.6), were included in this study. Mean weight change across four studies for tirzepatide and semaglutide was −11.4% (−15.3% to −8.27%) and −7.3% (−8.3% to −6.08%), respectively. The meta‐analysis supports these findings with a mean difference of −4.84 kg (95% CI: −6.21 to −3.47), favouring tirzepatide. The most common AEs were minor and moderate‐severity gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

Conclusion

Current literature supports tirzepatide demonstrating a higher impact on weight loss than semaglutide, with both demonstrating high rates of minimal‐ to moderate‐severity AEs. Further research with comparative head‐to‐head trials will better elucidate these weight loss effects and safety profiles.

AACE 2022 diabetes — tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes: Tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, is recently approved by the FDA for improvement in glycemic control in persons with type 2 diabetes. A systematic analysis of several completed trials with a total of 6609 participants confirmed dose-dependent superiority on glycemic efficacy at 5, 10, or 15 mg weekly subcutaneous administration, with reduction in body weight versus placebo, GLP-1 RAs, and basal insulin. Tirzepatide was associated with increased gastrointestinal adverse events but no increase in risk of hypoglycemia, appears useful for those already on metformin therapy, and based on early data and ongoing trials (including a cardiovascular outcomes trial) additional clinical indications for weight loss and/or cardiovascular risk reduction may be sought.

Table 3
By‐week combined incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea

The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes (documented, symptomatic, probable and asymptomatic events) was low across all the tirzepatide treatment groups during the study. There were 12 patients who experienced at least one hypoglycaemic episode (plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]). It cannot be ruled out that one patient in the 15 mg‐2 group had a plasma glucose of < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) because that patient reported a hypoglycaemia episode but did not report a plasma glucose value (Table 2). There were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia. There were no cases of investigator‐suspected pancreatitis or cholecystitis. No cardiovascular events that required adjudication occurred during the trial. There were no reports of thyroid tumours, neoplasms or C‐cell hyperplasia events. Pulse rate increased for the tirzepatide treatment groups (0.9 to 5.7 beats/min) and decreased in the placebo group (−2.3 beats/min) during the treatment period of the study.

Approximately 26% of patients treated with tirzepatide developed treatment‐emergent antidrug antibodies (TE‐ADAs). Overall titres were low and there were no effects because of the presence of TE‐ADAs on reduction of HbA1c, body weight or drug clearance. There were no hypersensitivity reactions or any other relevant AEs associated with the presence of TE‐ADAs.

According to the retrospective study by Grimes et al. including 203 appendectomies performed with normal histology, fecaliths may be the cause of right iliac fossa pain in the absence of obvious appendiceal inflammation. In this study, the policy of routine removal of a normal-looking appendix at laparoscopy in the absence of any other obvious pathology appeared to be an effective treatment for recurrent symptoms. In the same way, Tartaglia et al. supported an appendectomy in patients undergoing laparoscopy for acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain even when the appendix appears normal on visual inspection, based on the results of a study in which 90% of the removed normal-looking appendices at laparoscopy for abdominal pain and no other intra-abdominal acute disease harbored inflammatory changes at the definitive pathology.

Recently, Sørensen et al. performed a retrospective cohort analysis of patients who underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy due to clinical suspicion of AA where no other pathology was found, and the appendix was not removed. Of the 271 patients included, 56 (20.7%) were readmitted with right iliac fossa pain after a median time of 10 months. Twenty-two patients (8.1%) underwent a new laparoscopic procedure, and the appendix was removed in 18 patients, of which only one showed histological signs of inflammation. Based on results from this study, the authors did not consider that it is necessary to remove a macroscopic normal appendix during laparoscopy for clinically suspected AA. This year, Allaway et al. published the results of a single-centre retrospective case note review of patients undergoing LA for suspected AA. Patients were divided into positive and negative appendectomy groups based on histology results. The authors reported an overall negative appendectomy rate of 36.0% among 1413 patients who met inclusion criteria (904 in the positive group and 509 in the negative group). Morbidity rates (6.3% vs 6.9%; P = 0.48) and types of morbidity were the same for negative appendicectomy and uncomplicated AA, and there was no significant difference in complication severity or length of stay (2.3 vs 2.6 days; P = 0.06) between negative appendicectomy and uncomplicated AA groups.

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) in patients treated with tirzepatide. In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical studies for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), 0.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients had severe hypersensitivity reactions compared to no placebo-treated patients. Similar rates of severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND trials for OSA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue use of ZEPBOUND. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in ZEPBOUND [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with ZEPBOUND.

5.7 Hypoglycemia

ZEPBOUND lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia.

In a trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²(Study 2), hypoglycemia (plasma glucose < 54 mg/dL) was reported in 4.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients versus 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. In this trial, patients taking ZEPBOUND in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) had increased risk of hypoglycemia (10.3%) compared to ZEPBOUND-treated patients not taking a sulfonylurea (2.1%). There is also increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients treated with tirzepatide in combination with insulin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hypoglycemia has also been associated with ZEPBOUND and GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In patients with diabetes mellitus, monitor blood glucose prior to starting ZEPBOUND and during ZEPBOUND treatment. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of insulin or sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue).

### Tirzepatide immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety: analysis of data from phase 3 studies [^9c641a15]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Antidrug antibodies (ADA) can potentially affect drug pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy.

Objective

This work aimed to evaluate treatment-emergent (TE) ADA in tirzepatide (TZP)-treated participants across 7 phase 3 trials and their potential effect on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety.

Methods

ADA were assessed at baseline and throughout the study until end point, defined as week 40 (SURPASS-1, -2, and -5) or week 52 (SURPASS-3, -4, Japan-Mono, and Japan-Combo). Samples for ADA characterization were collected at SURPASS trial sites. Participants included ADA-evaluable TZP-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 5025). Interventions included TZP 5, 10, or 15 mg. ADA were detected and characterized for their ability to cross-react with native glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (nGIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (nGLP-1), neutralize tirzepatide activity on GIP and GLP-1 receptors, and neutralize nGIP and nGLP-1.

Results

TE ADA developed in 51.1% of tirzepatide-treated patients. Proportions were similar across dose groups. Maximum ADA titers ranged from 1:20 to 1: 81 920 among TE ADA+ patients. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against TZP activity on GIP and GLP-1 receptors were observed in 1.9% and 2.1% of patients, respectively. Less than 1.0% of patients had cross-reactive NAb against nGIP or nGLP-1. TE ADA status, ADA titer, and NAb status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or efficacy of TZP. More TE ADA+ patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions than TE ADA– patients. The majority of hypersensitivity and injection site reactions were nonserious and nonsevere, and most events occurred and/or resolved irrespective of TE ADA status or titer.

Conclusion

Immunogenicity did not affect TZP pharmacokinetics or efficacy. The majority of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions experienced by TE ADA+ patients were mild to moderate in severity.

### Tirzepatide versus semaglutide on weight loss in type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of direct comparative studies [^bacb2832]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as an efficacious treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and have demonstrated substantial weight loss effects. This systematic review compares two prevalent GLP-1RAs, tirzepatide and semaglutide, with their weight loss effects and rates of adverse events (AEs).

Methods

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library for direct comparative studies between tirzepatide and semaglutide. A meta-analysis was conducted via a random-effects model to analyse the differences in weight loss outcomes between study cohorts.

Results

Four studies, with 28,827 patients (14,870 tirzepatide/13,928 semaglutide), mean age of 55.7years (52.0 to 63.7) and mean follow-up of 35.9weeks (23.6 to 44.6), were included in this study. Mean weight change across four studies for tirzepatide and semaglutide was -11.4% (-15.3% to -8.27%) and -7.3% (-8.3% to -6.08%), respectively. The meta-analysis supports these findings with a mean difference of -4.84kg (95% CI: -6.21 to -3.47), favouring tirzepatide. The most common AEs were minor and moderate-severity gastrointestinal (GI) AEs.

Conclusion

Current literature supports tirzepatide demonstrating a higher impact on weight loss than semaglutide, with both demonstrating high rates of minimal- to moderate-severity AEs. Further research with comparative head-to-head trials will better elucidate these weight loss effects and safety profiles.

5.5 Acute Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists or tirzepatide.

In clinical trials of tirzepatide for a different indication, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 tirzepatide-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure). In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), 0.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients had acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication (0.14 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients (0.15 patients per 100 years of exposure). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for treatment-emergent adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis in the pooled clinical studies for OSA (Studies 5 and 6) was 0.84 patients per 100 years for ZEPBOUND and 0 for placebo-treated patients.

After initiation of ZEPBOUND, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue ZEPBOUND and initiate appropriate management. Continuation of ZEPBOUND after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be individually determined in the clinical judgment of a patient's health care provider.

### Efficacy and tolerability of artemisinin-based and quinine-based treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in pregnancy: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^739b15ac]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Among ACTs, adverse events were considered to be mainly due to the partner drug, and AL and DP were the better tolerated regimens. The risk of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness was higher in ASAQ and ASMQ than in AL or DP, although none of the studies included in this pooled analysis were double-blinded. Pregnancy outcomes are described in detail by Saito and colleagues, but there was no difference among the ACTs tested (ie, AL, ASAQ, ASMQ, and DP).

This study has some limitations. Firstly, although this meta-analysis includes over 90% of patients that are available in the literature, some non-standard treatments were documented in only a small number of women. Nine studies,(8% of individual patient data) were not included, but the pooled efficacy at the fixed timepoints was similar when aggregated data of those unshared studies were included (appendix p 8). Study designs and handling of indeterminate PCR or P vivax intercalated infection also did not affect our conclusions (appendix p 13–16), thereby confirming the robustness of our analysis as the most accurate global summary. Secondly, although the efficacy of ACTs shown in this study was satisfactory, careful consideration is needed when applying these results to specific settings because of variable patterns of drug resistance. Sensitivity to the partner drugs and immunity level differs depending on the location and study year, although a sensitivity analysis in which one study site was removed at a time did not change the conclusion of the meta-analysis (data not shown). The data from southeast Asia included in this study were collected before widespread artemisinin resistance in the area, but the spread of resistance in this region will affect the general recommendations for antimalarials, requiring alternative strategies and the safety of those formulations will have to be assessed in pregnant women. Thirdly, as study participants were mostly enrolled at antenatal clinics by screening for peripheral parasitaemia, the women included in this pooled analysis were more likely to be afebrile and with lower baseline parasite densities than patients in most antimalarial efficacy studies in non-pregnant populations. Thus, the efficacy at fixed time points might not be directly comparable to the results in non-pregnant populations or in settings where antenatal screening is not provided. Indeed, as baseline parasite density is a known risk factor for PCR-corrected treatment failure, the pooled efficacy at fixed timepoints in this study could have been overestimated. The lower efficacy of quinine and AL (under the dosing currently recommended by WHO)shown in this analysis could thus actually be worse for infections with higher parasitaemia. Nonetheless, the results of this study will be practically useful and more relevant than only including symptomatic patients because even asymptomatic parasitaemia leads to adverse pregnancy outcomes and most pregnant women with parasitaemia were asymptomatic. Finally, evidence on the safety and efficacy of antimalarial treatment in the first trimester both in this meta-analysis and in the literature is scarce. Although safety of ACTs is reassuring, and there was no apparent effect of gestational age on the risk of PCR-corrected treatment efficacy indicated in this meta-analysis, collecting further evidence on the safety and efficacy of antimalarial treatment in first trimester women should be continued.

### Tirzepatide and blood pressure reduction: stratified analyses of the SURMOUNT-1 randomised controlled trial [^80b6035f]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating obesity may be a pathway to prevent and control hypertension. In the SURMOUNT-1 trial in people with obesity or overweight with weight-related complications, 72-week tirzepatide treatment led to clinically meaningful body weight and blood pressure reduction. Post hoc analyses were conducted to further explore the effects of tirzepatide on the pattern of blood pressure reduction and whether the effects were consistent across various subgroups.

Methods

The mixed effect for repeated measure model was used to compare changes in overall blood pressure, across demographic and clinical subgroups, baseline blood pressure subgroups and hypertension categories between SURMOUNT-1 participants randomised to treatment with tirzepatide and placebo. The association between weight changes and blood pressure and adverse events associated with low blood pressure were also evaluated by mediation analysis.

Results

Tirzepatide treatment was associated with a rapid decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the first 24 weeks, followed by blood pressure stabilisation until the end of the observation period, resulting in a significant net reduction by 72 weeks of 6.8mm Hg systolic and 4.2mm Hg diastolic blood pressure versus placebo. Participants randomly assigned to any tirzepatide group were more likely than those assigned to placebo to have normal blood pressure at week 72 (58.0% vs 35.2%, respectively). The effects were broadly consistent across baseline blood pressure subgroups, shifting the blood pressure distribution curve to lower blood pressure levels. The mediation analysis indicated that weight loss explained 68% of the systolic and 71% of the diastolic blood pressure reduction. Low blood pressure adverse events were infrequent, but the rate was higher in the tirzepatide group.

Conclusions

In these post hoc analyses, in participants with obesity or overweight, tirzepatide was associated with reduced blood pressure consistently across participant groups primarily via weight loss, with relatively few blood pressure-related adverse events.

### The vermiform appendix impacts the risk of developing Parkinson's disease [^e9dcdb58]. Science Translational Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein, which has been suggested to begin in the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we determined the capacity of the appendix to modify PD risk and influence pathogenesis. In two independent epidemiological datasets, involving more than 1.6 million individuals and over 91 million person-years, we observed that removal of the appendix decades before PD onset was associated with a lower risk for PD, particularly for individuals living in rural areas, and delayed the age of PD onset. We also found that the healthy human appendix contained intraneuronal α-synuclein aggregates and an abundance of PD pathology-associated α-synuclein truncation products that are known to accumulate in Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of PD. Lysates of human appendix tissue induced the rapid cleavage and oligomerization of full-length recombinant α-synuclein. Together, we propose that the normal human appendix contains pathogenic forms of α-synuclein that affect the risk of developing PD.

### The dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist tirzepatide: a novel cardiometabolic therapeutic prospect [^364ab032]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Incretin hormones are peptides released in the intestine in response to the presence of nutrients in its lumen. The observation that the induced effect on insulin secretion is different when oral glucose was administered versus the same amount of glucose parenterally coined the term 'incretin effect', supporting the idea that some substances secreted in the intestines favored the release of insulin after ingestion. This effect is part of the entero-insular axis of glucose homeostasis and is estimated to be responsible for at least 50% of insulin secretion.

The main incretins are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 is a 30 amino acid peptide produced by the L cells, enteroendocrine cells of the distal ileum and colon, and GIP is a 4 amino acid peptide produced by the K cells of the duodenum and jejunum. Both hormones are rapidly released after ingestion, apparently under neural control, and stimulate insulin production in pancreatic β cells in a glucose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GLP-1 decreases glucagon secretion from pancreatic α cells and has also extrapancreatic influences as a direct suppressive effect on appetite centers and a slowing of gastric emptying increasing the feeling of satiety. It has been shown that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) the response to the incretin effect is altered as a result of a severe defect in the sensitivity for GIP in the β cells and a reduction in food-induced GLP-1 secretion.

Plasma concentrations of GLP-1 and GIP are very low in the fasting state and increase 15–30 min after ingestion. The incretin effect is very brief because it remains active 1–2 min after its secretion and is then inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4). This very short action limited the initial enthusiasm for the possible usefulness of incretins for the treatment of T2DM, and in turn stimulated the development of both GLP1 agonists resistant to DPP-4, with a longer half-life and of DPP-4 inhibitors that prolong the half-life of native incretins. A large real world evidence demonstrated that when comparing several GLP-1 receptor agonists versus DPP-4 inhibitors treatments in patients with a baseline cardiovascular risk, the incidence of adverse events was much lower for the former; the GLP-1 semaglutide reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events vs comparators in a broad T2DM population.

### Tirzepatide immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety: analysis of data from phase 3 studies [^de75fef8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Antidrug antibodies (ADA) can potentially affect drug pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy.

Objective

This work aimed to evaluate treatment-emergent (TE) ADA in tirzepatide (TZP)-treated participants across 7 phase 3 trials and their potential effect on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety.

Methods

ADA were assessed at baseline and throughout the study until end point, defined as week 40 (SURPASS-1, -2, and -5) or week 52 (SURPASS-3, -4, Japan-Mono, and Japan-Combo). Samples for ADA characterization were collected at SURPASS trial sites. Participants included ADA-evaluable TZP-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 5025). Interventions included TZP 5, 10, or 15 mg. ADA were detected and characterized for their ability to cross-react with native glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (nGIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (nGLP-1), neutralize tirzepatide activity on GIP and GLP-1 receptors, and neutralize nGIP and nGLP-1.

Results

TE ADA developed in 51.1% of tirzepatide-treated patients. Proportions were similar across dose groups. Maximum ADA titers ranged from 1:20 to 1: 81 920 among TE ADA+ patients. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against TZP activity on GIP and GLP-1 receptors were observed in 1.9% and 2.1% of patients, respectively. Less than 1.0% of patients had cross-reactive NAb against nGIP or nGLP-1. TE ADA status, ADA titer, and NAb status had no effect on the pharmacokinetics or efficacy of TZP. More TE ADA+ patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions than TE ADA- patients. The majority of hypersensitivity and injection site reactions were nonserious and nonsevere, and most events occurred and/or resolved irrespective of TE ADA status or titer.

Conclusion

Immunogenicity did not affect TZP pharmacokinetics or efficacy. The majority of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions experienced by TE ADA+ patients were mild to moderate in severity.

### Comparison of 2016–17 and previous epizootics of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 guangdong lineage in Europe [^afdf5ebf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

This study presents many limitations (online Technical Appendix). Differences in the implementation of passive wild bird surveillance between countries, which are implied in the EU avian influenza annual report for 2016, suggest that sensitivity of wild bird surveillance varies across countries, which could affect the distribution of cases we observed. The true probability of detecting HPAI is dependent on many factors that may influence both the frequency of wild bird deaths and the likelihood of identification and sampling of wild bird carcasses in different regions and countries. Public awareness, the current avian influenza status of the country area, media coverage, prevailing climatic conditions, available food sources, and removal by predators may affect wild bird mortality, detection rates, or both. Furthermore, the efficacy of passive surveillance is difficult to measure because capturing the expended effort depends on observation and testing of deceased birds. On the other hand, surveillance has high sensitivity in farmed poultry, mainly because of higher virulence and much closer observation of these populations.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^e92daacf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

This study compares the therapeutic efficacy, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) rates and the relationship between the therapeutic efficacy and GI AEs in randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of GLP‐1 RAs and the dual GLP‐1/GIP agonist tirzepatide.

Materials and Methods

A systematic PubMed search identified 38 phase 3 or 4 placebo‐controlled RCTs of exenatide (b.i.d. and q.w.), lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide with a total of 16 660 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 104 study arms. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight and the proportion of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) were calculated by agent, preparation and dose. The correlation between odds ratios (ORs) for GI AEs and the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a linear regression analysis.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across studies: mean age 57 ± 10 years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6 years, body mass index (BMI) 31.9 ± 5.8 kg/m² and HbA1c 8.2% ± 0.9%. HbA1c reductions ranged from −0.63% ± 0.03% (lixisenatide, 20 μg q.d.) to −1.79% ± 0.09% (tirzepatide, 15 mg q.w.; p < 0.0001). Weight reductions ranged from −0.75 ± 0.10 kg to −9.65 ± 0.56 kg. Despite the high variability in therapeutic efficacy, ORs for GI AEs were similar across compounds/preparations.

Conclusions

The magnitude of efficacy for intended therapeutic actions (HbA1c and body weight reduction) varied widely between incretin mimetic glucose‐lowering agents. However, larger therapeutic efficacy was not systematically associated with higher GI AE or drug discontinuation rates, indicating better tolerability of the more effective agents/preparations.

### Efficacy and tolerability of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate different dose-escalation regimens [^a00c10ac]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

There were no unexpected safety findings in this study and there were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia. Patients who developed tirzepatide antidrug antibodies had low titres; there was no effect of TE‐ADAs on reduction of HbA1c and body weight or on the incidence of hypersensitivity events. These findings were consistent with the phase 2b study. 20

This study has some important limitations. Although the main focus of this trial was to evaluate the tolerability of different tirzepatide dose‐escalation regimens, the study was designed with change in HbA1c as the primary objective. The reason for this was to compare efficacy with the phase 2b study and to avoid reporting bias towards GI side effects. The dose‐escalation period was limited to 8 weeks and up to four dose steps; more gradual dose increases, and a longer dose‐escalation duration, may have resulted in further improvements in the incidence of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Furthermore, the study was not powered to compare small differences in GI frequencies within weeks or at endpoint, so conclusions were made only upon numerical comparisons. Another limitation of the study was that there was a difference in the gender distribution in the 15 mg‐2 group, although there was no indication in this study or in the 26‐week phase 2b study that there was a gender difference in reporting AEs.

In conclusion, 12 weeks of tirzepatide treatment with 12 and 15 mg doses resulted in statistically and clinically significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight that were comparable with those observed in the larger primary phase 2b study in a similar patient population with type 2 diabetes. A gradual dose‐escalation regimen, with smaller dose increments, appeared to result in a more favourable GI side effect profile. These findings have informed the dose‐escalation regimen being used in the tirzepatide phase 3 clinical programme.

### Tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes: an endocrine perspective [^cb602a0b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Generally, the proportions of participants who reported serious adverse events (SAEs) were similarly distributed between tirzepatide and comparator treatment arms (Table S1), and the range of SAEs reported is consistent with that reported for semaglutide 1 mg in the SUSTAIN programme. A higher number of SAEs was reported in tirzepatide‐treated participants than those who received semaglutide 1 mg in SURPASS‐2. The most frequent SAE reported was COVID‐19‐related pneumonia in both the tirzepatide (0.4%) and semaglutide 1 mg (0.9%) groups. Overall, 79 deaths occurred in the SURPASS 1‐5 studies, 41 (1%) in the tirzepatide arms and 38 (2%) in the comparator arms (Table S1). In SURPASS‐2, there were five deaths related to COVID‐19, with the death of a sixth being adjudicated as from cardiovascular causes but with suspected COVID‐19. These occurred in five (0.4%) participants who received tirzepatide and one who received semaglutide (0.2%). In the high‐risk population of SURPASS‐4, six (0.6%) COVID‐19‐related deaths were reported in the tirzepatide arms and eight (0.8%) in the insulin glargine 100 U/ml arm. There was one COVID‐19‐related death in a tirzepatide‐treated participant in SURPASS‐3 (< 0.1%) and none in SURPASS‐1 or ‐5. No deaths were considered related to study medications.

### Comparative efficacy of serotonin (5-HT ₃) receptor antagonists in patients undergoing surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^17f5bce1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In order to account for the treatment effect modifier 'risk of bias', a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which 10 RCTs were removed because of high risk of incomplete outcome data bias (Additional file 1: Appendix 21); the results were unchanged from the primary analysis, except that the risk of PONV was significantly higher with tropisetron than with granisetron. In another sensitivity analysis, two cohort studies and three non-randomized controlled trials were added to the included studies, and the same results were observed (Additional file 1: Appendix 11).

Appendicitis research recommendations emphasize that further long-term outcome and quality of life data is needed for both treatment options, studies should transparently report the diagnostic criteria as well as treatment protocols, and evidence of the value placed by patients or parents on the avoidance of appendectomy relative to the risk of recurrence would be useful.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and tolerability of weekly NuSh agents — semaglutide and tirzepatide are dosed once weekly, and all agents require dose titration to minimize largely gastrointestinal adverse effects; slow titration mitigates intolerance, and for patients with adverse effects, decreasing the dose to a previously tolerated dose is recommended. In clinical trials, 4.3% to 7.1% of participants discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Among published clinical trials, the longest duration of treatment with a NuSh (liraglutide) was 3.8 years, and observational data across 5 years suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective; given that obesity is a chronic disease, weight regain after discontinuation of therapy is expected. Access and affordability challenges can lead to missed doses; should a patient miss doses due to lack of access, strategies exist to guide therapeutic interchanges, and if ≥ 3 missed dosages of once-weekly semaglutide or tirzepatide occur, a dose reduction may be considered.

### Outcomes of laparoscopic appendectomy of a normally appearing appendix in children with suspected acute appendicitis: a tertiary care center experience [^6caba2c5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis represents the most frequent reason for abdominal surgery in children. Before the advent of laparoscopic surgery, surgeons often removed the appendix even if it appeared normal. This practice aimed to prevent diagnostic confusion in the future, as an appendix scar could be misleading. Consequently, it was common to remove a histologically normal appendix, a procedure referred to as a negative appendectomy. Reported rates of negative appendectomy in the literature range from 1.8 to 46%, with a higher incidence observed in the pediatric population. While a negative appendectomy may seem benign, approximately 6% of patients experience complications afterwards.

A macroscopically normal appendix discovered during laparoscopy for right iliac fossa pain poses a clinical dilemma. There is no universally accepted protocol for managing such cases, and the long-term consequences of leaving the appendix in situ remain unclear. Removing the appendix in these situations eliminates the risk of future exploratory laparoscopy for suspected appendicitis. Additionally, it prevents potential complications, such as progressive infection, inflammation, or perforation, in cases where microscopic appendicitis is present.

Alternatively, many argue that performing an appendicectomy on a macroscopically normal appendix may be unwarranted. Removing a normal appendix exposes patients to potential complications, including surgical site infections, intra-abdominal abscesses, prolonged ileus, enterocutaneous fistulas, and small bowel obstruction. Weighing the risk of needing a future repeat laparoscopy for appendicitis against conducting a potentially avoidable procedure during the initial surgery is crucial.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic appendectomy for macroscopically normal appendices in children with suspected acute appendicitis, focusing on the correlation between gross features and histopathological findings of the excised specimens.

Online prescriptions for obesity medications and compounded semaglutide/tirzepatide — AACE's position and FDA cautions emphasize that online prescription of obesity medications per se, operating without involvement of health care professionals for initial evaluation and follow-up, represents substandard care and places individuals at risk, and whether follow-up involves in-person visits or telehealth, the involvement of trained health care professionals is required. Compounded alternatives to FDA-approved semaglutide and tirzepatide are often dispensed via online pharmacies, and AACE advises against the use of these agents; compounded drugs, however, are not approved by the FDA; thus, without verification of safety, effectiveness, or quality before they are marketed, these pose a higher risk to individuals than drugs approved by the FDA. An analysis of compounded preparations has demonstrated inaccurately labeled concentrations, impurities, other high molecular weight peptides, trace metals, residual solvents, and neopeptides with potential immunogenicity, and the FDA has recommended caution over the use of compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide because of overdosing and hospitalizations; in addition, the FDA has presented demonstrable difficulties for compounding under sections 503A or 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that would prohibit compounding those medications.

### Tirzepatide cardiovascular event risk assessment: a pre-specified meta-analysis [^e06607eb]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Tirzepatide is a novel, once weekly, dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist and is under development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Its association with cardiovascular outcomes requires evaluation. This pre-specified cardiovascular meta-analysis included all seven randomized controlled trials with a duration of at least 26 weeks from the tirzepatide T2D clinical development program, SURPASS. The pre-specified primary objective of this meta-analysis was the comparison of the time to first occurrence of confirmed four-component major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-4; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalized unstable angina) between pooled tirzepatide groups and control groups. A stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with treatment as a fixed effect and trial-level cardiovascular risk as the stratification factor, was used for the estimation of hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) comparing tirzepatide to control. Data from 4,887 participants treated with tirzepatide and 2,328 control participants were analyzed. Overall, 142 participants, 109 from the trial with high cardiovascular risk and 33 from the six trials with lower cardiovascular risk, had at least one MACE-4 event. The HRs comparing tirzepatide versus controls were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.57–1.11) for MACE-4; 0.90 (95% CI, 0.50–1.61) for cardiovascular death; and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.51–1.25) for all-cause death. No evidence of effect modifications was observed for any subgroups, although the evidence was stronger for participants with high cardiovascular risk. Tirzepatide did not increase the risk of major cardiovascular events in participants with T2D versus controls.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^8b43c220]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Incretin mimetics are glucose‐lowering medications widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), originally developed based on the glucose‐ and weight‐reducing effects of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1). The newest addition to this class is tirzepatide, the first unimolecular co‐agonist acting on both GLP‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. While the additive effect of GIP receptor agonism is still being explored, newer incretin mimetics generally show greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) developed earlier.

Head‐to‐head comparisons, and network meta‐analyses, have shown significant variations in the efficacy of the incretin mimetics in reducing HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight reductions, which have informed their differential use based on individual patient needs. However, another important consideration that influences the selection of these agents is the risk for adverse events (AEs), particularly gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Potential differences in the GI AEs and their relationship with therapeutic efficacy across trials have not received the same attention and have not — so far — been systematically explored.

To address this knowledge gap, the current study compares therapeutic efficacy (i.e. effect size for intended therapeutic actions — HbA1c and body weight reduction), the risk of GI AE versus placebo treatment and their correlation across phase 3 and 4 randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials studying various incretin‐based glucose‐lowering agents used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

### Tirzepatide after intensive lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity: the SURMOUNT-3 phase 3 trial [^fcda2471]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Safety

Overall, 87.1% of the 287 tirzepatide-treated participants reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event compared with 76.7% of the 292 placebo-treated participants (Table 3). The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea and constipation). These occurred in more participants in the tirzepatide MTD group than placebo, were mostly mild to moderate in severity and occurred primarily during dose escalation (Extended Data Fig. 3). Antiemetic medication use was reported by 78 participants (27.2%) treated with tirzepatide and by 20 (6.8%) treated with placebo. Antidiarrheal medication use was reported by 23 participants (8.0%) treated with tirzepatide and by six (2.1%) treated with placebo.

Serious adverse events were reported by 31 participants (5.4%) overall. Occurrence was similar in participants treated with tirzepatide (5.9%) and placebo (4.8%) (Table 3). Two deaths (both myocardial infarction) were reported during the study, one in the tirzepatide MTD group and one in the placebo group. Both events were considered not to be related to the study treatment by the investigator.

Adjudication-confirmed cases of pancreatitis were reported in 0.3% (one) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD group and 0.3% (one) of participants in the placebo group from randomization to safety follow-up (Table 3). Cholelithiasis was reported in 1.4% (four) of participants in the tirzepatide group and 1.0% (three) of participants in the placebo group. There was one case (0.3%) of acute cholecystitis in the tirzepatide group and none in the placebo group. Malignancies were reported in 1.7% (five) of participants in the tirzepatide MTD group and 1.0% (three) of participants in the placebo group. None of the malignancies were considered related to the study treatment by the investigators, and no cases of medullary thyroid cancer or pancreatic cancer were reported. Additional safety measures are reported in Extended Data Table 3.

### Gastrointestinal tolerability and weight reduction associated with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight with and without type 2 diabetes in the SURMOUNT-1 to-4 trials [^a913de3e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This analysis evaluated whether gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs) including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (N/V/D) and dyspepsia were associated with weight reduction with tirzepatide across the SURMOUNT-1 to -4 trials.

Materials and Methods

SURMOUNT-1 to -4 were global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide among participants with obesity or overweight with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Participants were randomly assigned to receive once weekly subcutaneous tirzepatide or placebo. This post hoc analysis investigated weight change at the primary endpoint from baseline among participants who self-reported no N/V/D, any N/V/D or nausea alone. Mediation analyses evaluated the contribution of N/V/D and dyspepsia on weight reduction. Time to first use of antidiarrheal and antiemetic usage was reported by time intervals.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between participants who reported N/V/D and those who did not. More participants reported GI AEs in the tirzepatide treatment arms (27.8%-72.8%) than with placebo (12.2%-32.5%). Most GI AEs were non-serious and occurred during dose escalation. Between 1.0% and 10.5% of tirzepatide-treated participants discontinued treatment due to GI AEs. Weight reduction with tirzepatide was similar among participants reporting no nausea, nausea alone, or any N/V/D. Mediation analyses suggested that N/V/D and dyspepsia were associated with up to 3.1% of total weight reduction. When required, first use of antidiarrheal and antiemetic medication was most commonly reported during dose escalation.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, GI AEs appeared to contribute slightly to the weight reduction seen with tirzepatide in participants with obesity or overweight with or without T2D.
