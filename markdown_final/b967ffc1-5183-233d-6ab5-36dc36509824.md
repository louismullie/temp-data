Rash description

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a structured approach to describing and evaluating rashes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational definition and why precise description matters. Then, I should verify the core morphologic categories and how they guide urgency. Next, I will examine distribution, evolution, and associated symptoms. After that, I need to consider special populations and high-risk contexts. Finally, I will integrate a practical documentation template and highlight red flags that mandate immediate action, making sure each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't gloss over basics: a rash is a change in skin texture or color that may be red, warm, scaly, bumpy, dry, itchy, swollen, or painful, and it can be localized or generalized; importantly, morphology and distribution are the primary clues to etiology and severity, so I need to ensure I capture these accurately in every description [^eb2fcd77].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I classify morphology, because morphology drives the differential and triage; the emergency medicine framework divides rashes into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous categories, and this stratification helps surface life-threatening entities like meningococcemia, SJS/TEN, and toxic shock early in the evaluation [^7565e82b].

> I will now examine petechial or purpuric rashes, since these are the most time-sensitive; they reflect bleeding into the skin and mandate urgent evaluation for sepsis, vasculitis, or coagulopathy, with dengue, chikungunya, and Zika as key travel-associated causes where widespread petechiae carry diagnostic and prognostic weight, so I should confirm platelets, coagulation, and systemic status promptly [^189c2603] [^5656e42d].

> Wait, let me verify the vesiculobullous category next, because blisters with mucosal involvement push me toward SJS/TEN, pemphigus, or pemphigoid; in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitors, any bullous eruption warrants holding therapy and considering immunopathology, whereas in children I should distinguish benign viral vesicles from dangerous entities like congenital infection or SSSS, and in adults I must keep drug-induced causes high on the list [^4b1c093b] [^960c77ba] [^e1af51e1].

> Let me consider maculopapular eruptions carefully; they are common but nonspecific, often drug-induced or viral, and I should double-check timing relative to new medications and systemic symptoms. COVID-19 frequently produces maculopapular rashes that can be the first or only symptom, and gemcitabine-based regimens can cause a characteristic lateral trunk–predominant maculopapular rash, so distribution and chronology help refine the differential [^dbb0daae] [^664ef6cb].

> I need to check erythematous or urticarial patterns as well; urticaria can signal IgE-mediated drug allergy or viral immune complexes, and in COVID-19, urticarial eruptions cluster with more severe disease, so I should confirm airway involvement and systemic features while reviewing medications and exposures [^ea658931] [^696922f5].

> Next, I should review distribution and evolution, because these often crack the case; measles starts on the face and spreads caudally, Zika tends to be maculopapular with centrifugal spread and sometimes petechiae on the legs, herpes zoster is dermatomal and does not cross the midline, and mpox in the 2022–23 outbreak frequently involved anogenital and oropharyngeal sites with fewer lesions overall, so I should map the rash precisely and ask about prodrome and mucosal pain [^8acd9c68] [^b940000d] [^7ea0d0de] [^ac8ab837].

> But wait, what if the patient is a newborn, pregnant, immunocompromised, or on targeted therapy; I need to ensure I tailor the evaluation. In newborns, pustules or vesicles can herald serious infection, in pregnancy measles carries higher morbidity, in oncology patients EGFR inhibitors commonly cause papulopustular rashes that correlate with efficacy but require proactive management, and in ICI therapy I should anticipate early-onset rashes and escalate to dermatology for bullae or mucosal disease [^e1af51e1] [^43dff1dc] [^392eb09e] [^f1ae1cdc].

> I should double-check associated symptoms because they pivot the pretest probabilities; fever with petechiae pushes me toward sepsis or hemorrhagic viral illness, fever with mucosal erosions suggests SJS/TEN, pruritus supports drug eruption or scabies, arthralgia and conjunctivitis steer me to Zika, and neurologic deficits with a rash broaden to entities like West Nile or even CNS-driven vascular dysregulation, so I must ask about systemic and mucosal involvement explicitly [^189c2603] [^b940000d] [^9b05512a] [^b67d04a8].

> Let me think about a practical documentation template so I don't miss key elements: I should record morphology (macule, papule, vesicle, bulla, pustule, plaque, nodule, ulcer, petechia, purpura), distribution (localized, generalized, dermatomal, acral, flexural, extensor, truncal, anogenital, mucosal), evolution (onset, progression, pruritus, pain, fever, mucosal involvement), and context (new drugs, travel, exposures, contacts, immunizations, comorbidities), because this structured approach aligns with emergency and primary care frameworks and supports accurate coding and communication [^7565e82b] [^57b64ad2].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate immediate action so I don't under-triage: any petechial or purpuric rash with fever, rapidly progressive blistering with mucosal involvement, diffuse erythroderma with systemic instability, or a rash in a toxic-appearing patient should trigger urgent evaluation for sepsis, SJS/TEN, toxic shock, or severe drug reactions, with early involvement of dermatology and critical care as indicated [^7565e82b] [^4b1c093b] [^fc998c52].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include a table of morphologies and exemplars here, but I should confirm that I am not overgeneralizing; given the heterogeneity and the need to anchor to clinical context, I will instead emphasize that morphology plus distribution plus evolution plus systemic features together drive the diagnosis, and I will cite the emergency and primary care algorithms that operationalize this approach rather than impose a rigid table that could mislead in atypical cases [^7565e82b] [^57b64ad2].

> In summary, I need to ensure my rash description is precise, complete, and prioritized: define morphology, map distribution, chronicle evolution, screen for associated symptoms, and contextualize with exposures and host factors; this disciplined approach accelerates diagnosis, surfaces dangerous entities early, and guides timely management, and it is consistently endorsed across emergency medicine, primary care, and specialty guidelines [^7565e82b] [^57b64ad2] [^4b1c093b].

A rash is a **change in skin appearance** [^eb2fcd77] with alterations in color, texture, or elevation, and may involve itching, pain, or scaling. Rashes can be **localized or generalized** [^36efc081] and vary widely in morphology, including maculopapular, vesicular, petechial, urticarial, or pustular forms [^7565e82b]. They arise from diverse causes such as infections (e.g. measles, varicella, COVID-19, mpox) [^8acd9c68] [^dbb0daae] [^ac8ab837], drug reactions [^3de8c411], autoimmune diseases, and environmental exposures [^57b64ad2]. Evaluation should prioritize **morphology, distribution, and associated symptoms** [^57b64ad2] to guide diagnosis and management, with red flags (e.g. mucosal involvement, systemic illness) prompting urgent care [^7565e82b].

---

## Morphological classification

Rashes are classified by **morphology**, which helps narrow the differential [^7565e82b]:

| **Morphology** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Maculopapular | Flat or slightly raised erythematous lesions | - Measles [^8acd9c68] <br/> - Rubella <br/> - Drug eruptions [^3de8c411] |
| Vesicular | Fluid-filled blisters | - Varicella [^7ea0d0de] <br/> - Herpes simplex <br/> - COVID-19 vesicular eruptions [^e41088c4] |
| Petechial/purpuric | Small, non-blanching hemorrhagic lesions | - Meningococcemia <br/> - Dengue [^189c2603] <br/> - Vasculitis [^5656e42d] |
| Urticarial | Raised, itchy wheals with transient borders | - Allergic reactions <br/> - Hives [^ea658931] |
| Pustular | Pus-filled lesions | - Acne <br/> - Folliculitis <br/> - AGEP [^ecb0974f] |

---

## Common causes

Rashes result from a broad range of etiologies, including:

- **Infectious diseases**: Measles, rubella, varicella, herpes zoster, COVID-19 [^dbb0daae], mpox [^ac8ab837], dengue, Zika [^b940000d].
- **Drug reactions**: Maculopapular eruptions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, AGEP [^3de8c411] [^ecb0974f].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, vasculitis [^7c8ba1d1].
- **Environmental exposures**: Contact dermatitis, heat rash, insect bites [^57b64ad2].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough evaluation should include:

- **History**: Onset, duration, progression, associated symptoms (fever, pruritus, pain), recent exposures (travel, medications, contacts) [^57b64ad2].
- **Physical examination**: Distribution, morphology, mucosal involvement, systemic signs [^7565e82b].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers, serologies, cultures, biopsy when indicated [^58484bf6].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent attention

Certain features **warrant immediate evaluation**:

- **Mucosal involvement**: Suggests severe drug reactions (SJS/TEN) [^4b1c093b].
- **Systemic illness**: Fever, hypotension, altered mental status [^ee7d974c].
- **Rapid progression**: Rapidly spreading lesions or necrosis [^5656e42d].
- **Immunocompromised state**: Increased risk of severe infections and complications [^e1af51e1].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Supportive care**: Antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, emollients, analgesics [^notfound].
- **Specific therapies**: Antivirals, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, discontinuation of offending drugs [^8ff89d92].
- **Patient education**: Avoidance of triggers, adherence to treatment, recognition of warning signs [^c2ef4585].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause and severity**. Most viral exanthems resolve spontaneously, whereas severe drug reactions or systemic diseases may cause significant morbidity or mortality. Complications include secondary infections, scarring, and systemic organ involvement [^4a615e49].

---

A rash is a visible skin change with diverse causes; **careful morphologic assessment and clinical correlation** are essential for diagnosis and management, with urgent action for severe or systemic features [^7565e82b].

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^7565e82b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^57b64ad2]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### HER1 / EGFR inhibitor-associated rash: future directions for management and investigation outcomes from the HER1 / EGFR inhibitor rash management forum [^91ac588b]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

Skin rash associated with HER1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is common. The lack of clinical and patient guidance for this often chronic and sometimes distressing side effect makes rash management and etiology investigation high priorities. To address this, oncologists and dermatologists with experience with HER1/EGFR inhibitors attended the HER1/EGFR Inhibitor Rash Management Forum. Recommendations include continued analysis of the correlation between rash and clinical outcome and improving the accuracy and reproducibility of terminology and grading systems. Because acne vulgaris has a unique pathology, and the pathology and etiology of rash are unclear yet distinct from acne vulgaris, using such terms as acne, acne-like, or acneiform should be avoided. Until there is a specific dermatological definition, rash is best described using phenotypic terms for its appearance and location. It is currently unknown which agents are best for treating rash. Clinical trials of rash treatments are urgently required, and suggestions for agents to consider are made based on current knowledge. The effect of dose reduction or interruption on rash should also be investigated. Secondarily infected rash may be more frequent than has been previously recognized, and some investigators favor empiric use of an oral antibiotic if this appears to be the case. Suggestions for patients include makeup to camouflage the rash and an emollient to prevent and alleviate skin dryness. The increasing use of HER1/EGFR-targeted agents makes managing rash important. We hope the outcomes from this Forum provide background for future studies.

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^7c45ce7e]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The accurate diagnosis and proper management of D-irAEs, as well as development of prevention strategies, are challenging because of the lack of specific, standardized disease definitions and severity grading criteria that capture the heterogeneity of possible manifestations. For example, rash is typically reported as maculopapular, a non-specific eruption, which may be due to the lack of guidance in the CTCAE for classifying specific subtypes. Making an accurate diagnosis of rash subtype is critical for effective D-irAE treatment and for predicting rash associated morbidity/mortality risk; thus, diagnosing the D-irAE subtype may impact ICI management. Moreover, preventing the progression of toxicity may reduce the risk of ICI interruption, discontinuation, and use of systemic immunosuppression.

Here, we report disease definitions for diagnosis and severity grading of D-irAEs. The definitions were developed through a Delphi consensus process similar to that which recently resulted in the first disease definitions for neurologic irAEs, in partnership with Project Data Sphere, an independent, not-for-profit initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer. Guidance statements and descriptions are presented for dermatologic disease categories organized by most to least commonly reported. In addition to supporting diagnosis and clinical management, these definitions will improve the documentation of D-irAEs in ICI clinical trials, which often relies on non-dermatologists to assess and grade cutaneous toxicities. Precise definitions will also advance the clinical, histological, and immunophenotypical characterization of D-irAEs in clinical/translational research cohorts.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^5a1cb21f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^d627ac93]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated rash and therapeutic response: "One of the observations made by early clinical investigators was the correlation between the development of rash and response to EGFR therapy," and "if rash proved to be a clinical marker for response, it would offer patients a motivating factor to work through the rash associated with the first 2 months of therapy in order to establish drug efficacy." Although "mixed," "the bulk of data would tend to support the correlation between rash and outcomes in patients treated with EGFR therapy," with "Positive correlations between rash and outcome" reported for "cetuximab," "erlotinib," "gefitinib," and "panitumumab." "Data support not only an increase in response but an increase in survival for those patients experiencing a rash."

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^5656e42d]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^f1ae1cdc]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related skin toxicity and rash — timing and incidence indicate that dermatological toxicities are one of the most common categories of irAE and are also one of the earliest to appear, at an average of 3–4 weeks after the start of treatment. Patients treated with ICIs commonly develop rashes, although these rashes do not frequently rise to grade ≥ 3 severity, and patients develop rashes at a rate of 23% (1% grade ≥ 3), 10% (< 1% grade ≥ 3), and 41% (5% grade ≥ 3) in response to therapy with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-(L)1, and combination ICI therapies, respectively. Rash typically presents early in treatment, with onset from 2–5 weeks after first ICI treatment, and rash is often accompanied by pruritus.

### Fever and rash [^ee7d974c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^960c77ba]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Mpox surveillance based on rash characteristics-13 emergency departments, United States, June-December 2023 [^dd2eac89]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Enrollment Qualifications

A multicenter observational mpox surveillance project was conducted at 13 ED hospital sites. § During June–December 2023, patients aged ≥ 3 months evaluated in a participating ED with an mpox-compatible rash, defined as one or more lesions that appeared pustular, vesicular, crusted, or ulcerated, were enrolled. A qualifying rash was the only entry criterion; epidemiologic mpox risk factors and other illness characteristics were not considered inclusion criteria. Site coordinators received instruction and ongoing feedback regarding rash identification and characterization from project principal and site investigator physicians. Exclusion criteria included the following conditions: 1) previous enrollment, 2) predesignated as not wishing to participate in research, 3) not English- or Spanish-speaking, 4) unable to provide consent, 5) rash present for > 4 weeks, and 6) only lesions > 2 cm in diameter, excluding erythema.

During the enrollment visit, demographic, historical, and illness characteristics were collected through patient (or parent) and clinician questionnaires; electronic health record review was completed 5–7 days after the enrollment visit. Two skin swabs were collected from lesions located on different body sites (when possible) from each patient. Swabs were tested at UCLA Clinical Microbiology Laboratory by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that included targets for both nonvariola orthopoxvirus and monkeypox virus.

Assessment of Sensitivity of Case Finding

To assess case-finding sensitivity and characterize differences between enrolled and eligible nonenrolled patients, project sites performed monthly audits of project-qualifying nonenrolled ED patients and those receiving hospital mpox PCR testing based on the ED provider's clinical and epidemiologic suspicion during the patient's usual ED care, which occurred independently of the solely rash-based mpox surveillance project. Audit lists included project-eligible ED patients with rash associated with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes R21 (rash and other nonspecific skin eruption), B00 (herpesviral [herpes simplex] infections), B01 (varicella [chickenpox]), B02 (zoster [herpes zoster]), B03 (smallpox), B04 (monkeypox), and B08 (other viral infections characterized by skin and mucous membrane lesions), and with usual-care mpox PCR testing orders. Demographic and illness characteristics of enrolled and eligible nonenrolled patients were compared.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^fc998c52]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^dbb0daae]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

One of the challenging aspects of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is its diverse multisystemic disease presentation.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and investigate their duration and timing in relation to other COVID‐19 symptoms.

Methods

We used data from 336 847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app to assess the diagnostic value of body rash or an acral rash in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and data from an independent online survey of 11 544 respondents to investigate skin‐specific symptoms and collect their photographs.

Results

Using data from the app, we show significant association between skin rashes and a positive swab test result (odds ratio 1·67, 95% confidence interval 1·42–1·97). Strikingly, among the respondents of the independent online survey, we found that 17% of SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive cases reported skin rashes as the first presentation, and 21% as the only clinical sign of COVID‐19. Together with the British Association of Dermatologists, we have compiled a catalogue of images of the most common skin manifestations of COVID‐19 from 400 individuals, which we have made publicly available to assist clinicians in recognition of this early clinical feature of COVID‐19.

Conclusions

Skin rashes cluster with other COVID‐19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test, and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognizing rashes is important in identifying new and earlier cases of COVID‐19.

### Description of the first global outbreak of mpox: an analysis of global surveillance data [^ac8ab837]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The 2022–23 epidemic is the largest-ever documented outbreak of mpox in terms of magnitude and geographical spread. Our results provide insights into its epidemiology and highlight features not previously documented. These insights include differences in regional trends, risk factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics among regions and settings.

This mpox outbreak, related to clade IIb MPXV and reported in mostly newly affected countries to have spread mainly among MSM, has been sustained by human-to-human transmission through sexual contact in various settings.

Many reported cases show a different clinical presentation than previously documented; the clinical presentations are less severe, a smaller proportion of the cases report symptoms during the prodromal phase, the eruptive phase has been marked by more anogenital and oropharyngeal lesions, and there has been less frequent generalised rash than previously reported. Differences in skin lesion morphology probably stem from differences in routes and intensity of exposure — supported by our findings indicating greater frequency of genital rash in men aged 18 years and older. More research is needed to better understand whether the often different clinical presentation than documented in the past is linked to heightened surveillance and better detection, lower viral load, mode of transmission and site of virus entry, specific characteristics of the current outbreak and clade, mild disease going undetected in Africa, or a combination of these factors.

Fever and rash in returned travelers — differential diagnosis and dengue features state that fever and rash are most often, but not always, due to viral infections; bacterial infections, parasitic infections, systemic fungal infections, and some noninfectious conditions can also cause fever and rash; if the rash is characterized by petechiae/purpura or by abundant vesicles, pustules, or widespread blisters, the evaluation should be prompt and thorough; dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are viral diseases transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes and often present as undifferentiated fevers, and rashes — particularly widespread petechial eruptions — provide important diagnostic information, with viral illnesses often occurring in small outbreaks; dengue is characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, frontal headache, and myalgia, a widespread but faint macular rash may appear 2–4 days after illness onset, and a petechial rash may occur in classic and severe dengue.

### A retrospective study on the incidence, management and risk factors of skin rash in patients with advanced prostate cancer in Japan [^a1f59b89]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study variables

Patient baseline characteristics were determined at the index date and included age, height, weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), PSA value, and previous treatment for PC (e.g. radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy) before the index date. For each cohort, descriptive statistics were calculated for the baseline characteristics, skin rash incidence, type of skin rash treatment and counts of prescribed medicines for the management of skin rash; and duration of skin rash treatments by administration route. Oral antihistamine, systemic corticosteroid, and topical corticosteroid were the administration routes considered to treat skin rash. For all administration routes, the last consecutive treatment was defined by either no diagnosis/rash treatment, or a treatment gap of more than 90 days from the end of the skin rash treatment designated for each drug formulation. The end of skin rash treatment for oral antihistamine was set to the end of the prescribed period. The prescribed period started at the date of the prescription and ended one day before the end of the prescribed period. For systemic corticosteroids, the prescription date was assumed to be the last day of the prescribed period. For topical corticosteroids, it was assumed a prescription would be provided for 28 days. This assumption was based on expert opinion. Similar to oral administration, the prescribed period ended one day before. The study outcomes assessed with their description are outlined in Table 2.

### Classification and management of adult inflammatory myopathies [^7c8ba1d1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory myopathies, collectively known as myositis, are heterogeneous disorders characterised by muscle inflammation, and frequently accompanied by extramuscular manifestations that affect the skin, lung, and joints. Patients with inflammatory myopathies were previously classified as having dermatomyositis if characteristic rashes accompanied the muscle involvement, and as having polymyositis if no rashes were present. Five main types of inflammatory myopathies are now widely recognised: dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotising myopathy, sporadic inclusion-body myositis, overlap myositis (including antisynthetase syndrome), and polymyositis. The discovery of autoantibodies that are specifically associated with characteristic clinical phenotypes has been instrumental to the understanding of inflammatory myopathies. Treatment is still largely based on expert opinion, but several studies have shown effectiveness of different therapies in various subsets of inflammatory myopathies. These advances will undoubtedly improve the outcomes of patients with inflammatory myopathies.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^8ff9b340]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Mpox surveillance based on rash characteristics-13 emergency departments, United States, June-December 2023 [^1b9e5457]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Rash Characteristics

Enrollees had a median of 10 lesions, with a median lesion diameter of 0.5 cm (Table 2). Rashes were described as vesicular (50.5%), crusted (41.8%), pustular (27.0%), and ulcerated (22.5%). Twelve (6.1%) participants were assessed by their treating ED clinician as being likely or very likely to have mpox as the cause of their rash, and 13 enrollees (6.6%) underwent usual-care testing for mpox.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^0b5b6633]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

One of the challenging aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection is its diverse multisystemic disease presentation.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate their duration and timing in relation to other COVID-19 symptoms.

Methods

We used data from 336 847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app to assess the diagnostic value of body rash or an acral rash in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and data from an independent online survey of 11 544 respondents to investigate skin-specific symptoms and collect their photographs.

Results

Using data from the app, we show significant association between skin rashes and a positive swab test result (odds ratio 1·67, 95% confidence interval 1·42–1·97). Strikingly, among the respondents of the independent online survey, we found that 17% of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases reported skin rashes as the first presentation, and 21% as the only clinical sign of COVID-19. Together with the British Association of Dermatologists, we have compiled a catalogue of images of the most common skin manifestations of COVID-19 from 400 individuals (https://covidskinsigns.com), which we have made publicly available to assist clinicians in recognition of this early clinical feature of COVID-19.

Conclusions

Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test, and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognizing rashes is important in identifying new and earlier cases of COVID-19.

### Viral exanthems [^4a615e49]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Determining the viral cause of a rash presents significant diagnostic challenges. We review contemporary literature on viral exanthems and suggest a structured approach to aid diagnosis.

Recent Findings

Strains responsible for, and the clinical presentation of, enteroviral infections have diverged from classic descriptions. The causative relationship between antibiotic administration and rash in Epstein-Barr virus infection has been recently questioned. Major measles virus outbreaks have recently occurred in Europe and the USA. The largest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has resulted in importation of the virus to other countries and secondary local transmission. Autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya virus has occurred in nonendemic areas, including Europe, the Caribbean and Americas. Zika virus has re-emerged in the Pacific with local transmission from imported cases. Climate change, global warming and spillover of zoonotic viruses are contributing to the emergence and spread of viral diseases.

Summary

Important clues to the diagnosis of viral exanthems include their distribution and morphology, geographic location and potential exposure to vector-borne or blood-borne viruses. Diagnosis is commonly made via serology, nucleic acid tests or, rarely, viral culture. Skin biopsy is not usually required. In general, viral exanthems are self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

### SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, skin and immunology-what do we know so far? [^ea658931]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Drug‐induced urticarial rashes

Urticaria and urticarial rashes belong at least in part to cutaneous type I (IgE‐mediated) drug hypersensitivity reactions (Table 3) (Figure 7). Other mechanisms involved in drug‐induced urticarial rashes are direct mast cell activation, immune complex formation/precipitation (Figure 7) and activation of complement during serum sickness, or interaction with metabolic pathways of drugs such as arachidonic acid metabolism. Urticaria or urticarial rashes in SARS‐CoV‐2 patients could be drug‐induced, induced by viral RNA or a mixture of both. Infection‐associated reactivation or exacerbation of preexisting urticaria might be possible as well.

Drug‐induced maculopapular exanthema

In general, about 7% of hospitalized patients develop drug hypersensitivity reactions of variable severity, and exanthema occurs in 2%‐3% of these cases.

Both, drugs and metabolites of drugs might elicit exanthematous drug hypersensitivity reactions (Table 4).

TABLE 4
Common and less common cutaneous (drug) eruptions (modified from), which have also been described in COVID‐19 patients

Maculopapular exanthema with eosinophilia has been described in COVID‐19 patients.

Some skin lesions observed in COVID‐19 patients might result from cutaneous type IV (T‐cell mediated) drug hypersensitivity reactions. Typical immunologic characteristics of maculopapular eruptions are summarized in Figure 5B (type IVb) and 5C (type IVc), and histologic features are summarized in Table 5 and shown in Figure 6B. The most common histologic feature of drug‐induced maculopapular exanthema is a perivascular dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with or without infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes. The epidermis can be normal or exhibit interface changes with vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, apoptotic keratinocytes, and exocytosis of lymphocytes can be present. Additional features can be edema in the upper dermis, extravasation of red blood cells, and dilatation of blood vessels. It is often impossible to histologically distinguish viral and drug‐induced exanthema. Lichenoid — and less frequently — spongiotic or psoriasiform pattern of reactions may be related to maculopapular drug reactions. Sometimes even systemic eosinophilia and elevated CRP levels might occur. Typical immunologic characteristics of maculopapular eruptions are summarized in Figure 5B (type IVb) and 5C (type IVc), and histologic features are summarized in Table 5 and shown on Figure 6B.

### Dose escalation to rash for erlotinib plus gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer: the phase II RACHEL study [^048419f6]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Retrospective analyses have also highlighted relationships between rash and efficacy in pancreatic cancer. Patients treated with erlotinib plus gemcitabine classified as having 'high' severity rash had significantly longer OS/PFS than their 'low' severity counterparts (OS: median 7.58 vs 5.03 months; P = 0.0339; PFS: median 2.4 vs 2.0 months; P = 0.0485). Another retrospective study indicated that erlotinib-induced grade 1 and grade ⩾2 rash were correlated with improved OS (HR, 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50–1.00 and HR, 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40–0.82, respectively; P = 0.007), although adjusting for baseline characteristics removed the significance (HR, 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49–0.97 and adjusted HR, 0.78, 95% CI: 0.48–1.2, respectively). In the present study, the slight tendency of dose-escalated patients to have negative prognostic factors (ECOG PS 1; pancreatic cancer pain; pancreatic tail tumours) may have contributed to the lack of difference seen between the randomised groups.

The key difference between the RACHEL trial and previous pancreatic cancer trials was the aspect of using erlotinib dose escalation to induce rash. A phase II NSCLC study, a disease where a relationship with rash is well established, employed the 'dose-to-rash' strategy and also demonstrated no correlation of erlotinib exposure with tumour response. In RACHEL, the OS was also not statistically different between the group of patients who developed a grade ⩾2 rash 'naturally' after 4 weeks, and those in whom rash was induced by dose escalation (HR, 1.03, 95% CI: 0.74–1.43; P = 0.8449). However, the patients with 'natural' grade ⩾2 rash were not randomised, and the analysis was not adjusted for baseline characteristics. Although the rash may appear be more severe in the non-randomised grade ⩾2 'natural' rash group (18.1% grade 3 or 4 rash, compared with 4.2% and 0% in the two randomised groups), this is not surprising, given that the non-randomised group will have a greater probability of grade 3 or 4 rash by virtue of their randomisation criteria (all grade ⩾2 rash).

### Characteristics of the rash associated with west nile virus fever [^9b05512a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We characterized rash in 15 patients with West Nile virus (WNV) fever. Generalized, maculopapular rash typically occurred on days 5–12 of illness. Dysesthesia was reported by 27% of patients, and pruritus by 33% of patients. Because the rash was nonspecific and serologic test results were often negative for WNV at presentation, convalescent-phase testing was frequently required to diagnose WNV fever.

### Laboratory testing for the monkeypox virus: interim guidance [^96afaa25]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.

### Surveillance, case investigation and contact tracing for monkeypox [^6703cc4c]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for mpox, more specifically with respect to networking and reporting, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to include the following information as a minimum in case reports:

- date of the report

- reporting location

- name, age, gender, and residence of case

- date of onset of first symptoms

- date of fever onset

- date of rash onset

- recent travel history (in the 5–21 days before the onset of illness)

- recent exposure to a probable or confirmed case (in the 5–21 days before the onset of illness)

- relationship and nature of contact with the probable or confirmed case (where relevant)

- recent history of multiple or anonymous sexual partners (in the 5–21 days before the onset of illness)

- occupation (including whether health worker)

- smallpox vaccination status

- presence of rash

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^5f9616e7]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Different D-irAEs may also portend an elevated level of risk for the future development of other non-dermatologic irAEs. A recent study found that nearly half of patients who developed a D-irAE also had a non-dermatologic irAE, and in most cases, the D-irAE preceded other irAEs. Although the relationship between D-irAEs and other toxicities needs further study, it may be that patients with a D-irAE should be monitored more closely for the development of gastrointestinal, endocrine, and other irAEs, and this may allow for earlier detection and improved management of these toxicities.

In addition to the clinical setting, specific diagnoses of D-irAEs are critical for accurate data capture in clinical trials and for research involving data from trials. To date, the lack of specificity in the reporting of D-irAEs, especially in clinical trials, has created challenges in understanding the incidence of specific clinical morphologies and outcomes associated with these. The lack of specificity is due to a multitude of factors. An obvious challenge remains the absence of specific morphologies within the CTCAE. These have evolved to be more inclusive over the last several versions, making it possible to diagnose acneiform eruptions, among other specific toxicities. Even so, the limits of CTCAE are highlighted in that certain toxicities may be graded relatively lower despite severe morphologies, such as erosive mucocutaneous reactions or bullous pemphigoid, where less body surface area may be affected but erosions, mucosal damage or systemic symptoms may severely impact patient quality of life. Additionally, some presentations are still notably absent (psoriasis/psoriasiform eruptions) and thus are captured as non-specific rashes (most commonly 'maculopapular rash' in most clinical trial data. Additionally, clinicians need to have the knowledge to identify and label rash subtypes for specificity to be reported; to date, this has required dermatology training or involvement of dermatologists in clinical trials or clinical care. In the absence of someone familiar with the examination evaluating the full skin surface, eruptions are often collapsed as 'maculopapular rash'.While this diagnosis may mean the specific morphologic pattern of a morbilliform eruption to a BCD, it could be guttate psoriasis, lichenoid dermatitis, eczematous eruptions, or Grover's disease to a non-BCD. Given this historical challenge with the use of the term 'maculopapular rash' to encompass all eruptions that have any macules or papules, the consensus panel settled on the term ICI-exanthem to capture the type IV delayed type hypersensitivity eruption that presents as a true maculopapular or morbilliform eruption. The use of the term maculopapular or its exclusion sparked considerable debate throughout the process, although ultimately consensus was reached. While maculopapular will still be undoubtedly used, ideally, it will be applied less frequently in cases where the specific D-irAE core diagnosis can be made. In addition to the relevance to clinical care and clinical trials, detailed and rigorous clinical phenotyping is essential for many areas of genomic and translational research. Having standardized clinical descriptions can allow for improved natural language text searching and have an impact on the characterization of paired blood and tissue samples. The rigorous classification may allow for the development of specific non-invasive blood biomarkers that have the potential to serve as predictive, diagnostic, and potentially even therapeutic targets that will personalize treatment. We hope the framework presented herein can assist clinicians as well as research personnel in the evaluation of a potential D-irAE related to a trial drug or in routine clinical practice, rendering a specific diagnosis whenever possible.

### Skin rash and good performance status predict improved survival with gefitinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^a94e6f27]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Gefitinib (Iressa) is active as a single agent in the treatment of select patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The clinical characteristics of patients treated with gefitinib on an Expanded Access Program (EAP) at our institution identified predictive variables associated with better outcome.

Patients and Methods

Patients (n = 199) with advanced NSCLC were treated with gefitinib (250 mg) upon progression with chemotherapy. Baseline patient characteristics were: median age, 69 years; males, 57%; adenocarcinoma, 56%.

Results

Partial responses were noted in two patients (1%) and disease stabilization in 66 (35%) patients. The median survival (MS) was 5.9 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1–7.1] and median time to progression was 3 months (95% CI 2.0–3.0). The predictive factors analyzed were gender, skin rash, diarrhea, tumor histology and performance status (PS). Patients who developed skin rash (any grade) had MS of 10.8 months versus 4.0 months for those without rash (P < 0.0001, log rank test). Patients with PS 0, 1 and 2 had MS of 8.4, 6.2 and 2.8 months, respectively (P < 0.0002). The other factors did not impact survival.

Conclusions

Occurrence of skin rash and baseline PS of 0/1 were associated with improved survival with gefitinib for recurrent NSCLC patients at our institution.

### Characteristic distribution of maculopapular rash caused by gemcitabine-based chemotherapy [^664ef6cb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Skin toxicity induced by gemcitabine, a chemotherapeutic agent, is not rare, but is usually mild. However, the occurrence of moderate to severe skin rash has been reported in patients treated with combinations of gemcitabine and other anticancer drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of rash caused by gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. We analyzed 12 patients who developed maculopapular rash over more than 10% of their body surface following gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Maculopapular rash appeared at 6.3 ± 1.3 days after the first administration in eight patients and the second administration in four patients. In two patients, the rash was localized on the lateral aspect of the trunk. The other 10 patients showed various degrees of rash on the chest and abdomen, in addition to the lateral aspect of the trunk. However, rash was absent on the upper and middle back in almost all patients. After the rash disappeared, gemcitabine was re-administrated in eight patients. They continued the therapy with no or only mild rash relapse. In conclusion, maculopapular rash caused by gemcitabine-based chemotherapy shows biased distribution to frontal and lateral sites of the trunk, which may be informative for consecutive chemotherapy.

Non-specific morphologies

Outside of the 10 core diagnoses discussed above, there exist other potential non-specific presentations that occur at higher frequencies. These non-specific presentations require an evaluation as described above in order to come to a core diagnosis, when possible. When a core diagnosis is not reachable, workup may at least reveal new data that will allow for more targeted therapy in addition to severity grading (online supplemental table S23). The non-specific morphologies include hyperkeratotic papules and plaques, isolated mucositis, or the previously often diagnosed 'maculopapular rash'.Importantly, we would encourage clinicians to avoid making a final diagnosis of these non-specific subtypes, but rather to use them as descriptive terms while undertaking the evaluation of patient with D-irAE.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) — skin rash, often erythematous and papular or pustular, is commonly associated with TKIs, particularly EGFR inhibitors, occurring in up to 100% of patients; because of outcome associations, supportive care with steroids, antihistamines, and antibiotics is preferable in many cases. Diarrhea is also observed commonly with TKIs as a class, and several agents (lapatinib, sunitinib, pazopanib) carry a black box warning for liver toxicity; dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered with hepatotoxicity as well as severe and chronic diarrhea.

### Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of monkeypox cases-United States, may 17-July 22, 2022 [^08ed8288]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Monkeypox, a zoonotic infection caused by an orthopoxvirus, is endemic in parts of Africa. On August 4, 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the U.S. monkeypox outbreak, which began on May 17, to be a public health emergency (1,2). After detection of the first U.S. monkeypox case), CDC and health departments implemented enhanced monkeypox case detection and reporting. Among 2,891 cases reported in the United States through July 22 by 43 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia (DC), CDC received case report forms for 1,195 (41%) cases by July 27. Among these, 99% of cases were among men; among men with available information, 94% reported male-to-male sexual or close intimate contact during the 3 weeks before symptom onset. Among the 88% of cases with available data, 41% were among non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 28% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons, and 26% among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons. Forty-two percent of persons with monkeypox with available data did not report the typical prodrome as their first symptom, and 46% reported one or more genital lesions during their illness; 41% had HIV infection. Data suggest that widespread community transmission of monkeypox has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and racial and ethnic minority groups. Compared with historical reports of monkeypox in areas with endemic disease, currently reported outbreak-associated cases are less likely to have a prodrome and more likely to have genital involvement. CDC and other federal, state, and local agencies have implemented response efforts to expand testing, treatment, and vaccination. Public health efforts should prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who are currently disproportionately affected, for prevention and testing, while addressing equity, minimizing stigma, and maintaining vigilance for transmission in other populations. Clinicians should test patients with rash consistent with monkeypox, † regardless of whether the rash is disseminated or was preceded by prodrome. Likewise, although most cases to date have occurred among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, any patient with rash consistent with monkeypox should be considered for testing. CDC is continually evaluating new evidence and tailoring response strategies as information on changing case demographics, clinical characteristics, transmission, and vaccine effectiveness become available. §.

Fever and rash in returned travelers — viral etiologies and dengue features are highlighted: "Many illnesses fall into the category of fever with a rash," and "In returned travelers, fever and rash are most often, but not always, due to viral infections," though "bacterial infections, parasitic infections, systemic fungal infections, and some noninfectious conditions can also cause fever and rash." When rash shows "petechiae/purpura or by abundant vesicles, pustules, or widespread blisters, the evaluation should be prompt and thorough." Among systemic viral illnesses, "The first 3 conditions discussed — dengue, chikungunya, and Zika — are viral diseases transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes and often present as undifferentiated fevers," with rashes providing clues because "Rashes, particularly widespread petechial eruptions, provide important diagnostic information" and "Viral illnesses often occur in small outbreaks." For dengue, it is "characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, frontal headache (often accompanied by retro-orbital pain), and myalgia," and a macular rash "may appear 2–4 days after illness onset," while "A petechial rash may occur in classic and severe dengue."

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^36fd6221]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Cutaneous rashes are predictive of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection

Here, we investigated whether cutaneous manifestations are specific to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in 336 847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study appwho registered between 7 May and 22 June 2020 (Figures S1 and S2). The majority of the users included in this study were white European (94·0%). Results for SARS‐CoV‐2 swab tests were provided by 27 157 users (8·1%), 2021 of whom (7·4%) were positive. Among untested users, 54 652 were symptomatic (i.e. they reported at least one of the 16 collected symptoms), including 17 371 users presenting with at least one of the three symptoms of COVID‐19 (i.e. fever, persistent cough and/or anosmia), whose presence, according to the UK NHS guidelines, would require isolation and testing. While these guidelines are not diagnostic, the presence of any of these three symptoms associates in our data with SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive swab with an odds ratio (OR) of 5·69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5·13–6·31, P = 5.12×10 ‐282 1 and Table S1 (see Supporting Information).

Table 1
Characteristics of the patients in the sample

Skin‐related symptoms were reported by 6403 users, including 1534 tested users, and by 3672 untested symptomatic users. Among the 2021 users who tested positive on swab test, 178 (8·8%) reported skin‐related changes. Of those, 138 (6·8%) reported body rashes and 62 (3·1%) acral rashes (Table 1). Only 22 (1·1%) reported both acral and body rashes. Infected users reporting acral rashes were slightly older (mean age 50·2 years) than those who did not (mean age 43·7 years; Wilcoxon's test, P = 0·006). Additionally, the prevalence of body rashes was slightly higher among female participants (OR 1·60, 95% CI 1·08–2·44, P = 0·02). We did not observe any significant age difference for body rashes, or sex difference for acral rash prevalence (P > 0·05).

### A retrospective study on the incidence, management and risk factors of skin rash in patients with advanced prostate cancer in Japan [^2b4f2a00]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics of the population (Table 4) were determined at the index date.

Table 4
Patient characteristics

N Number of patients in a specific group, n Number of patients without missing value in a specific group, ALP alkaline phosphatase, ALT alanine aminotransferase, AST aspartate aminotransferase, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, GGT Gamma-glutamyltransferase, IQR Interquartile range, L liter, Max Maximum, mCNPC Metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer, mCRPC Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, min minutes, mL milliliter, Min Minimum, ng nanogram, nmCRPC Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, U Units, PSA Prostate-specific antigen, RP Radical prostatectomy, RT Radiotherapy, SD Standard deviation

The mean values for age, and weight, renal function, and liver function were similar across all cohorts. Due to outliers, the median has been reported for PSA. Note that baseline PSA data was not available for 36.6% of patients in the mCNPC cohort. The majority of patients (74.2%) across all indications had received prior hormonal therapy, although this varied considerably across the cohorts and was 87.3% for mCRPC, 79.6% for nmCRPC, and 34.6% for mCNPC. Previous treatment with radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy was administered to less than 10% of the overall population. Baseline characteristics of the overall analysis were similar to those of the sensitivity analysis (Additional file 1: Table S5).

Incidence of skin rash, duration and administered treatments

Approximately 29% of patients with mCRPC and mCNPC experienced skin rash. This incidence was notably higher compared to patients with nmCRPC (19.97%). Similarly, the incidence rate per 100 patient-years was highest in the mCRPC cohort (28.89%), followed by the mCNPC (28.85%) and nmCRPC cohorts (19.97%) (Table 5).

Rash during treatment — all antituberculosis drugs can cause a rash and management depends on severity; if the rash is mainly itchy without mucous membrane involvement or systemic signs such as fever, treat symptomatically with antihistamines and continue all antituberculosis medications; a petechial rash suggests rifamycin hypersensitivity with thrombocytopenia, and if the platelet count is low the rifamycin is permanently stopped and platelet counts closely monitored; drugs are also stopped for a generalized erythematous rash; hypersensitive reactions to multiple antituberculosis drugs have been noted, particularly in persons with HIV infection.

Papulopustular (acneiform) rash — burden and risk factors: During the first weeks to months of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFRI) therapy, a papulopustular rash is the most clinically significant dermatologic toxicity and affects the majority of treated patients, with a survey showing that 32% of providers discontinued therapy and 76% modified dose due to rash when severe. Risk factors associated with developing rash include, for erlotinib, nonsmokers, people with fair skin, and older than 70, and for cetuximab, male gender and those younger than 70, with severe rash more frequent with monoclonal antibodies (10–17%) than with low-molecular-weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (5–9%).

### Gemifloxacin mesylate (Factive) [^5d5e46a9]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Safety Study of Rash

To further characterize gemifloxacin-associated rash, which in early clinical studies appeared to be associated with age less than 40 and female gender, a clinical pharmacology study was conducted. The study enrolled 1,011 healthy female volunteers less than 40 years of age. Subjects were randomized in a 5:1 ratio to receive either FACTIVE 320 mg PO daily (819 subjects) or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO twice daily for 10 days (164 subjects). This study was designed to enroll subjects at a high risk for rash (women < 40 years of age and dosing beyond the recommended duration of therapy for FACTIVE [10 days]) and over estimates the risk to patients taking FACTIVE as prescribed. Subjects who received FACTIVE were 7 times more likely to develop rash than those who received ciprofloxacin. Of the 260 rashes in subjects receiving FACTIVE, the majority of rashes were maculopapular and of mild to moderate severity; 7% of the rashes were reported as severe, and severity appeared to correlate with the extent of the rash. In 68% of the subjects reporting a severe rash and approximately 25% of all those reporting rash, > 60% of the body surface area was involved; the characteristics of the rash were otherwise indistinguishable from those subjects reporting a mild rash. The histopathology was consistent with the clinical observation of uncomplicated exanthematous morbilliform eruption. Approximately 11% of the rashes were described as being "urticaria-like". There were no documented cases of hypersensitivity syndrome or findings suggestive of angioedema or other serious cutaneous reactions.

### Diffuse pustules overlying brightly erythematous plaques in skin of color [^ecb0974f]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Miliaria pustulosa
B. Bacterial folliculitis
C. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)
D. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome
E. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms

Answers:
A. Miliaria pustulosa – Incorrect. Although miliaria pustulosa can present with pinpoint pustules overlying erythematous patches or plaques, miliaria pustulosa often favors flexural, intertriginous areas; in contrast, this patient presented with a much more diffuse eruption covering the neck, trunk, and extremities with no clear predilection for areas prone to occlusion and hyperhidrosis. Furthermore, the patient did not report intense pruritus or stinging characteristic of miliaria pustulosa.
B. Bacterial folliculitis – Incorrect. Bacterial folliculitis presents with isolated, follicular-based papules or pustules, which is inconsistent with the clustered, nonfollicular pustules observed in this patient. Furthermore, the negative wound culture decreases likelihood of a bacterial etiology.
C. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) – Correct. AGEP is a rare pustular severe cutaneous adverse reaction classically triggered by beta-lactam antibiotics, including amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which the patient had taken 3 days before eruption's onset. The timeline of the rash and fever, the eruption of small, nonfollicular pustules overlying erythematous plaques, the lack of mucosal involvement, the neutrophilia on laboratory, and the spongiosis with papillary edema on pathology are characteristic of AGEP.
D. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by targetoid lesions, bullae formation, full-thickness epidermal necrosis, and mucosal and ocular involvement, which were not seen in this patient.
E. Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms – Incorrect. Pustules are rarely observed in DRESS. Although the patient had autoimmune hepatitis at baseline, she did not have new or worsening internal organ involvement as is commonly observed in DRESS. In terms of timeline, symptoms of DRESS typically develop 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of the offending drug, in contrast to the acute onset in this patient.

Results

Study patients

The population used for this analysis consisted of 201 patients randomised to treatment (placebo: N = 102; anifrolumab 300 mg Q4W: N = 99). Baseline disease characteristics were similar between treatment groups (table 1). At baseline, 151/201 (75%) patients were classified as IFNGS test–high.

Baseline characteristics for clinical outcome measures

Most common lupus manifestations in patients

Given the low number of IFNGS test–low patients (n = 50), this subgroup analysis was restricted to the most common manifestations of SLE in the MUSE study, which were arthritis and rash (online supplementary table 1). At baseline, SLEDAI-2K-defined arthritis was present in 96.4% of patients and rash in 84.6%. Using BILAG definitions, 79.0% of patients entered the trial with rash, including 16.0% with a BILAG A (severe) score and 63.0% with a BILAG B (moderate) score. BILAG definitions of arthritis were met by 91.8% of patients, with 34.4% determined as BILAG A and 57.4% as BILAG B. Other common features of SLE, measured by SLEDAI-2K, are listed in online supplementary table 1.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^eb77e6cd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The skin rash survey

To collect more detailed information on the duration and timing of cutaneous symptoms with respect to other COVID‐19 symptoms, and to create a repository of photographs, we delivered an independent online questionnaire via SurveyMonkey, asking whether the rash was the only symptom, how many days it lasted, and, if other COVID‐19‐related symptoms were present, whether the rash started before, during or after them. The questionnaire was open from 12 to 17 June 2020, and 29 966 individuals participated. This survey was advertised on social media and was not specifically addressed to the app's users. However, we cannot exclude that some of the surveyees were also users of the app, although we are unable to link individuals from the two study samples.

We removed 18 422 surveyees not reporting their sex, not giving a numerically plausible age (between 1 and 90 years), not reporting the duration of their cutaneous symptoms, or reporting symptoms lasting > 6 weeks (Figure S3; see Supporting Information). Of the 11 544 surveyees passing this quality control, 2 328 uploaded a photograph of their rash and gave consent for sharing. From these, we randomly selected 260 photographs from people of either sex, with either a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test or reporting at least one of the three main symptoms included in the UK NHS guidelines (i.e. fever, persistent cough and/or anosmia). The 260 photographs were blindly assessed and independently categorized by four experienced dermatologists. Classifications were accepted when at least three dermatologists agreed on the diagnosis.

In collaboration with the British Association of Dermatologists, the complete photograph database was subsequently examined by four consultant dermatologists, and about 400 photographs were classified by consensus to create a large library of curated photographs divided into several types of rashes.

Ethical statement

The study was approved by the King's College London Research Ethics Committee, REMAS ID 18210, review reference LRS‐19/20‐18210. All app users and surveyees provided informed consent, either themselves or by proxy. Additional consent was sought for the sharing of the uploaded photographs with researchers, healthcare professionals and journalists for publication purposes.

### Cutaneous manifestation of drug allergy and hypersensitivity [^3de8c411]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Drug hypersensitivity reactions may manifest with either organ-specific or systemic symptoms, but cutaneous eruptions are the most common manifestations. Different medications may cause identical skin symptoms, whereas hypersensitivity to a single drug may manifest with various patterns of symptoms depending on the pathomechanism of hypersensitivity. Drug reactions should be also taken into account in the differential diagnosis of numerous skin rashes. Analysis of morphology of drug-induced lesions, about potential immunologic or nonimmunological mechanisms, is important for the final diagnosis. Thus, here the authors present a morphologic approach to the diagnosis of cutaneous drug-induced eruptions.

Clinical features of zoster — Acute zoster often begins with a prodrome in which headache, photophobia, and malaise might occur with fever being less common, and abnormal skin sensations and pain can precede the rash by days to weeks. The rash is typically unilateral, does not cross the mid-line, and erupts in one or two adjacent dermatomes, initially erythematous and maculopapular then progressing to coalescing clusters of clear vesicles that evolve through pustular, ulcer, and crust stages. The rash usually lasts 7–10 days, with complete healing within 2–4 weeks, though small numbers of lesions can occur outside the primary or adjacent dermatome, and streptococcal or staphylococcal superinfections might complicate the rash.

Measles — clinical presentation and complications — The incubation period averages 11–12 days from exposure to onset of prodrome, and rash usually appears approximately 14 days after exposure; prodromal symptoms can include fever with temperature ≤ 40.6°C (≤ 105°F). A characteristic maculopapular rash appears 3–7 days after prodromal onset, begins on the face, becomes generalized to the trunk and extremities, and typically lasts 4–7 days. Common complications include diarrhea (8%), middle ear infection (7%–9%), and pneumonia (1%–6%). Encephalitis occurs in approximately 1 per 1,000–2,000 cases of measles, and approximately 25% of patients with acute measles require hospitalization. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually presents 7–10 years after recovery from primary infection and occurs in approximately 7–11 per 100,000 reported measles cases, with higher rates among children infected at < 2 years of age.

Dermatological toxicity — immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related rash evaluation and management includes that rash with blisters, mucosal involvement, or bullous formation should trigger suspicion of lichenoid rash, pemphigus, pemphigoid, or SJS/TEN and follow-up testing, including specified immunopathology studies; ICI therapy should be interrupted until resolution or significant improvement of symptoms; if ICI-related rash does not respond to topical or oral corticosteroids, is grade ≥ 3, or is intolerable, a dermatological consultation is recommended; grade ≥ 2 dermatological events (rash, pruritus) may recur after steroid taper and a dermatological consultation or use of a steroid-sparing agent is recommended (rituximab for pemphigus or bullous pemphigoid, dupilumab for eczema, infliximab for lichenoid rash, and omalizumab for urticaria/pruritus); patients who have experienced grade 3 ICI-related rash may be rechallenged with ICIs, and rash that does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy should underscore the possibility of an infection and corresponding cultures should be obtained.

### Drug-induced cutaneous pathology [^ca3aaaf2]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced cutaneous rashes, whether confined to the skin or part of a systemic disease, are characterised by a spectrum of inflammatory disease patterns that include perivascular dermatitis, nodular and diffuse dermatitis, vesiculobullous lesions, pustular eruptions, sclerodermoid reactions, vasculitis, folliculitis/perifolliculitis and panniculitis. While a single drug can elicit a range of reaction patterns, no reaction pattern is specific for a particular drug. Although the temporal link between initiation of drug therapy and the onset of the drug rash is critical to the diagnosis, drug reactions may also occur during the course of chronic drug ingestion. Clues to the drug-induced nature of the cutaneous eruption include the presence of overlapping histological reaction patterns and incongruent clinical and histopathological features. While eosinophils are an important tell-tale sign of a drug-induced reaction, they may also be conspicuous in skin rashes devoid of a drug association. Furthermore, eosinophils may be sparse or absent in some drug exanthems. Heightened awareness of the mimicry of a wide spectrum of cutaneous pathology by an ever-increasing range of therapeutic agents is pivotal to the diagnosis of drug-induced skin pathology.

### Expert perspective: diagnostic approach to differentiating juvenile dermatomyositis from muscular dystrophy [^4eb986df]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The current classification criteria used for JM are the 2017 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for adult and juvenile IIM. These criteria are composed of a weighted point system for clinical variables, including age at onset, patterns of muscle weakness, skin manifestations, laboratory test findings, and muscle biopsy features; the resultant score leads to a predictive probability of whether or not the patient has IIM. With characteristic rash and muscle findings, one can fairly confidently reach a diagnosis of juvenile IIM; indeed, 97% of patients with JDM were correctly classified without a muscle biopsy. Without a rash, however, biopsy is usually required to fulfill the points for definite IIM. The criteria were developed to include juvenile IIM and so may be used in pediatric patients. For juvenile IIM, though, the criteria only distinguish between (1) JDM and (2) JM other than JDM, because there were too few pediatric patients in the latter category to further delineate their JM classification subgroup. This classification system is an update from the 1975 Bohan and Peter diagnostic criteriaand allows more flexibility in JDM classification for patients with variable phenotypes and who have not had muscle biopsy or electromyography performed.

The myositis community is currently working to update the IIM classification criteria to include further differentiation of IIM subtypes in children, such as antisynthetase syndrome and immune‐mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and to include additional clinical variables with diagnostic utility. An international survey of JDM specialists in 2006 identified additional findings that could be helpful in diagnosis and included muscle MRI and ultrasound scans, NFC abnormalities, calcinosis, and dysphonia. The 2012 Single Hub and Access point for Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) initiative, an evidence‐based guideline out of Europe, also developed 33 diagnostic recommendations for JDM and provided strength‐of‐evidence support for each, including a recommendation that muscle biopsy be performed in patients with JDM who are atypical or lacking classic rash, which was a recommendation based on expert opinion, as were the majority of recommendations.

### Papular-vesicular rash in COVID-19 [^09e3b5d5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The rash usually appears 3 days after the onset of systemic symptoms and disappears by 8 days. The characteristic features of this vesicular exanthem are mild/absent pruritus, frequent trunk involvement, small size, scattered distribution of lesions, and heals without scar. Two morphological patterns of this rash are 1) widespread polymorphic pattern — more common, consisting of small papules, vesicles, and pustules, and 2) localized pattern — less prevalent, consisting of monomorphic lesions over anterior or posterior trunk.

The histology shows dyskeratosis, ballooning multinucleated cells, and scanty necrotic keratinocytes with lymphocytic satellitosis. Dermal and vessel wall edema, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and red blood cells (RBCs) extravasation are the other findings seen.

Varicella-like exanthem is a COVID-19-specific rash whose identification is helpful in the clinical diagnosis.

### Common skin rashes in children | AAFP… [^4272cfb5]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Most children have a fever and sore throat one to two days before the rash develops on the upper trunk. The rash spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles, with characteristic circumoral pallor. This differs from some viral exanthems that develop more slowly. The rash is characterized by confluent, erythematous, blanching, fine macules, resembling a sunburn, and sandpaper-like papules. Erythema Infectiosum Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is caused by parvovirus B19. It is a common childhood infection characterized by a prodrome of low-grade fever, malaise, sore throat, headache, and nausea followed several days later by an erythematous "slapped cheek" facial rash. After two to four days, the facial rash fades. In the second stage of the disease process, pink patches and macules may develop in a lacy, reticular pattern, most often on the extremities. After one to six weeks, the rash resolves but may reappear with sun exposure, heat, or stress.

14 It also occurs in sexually active adolescents. The lesions are flesh-colored or pearly white, small papules with central umbilication. The oral mucosa is rarely affected, but lesions may appear on the genital region and conjunctiva. Typically, children have 10 to 20 lesions, but occasionally there may be up to hundreds. 14 Molluscum may also occur in conjunction with dermatitis. It can erupt and spread quickly in a child with underlying atopic dermatitis, or it can induce dermatitis in a child with previously clear skin. Tinea capitis, the most common skin infection in children in the United States, is characterized by scaling or circumscribed alopecia and broken hair follicles. The distribution of atopic dermatitis lesions can vary based on the age of the child. Infants and younger children often have lesions on the extensor surfaces of extremities, cheeks, and scalp.

Older children and adults often present with patches and plaques on the flexor surfaces. Hands and feet are also commonly affected. Thickened plaques with a lichenified appearance may be seen in more severe cases. Children with atopic dermatitis often have dry, flaky skin and are at risk of secondary cutaneous infections.

### Whip-like rash in hospitalized patient [^dece5e89]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 59-year-old man with a past medical history notable for intravenous drug use and hypertension, presented with back pain, neurologic deficits (left arm numbness, slurred speech, confusion) and a curvilinear whip-like rash on the back (Fig 1). He had been treating his back pain with acetaminophen, menthol, and heating pads. Work-up was notable for severe hyponatremia, scattered microhemorrhages on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and bacteriuria. Spinal MRI showed vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural abscesses at multiple spinal levels. Transesophageal echocardiogram was suggestive of endocarditis. Skin biopsy results are shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the dermatologic diagnosis?
A. Flagellate erythema
B. Vasculitis
C. Thermal injury
D. Purpura fulminans
E. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome

Answers:
A. Flagellate erythema – Incorrect. Although the rash has a whip-like shape in some regions, this patient lacks exposure to common causes including shiitake mushrooms and bleomycin.
B. Vasculitis – Incorrect. Although the rash has a dusky/purpuric appearance, the morphology (eg, curvilinear patches and eroded plaques) and distribution only on the back is atypical for vasculitis.
C. Thermal injury – Correct. Recent exposure to a heating pad and the morphology of the rash (eg, erythema and erosions in geometric shapes in area where heating pad was applied) make thermal injury the most likely diagnosis. Although erythema ab igne can result from long-term heating pad use, exam findings were consistent with thermal burn rather than erythema ab igne given lack of reticulated erythema/dyspigmentation.
D. Purpura fulminans – Incorrect. Although purpura fulminans can occur in the setting of endocarditis and sepsis, the geometric shape of the rash and localization to the back makes purpura fulminans less likely.
E. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – Incorrect. Although SSSS can occur in the setting of S. aureus bacteremia, the patient's rash does not show the classic periorificial radial fissuring or intertriginous involvement of SSSS. Furthermore, SSSS is a more superficial process that involves toxins causing denuded skin from a subcorneal split. SSSS is also less common in adults with normal renal function.

### Spotting zika spots: descriptive features of the rash used in 66 published cases [^b940000d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Zika virus (ZV) is an important emerging infection. Rash is a key feature, but the summative literature lacks description of the rash beyond 'maculopapular'. Our aim was to identify the cutaneous features described in the published literature. A literature search using defined terms for ZV cases reports and series was performed on the OVID, Clinical Key and University of Dundee's e-library journals databases in December 2016; a later case report was included while the paper was under review. Diagnosis in all cases was via PCR. Exclusion criteria were Zika cases without rash or omitting any description of the rash. Ocular features (conjunctivitis) were not included. In total, 42 publications with 66 cases met the criteria. The most frequent descriptive features included maculopapular (59%), lower limb petechial purpura (11%) and erythematous/red (9%). Pruritus was described in 44% and tenderness in 3%. Lesions were located on the trunk (29%), limbs (5% arms, 11% both arms and legs), face (17%) and extremities (14%) or were diffuse/generalized (12%). There was facial sparing in 3%. Other features were centrifugal spread (6%), palmar and/or plantar involvement (6%), palmoplantar desquamation (2%) and malar erythema with oedema (2%). Mucosal features included gingival bleeding (11%), oral haemorrhagic blisters (8%) and painful blisters/vesicles (4%). Oedema/swelling was described in the upper limbs (5%), lower limbs (5%) and both (3%). Mean rash duration was 6 days (range 3–11 days). The ZV exanthema is most frequently maculopapular, pruritic, sometimes with centrifugal spread from the trunk to extremities. This may include lower limb petechial purpura, palmoplantar lesions, oedema of limb extremities, and gingival bleeding or painful oral bullae. As ZV becomes more prevalent, recognition of the clinical features will enable earlier diagnosis and appropriate testing.

### Clinical and histological characterization of vesicular COVID-19 rashes: a prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^e41088c4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vesicular skin rashes have been reported as associated with COVID-19, but there is little information about this cutaneous manifestation. We designed a prospective observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had vesicular lesions. Clinical characterization of skin findings was conducted by dermatologists. When possible, histological analysis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the content of the vesicles was performed. In total, 24 patients were included. A disseminated pattern was found in 18 patients (75%), and a localized pattern was found in 6 (25%). Median duration of the skin rash was 10 days. Of the 24 patients, 19 (79.2%) developed the skin rash after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Histological examination in two patients was consistent with viral infection, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in four patients. This single-centre study shows the clinical characteristics of vesicular skin rashes in patients with COVID-19.

In our app‐based study, 8·8% of patients who were positive for COVID‐19 via swab tests also reported skin rashes (OR 1·67, 95% CI 1·42–1·97). Body rashes were more frequent than acral lesions (6·8% vs. 3·1%), although their predictive value was similar (OR 1·66, 95% CI 1·37–1·99 vs. 1·74, 95% CI 1·33–2·28, respectively). Interestingly, the OR for both types of rash was greater than for fever (OR 1·48), a widely used criterion to suggest testing. Reports of cases with both body rashes and acral lesions were rare (1·1%), suggesting different pathogenesis, with the former caused by immunological reactions to the virus, and the latter more likely explained by delayed small thrombotic occlusions or damage to vessel walls.

Etravirine (ETR) major toxicities — more common effects are "Nausea, diarrhea, and mild rash." Rash occurs most commonly during the first "6 weeks" of therapy and generally resolves after "1 to 2 weeks" on continued therapy; people with a history of severe rash with prior NNRTI use "should not receive ETR." Less common (more severe) events include "Peripheral neuropathy, severe rash, hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and erythema multiforme," and clinicians should "Discontinue ETR immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or HSRs develop," "monitor a person's clinical status, including levels of liver transaminases," and note that "Continuing to use ETR after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction"; people with a history of severe rash while using NVP or EFV "should not receive ETR."

### Where are we with developing diagnostic criteria for skin diseases? Mapping the evidence in 2021 [^7149c578]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Report

To identify where the gaps in diagnostic criteria research are a PubMed search was conducted in July 2021. The search strategy was developed with an information specialist, and built around key words for dermatological disease and diagnostic criteria. The project protocol and search strategy are available on the Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology (CEBD) website. Studies for which the primary research aim was to develop, validate or critically appraise diagnostic criteria for a skin disease were included. Skin diseases were included if they were listed in the British Association of Dermatologists Index and would be reviewed in a dermatology clinic. Diagnostic criteria were defined as a group of features (which may include clinical, imaging, histopathological, biochemical or genetic items) that collectively are used to diagnose a condition. No restrictions were placed on the stage of diagnostic criteria development, study type or publication status. Studies before 1990 were excluded because of low availability of electronic papers and resource limitations. Papers underwent single reviewer assessment for citation screening, full text eligibility review and data extraction (JL). Queries were discussed with a second reviewer. Skin diseases were categorized into groups based on similarities in pathogenesis. Limited core details were extracted from non‐English papers. Data were analysed descriptively, presenting percentages for the frequency of different categories of characteristics. An infographic (Fig. 1) was created to show the results.

§ Percentages calculated using nonmissing data.

¶ Rash includes at least one lesion affecting the skin or mucous membranes.

Rash was most frequently reported on the genitals (46%), arms (40%), face (38%), and legs (37%); among 718 persons with monkeypox who reported body regions with rash, 238 (33%) reported rash in one region, 126 (18%) in two regions, 98 (14%) in three regions, and 256 (36%) in four or more regions. Among 104 persons with information on the number of lesions, 88% of cases involved fewer than 50 lesions.

Among 334 persons with data available on HIV status, 136 (41%) had HIV infection. Among 954 persons with hospitalization data available, 77 (8%) patients were hospitalized because of their illness. No deaths were reported. Among 339 persons with vaccination status available, 48 (14%) reported previous receipt of smallpox vaccine, including 11 (23%) who received 1 of 2 JYNNEOS doses during the current outbreak, 11 (23%) who received pre-exposure prophylaxis at an unknown time before the current outbreak, and 26 (54%) who did not provide information about when vaccine was administered. Among the recently vaccinated persons with monkeypox, at least one experienced symptoms > 3 weeks after their first JYNNEOS dose.

### Desquamative erythematous rash in a young woman [^283b9753]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Incorrect – the overall suspicion of cutaneous fungal infection was not high in this patient, especially with the morphology of superficial erosions associated with hyperesthesia and the absence of fungal elements on the skin biopsy histology.
B. Incorrect – Some may mistake the neck and chest rashes for the scarf/shawl sign in dermatomyositis, but the rash was not photo-distributed and it does not show violaceous erythema or poikiloderma. There were no characteristic associated features, such as heliotrope rash, Gottron's papules, periungual erythema, or myopathy.
C. Correct – The key to the correct diagnosis, in this case, is the combination of the morphology of an eruption of erythematous patches and plaques on her neck and flexures with superficial erosions and desquamative scales, coupled with the histologic findings of granular parakeratosis with upper epidermal pallor and history of eating disorder – suggesting an underlying nutritional disorder.
D. Incorrect – There was no history of any new contactants in this patient, thus patch testing would likely be unyielding. Furthermore, this would not address the underlying condition of nutritional disorder.
E. Incorrect – Although oral steroids may temporarily improve the dermatitis of a nutritional deficiency, it would not address the underlying cause of her dermatitis, thus it is not the most appropriate therapy.

### Viruses associated with measles-like illnesses in Uganda [^03978296]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

We detected other viruses that are well-known to cause fever and rash in other settings, including human parvovirus B19, HHV6B, EBV, VZV and CMV. Human parvovirus B19 causes "fifth disease", otherwise known as "slapped cheek syndrome" due to the appearance of a facial rash in infected individuals and more rarely causes polyarthropathy and anemia. The herpesvirus HHV6B causes roseola infantum, and EBV and CMV are commonly associated with glandular fever-like illness, characterized by rash, fever, lymphadenopathy and bilateral tonsillar exudate. The subtleties of clinical presentation of childhood infections associated with rash and fever are not well described in the Ugandan population, and characteristics of the rash e.g. macular, papular, vesicular, purpuric alongside distribution and accompanying features such as lymphadenopathy are not routinely reported or assessed during routine MLI screening in Uganda. Further clinical description and reporting could help with clinical diagnosis in the absence of resources for additional testing without additional cost.

Virus‐induced vesicular eruptions

Virus‐induced vesicular eruptions are quite common for herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus‐induced skin lesions in which the vesicles are caused by intraepidermal blister and epithelial necrosis. Either reticular degeneration of the epidermis or ballooning of keratinocytes might cause intraepidermal vesicle formation,(Table 2). Another example for virus‐induced vesicular eruptions is caused by Coxsackie A16 virus, an enterovirus, which is responsible for Hand‐foot‐and‐mouth diseases. Intraepidermal vesicles with reticular degeneration and ballooned cells are characteristic features. Papillary edema and mild perivascular infiltrates might be detectable as well. In all of these virus‐induced skin eruptions, viral antigens are detectable in various cutaneous structures using different methods such as antibody staining, electron microscopy, or others.

Whether vesicular eruptions observed in part of the COVID‐19 patients are caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, needs to be evaluated in further studies.

Some reports of erythemato‐violaceous papules and patches with a pseudo‐vesicle in the center, resembling erythema multiforme and an enanthem of the oral cavity in some of those patients during or after improvement of COVID‐19 symptoms, exist., If those lesions are related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or drugs applied in this context, then both remain to be elucidated in further studies.

Virus‐induced urticarial rashes

Urticaria and acute urticarial rashes go along with up to 50% of all cases with infections of the upper respiratory tractand are most often mediated by complement activation and serum sickness induced by viral antigens or secondary mechanisms, due to the interaction of the immune system with viral antigens. This could be also the case in part of the SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients with urticarial eruptions (Figure 7).

Cutaneous rashes are often the first or only symptom

To better investigate the duration of skin rashes and their timing in relation to other COVID‐19 symptoms, we collected data from 11 544 individuals who responded to an independent online survey on COVID‐19‐related skin rashes (Figure S3). The median age was 53 years (interquartile range 41–63) and 77% were female. In total, 694 reported a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 swab or antibody test, and 3109 were untested but reported having had one of the three classic symptoms included in the UK NHS guidelines. The 694 surveyees who reported having tested positive to SARS‐CoV‐2 via a swab or antibody test, with skin clinical signs, also reported other COVID‐19‐related symptoms, with fatigue (11%), headaches (9%), loss of smell (9%), fever (7%), muscle pain (6%), shortness of breath (6%) and persistent cough (6%) being the most common. Interestingly, while most surveyees declared skin changes to appear at the same time as other COVID‐19 symptoms (47%) or afterwards (35%), in 17% of the cases skin symptoms appeared before any other symptoms, and in 21% of the cases the rash was the only symptom. Similar estimates were obtained when focusing on the 3109 symptomatic untested participants, where 47%, 39% and 15% of surveyees declared having had a cutaneous rash during, after or before any other symptoms, respectively.

### Clinical characteristics of children with viral single-and co-infections and a petechial rash [^3b457ca4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Children with petechial rash are more likely to undergo invasive diagnostics, to be treated with antibiotics for potential bacterial infection and to be hospitalized. However, viruses have also been associated with petechial rash. Nonetheless, a systematic analysis of viral infections with modern available techniques as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the context of petechial rash is lacking. The purpose of this pediatric study was to prospectively uncover viral pathogens that may promote the emergence of petechiae and to analyze the correlation with the clinical characteristics and course.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study in children (0 to 18 years) presenting with petechiae and signs or symptoms of infection at the emergency department between November 2009 and March 2012. In nasopharyngeal aspirates the following viruses were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction: cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, influenza A and B, parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL63 and human bocavirus.

Results

A viral pathogen was identified in 67% of the analyzed 58 cases with petechial rash. Virus positive patients showed a significantly higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections. Forty-one percent were viral coinfections, which were significantly younger than virus negative patients, had a higher leukocyte count and were hospitalized for a longer time.

Conclusions

A petechial rash is frequently associated viral single- and coinfections and can rapidly be identified via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^ca03369d]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Bioterrorism versus emerging infectious diseases — recognizing and responding to outbreaks notes that an intentional biological release can mimic a natural outbreak and that recognizing an undeclared use may be more difficult than announced chemical or biological events. Health investigators may not immediately know an outbreak is intentional; CDC highlights illnesses and symptoms that may result from nature or bioterrorism, including encephalitis, hemorrhagic mediastinitis, pneumonia with abnormal liver function tests, papulopustular rash such as smallpox rash, hemorrhagic fever, descending paralysis, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Characteristics suggesting possible intentional use include an outbreak of a rare disease; an outbreak in an area that normally does not experience the disease; occurrence of a seasonal disease at an inappropriate time of year; unusual age distribution; unusual epidemiologic features (for example, a foodborne pathogen now transmitted person to person); and unusual clinical symptoms not typically seen with a known pathogen, especially respiratory symptoms.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^f7d3ccf9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fourthly, some of these cutaneous manifestations could have been caused by adverse reactions to drugs used to treat SARS‐CoV‐2 and/or for other purposes. Due to the size of our study and to the nature of the app used to collect our data, we could not collect a full history for drug usage, either at the time of data collection or retrospectively. However, we expect the numbers of community‐based users on drugs that could have also caused a rash to be very low compared with the number of rashes observed in hospitalized patients, and therefore drugs are unlikely to have been a major alternate cause of rashes. Similarly, we could not collect information on pre‐existing skin diseases, and could not investigate whether they influenced the rate of the reported rashes.

In summary, this study strongly supports the inclusion of skin rashes in the list of suspicious COVID‐19 symptoms. Although they are less prevalent than fever, they are more specific and last longer, and can be easily spotted by patients. Importantly from the survey reported in this study, it was the only presentation in one‐fifth of the patients diagnosed with COVID‐19.

Increased awareness from the public and healthcare professionals regarding COVID‐19 skin changes will allow more efficient detection of infection and contact tracing.

### SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, skin and immunology-what do we know so far? [^afa93c91]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Based on the largest collection of skin lesions from patients from Spain, lesions have been recently categorized into five main groupssummarized in Figure 4A‐E.
Vesicular eruptions, predate in about 15% COVID‐19 symptoms or occur with symptoms, last 10‐12 days and go along with COVID‐19 with intermediate severity, patients affected are middle aged, and lesions are accompanied by moderate itch (Figure 4A).
Maculopapular exanthema manifests together with COVID‐19 symptoms, often in more severe cases with a mortality rate up to 2%, lasts 7‐9 days, and is in over 50% of the cases accompanied by itch (Figure 4B).
Urticarial eruptions occur at the same time as other symptoms in more severe COVID‐19 cases are accompanied by itching and last 6‐8 days (Figure 4C).
Livedo or necrosis and other vasculitis forms tend to occur in older and more severe cases, with relatively high mortality (up to 10%), and the onset was together with COVID‐19 symptoms (Figure 4D).
Chilblain was observed in younger patients with mild or even asymptomatic courses or negative SARS‐CoV‐2 testing, the onset is late, duration 12‐14 days and in one third are the lesions accompanied by pain and itch,(Figure 4E).

FIGURE 4
A: Typical skin lesions (vesicular eruptions occurring early during COVID‐19 (A), with symptoms of COVID‐19, that is, maculopapular exanthema (B), urticarial rash (C), vasculitis (D), and later during COVID‐19 disease Chilblain eruptions (E). The bar on top indicates the onset of skin symptoms in relation to COVID‐19 symptoms, as well as average age and severity of COVID‐19 patients, and typical predilection sites of the lesions are also depicted

Since it is quite difficult to verify, in which context the skin lesions occur in terms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections, we would like to summarize in the next few sections current knowledge about the pathophysiologic background of virus‐induced and drug‐induced lesions of the skin and the vascular system.

### Newborn skin: part I. common rashes and skin changes [^e1af51e1]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Rashes in the newborn period are common and most are benign. Infections should be suspected in newborns with pustules or vesicles, especially in those who are not well-appearing or have risk factors for congenital infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can cause sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay. Skin manifestations of cytomegalovirus may include petechiae due to thrombocytopenia. The most common skin manifestations of early congenital syphilis are small, copper-red, maculopapular lesions located primarily on the hands and feet that peel and crust over three weeks. Erythema toxicum neonatorum and neonatal pustular melanosis are transient pustular rashes with characteristic appearance and distribution. Neonatal acne is self-limited, whereas infantile acne may benefit from treatment. Milia can be differentiated from neonatal acne by their presence at birth. Cutis marmorata and harlequin color change are transient vascular phenomena resulting from inappropriate or exaggerated dilation of capillaries and venules in response to stimuli.

### Description of the first global outbreak of mpox: an analysis of global surveillance data [^b6caa440]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The most common symptoms reported were any rash (30 225 [82·6%] of 36 609 cases with reported symptoms), fever (21 819 [59·6%] of 36 609), skin or mucosal lesions (excluding oral and genital lesions; 19 121 [52·2%] of 36 609), genital rash (16 993 [46·4%] of 36 609), and headache (12 016 [32·8%] of 36 609). Symptom prevalence varied by age and sex (figure 1C; appendix 3 p 6). Notably, prevalence of genital rash was lower in female cases aged 15 years and older with reported symptoms (329 [27·0%] of 1218) than male cases aged 15 years and older with reported symptoms (16 201 [47·1%] of 34 362). This prevalence was also lower for female (11 [7·0%] 157) and male cases (14 [7·3%] of 191) younger than 15 years. 438 cases with reported genital rash symptoms did not have age and sex data reported. Prevalence of genital rash varied among regions, with the lowest rates in the Eastern Mediterranean region (18 [32·1%] of 56) and highest rates in the Western Pacific region (35 [80·0%] of 44). Symptom data were extremely limited for the African region.

Table 2
Clinical characteristics comparing ZIKV and non-ZIKV cases in children and adults

Among 111 adult cases (17 ZIKV and 94 non-ZIKV), rash (100.0% versus 29.8%; P < 0.01), arthralgia (64.7% versus 26.6%; P < 0.01), and conjunctivitis (52.9% versus 9.7%; P < 0.01) were significantly found more common in ZIKV cases than non-ZIKV cases (Table 2). The PPV of rash for ZIKV infection was 37.7%. All rashes were maculopapular, and 70% of them were accompanied by pruritus. The duration of rash was significantly longer among ZIKV cases than non-ZIKV cases (median [IQR] 6 days [4.5, 7.0] versus 3 days [2.0, 4.75]; P < 0.01). Fever was significantly less common (58.8% versus 97.9%; P < 0.01), peak temperature was lower (37.6°C versus 38.6°C; P < 0.01), and duration of fever was shorter (median [IQR] 3 days [2.0, 5.25] versus 5 days [3.0, 6.0]; P = 0.08) among ZIKV cases than non-ZIKV cases. Headache (41.2% versus 83.0%; P < 0.01), myalgia (52.9% versus 87.2%; P < 0.01), and cough (0.0% versus 22.3%; P = 0.04) were significantly less common in ZIKV cases. Combined clinical characteristics including rash plus fever plus conjunctivitis plus arthralgia (OR [95% CI], 9.33 [1.87–46.49]; P = 0.01) were predictive for ZIKV disease in adult, giving the PPV of 57.1%.

### Lamotrigine extended release [^648669c2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Skin Rashes (see Boxed Warning)

The risk of serious rash caused by treatment with lamotrigine extended-release is not expected to differ from that with the immediate-release lamotrigine [see Boxed Warning]. However, the relatively limited treatment experience with lamotrigine extended-release makes it difficult to characterize the frequency and risk of serious rashes caused by treatment with lamotrigine extended-release.

Pediatric Population: The incidence of serious rash associated with hospitalization and discontinuation of immediate-release lamotrigine in a prospectively followed cohort of pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years) with epilepsy receiving adjunctive therapy with immediate-release lamotrigine was approximately 0.8% (16 of 1,983). When 14 of these cases were reviewed by 3 expert dermatologists, there was considerable disagreement as to their proper classification. To illustrate, one dermatologist considered none of the cases to be Stevens-Johnson syndrome; another assigned 7 of the 14 to this diagnosis. There was 1 rash-related death in this 1,983-patient cohort. Additionally, there have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis with and without permanent sequelae and/or death in U.S. and foreign postmarketing experience.

### Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of monkeypox cases-United States, may 17-July 22, 2022 [^ff351166]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

On June 3, 2022, CDC released a case report form for health departments to report monkeypox cases. Data collected include possible exposures during the 3 weeks preceding symptom onset, symptoms during the illness course, and distribution of rash, defined as at least one lesion on the skin or mucous membranes. To describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, CDC analyzed case report form data for probable or confirmed cases initially reported through July 22, 2022; to allow for reporting delay, data received through July 27 were included. Analyses were restricted to cases for which relevant data were available. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

During May 17–July 22, 2022, a total of 2,891 U.S. monkeypox cases were reported by 43 states, Puerto Rico, and DC; the number of reported cases increased rapidly during this time (Figure). Case report forms including, at minimum, age and gender identity were received for 1,195 (41%) cases; these cases are described in this report. Median age was 35 years (IQR = 30–41 years). Nearly all (99%) persons with case report forms available were men (cisgender and transgender) (Table 1). Among 1,054 cases for which race and ethnicity were reported, 41% occurred among White persons, 28% among Hispanic persons, and 26% among Black persons. Based on information available in case report forms, the percentage of cases among Black persons increased from 12% (29 of 248) during May 17–July 2 to 31% (247 of 806) during July 3–22, and the percentage among Hispanic persons decreased from 33% (82 of 248) to 27% (214 of 806) and among White persons from 49% (121 of 248) to 38% (307 of 806).

EGFR inhibitor–associated dermatologic toxicities — background and burden: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (EGFRI) are used for treating lung, pancreatic, breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers, and may be used as first-line through third-line treatments alone or in combination. Common dermatologic side effects include papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis enhancement, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia, with incidences ranging from 36% for mucositis to 80% for papulopustular (acneiform) rash. In cancer patients receiving systemic therapy, itchy skin or rash increase the number of visits to the outpatient clinic by 36% and 72%, respectively, underscoring the need to maximize supportive measures.

### Clinical and histopathological characterization of enfortumab vedotin-associated cutaneous toxicities: a case series [^6d41010d]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

A retrospective review of EV-treated patients at Johns Hopkins who required a skin biopsy due to EV-related cutaneous toxicity was performed. All patients were evaluated by a dermatologist, who also performed the skin biopsy, which was read by one dermatopathologist at Johns Hopkins University.

Medical record review included all medication exposures prior to EV initiation until the date of rash onset, clinical presentation, distribution, and morphology of the rash, response to EV treatment, and survival data. The time to onset of the rash was documented as the number of days from the initial EV dose to the patient-reported appearance of the skin eruption.

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. We calculated OS and PFS for each patient and mean OS and PFS for the entire cohort. Statistical analysis was performed using R 4.2.2 and Microsoft Excel.

The Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board approved this study, and all patients gave written consent. Authors had access to identifiable data to review notes and images for data collection. The study conformed to the case series reporting standards.

### Impact of a rash management guide in patients receiving apalutamide for high-risk localized prostate cancer in the apa-RP study [^c2ef4585]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Based on the SPARTAN and TITAN studies, apalutamide is approved for patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant and metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Skin rash was a common adverse reaction across indications. We hypothesized that earlier identification and intervention could improve rash outcomes.

Subjects/Methods

A prespecified rash management guide outlining recommended skin care practices was provided to all patients enrolled in Apa-RP (NCT04523207). Rash-related safety data from Apa-RP were compared descriptively with data from SPARTAN and TITAN.

Results

Patients in Apa-RP experienced improved rash-related outcomes vs those in SPARTAN and TITAN.

Conclusions

Increased vigilance and proactive management may reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of rash during apalutamide treatment.

### A rapidly fluctuating rash in a stuporous patient [^b67d04a8]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Rapidly fluctuating blotchy patches that appear then disappear in a matter of seconds to a minute are a striking clinical presentation that is not well documented in the dermatologic literature. A broader literature review found descriptions of six patients with similar cutaneous findings. Five patients (between 9 and 15 years of age) had an acute elevation in intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus, head trauma, or intraventricular hemorrhage; the sixth patient was a 42-year-old man with head trauma. The cutaneous findings described in all six cases were attributed to an unclear mechanism linking the CNS pathology to the rapidly fluctuating rash.

We propose CNS-driven autonomic neurovascular dysregulation of arteriolar sphincters as the underlying mechanism leading to the rapidly fluctuating erythema. The distribution of dermal arterioles that control ascending umbrella-like cascades of capillaries would explain the observed pattern. Drawing attention to this rather unique clinical presentation and its association with underlying CNS abnormalities beyond head trauma and elevated intracranial pressure should prove useful to dermatologists asked to evaluate such patients.

Dermatologic toxicities from targeted agents such as panitumumab can interfere with cancer treatment.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the rash assessment and management in a consecutive patient cohort who received panitumumab for colorectal cancer treatment.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review.

Results

Skin toxicity, consisting of papulopustular rash, was experienced by 32 of 34 patients. The majority (85%) developed the rash by the end of the second infusion cycle. Patients presented with a mild (41%), moderate (38%), and severe (21%) rash, and progressed to an extensive rash without appropriate treatment. A grading system was used for 65% of patients to document severity.

Limitations

Small sample size limited power in analysis. Rash severity had to be inferred based on rash description and management in 11 of the patients.

Conclusion

Dermatologic toxicities related to panitumumab are common; however, the way they are reported and managed varies among physicians. To prevent progression, toxicities must be assessed and treated early and aggressively, according to severity grading. Dermatologists could aid oncologists in choosing the best management strategies.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^456b68a0]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age, the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP's diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.

### A case report and discussion of cetuximab-induced folliculitis [^947abce5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Use of human epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors by oncologists has led to the occurrence of an acne-like eruption that is technically a folliculitis. Misidentification of the rash often leads to unfruitful treatment attempts as its morphologic features do not correlate well with its histologic findings. We describe a case history, diagnosis, and management of a man undergoing treatment with cetuximab for colorectal carcinoma who experienced the characteristic follicular eruption. Our patient responded well to daily moisturizers and 1% clindamycin gel and experienced near complete resolution of the rash. The evolving research and understanding of this unique entity are also discussed.

### Rash management and treatment persistence of cancer patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors in the truven marketScanresearch database [^183376b4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rash toxicity is a common, expected class effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Although rash management is practiced, it is not well characterized in the real-world setting. We describe the management of rash that developed while receiving EGFR-inhibitor therapy and how rash affects treatment duration, using Truven MarketScan® Research Database, a US medical claims database.

Methods

Adult patients who received EGFR-inhibitor treatment between 2004 and 2015 after a diagnosis of colon, head and neck, lung, breast, or thyroid cancer were identified. Descriptive analyses were conducted to describe occurrence of rash during the EGFR-inhibitor treatment period, EGFR-inhibitor treatment persistence and management of rash, including treatment and cost.

Results

Of 44,533 eligible patients, 4649 (10.4%) had records of rash during the EGFR-inhibitor treatment period, and of patients experiencing rash, 2891 (62.2%) received prescription drugs for rash treatment. Treatment persistence with an EGFR inhibitor was longer among patients experiencing rash compared with no rash (median 178 vs. 80 days for EGFR-TKIs, 85 vs. 57 days for EGFR-monoclonal antibodies), especially among patients with rash who were treated for rash (208 days for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 104 days for EGFR- monoclonal antibodies). Annualized cost during EGFR-inhibitor treatment was lowest among patients not experiencing rash (US$185,619), followed by rash patients receiving drugs for rash management (US$215,561), and highest among rash patients not treated for rash (US$267,105).

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that management of EGFR inhibitor-associated rash could be important for EGFR-inhibitor treatment persistence.

### SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, skin and immunology-what do we know so far? [^58fc2922]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The pandemic condition coronavirus disease (COVID‐19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), can take asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe courses. COVID‐19 affects primarily the respiratory airways leading to dry cough, fever, myalgia, headache, fatigue, and diarrhea and can end up in interstitial pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. Reports about the manifestation of various skin lesions and lesions of the vascular system in some subgroups of SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients as such features outside the respiratory sphere, are rapidly emerging. Vesicular, urticarial, and maculopapular eruptions and livedo, necrosis, and other vasculitis forms have been reported most frequently in association with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In order to update information gained, we provide a systematic overview of the skin lesions described in COVID‐19 patients, discuss potential causative factors, and describe differential diagnostic evaluations. Moreover, we summarize current knowledge about immunologic, clinical, and histologic features of virus‐ and drug‐induced lesions of the skin and changes to the vascular system in order to transfer this knowledge to potential mechanisms induced by SARS‐CoV‐2.
