## Question

Which antibiotics is given for cholangitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are given for cholangitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of cholangitis. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens and resistance patterns. Next, I will align empiric choices with guideline-based regimens and stewardship principles. After that, I need to consider special populations and de-escalation strategies. Finally, I will confirm duration and reconcile any conflicting data before summarizing practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why empiric therapy matters. Acute cholangitis is a life-threatening biliary infection driven by obstruction and bacterial ascent; timely broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce sepsis and mortality, but antibiotics alone are insufficient without source control via biliary drainage, so I need to ensure I'm not implying antibiotics replace drainage [^9bfd28c5] [^f85956e7] [^9a51c21c].

> I need to check the likely pathogens and resistance risks. The predominant organisms are gram-negative Enterobacterales, especially Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with Enterococcus spp. increasingly important, particularly in healthcare-associated disease or with biliary stents; anaerobes are less frequent but can be relevant in severe or obstructed cases, so I should keep polymicrobial coverage in mind when risk is high [^25b5ba55] [^693114d2] [^72d40e7a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single regimen. I should align choices with severity and setting. For mild, community-acquired disease without high-risk features, a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole is reasonable; piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy is also acceptable and may better cover enterococci and anaerobes, while fluoroquinolone-based regimens can be considered in beta-lactam allergy, though I should confirm local resistance before relying on fluoroquinolones [^da54a4db] [^ad9194b5] [^32cc7896].

> For moderate-to-severe disease or healthcare-associated infection, I should confirm that broader coverage is warranted. Piperacillin-tazobactam is a common first-line choice; if there is septic shock, high risk for ESBL, or concern for Pseudomonas, a carbapenem such as meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin is appropriate; if enterococcal coverage is specifically needed and not covered by the base regimen, adding ampicillin or switching to ampicillin-sulbactam can be considered, but I need to ensure I'm not duplicating anaerobic coverage unnecessarily [^da54a4db] [^ad9194b5] [^25b5ba55].

> Wait, let me verify special populations and device-related risks. In patients with biliary stents or prior biliary instrumentation, Enterococcus and nonfermenters like Pseudomonas are more common, so I should favor regimens with enterococcal and anti-pseudomonal activity such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, and I should plan to obtain cultures during ERCP or PTC when feasible to enable de-escalation [^693114d2] [^ebb09587] [^32cc7896].

> I should double-check the role of local epidemiology and patient-specific risk factors. High local rates of ESBL or prior colonization with resistant organisms push toward carbapenems, whereas in carefully selected community-acquired cases without stents or ICU care, piperacillin-tazobactam can achieve excellent coverage and spare carbapenems; inadequate initial therapy is associated with higher mortality in bacteremic cholangitis, so I need to balance stewardship with timely, effective coverage [^25b5ba55] [^0b572baa] [^37dc3f15].

> Next, I should review duration and the impact of source control. Historically, 7–10 days was standard, but emerging data suggest shorter courses are effective after successful biliary drainage. A randomized trial showed 4 days was noninferior to 8 days for moderate-to-severe cholangitis, and older observational data support 3 days when drainage is achieved and fever resolves; I should tailor to clinical response and culture results, extending if bacteremia with enterococcus or persistent infection is present [^1ce8c27f] [^a1f0609e] [^8b156b81].

> But wait, what if cultures remain positive despite antibiotics. I need to ensure I reassess for ongoing obstruction, inadequate source control, or resistant organisms; polymicrobial bile cultures are common, and discordance between bile and blood isolates can occur, so obtaining bile cultures during decompression and narrowing therapy to susceptibilities improves outcomes and supports de-escalation [^ebb09587] [^32cc7896] [^25b5ba55].

> I will now examine pediatric and transplant-specific nuances. In children with biliary atresia post-Kasai, cefoperazone has declining efficacy and meropenem is often required for refractory cases; in liver transplant recipients undergoing ERCP, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended and resistance patterns differ, with higher rates of ceftriaxone and gentamicin resistance, so I should prefer agents like piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenems when risk is high [^85394b5a] [^3d131808] [^68d63a69].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting guidance. Some older or lower-quality meta-analyses suggested prophylactic antibiotics around ERCP do not clearly reduce cholangitis, but more recent randomized data show reduced infectious complications with cefoxitin prophylaxis in obstructed patients, and contemporary endoscopy guidance supports selective prophylaxis when drainage is anticipated to be incomplete or in high-risk hosts; I should align with the newer evidence and guideline shifts rather than outdated conclusions [^6eae9d9a] [^6a095f6e] [^3d131808].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: start empiric IV antibiotics immediately for suspected cholangitis, choose ceftriaxone plus metronidazole or piperacillin-tazobactam for mild community-acquired cases, escalate to piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem for moderate-to-severe or healthcare-associated disease, add ampicillin if enterococcal coverage is needed and not already provided, obtain cultures during drainage when possible, de-escalate at 48–72 hours based on results, and target 4–7 total days if the patient improves with drainage, extending for enterococcal bacteremia or persistent infection; throughout, prioritize early biliary decompression because antibiotics alone are insufficient without source control [^da54a4db] [^1ce8c27f] [^f85956e7] [^9a51c21c].

---

Empiric antibiotics for cholangitis should cover **gram-negative rods and anaerobes** [^da54a4db], with **enterococcal coverage added for severe or healthcare-associated cases** [^ad9194b5]. Start **piperacillin-tazobactam** or a **third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole** [^da54a4db]; use a carbapenem if ESBL risk is high or the patient is septic [^ad9194b5]. Adjust to culture results and stop within 4–7 days once drainage is achieved and the patient is clinically stable [^1ce8c27f] [^a1f0609e].

---

## Common pathogens

The most common pathogens include **gram-negative rods** — Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^25b5ba55] — and **gram-positive cocci**, particularly Enterococcus species [^693114d2]. Anaerobes such as Bacteroides species are less common but may be present, especially in severe or complicated cases [^72d40e7a].

---

## Empiric antibiotic recommendations

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly, ideally within 1 hour of presentation, and tailored to local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^notfound]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric antibiotic regimen** |
|-|-|
| Mild to moderate, community-acquired | - Piperacillin-tazobactam [^da54a4db] <br/> - Or ceftriaxone/cefotaxime + metronidazole [^da54a4db] |
| Severe or healthcare-associated | - Piperacillin-tazobactam [^da54a4db] <br/> - Or carbapenem (ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin) [^ad9194b5] |
| Beta-lactam allergy | - Fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) + metronidazole [^da54a4db] <br/> - Or tigecycline (if carbapenem-sparing strategy is needed) [^da54a4db] |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy should be individualized based on clinical response, severity of illness, and whether adequate biliary drainage has been achieved. Generally, **4–7 days** is sufficient if the patient improves clinically and biliary drainage is achieved [^1ce8c27f] [^a1f0609e]. Prolonged therapy beyond 7 days is not routinely recommended unless there is persistent infection or unresolved obstruction.

---

## Role of biliary drainage

Antibiotic therapy alone is insufficient; **prompt biliary drainage** is essential to relieve obstruction and prevent recurrence [^f85956e7]. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the preferred method for biliary drainage, with percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) or surgical intervention reserved for cases where ERCP is not feasible or has failed [^66007423].

---

## Adjustment based on culture results

Once culture and sensitivity results are available, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted to target the identified pathogens. This approach ensures appropriate coverage, minimizes the risk of resistance, and reduces adverse effects [^ce0eb2eb].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broader-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for enterococci and pseudomonas, may be necessary [^ad9194b5].
- **Post-liver transplantation**: Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended due to increased risk of infection [^3d131808].
- **Pediatric patients**: Antibiotic selection should consider age-specific pathogens and dosing adjustments [^notfound].

---

Empiric antibiotic therapy for cholangitis should cover gram-negative rods and anaerobes, with enterococcal coverage added for severe or healthcare-associated cases. Piperacillin-tazobactam or a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole are first-line options, with carbapenems reserved for high-risk patients. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture results and continued for 4–7 days once adequate biliary drainage is achieved and the patient is clinically stable.

Background

Cholangitis is a life-threatening infection of the biliary tract. Historically, the mortality secondary to cholangitis approached 100%. However, with early recognition, antibiotics, resuscitation, and surgical or endoscopic intervention, patient outcomes have significantly improved, although there is still progress to be made.

Objective Of Review

The objective of this review is to provide an emergency medicine-centered approach to the risk factors, presentations, and various diagnostic and treatment modalities in cholangitis.

Discussion

Early recognition and treatment of cholangitis in the emergency department is instrumental in ensuring a favorable outcome for patients. Recognition of acute cholangitis can be challenging, as many patients do not present with the classic symptoms of Charcot's triad. This article reviews the risk factors in cholangitis, as well as the typical presentations and necessary diagnostic studies. Furthermore, once diagnosis is made, distinguishing those requiring emergent biliary decompression from those who may tolerate a delayed procedure can also be difficult. Scoring systems that attempt to identify patients who may tolerate a delayed approach have yet to be validated. This review discusses the appropriate antibiotic therapy based on most common pathogens, as well as the options for achieving biliary decompression.

Conclusions

Cholangitis is a life-threatening infection that carries a high likelihood of poor outcomes if not treated early and aggressively in the emergency department. Appropriate recognition, early broad-spectrum antibiotics, and fluid resuscitation are paramount, and in patients with severe disease, early biliary decompression will significantly reduce mortality.

Bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction can lead to acute cholangitis, a condition characterized by fever, abdominal pain and jaundice. Choledocholithiasis is the most common cause of acute cholangitis and is often associated with bacterial infection and colonization in addition to biliary obstruction. Iatrogenic introduction of bacteria into the biliary system most commonly occurs during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with biliary obstruction. The majority of patients with acute cholangitis respond to antibiotic therapy, but endoscopic biliary drainage is ultimately required to treat the underlying obstruction. Acute cholangitis is often diagnosed using the clinical Charcot triad criteria; however, recommendations from an international consensus meeting in Tokyo produced the most comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis. These guidelines enable a more accurate diagnosis of acute cholangitis than do earlier methods, and they facilitate the classification of disease as mild, moderate or severe. Although these guidelines represent a notable advance toward defining a universally accepted consensus for the definition of acute cholangitis, they have several limitations. This Review discusses current recommendations for the diagnosis of acute cholangitis and addresses the advantages and disadvantages of different modalities for the treatment of this disease.

### Approach to the patient who has suspected acute bacterial cholangitis [^edaf6c30]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Table 4 gives summary recommendations concerning the major decisions that are related to the diagnosis and management of suspected acute bacterial cholangitis. All of these decisions have to be made within the context of disease severity, degree of diagnostic uncertainty, and associated comorbidity. Although these recommendations are based on evidence, there are few randomized controlled trials. Antibiotics that cover gram negatives and anaerobes, along with fluid and electrolyte correction, frequently stabilize the patient. Imaging studies frequently confirm the diagnosis and identify the location and etiology of the obstruction. With or without a definitive diagnosis, ERCP or PTC can be done emergently to establish drainage to control sepsis. Although endoscopic and percutaneous drainage techniques have lower morbidity and mortality than does emergent surgical decompression, optimal management of this potentially life-threatening condition requires close cooperation between the gastroenterologist, radiologist, and surgeon.

### Conventional vs short duration of antibiotics in patients with moderate or severe cholangitis: noninferiority randomized trial [^1ce8c27f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Successful biliary drainage and antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy in management of patients with acute cholangitis. However, the duration of antibiotic therapy after successful biliary drainage has not been prospectively evaluated. We conducted a single-center, randomized, noninferiority trial to compare short duration of antibiotic therapy with conventional duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with moderate or severe cholangitis.

Methods

Consecutive patients were screened for the inclusion criteria and randomized into either conventional duration (CD) group (8 days) or short duration (SD) group (4 days) of antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was clinical cure (absence of recurrence of cholangitis at day 30 and > 50% reduction of bilirubin at day 15). Secondary outcomes were total days of antibiotic therapy and hospitalization within 30 days, antibiotic-related adverse events, and all-cause mortality at day 30.

Results

The study included 120 patients (the mean age was 55.85 ± 13.52 years, and 50% were male patients). Of them, 51.7% patients had malignant etiology and 76.7% patients had moderate cholangitis. Clinical cure was seen in 79.66% (95% confidence interval, 67.58%-88.12%) patients in the CD group and 77.97% (95% confidence interval, 65.74%-86.78%) patients in the SD group (P = 0.822). On multivariate analysis, malignant etiology and hypotension at presentation were associated with lower clinical cure. Total duration of antibiotics required postintervention was lower in the SD group (8.58 ± 1.92 and 4.75 ± 2.32 days; P < 0.001). Duration of hospitalization and mortality were similar in both the groups.

Discussion

Short duration of antibiotics is noninferior to conventional duration in patients with moderate-to-severe cholangitis in terms of clinical cure, recurrence of cholangitis, and overall mortality.

Cholangitis management background — comparative effectiveness and alternatives emphasize that patients with cholangitis may respond to medical therapy including antibiotics; however, decompression of the biliary tree is necessary in most cases, surgical mortality ranges from 10% to 40% and has been correlated with disease severity, randomized comparative trials indicate that ERCP achieves biliary decompression with markedly less morbidity and mortality compared with surgery regardless of clinical severity, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage represents an alternative option with a less defined role, and the timing of ERCP and whether duct clearance should be attempted during the initial ERCP remain controversial.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^25b5ba55]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute cholangitis is a potentially life-threatening infection of the biliary tract. The main underlying pathological process is obstruction of bile ducts leading to cholestasis and impeded clearance of intestinal microorganisms ascending from the duodenum. The increase in biliary tract pressure and the local inflammatory response to the infecting organisms impair the integrity of the biliary epithelium, facilitate bacterial translocation into the circulation, and promote systemic inflammation. In addition, certain procedures, such as sphincterotomy, stent placement or biliodigestive anastomosis, can predispose to bacteriobilia and cholangitis. In these situations, infection of the biliary tract may develop in the absence of obstruction.

The clinical course of acute cholangitis ranges from mild abdominal symptoms to sepsis and shock. Despite considerable progress in the treatment of acute cholangitis during the last decades, recent studies still report mortality rates of up to 10%. As with other localized infections, treatment success depends on efficient source control and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Source control is achieved by biliary decompression by endoscopic or percutaneous drainage. The importance of antibiotic therapy is highlighted by the fact that inappropriate empirical therapy is associated with increased mortality.

Studies from different geographic regions of the world consistently found E.coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterococcus spp. as most common pathogens in ascending cholangitis. Thus, the microbial spectrum to be covered by empirical therapy seems to be well defined in general. However, individual patient factors as well as local resistance patterns can increase the probability for infection with resistant enterobacterales, P.aeruginosa or other difficult-to-treat pathogens. Enterobacterales resistant to third generation cephalosporines (3GCRE) are of particular importance because their treatment regularly requires the use of carbapenems. Because of the rising prevalence of cephalosporine resistance, the clinician is confronted with the dilemma of ensuring broad empirical antibiotic coverage while at the same time avoiding excessive use of carbapenems. Particularly in institutions with a high prevalence of 3GCRE, it seems difficult to define a role for carbapenem-sparing regimens. Knowledge of local susceptibility rates alone is not sufficient to solve this problem.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^ad9194b5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Empirical therapy of cholangitis represents an educated guess based on spectrum and likelihood of causative pathogens and their expected antimicrobial susceptibility. Accordingly, the current Tokyo guideline recommends third generation cephalosporines, piperacillin/tazobactam or carbapenems for empirical treatment the choice of which should be guided by local susceptibility data and the severity of the infection. For severe cases and hospital-acquired infections anti-pseudomonal agents and coverage of enterococci are recommended. Because optimal empirical treatment may vary greatly between different institutions, a multi-disciplinary approach is suggested.

Although these recommendations provide a useful framework in general, the selection of antibiotic therapy is still associated with various uncertainties. Without guidance by local susceptibility data, it is difficult for the attending physician to make his choice between the three betalactam-options. Carbapenems seem to be the safest choice, because of their bactericidal activity against most gram-negative rods resistant to third generation cephalosporins and acylureidopenicillins. However, increased carbapenem usage promotes carbapenem-resistance, which is regarded a major global public health problem. According to recognized principles of antibiotic stewardship, it is therefore widely advocated that carbapenems should be used in a restrictive manner in order to minimize the selection pressure favouring growth of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.

Even if local susceptibility rates are available, they are usually not provided in respect to specific disease entities despite considerable disease-specific variations making the choice of the optimal empirical therapy difficult. Owing to the rising prevalence of resistant gram-negative rods, carbapenems often seem to be the only effective option left. Particularly, empirical therapy guided by microbiological data only may fall short in respect to the goals of modern antibiotic therapy if patient-related response rates are not taken into account. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyse both microbiological as well as patient data in order to optimize empirical therapy of acute cholangitis. To this end, our analysis identified risk factors for 3GCRE and/or MRGN. Although we did find a high overall prevalence of cepholosporine resistant enterobacterales in bile and blood cultures of our patients, our results imply that piperacilline/tazobactam is a highly effective option for patients with community-acquired cholangitis, without pre-existing biliary prosthesis, and not treated on an ICU.

Acute cholangitis, also referred to as ascending cholangitis, is an infection of the biliary tree characterized by fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain, which in most cases is the consequence of biliary obstruction. Diagnosis is commonly made by the presence of clinical features, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The treatment modalities include administration of intravenous fluids, antimicrobial therapy, and prompt drainage of the bile duct. Early diagnosis and treatment of acute cholangitis are crucial to prevent unwanted clinical outcome of the disease.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing elective endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [^b7b6dc26]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The use of prophylactic antibiotics before endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is recommended by all major international gastroenterological societies, especially in the presence of an obstructed biliary system. Their use is intended to decrease or eliminate the incidence of complications following the procedure, namely cholangitis, cholecystitis, septicaemia, and pancreatitis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics before elective ERCP in patients without evidence of acute or chronic cholecystitis, or acute or chronic cholangitis, or severe acute pancreatitis.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and LILACS until March 2010. Relevant medical and surgical international conference proceedings were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised clinical trials were included in the analyses, irrespective of blinding, language, or publication status. Participants were patients that underwent elective ERCP that were not on antibiotics, without evidence of acute or chronic cholecystitis, cholangitis, or severe acute pancreatitis before the procedure. We compared patients that received prophylactic antibiotics before the procedure with patients that were given placebo or no intervention before the procedure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review was conducted according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration as well as the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group. Review Manager 5 was used employing fixed-effect and random-effects models meta-analyses.

Main Results

Nine randomised clinical trials (1573 patients) were included in the analyses. The majority of the trials had risks of bias. When all patients providing data for a certain outcome were included, the fixed-effect meta-analyses significantly favoured the use of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing cholangitis (relative risk (RR) 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.91), septicaemia (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.11), bacteriaemia (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.78), and pancreatitis (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.00). In random-effects meta-analyses, only the effect on bacteriaemia remained significant. Overall mortality was not reduced (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.32 to 5.44). If one selects patients in whom the ERCP resolved the biliary obstruction at the first procedure, there seem to be no significant benefit in using prophylactic antibiotics to prevent cholangitis (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.69, only three trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ERCP. In the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ERCP, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. Further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ERCP if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^a4207ff2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ineffective antibiotic therapy increases mortality of acute cholangitis. The choice of antibiotics should reflect local resistance patterns and avoid the overuse of broad-spectrum agents. In this study, we analysed how results of bile and blood cultures and patient data can be used for selection of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangits.

Methods

Pathogen frequencies and susceptibility rates were determined in 423 positive bile duct cultures and 197 corresponding blood cultures obtained from 348 consecutive patients with acute cholangitis. Patient data were retrieved from the medical records. Associations of patient and microbiological data were assessed using the Chi-2 test and multivariate binary logistic regression.

Results

In bile cultures, enterobacterales and enterococci were isolated with equal frequencies of approximately 30% whereas in blood cultures, enterobacterales predominated (56% compared to 21% enterococci). Antibiotic resistance rates of enterobacterales were > 20% for fluorochinolones, cephalosporines and acylureidopenicillins but not for carbapenems (< 2%). The efficacy of empirical therapy was poor with a coverage of bacterial bile and blood culture isolates in 51 and 69%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, predictors for pathogen species, antibiotic susceptibility and expected antibiotic coverage were identified.

Conclusions

In unselected patients treated for acute cholangitis in a large tertiary refferential center, use of carbapenems seems necessary to achieve a high antibiotic coverage. However, by analysis of patient and microbiological data, subgroups for highly effective carbapenem-sparing therapy can be defined. For patients with community-acquired cholangitis without biliary prosthesis who do not need intensive care, piperacillin/tazobactam represents a regimen with an expected excellent antibiotic coverage.

### Is antibiotic prophylaxis warranted in all patients with biliary obstruction undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5a75af6f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Goals

To evaluate whether prophylactic antibiotics improve infectious complication rates after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Background

Current guidelines recommend prophylactic antibiotics before ERCP only in cases of anticipated incomplete biliary drainage or severe immunosuppression. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested a benefit regardless of drainage status. This systematic review and meta-analysis assess the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on post-ERCP infectious complications.

Study

A systematic search of major databases was conducted through June 2024 for RCTs comparing ERCP outcomes with and without antibiotic prophylaxis. Pooled data were analyzed for the composite outcome of infectious complications, including cholangitis, bacteremia, and sepsis. Mortality and pancreatitis were also analyzed. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and regressions for funnel plot asymmetry. Our analysis implemented a dichotomous regression model with random effects using R software.

Results

Eleven RCTs with 2105 patients were included, with 1086 receiving antibiotics and 1019 serving as controls. Infectious complications were significantly lower in the antibiotic group [risk difference (RD): -0.08, 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.02, P = 0.00001, I2: 83%]. Beta-lactam and cephalosporin antibiotics had a greater effect (RD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.17 to -0.04, P = 0.00001, I2: 85%). Bacteremia rates were also reduced (RD: -0.06, 95% CI: -0.11 to -0.01, P = 0.01, I2: 58%). No significant differences were found in cholangitis, sepsis, pancreatitis, or mortality. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces post-ERCP infectious complications and should be considered in all patients with biliary obstruction who are undergoing ERCP.

Antibiotics and gut-targeted therapies

A key role of the gut microbiome in PSC pathophysiology is highly likely, but the exact mechanisms whereby the gut microenvironment interacts with biliary inflammation and peribiliary fibrogenesis are still under investigation. The potential impact is multifactorial, including effects from pathobiont or opportunists like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococci, and Veillonella spp. along with altered gut microbial metabolism resulting from shifts in microbiome composition. Several small trials have shown improvements in ALP from absorbable (eg, metronidazole) and nonabsorbable (eg, vancomycin) antibiotics.– How these changes in liver blood tests relate to a potential impact on gut inflammation in IBD in PSC can so far only be speculated. In the pediatric setting, off-label vancomycin prescription for PSC has gained popularity.

For a scientific topic, the discussion on vancomycin prescription and potential reimbursement has become quite tempered. Learned society clinical practice guidelines advise against long-term antibiotics in PSC except for recurrent bacterial cholangitis, while advocacy is being made from both patient representatives and certain academic centers to implement vancomycin prescription in routine practice for PSC, even with associated reimbursement. The discussion holds considerable relevance since the implicit consequence of routine prescription of vancomycin would be to compromise the type and volume of evidence normally required for the introduction of therapeutic modalities with the argument that PSC is rare and difficult to study. The proof-of-concept vancomycin data support a role of the gut microbiota in PSC pathophysiology, but from such proof-of-concept data to make short-cuts into clinical applications with associated concerns on long-term safety and efficacy is a route likely not to benefit patients. Adequately powered clinical trials for vancomycin (such as NCT03710122 and NCT05876182) are warranted, addressing distinctively efficacy for IBD versus liver disease in PSC, respectively. The underlying biological mechanisms responsible for vancomycin-associated effects must also be determined.

A range of other modalities is also being explored for manipulation of the gut microbiota in PSC and other liver and non-liver diseases. Of particular interest are specific approaches, either targeting particular pathobionts, such as bacteriophage-mediated killing of Klebsiella pneumoniae, or targeted correction of the metabolic consequences of microbiome perturbations through supplementation (eg, vitamin B6 supplementation) or in vitro and in vivo genetic engineering of bacterial features. – With time and an increased understanding of the exact roles of the gut microbiota in PSC, clinical trials based on such specific approaches are likely to replace broad approaches like antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation.

### Prophylactic antibiotics cannot prevent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-induced cholangitis: a meta-analysis [^6eae9d9a]. Pancreas (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prophylactic effect of antibiotics on post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) cholangitis or sepsis reduction in randomized controlled trials.

Methods

Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Science Citation Index updated to June 2007 were searched. Main outcome measure was post-ERCP cholangitis or sepsis.

Results

Seven trials were identified, and a total of 1389 patients were included; post-ERCP cholangitis occurred in 5.8% of controls (41/705) versus 3.4% of treated patients (23/684), without statistical significance (relative risk [RR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22–1.55). Subsequent sensitivity analysis on trials mainly targeted at patients with suspicious biliary obstruction showed that the incidences of post-ERCP cholangitis were 2.8% (12/425) and 5.4% (24/441) in the antibiotics and control groups, respectively, and this sensitivity analysis did not support antibiotics' preventive effect (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.03–3.32). Another sensitivity analysis exclusively including trials with intravenous route of antibiotics administration also failed to confirm the prophylactic effect of antibiotics (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.18–1.60).

Conclusions

Antibiotics cannot significantly prevent ERCP-induced cholangitis in unselected patients and should not be routinely recommended. Yet, more trials including patients with predicted incomplete biliary drainage are still required to prove the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in this setting.

In our study, we investigated whether the analysis of patient factors and their association with pathogens and antibiotic resistance could be helpful to avoid overuse of carbapenems and other broad-spectrum antibiotics. To this end, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 348 patients treated for ascending cholangitis in Germany's largest university medical center. We determined the pathogen spectrum and antibiotic susceptibilities of enterobacterales and enterococci in biliary and blood samples from these patients. Particularly, we analysed the significance of various patient factors for predicting the isolation of bacterial biliary pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility profile. Our results demonstrate, how the combination of microbiological and patient data can be used for the choice of efficacious antibiotic therapy of patients with acute cholangitis.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for cholangitis after successful endoscopic drainage of the biliary tract [^a1f0609e]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Drainage of the obstructed biliary tree is the mainstay of therapy for patients with acute cholangitis; antibiotic therapy is complementary. It is unknown whether it is necessary to continue therapy with antibiotics once biliary drainage is achieved and signs of systemic inflammation have subsided.

Methods

Patients who presented with acute cholangitis and were successfully treated at ERCP were studied retrospectively. Patients were followed for 6 months after ERCP.

Results

Eighty patients fulfilled study criteria. In 46% of patients blood cultures grew microorganisms. All patients recovered from the episode under study. Antibiotic therapy after ERCP was given for a median duration of 3 days (range: 0–42). Forty-one patients received antibiotic therapy for 3 days or less, 19 for 4 or 5 days, and 20 patients longer than 5 days. The 3 groups were well-matched. In none of the patients did the index episode of cholangitis result in a secondary complication not present at the time of ERCP. The percentage of patients with recurrent cholangitis (24%) was not statistically different for the 3 groups (p = 0.80).

Conclusions

Short-duration antibiotic therapy (3 days) appears sufficient when adequate drainage is achieved and fever is abating.

### Clinical and biochemical factors for bacteria in bile among patients with acute cholangitis [^ed2bd141]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cholangitis, the most common hepatobiliary system disease, is an infectious condition caused by partial or complete obstruction of the biliary system and can have life-threatening consequences if not given timely treatment. Fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice are typical clinical manifestations of patients with acute cholangitis and obstruction of the bile duct is the main cause of biliary obstruction. No bacteria are present in the bile under normal physiological conditions due to effective defensive mechanisms. Upon biliary obstruction, the following occur: the antibacterial barrier is disrupted by cholestasis, tight junction cholangiocytes are altered, immunoglobulin A production decreases, and biliary system pressure increases, which lead to bacteria migration from the duodenum into the biliary tract and causes infection. Persistently elevated intraductal pressure can cause bacteria reflux into the systemic circulation from the bile, leading to bacteremia and progression from a local infection to systemic inflammation and ultimately, death.

Controlling biliary infection and obstruction release are the most common two important strategies in the clinical management of acute cholangitis. Treatment methods include intravenous fluid, antibiotic administration, and biliary drainage. Empiric antibiotics are effective in the majority of patients with mild symptoms. However, bacteria can still be isolated from the bile of some patients after empirical antibiotic treatment, indicating that empirical antibiotic usage may not be sufficient for infection control. The presence of bacteria in bile increased the risk of entering the circulation system when invasive operations were conducted to remove the stone in the biliary duct system, consequently resulting in systemic infection. Thus, the spectrum of pathogens in bile and the resistance pattern would aid in guiding antibiotic therapy in patients with acute cholangitis. In fact, antibiotic regimens have to be adjusted during hospitalization for more than 40% of patients. However, there is limited data on risk factors related to positive culture results in bile specimens before bile drainage. Therefore, bile samples were collected to analyze the distribution of bacteria that remain in patients with acute cholangitis after antibiotic treatment. Clinical manifestations and laboratory tests upon admission were reviewed to predict the presence of bacteria in bile when bile drainage was conducted.

TREATMENT

A recent Clinical Guideline of the American College of Gastroenterology concludes that there is ".no approved or proven therapy… " for PSC. On the other hand, there is some evidence that antibiotic therapy is beneficial in patients with PSC. Since an initial case series of a patient with PSC was published in 1958, a number of treatments including immune suppression have been tested, but none have proven to alter the course of disease or cure this disease. Indeed, until now, PSC has a poor prognosis, and OLT is so far the only proven therapy to extend life expectancy.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^1829bdf3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, we found a high prevalence of 3GCRE or even MRGN in bile and blood samples obtained from patients with acute cholangitis as would have been expected for a tertiary referential center with associated liver transplant unit. Carrier status, a high burden of comorbitiy, the presence of biliary stenosis, and repeated biliary tract interventions were identified as risk factors for isolation of resistant gram negative bile culture isolates. Only the combined analysis of microbiological and patient data revealed piperacillin/tazobactam as an excellent choice for empiric therapy of patients with community acquired cholangitis, no biliary prosthesis, and no previous or ongoing ICU treatment. The study thus provides an example of how the Tokyo guideline recommendations can be specified for a particular institution on the basis of local microbiology and individual patient characteristics.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^fce34d8c]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) management: All patients with PSC should be considered for participation in clinical trials. In patients not eligible or interested in clinical trials with persistently elevated ALP or GGT, UDCA 13–23 mg/kg/day can be considered for treatment and continued if there is a meaningful reduction or normalization in ALP (GGT in children) and/or symptoms improve with 12 months of treatment. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of oral vancomycin for the treatment of PSC. Patients with PSC with a diagnosis of concurrent AIH should be treated according to the AASLD AIH guidelines. Antibiotics should be used for bacterial cholangitis with consideration for MRCP to rule out relevant strictures. ERCP should be preferred for the treatment of dominant strictures with careful patient selection and assessment of risks versus benefits and alternatives. Antibiotics should be administered periprocedurally. Upper endoscopy to screen for varices should be performed if the LS is > 20 kPa by TE or the platelet count is ≤ 150,000/mm3.

Acute cholangitis is a life-threatening emergency, caused by blockage of bile, most commonly by a gallstone (choledocholithiasis). Stasis of bile leads to an infection in the biliary tree known as cholangitis. Cholangitis is graded into 3 categories according to severity of symptoms. The infections are polymicrobial and are predominantly gram-negative rods. Management consists of early initiation of antibiotics and prompt biliary decompression. The biliary tree can be drained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, rendezvous, or surgical means. Future directions will focus on improving quality of and access to minimally invasive means of clearing the biliary tree.

How do I manage complications of PSC?

Cholangitis

Cholangitis is a common complication of PSC. Bacterobilia is reported in 55% of patients at the time of liver transplantation, increasing to at least 77% in those who have predisposing factors such as biliary strictures or previous biliary instrumentation. Cholangitis can present without significant change in baseline liver biochemistry as infections can be limited to small liver segments. A clear risk factor for cholangitis or positive bile cultures is previous ERCP with or without therapeutic intervention, with the highest risk seen when stents are left in situ. A study (not in PSC) reported a positive bile culture rate of 98% in those with a stent in situ and 55% in those without. The number and variety of bacterial isolates were inversely proportional to the time since the last ERCP. Another potential source of cholangitis is portal bacteraemia, which has been described in patients with active colitis.ERCP is a risk major factor for cholangitis in PSC and antibiotics should be routinely used as recommended above.

Biliary infections are often polymicrobial, but the most common organisms are Eschericia coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Steptococcus, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides species. The choice of antibiotic agent should be directed by local practice after taking into consideration the history, severity of liver or renal disease and bacterial sensitivities. A common first-line agent for mild episodes is a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. More severe cases are usually treated with intravenous cephalosporins or extended spectrum penicillins with the addition of anaerobic cover. Candida species have been isolated from the bile of 8/67 (12%) patients with PSC undergoing ERCP. However, the clinical relevance of fungal contamination of bile is unknown. Antifungal therapy should be considered in those with cholangitis not responding to antibiotic therapy.

Patients with severe acute cholangitis and dominant bile duct strictures require urgent biliary decompression, as the mortality in those untreated is high. In patients with recurrent cholangitis secondary to complex intrahepatic cholangiopathy, rotation of antibiotics is occasionally used. This can lead to multiple antibiotic resistances and should be avoided where possible. Where this option is considered, expert multidisciplinary assessment, including formal microbiology advice, should be sought.

Antibiotic therapy

In 229 patients the empirical antibiotic regimen could be determined from the clinical records. One hundred thirty-six patients (59%) received monotherapy, and 93 patients (41%) were treated with a combinational regimen. The most commonly prescribed substances were cephalosporines, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam and fluorochinolones (Table 5). The most frequent combinational therapy consisted of a beta-lactam plus metronidazole. With the regimens employed, bacterial organisms isolated from bile were covered in only 51% of patients (taking into account all isolates of a sample). Even more importantly, empiric coverage of blood culture isolates was only 69%. Amongst patients with bacteremia, three out of 11 (27%) patients with inadequate empirical therapy deceased, compared to only two out of 22 (8%) patients with adequate therapy.

Empirical antibiotic treatment

A total of 229 patients were studied

a 2nd or 3rd generation

The primary goals of antibiotic therapy in ascending cholangitis are to prevent and treat systemic spread of the infection. In order to test whether carbapenem-sparing antibiotic therapy might be used at least for certain selected patients, we analysed antibiotic coverage in patient subgroups defined by simple patient-associated factors. For this analysis, the efficacy of the antibiotic therapy was evaluated in respect to the blood culture isolates, because a positive blood culture obviously represents proof of systemic spread. As shown in Table 6, blood culture isolates obtained from patients with community-acquired cholangitis (biliary sampling within 48 h of admission), without indwelling biliary drainage, and no ICU treatment would have been covered by piperacillin/tazobactam by 100%. In comparison, only a 78% coverage rate would have been achieved by third generation cephalosporines. In these patients, the use of carbapenems does not further improve antibiotic coverage.

Antibiotic treatment

Although there are no clinical data to support the use of antibiotics with biliary penetration for these patients, the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections may also depend on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations. Obviously, in patients with obstructed bile ducts, the biliary penetration of antibiotics may be poor and effective biliary concentrations are reached only in a minority of patients.

Antibiotics commonly used to treat biliary tract infections and their biliary penetration ability are illustrated in Table 9.

### Mortality risk for acute cholangitis (MAC): a risk prediction model for in-hospital mortality in patients with acute cholangitis [^3168e1e6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Proposed treatment algorithm for prospective evaluation

Based on the optimal cut-off value (0.7%) of the prediction model, patients were classified into a high risk and a low risk group (Fig. 2). Referring to the Tokyo guidelines, the low risk group was further subdivided into acute cholangitis with a mild (grade I) and a moderate (grade II) grade of severity. According to the Tokyo guidelines, moderate grade of severity applies if any two of the following conditions are fulfilled: Leucocyte > 12 G/l or < 4 G/l, high fever ≥ 39 °C, age ≥ 75 years, bilirubin ≥ 5 mg/dl. Thus, acute cholangitis of the low risk group, which do not fulfil the above mentioned criteria for moderate grade (II) of severity are defined as acute cholangitis with a mild (I) grade of severity. Dependent on the risk groups, the following treatment recommendation are proposed:

Figure 2
Recommended treatment algorithm based on the calculated mortality risk

Low risk mortality group

Elective biliary drainage is recommended for acute cholangitis with a mild grade of severity (according to the Tokyo guidelines). In case of acute cholangitis with a moderate grade of severity (according to the Tokyo guidelines), early biliary (within 24 h) drainage should be performed

High risk mortality group

Urgent biliary drainage is recommended for patients with a high predicted mortality risk. Dependent on the level of mortality risk, biliary drainage should be performed either immediately or within a narrow time frame (within hours).

In all three groups, immediate initiation of antimicrobial treatment is recommended. The use of broad spectrum antibiotics should be adapted to the local resistance situation, the individual risk for multi-resistant bacteria and to the individual predicted mortality risk.

Implementation

Due to its elaborateness, it is not possible to put the prediction model to paper. Therefore, the risk prediction model is available online on. After the user has made his choices for the risk predictors, an individual risk prediction, the membership to a certain risk group and a treatment recommendation is returned for the patient.

Antimicrobial therapy for biliary infections

Antibiotics are always recommended in complicated cholecystitis and in delayed treatment of uncomplicated cholecystitis.

In uncomplicated cholecystitis, when the focus of infection is treated effectively by cholecystectomy, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary beyond prophylaxis.

Patients with an infected focus that can be eradicated effectively by surgical intervention can potentially be treated with only 24 hours of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

The most important factors for antimicrobial drug selection in biliary infections are antimicrobial activity against causative bacteria, clinical patient's condition and biliary levels of the antimicrobial agents (Recommendation 1 B).

Knowledge of the secretion of antibiotics into bile and of their efficacy should be helpful in choosing the best therapeutic regimen (Recommendation 1 C).

Organisms most often isolated in biliary infections are the gram-negative aerobes, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and anaerobes, especially Bacteroides fragilis. Activity against enterococci is not required since their pathogenicity in biliary tract infections remains unclear.

The efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections depends on effective biliary antibiotic concentrations.

It has been debated whether antimicrobials with good biliary penetration should be recommended for biliary infections. However, there are no clinical or experimental data to strongly support the recommendation of antimicrobials with excellent biliary penetration for these patients. Other important factors include the antimicrobial potency of individual compounds, and the effect of bile on antibacterial activity.

Penicillins are still frequently used in biliary infections. Aminopenicillins such as amoxicillin are excreted unchanged in the bile. In patients with normal function of biliary tract, amoxicillin bile concentrations are higher than the serum concentrations (3 rates higher than the concentrations in plasma).

Fluoroquinolones have excellent bioavailability; they are excreted by renal, hepatic and biliary excretion. Ciprofloxacin biliary concentrations are generally higher then the concentrations in the plasma (28 to 45 rates higher than the concentrations in plasma). Besides, ciprofloxacin has been proven to reach high biliary concentrations also in patients with obstruction due to the anticipated secretion of quinolone by biliary epithelium. An alternative to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may be indicated for biliary infections, in no critically ill patient and in absence of risk factors for resistance patterns.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^72d40e7a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, polymicrobial growth occurred in almost 70% of bile samples with enterobacterales and enterococci being the most common pathogens, each accounting for about one third of bile isolates. Anaerobes were detected in less than 10% of our patients. These results are consistent with other recent reports and revise the classic view that both enterobacterales and anaerobes are the most important pathogens in biliary tract infections. Bacteremia was detected in one third of cases with available blood culture results. Reflecting their differing virulence, and in agreement with a recent large multicenter trial on biliary infections, enterobacterales comprised almost 60% and enterococci only 20% of blood culture isolates. In line with previous studies, our multivariate analysis found the presence of a biliary prosthesis an independent predictor for enterococcal isolation from bile. The Tokyo guideline recommends empirical treatment covering enterococci in severe community-acquired cholangitis – and in health-care associated infections if patients are colonized or enterococci are otherwise of concern. We agree on this but would like to point out that enterococcal coverage should particularly be considered in patients carrying an indwelling biliary drainage. As stated in the guideline, VRE carrier status should be taken into account in the choice of substance.

### Randomized trial of prophylactic antibiotics for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with biliary obstruction [^6a095f6e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

The incidence of postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) infections is reported to be up to 18% in patients with biliary obstruction. Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of infectious complications after ERCP; however, the clinical value of prophylactic antibiotics in ERCP remains controversial.

METHODS:

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to investigate whether the use of prophylactic antibiotics would reduce infectious complications after ERCP in patients with biliary obstruction. We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single dose of 1 g intravenous cefoxitin or normal saline as a placebo 30 minutes before undergoing ERCP. The primary outcome was the incidence of infectious complications after ERCP.

RESULTS:

We enrolled 378 patients, and 189 patients were assigned to each group. The risk of infectious complications after ERCP was 2.8% (5 of 176 patients) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 9.8% (17 of 173 patients) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11–0.74, P = 0.0073). The incidence rates of bacteremia were 2.3% (4 of 176 patients) and 6.4% (11 of 173 patients), respectively (risk ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12–1.04; P = 0.0599). The incidence rate of cholangitis was 1.7% (3 of 176 patients) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 6.4% (11 of 173 patients) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08–0.87; P = 0.0267).

DISCUSSION:

Antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP in patients with biliary obstruction resulted in a significantly lower risk of infectious complications, especially cholangitis, than placebo (trial number NCT02958059).

### Routine bile collection for microbiological analysis during cholangiography and its impact on the management of cholangitis [^ebb09587]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment of cholangitis is often insufficient because of inappropriate antibiotic use or bacterial resistance.

Objective

To evaluate the role of routine bile collection during endoscopic retrograde cholangiography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for microbiological analysis in the antibiotic management of cholangitis and to identify risk factors of bacteriobilia.

Design

Prospective, observational, diagnostic study.

Setting

Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

Patients and Intervention

This study involved 243 consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiography/percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for biliary complications after orthotopic liver transplantation (27%), malignancy (27%), primary sclerosing cholangitis (15%), benign strictures (11%), and choledocholithiasis (8%).

Main Outcome Measurements

Microbiological examination of bile samples.

Results

Patients with biliary stents or who were receiving repeated interventions after orthotopic liver transplantation were at increased risk of bacteriobilia (P < .05). The rate of gram-positive monomicrobial infection was higher in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (P < .01). In 40 examinations, patients presented with preprocedural cholangitis although they were receiving antibiotics. According to bile culture results, the antibiotic treatment was modified to a more specific therapy in 72.5% of patients. In patients who developed cholangitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (27 examinations), specific antibiotic treatment was started or refined in 67% of cases, based on bile culture results.

Limitations

Contamination of samples during intervention cannot be totally excluded.

Conclusion

Orthotopic liver transplantation, biliary stenting, and repeated interventions are risk factors of bacteriobilia. In our patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, gram-positive monomicrobial infections were more common. A bile sample collected during cholangiography for microbiological analysis is a simple, potentially valuable, diagnostic tool in patients with cholangitis. Each center should recognize its own patterns of infection to ensure ideal targeted therapy.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of cholangitis in patients with biliary atresia status post-kasai portoenterostomy: a systematic review [^b8a4d25c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing cholangitis, we conducted a systematic review comparing cholangitis occurrence in biliary atresia patients after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) with and without antibiotics.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases from April 1, 2013, using search terms "biliary atresia" OR "cholangitis" AND "antibiotics", selecting studies with control group data.

Results

Four of 509 titles met inclusion criteria, yielding a total of 319 patients from 3 countries. Three studies were retrospective cohorts and one was a randomized clinical trial. Two cohort studies concluded that prophylactic antibiotics reduced incidence of cholangitis and one did not. The randomized clinical trial supported prophylaxis after comparing the prospective randomized groups to a historical control group.

Conclusion

Few published studies measure the effect of prophylactic antibiotics after Kasai portoenterostomy. We identified 4 studies and they presented contradictory results. Prospective research is needed.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^152b552e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient data were extracted from the hospital records. In patients hospitalized several times for recurrent cholangitis, only the most recent episode was analysed. Also, in patients with more than one procedure of bile sampling during the same hospital stay, only culture results obtained during the first sampling procedure were considered for correlation of patient factors with microbiological data. Data on empirical antibiotic treatment were available for 229 patients.

The statistical evaluation was carried out after consultation with the Institute for Biometry and Clinical Epidemiology of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin using SPSS version 23.0. Significant differences in categorical variables were assessed using the Chi-2 test. Predictors with p ≤ 0.2 in the univariate analysis were then tested using multivariate binary logistic regression through backward elimination and forward selection. The significance level in two-sided testing was p < 0.05.

Ethics, consent and permissions

The study was approved by the internal review board (local ethics committee of Charité – Universitätmedizin Berlin; registry number EA2/033/16). The need for informed consent was waived for this retrospective study.

Ascending cholangitis

Ascending cholangitis is a life-threatening condition that must be treated in a timely manner.

Early treatment, which includes appropriate antibiotic coverage, hydratation, and biliary decompression, is of utmost importance in the management of acute cholangitis (Recommendation 1A).

The appropriatness of biliary drainage in patients with acute cholangitis depends on specific clinical findings, and this procedure may be secondary to a previous failed treatment.

Cholangitis varies greatly in severity, ranging from a mild form requiring parenteral antibiotics to severe or suppurative cholangitis, which requires early drainage of the biliary tree to prevent further complications.

Retrospective studies have shown that, 20–30 years ago, when biliary drainage was not available, the mortality rate of conservatively treated acute cholangitis was extremely high.

Given that emergency biliary drainage in patients with acute cholangitis is not always necessary or feasible, it is very important that surgeons promptly and effectively triage patients, distinguishing those who require this urgent procedure from those who do not.

In 2001, Hui et al. published a prospective study investigating predictive criteria for emergency biliary decompression for 142 patients with acute cholangitis. Emergency ERCP was associated with fever, a maximum heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute, albumin less than 30 g/L, bilirubin greater than 50 μmol/L, and prothrombin time exceeding 14 seconds.

There are 3 common methods used to perform biliary drainage: endoscopic drainage, percutaneous transhepatic drainage, and open drainage.

Endoscopic drainage of the biliary tree is safer and more effective than open drainage (Recommendation A).

Endoscopic biliary drainage is a well-established means of biliary decompression for patients with acute cholangitis caused by malignant or benign biliary disease and associated biliary obstruction.

Many retrospective case-series studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of percutaneous transhepatic drainage.

Endoscopic modalities of biliary drainage are currently favored over percutaneous procedures due to reduced complication rates. There are currently no RCTs comparing endoscopic and percutaneous drainage. (Recommendation 2C).

Currently, only retrospective studies have been published comparing the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in the treatment of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. These reports confirmed the clinical efficacy of endoscopic drainage as well as its ability to facilitate subsequent endoscopic or surgical intervention.

Open drainage should only be performed for patients for whom endoscopic or percutaneous transhepatic drainage has failed or is otherwise contraindicated (Recommendation 2C).

Given the shortened length of hospitalization and the rarity of serious complications such as intraperitoneal hemorrhage and biliary peritonitis, endoscopic drainage is preferred to open drainage.

### Microbiology of bile aspirates obtained at ERCP in patients with suspected acute cholangitis [^32cc7896]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cholangitis is a frequently encountered clinical entity that can have potentially fatal consequences if not detected and treated promptly. There is a high risk of end-organ damage, leading to a significant mortality rate if treatment is not instituted promptly, which drops to < 5% with timely and appropriate interventions. Treatment for acute cholangitis is incumbent on prompt and adequate hemodynamic resuscitation, and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy to limit the local and systemic inflammatory response to sepsis and to contain the spread of infection, followed by the achievement of definitive source control by decompressing the biliary tree to relieve biliary obstruction. Biliary decompression is most often achieved by techniques applied at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Multiple studies support superior outcomes and improved mortality with ERCP compared with interventional radiology or surgical modalities. The selection of appropriate empiric antimicrobial agents in acute cholangitis is an important cornerstone of medical decision-making that is frequently encountered in clinical care.

Our group has previously reported the microbiology of bile cultures aspirated at the time of ERCP in patients with acute cholangitis and cholestasis. In our prior study, the bile aspirates from 160 patients from 1994 to 2000 were analyzed. In the bile aspirates, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae were most commonly isolated. Polymicrobial infections and Enterococcus infections were more frequently identified in patients with previously placed plastic biliary stents. Based on susceptibility data, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone were effective against Gram-negative bacilli in 96% and 91% of cases, respectively. This has supported the use of these antibiotics for routine empiric antibiotic coverage in patients with suspected acute cholangitis.

With widespread use of antibiotics and the global emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, efforts are currently underway to identify microbiological characteristics and recognize patterns of drug resistance related to intra-abdominal infections to help in directing prudent antimicrobial choice, early de-escalation to pathogen-directed therapy, and appropriate termination of therapy. This has prompted prior studies and new recommendations from medical societies reinforcing these principles.

The primary aim of this study was to describe the microbiology patterns of bile aspirates obtained at the time of ERCP in patients suspected of having acute cholangitis. Secondary aims included: (i) the identification of factors that affect the microbiology patterns, such as the presence/absence of a biliary sphincterotomy, presence/absence of a biliary stent; and (ii) a description of the presence of microbiological resistance among the obtained biliary organisms.

### Role of antibiotic prophylaxis in liver transplant patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^68d63a69]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is frequently performed in liver transplant recipients for the management of biliary complications. While frequently medically necessary, ERCP carries a risk of post-procedural infections, particularly in immunosuppressed transplant patients. Prophylactic antibiotics are sometimes recommended, but their role remains uncertain. We aimed to address this knowledge gap.

Methods

This single-arm systematic review and meta-analysis included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case-control studies evaluating the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to or during ERCP (for any indication) in liver transplant recipients. No restrictions were placed on patient age, sex, or ethnicity. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published between database inception and June 2025. Primary outcomes of interest were incidence of post-ERCP cholangitis, infection, or pancreatitis, incidence of overall procedural complications, and mortality attributable to procedural complications. The quality of included studies was assessed via ROBINS-I. This work is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024604381.

Findings

This review included 26 studies involving more than 3800 liver transplant recipients undergoing over 7300 ERCP procedures. All studies were non-randomised, comprising nine prospective and 17 retrospective studies. The pooled complication rate was 25.7% per patient and 6.7% per procedure; the pooled cholangitis rate was 8.6% per patient and 3.5% per procedure; and the pooled pancreatitis rate was 6.1% per patient and 1.9% per procedure. In the overall cohort, the pooled mortality rate due to post-ERCP complications was 1.1% with two deaths reported among 594 patients. Both fatalities were attributed to sepsis secondary to cholangitis. Bile cultures were positive in 80.1% of the samples with a sensitivity of 63.7% to prophylactic antibiotics used and 24.3% of isolates resistant to more than one antibiotic. The highest resistance was observed against gentamicin (54.1%) and ceftriaxone (53.7%) while resistance was lower for piperacillin/tazobactam (26.2%) and carbapenems (26.6%). Resistance rates were higher in transplant recipients compared to the general ERCP population.

Interpretation

Despite widespread prophylactic antibiotic use, post-ERCP infections and antimicrobial resistance remain prevalent in liver transplant recipients. These findings support more targeted prophylactic strategies using agents with lower resistance rates, particularly in patients undergoing repeat ERCPs. This single-arm analysis did not include a direct comparator group of patients without antibiotic prophylaxis. Future prospective studies and randomised controlled trials are essential to determine the optimal prophylactic regimen, dose, and duration in this high-risk population.

Funding

### Clinical and biochemical factors for bacteria in bile among patients with acute cholangitis [^99573ecf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Infection in the biliary system causes acute cholangitis, a clinical condition that may result in death if not treated appropriately. Biliary obstruction, followed by bacteria ascending into the bile duct, is an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute cholangitis. However, bacteria can remain in the bile despite antibiotic usage. In this study, the distribution of bacteria in the bile was determined, and multiple indicators of the first laboratory examination during hospitalization were analyzed to determine the risk factors for bacteria in bile for patients with cholangitis.

The following three pathogens are most often detected in bile specimens: E. coli (25–50%), Klebsiella (15–20%), and Enterococcus (10–20%). In this study, the distribution of bacteria in the bile was similar. Of the 807 patients with acute cholangitis, 533 (66.05%) had positive cultures, which was significantly lower than previous data. Therefore, bacteria were still present in the bile of patients with acute cholangitis after empirical antibiotic treatment. To control the infection before invasive operations, such as gallstone removal and ERCP, longer antibiotic therapy is needed. Otherwise, the bacteria in bile could enter the circulation system and cause systemic infections such as bacteremia or sepsis. This is supported by the fact that in this study, a higher proportion of patients with bacteria in bile had positive bacteria in blood culture (44.68%) than those with negative bile culture results (23.37%). There is a high consistency in resistance patterns between bile and blood-derived strains in patients with acute cholangitis, indicating the importance of efficient anti-infection before invasive operations. Moreover, the common empirical antibiotic agent, ceftriaxone, used in this study could not have a good anti-infection effect as gram-positive bacteria or resistant-positive bacteria were isolated from bile (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplemental digital content 1. Thus, the empirical agents might be modified based on the prevalent bacteria and drug susceptibility.

### Impact of inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy on mortality in patients with bacteraemic cholangitis: a retrospective cohort study [^37dc3f15]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute cholangitis is a common cause of bacteraemia resulting in severe sepsis or septic shock. The impact of the appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy on short-term mortality in bacteraemic cholangitis has not been well investigated.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with bacteraemic cholangitis at two large tertiary care centres in Tokyo, Japan between 2009 and 2015. We determined the factors associated with 30-day all-cause mortality from the date of drawing the first positive blood culture, using a multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

We identified 573 patients with bacteraemic cholangitis (median age, 77 years; male, 58.3%). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 6.6% (38/573). Inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy occurred in 133 (23.2%) patients. Factors associated with 30-day all-cause mortality included the Charlson co-morbidity index score > 3 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.12; 95% CI 1.18–14.38), jaundice (total bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL) (aOR 3.39; 95% CI 1.46–7.89), septic shock within 48 h of the first positive blood culture (aOR 3.34; 95% CI 1.42–7.89), biliary obstruction due to hepatobiliary malignancy (aOR 8.00; 95% CI 2.92–21.97), and inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy (aOR 2.78; 95% CI 1.27–6.11).

Conclusions

Inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy was an important, modifiable determinant of survival.

Treatment

Biliary drainage and antibiotic therapy for 3–5 days

The key elements of therapy in acute cholangitis are adequate antimicrobial treatment to avoid or manage the septic complications and biliary decompression to restore biliary drainage in case of obstruction. The clinical presentation varies, and initial risk stratification is important to guide further management.

In severe cholangitis, an early interventional approach is absolutely essential for survival.

The type and timing of biliary drainage should be based on the severity of the clinical presentation, and the availability and feasibility of drainage techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), and open surgical drainage.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) plays a central role in the management of biliary obstruction in patients with acute cholangitis and is the treatment of choice for biliary decompression in patients with moderate/severe acute cholangitis. Biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy with stone extraction continues to be a therapeutic choice and the reference standard in the treatment of symptomatic choledocholithiasis, especially for the solitary common bile duct stones up to 10–12 mm in diameter. It has been shown that biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy reduces hospital stay and duration of cholangitis but does not prevent recurrent cholangitis. Biliary sphincterotomy in acute cholangitis as a result of common bile duct stones can allow definitive therapy or placement of a large-bore biliary stent which can drain the thick infected bile more efficiently. Endoscopic drainage can be carried out either by external drainage using a nasobiliary tube or internal drainage using biliary stenting. Both the modalities of internal and external drainage have their own advantages and disadvantages. Both have similar technical and clinical success rates.
Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) should be reserved for patients in whom ERCP fails. PTBD can lead to significant complications, including biliary peritonitis, haemobilia, pneumothorax, hematoma, liver abscesses, and patient discomfort related to the catheter.
Open drainage may be indicated for patients who cannot undergo non-invasive drainage procedures, for anatomical and structural reasons, including patients after Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy or patients with a propensity for hemorrhage. In open drainage, the goal is to decompress the biliary system. Simple procedures such as T-tube placement without choledocholithotomy should be recommended as a temporary solution in unstable patients, because prolonged operations should be avoided in such ill patients. Whenever possible, definitive elimination of the biliary obstruction should be the goal of surgery.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholangitis (with videos) [^5af8766a]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholangitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholangitis is a bacterial infection that occurs in the setting of biliary obstruction, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of acute cholangitis involves a blockage in the bile ducts, often due to choledocholithiasis or strictures. This blockage allows for the retrograde migration of bacteria from the intestine into the biliary system, leading to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent immune response, which results in inflammation and infection of the bile ducts.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of acute cholangitis in the US is estimated at 3,000 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with acute cholangitis often present with the Charcot triad of fever, jaundice, and RUQ pain. In severe cases, patients may also exhibit signs of sepsis, such as hypotension and altered mental status.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can vary and is influenced by factors such as disease severity, the patient's overall health, and the timeliness and effectiveness of treatment. Certain laboratory values, such as a WBC count > 20,000 cells/mcL and a TBIL level > 10 mg/dL, have been identified as independent prognostic factors for adverse outcomes.

Conclusions

Despite extensive research in the field of antibiotic regimens in cirrhotic patients there are many unanswered questions, especially with regard to treatment duration. A policy of careful restriction of prophylactic antibiotics to the high-risk populations could reduce the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria.

### Adverse events associated with ERCP [^3d131808]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholangitis — post–endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) cholangitis and sepsis are known adverse events, occurring in up to 0.5% to 3% of cases. Significant risk factors include combined percutaneous–endoscopic procedures (P < .001), stenting of malignant strictures (P < .001), and failed biliary access or drainage (P < .01), and risk is highest with incomplete biliary drainage and prior liver transplantation. Current guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis before ERCP in patients who have had liver transplantation or when known or suspected biliary obstruction may be incompletely drained, discourage the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis when complete biliary drainage is anticipated or obstruction is not suspected, and state that antibiotics covering enteric gram-negative organisms and enterococci should be continued after the procedure if biliary drainage is incomplete. It is recommended to use noninvasive imaging (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) to format a "roadmap" before ERCP. Retained stone fragments after mechanical lithotripsy carry a cholangitis risk reported to be as high as 10%, and a biliary stent should be placed when complete stone extraction has not been accomplished. In a randomized trial of 90 patients with choledocholithiasis (12–20 mm in size), stone clearance was 98% vs 91% (P = 0.36), with a statistically higher rate of cholangitis in the EPLBD group (13.3%) compared with 0% (P = 0.03). Plastic stents are typically exchanged at scheduled intervals, eg, every 3 months. After ERCP with cholangioscopy, postprocedure bacteremia occurred in 5 of 57 procedures (8.8%) and clinical cholangitis in 4 patients (7%); bacteremia was more common with biopsy sampling (P = 0.01), and cholangitis was more common in patients with bacteremia (P = 0.03).

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^f7617063]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Having defined predictors for infection with 3GCRE or MRGN, the question arises, whether patient subgroups can be identified that can still be effectively treated with a carbapenem-sparing therapy even in a tertiary referential center with a high prevalence of resistant pathogens. According to our data, piperacillin/tazobactam would represent a highly effective option for patients presenting with community acquired cholangitis, without indewelling biliary drainage, and not on an ICU. Of note, if only resistance data would have been considered (frequency of 3GCRE in blood culture isolates 11.4%), the choice would have been a third generation cephalosporine. However, if analysed in a patient-based manner, the coverage by cefotaxime was poor (< 80%) for unselected patients as well as for all subgroups investigated. The better results for piperacillin/tazobactam in our cohort are explained by the coverage of ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, piperacillin-susceptible P.aeruginosa and anaerobes but not 3GCRE that were tested susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam in vitro. This is important because piperacillin/tazobactam was inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of blood stream infections caused by E.coli and K.pneumoniae resistant to third generation cephalosporines. Aside from these considerations, our results demonstrate that i) efficacy of antibiotic regimens should be assessed in a patient-based manner, and ii) combined analysis of microbiological and patient data is a valuable tool for deliberate and efficacious use of antibiotics in settings with a high prevalence of resistance.

Since this paper focuses on antibiotic therapy, we have not included a risk analysis for biliary candidiasis. For completeness, a high Charlson Index, bile sampling later than 48 h after admission, and an indwelling drainage were independent risk factors for a fungibilia in our cohort. An indwelling drainage and/or ICU treatment were risk factors for candidaemia.

An important limitation of this retrospective study is the lack of documented information regarding administration of antibiotic therapies prior to microbiological sampling. Owing to its potential effect on microbial spectra and prevelance of resistancies, prior antibiotic exposure should be considered when selecting an empiric regimen. Still, the predictors for a carbapenem-sparing therapy identified in our study can be applied to patients without recent antibiotic therapy and to those in which information on antibiotic exposure cannot be reliably obtained from the patient's history.

### Effective antibiotic regime for postoperative acute cholangitis in biliary atresia – an evolving scene [^85394b5a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prompt use of empirical antibiotics is vital in managing post-Kasai cholangitis. The authors published findings of their clinical trial in 1991 and established the use of cefoperazone, with a response rate of 88.9%. Here its clinical use since its introduction is reviewed and the trend in its efficacy is assessed.

Methods

A retrospective review was carried out between 1997 and 2003. All episodes of acute cholangitis in patients who underwent Kasai procedure were recorded. Cholangitis was defined as unexplained fever with derangement of liver enzymes. Cefoperazone was started empirically according to the established protocol, and the response to treatment was analyzed.

Results

There were 19 patients with a total of 49 episodes of cholangitis. Cefoperazone was used as the first-line empirical antibiotic in 40 of these episodes. Only 30 showed successful response (75%). For the 10 unresponsive episodes, meropenem was used as second-line antibiotic with complete response in all.

Conclusions

The efficacy of cefoperazone in the treatment of post-Kasai cholangitis has decreased over the last years. This suggests a need for a more effective first-line empirical antibiotic. From this review, meropenem seems to be a suitable candidate, and a future prospective clinical trial is warranted.

### Efficacy of oral vancomycin in recurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis following liver transplantation [^71ca2eae]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a liver disease that leads to progressive destruction and stricturing of the biliary tree. Unfortunately, apart from orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), there are no universally accepted therapies to treat this disease. Even following transplantation, recurrence of PSC is seen in approximately one quarter of patients and leads to high rates of graft failure. Oral vancomycin, through possible immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, has been shown in small-scale studies to be successful in improving liver function tests in patients with pretransplant PSC. We report the first case of an adult patient diagnosed with recurrent PSC 4years after OLT who was treated with oral vancomycin leading to complete normalisation of his liver biochemistry. This case adds to the growing literature of a potential therapeutic role for this antibiotic in PSC and highlights interesting questions regarding mechanisms of disease.

### Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent cholangitis in children with biliary atresia after kasai portoenterostomy: a meta-analysis [^e226553c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A connection between the bowel and bile ducts after the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE) procedure poses a risk of ascending cholangitis. There were only a few evidence-based consensuses on the benefits of prophylactic antibiotics. This study aims to assess the value of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of cholangitis following the Kasai HPE procedure.

Methods

Meta-analysis is performed using random-effects model from the search result of 5 online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCO MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EuropePMC) from inception to October 27, 2021. The keywords used were "antibiotic", "antimicrobial", "Kasai", "portoenterostomy", "biliary atresia", and "bile duct atresia". Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale is used to assess the risk of bias. The outcomes are incidence of cholangitis and native liver survival.

Results

Six studies consisting of 4 cohorts and 2 cross-sectional studies were extracted. A total of 714 patients reported different cholangitis incidence after prophylactic antibiotics administration post-Kasai HPE. The incidence of cholangitis following Kasai HPE was not statistically significant among participants. There is conflicting evidence on the efficacy of antibiotics in prolonging native liver survival.

Conclusions

The existing evidence does not support the administration of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing cholangitis after Kasai HPE among biliary atresia patients. Additionally, their roles in native liver survival are still inconclusive. The fact that there were heterogeneous method and antibiotic usage between existing studies must also be highlighted for better design in future studies.

### Use of microbiological and patient data for choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in acute cholangitis [^005fc982]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

As to the frequency of resistant enterobacterales, we found an 80% susceptibility of bile isolates to fluorochinolones and an almost 90% susceptibility of blood isolates to third generation cephalosporines. Thus, on first view, all antibiotic choices recommended by the Tokyo guideline seem to be appropriate for our patients. However, when coverage was analysed in a patient-wise manner, a different picture emerged. Although the antibiotics prescribed largely reflected the Tokyo guideline recommendation, empirical therapy covered bile isolates in only 51% of patients. In patients with bacteremic infections, coverage was 69% which is still far less than desired. Probably owing to both the high proportion of polymicrobial growth and the high prevalence of resistant bacteria in bile and blood cultures, the actual antibiotic coverage was unacceptably low.

Epidemiological data from Germany suggest a frequency of 3GCRE of about 15% in hospitals. In an analysis of cholangitis cases from two other German university hospitals, ESBL producing E.coli were detected at a rate of 31%. In our cohort, the highest numbers of cholangitis associated with either 3GCRE or MRGN were found amongst patients carrying MDR pathogens. In those known to be colonized, MRGN were detected in 41% of bile cultures. Individuals with a high burden of comorbidity were also more prone to infections with 3GCRE. Furthermore, the presence of biliary stenosis was associated with an increased risk for MRGN, and we observed a linear trend between the proportion of patients infected with 3GCRE and MRGN and the number of prior biliary tract interventions. Thus, it seems reasonable to cover patients with carrier status, a high burden of comorbitiy or the presence of biliary stenosis and repeated biliary interventions (in our study > 3 interventions) with a carbapenem for empiric therapy. In addition to these risk factors, we found male sex to be an independent risk factor for isolation of 3GCRE or MRGN. In fact, a previous study on acute cholangitis from two German university centers also reported an association of male sex with infections caused by ESBL E.coli. At the time being, the causal relationship for this association is largely unclear. Therefore, we would presently not suggest to cover all male cholangitis patients with a carbapenem.

Cholangitis-specific considerations — "Endoscopic treatment of dominant strictures in PSC may be considered specifically for cholangitis". "Cholangitis can be the initial presentation of PSC and occurs frequently during the course of disease", and "Recurrent cholangitis can contribute to progression of the disease". Because "Dominant strictures are associated with biliary bacterial colonization and antibiotic therapy alone may not be sufficient to eradicate the bacteria", endoscopic treatment "may allow more effective treatment of cholangitis", though "The increased risk of cholangitis as a complication of ERCP, however, does reduce the potential benefit of endoscopic therapy for this indication".

### Role of antibiotic prophylaxis in liver transplant patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1005c654]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a widely utilised therapeutic and diagnostic procedure for the management of biliary and pancreatic disorders. Despite its significant clinical benefits, ERCP is associated with a range of potential complications, including post-ERCP infections, which can lead to considerable morbidity and, in severe cases, mortality. Infections after ERCP can arise via multiple modalities such as the use of improperly disinfected endoscopes and accessories, the combination of percutaneous and endoscopic procedures, and incomplete or failed biliary drainage.

Liver transplantation, a life-saving procedure for patients with chronic liver disease and acute liver failure, highlights the clinical context in which ERCP often becomes necessary. In 2023 alone, more than 10,000 liver transplants were performed in the United States. Despite advances in surgical techniques and medical therapy, approximately 5%–25% of liver transplant recipients develop biliary complications, such as biliary strictures, bile leaks, choledocholithiasis, biliary casts, and biliomas. These conditions frequently necessitate ERCP as both a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. However, the immunosuppressive regimens required to maintain graft survival in these patients increase their susceptibility to infections, including cholangitis and sepsis, following ERCP. Consequently, it is essential to focus on the prevention of post-ERCP infections in this vulnerable population.

Current guidelines from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ERCP in liver transplant patients. Supporting this recommendation, Kuhl et al.identified delayed administration of prophylactic antibiotics as a significant risk factor for post-ERCP infections. The decision to use prophylactic antibiotics requires a careful balance between benefits and potential drawbacks. On the one hand, prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of bacteraemia, cholangitis, and sepsis, thereby improving procedural outcomes and shortening hospital stays. On the other hand, indiscriminate antibiotic use carries risks such as antimicrobial resistance, adverse drug reactions, and disruption of the gut microbiome. These concerns are compounded by the growing global emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship, necessitating a judicious approach to antibiotic use even in high-risk populations.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) interpretation of strength — implications are: For patients, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", whereas a conditional recommendation means "Most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, strong means "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", whereas conditional means "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". For policymakers, strong means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Compliance with this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional means "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

### Aetiology, diagnosis and management for ischaemic cholecystitis: current perspectives [^8b156b81]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best management practices

Antibiotic treatment

According to the most recent iteration of the Tokyo Guidelines, antibiotic use for patients with acute cholecystitis is important for three primary reasons: to mitigate systemic septic response and local inflammation, to prevent surgical site infections and to prevent intrahepatic abscess formation. The most common Gram-negative bacteria found in acute biliary tract infections include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas, whereas the most common Gram-positive organisms are Enterococcus and Streptococcus. While local antimicrobial susceptibility data play a role in antibiotic choice, recommendations from the most recent version of the Tokyo Guidelines incorporate a grade system that accounts for infection severity and whether infection is hospital versus community acquired (table 3). Grades I, II and III acute cholecystitis are defined as mild, moderate and severe cholecystitis, respectively. Typical prophylactic antibiotic regimens for patients with acute cholecystitis (calculous, acalculous or ischaemic) or acute cholangitis are either piperacillin or cephalosporin based and are represented in table 3. Additional antimicrobial agents including carbapenems, monobactams, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin may be necessary depending on the clinical setting, patient allergies, local antimicrobial resistance patterns and patient colonisation. Recommendations regarding duration of antibiotic therapy are also based on grade severity. If bacteraemia with Gram-positive cocci is encountered during the clinical course, antibiotic treatment duration of minimum of 14 days is recommended. This extended course differs from that of Gram-negative bacteria, as Gram-positive microorganisms (eg, Enterococcus and Streptococcus) are associated with infective endocarditis. The typical patient scenario for a diagnosis of ischaemic cholecystitis is consistent with grade III severity and hence, we advocate for following this broad regimen.

Table 3
Antibiotic grade system

Non-surgical interventions

After initiating resuscitation and antibiotic administration, source control of the ischaemic gallbladder tissue is paramount. For this cohort, source control most commonly comes in the form of temporary gallbladder drainage. Gallbladder drainage procedures represent a quick and minimally invasive alternative to cholecystectomy for critically ill patients. These approaches have been shown to be an effective method of decompressing the gallbladder and thereby reducing inflammation and minimising bacterial overgrowth. Multiple studies have demonstrated the outcome benefits of drainage procedures versus immediate cholecystectomy for critically ill patients, including decreased morbidity, fewer ICU admissions, decreased hospital length of stay and lower patient costs. There are currently two primary drainage procedures employed for patients diagnosed with ischaemic cholecystitis and deemed to be poor surgical candidates: percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGD) and endoscopic drainage, which can be done via a transpapillary or transmural approach.

### Role of antibiotic prophylaxis in liver transplant patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1dd0720f]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Similarly, differences in infection control practices across centres likely contributed to variability in infection rates, with some institutions employing stricter aseptic techniques or adjuncts like bile duct stenting, while others faced higher infection rates due to prevalent antibiotic-resistant organisms despite prophylaxis. Moreover, as reinforced by our subgroup analyses, regional differences in antimicrobial resistance patterns may have influenced both infection rates and the effectiveness of the chosen prophylactic agents. Studies conducted in areas with higher baseline rates of MDROs, likely faced different microbiological profiles, which may have impacted the appropriateness of empiric antibiotic use. The inclusion of studies from over a decade-long span further compounds this variability, as resistance trends, transplant protocols, and antibiotic stewardship practices have evolved significantly over time. Collectively, these factors introduce important context for interpreting the pooled results and underscore the need for region-specific and temporally updated prophylaxis protocols. Importantly, our finding of lower cholangitis rates per procedure (3.5%) compared to per patient (8.6%) suggests that while the individual risk per ERCP remains low, repeat procedures may subsequently raise cumulative infection risk.

Due to incomplete reporting across studies, a meta-analysis for LOS, unplanned hospitalisations, and recurrent cholangitis could not be conducted. However, several studies provided relevant individual findings. Holmes et al. reported 15 admissions for fever in 11 patients (6.3%) within one-week post-ERCP. Kabar et al. and Kohli et al. noted three and four admissions, respectively, with two of Kohli's cases linked to bloodstream infections — only one of which had received antibiotic prophylaxis. Poley et al. described 21 admissions or prolonged hospitalisations due to procedural complications. Ji et al. found a slightly higher 30-day readmission rate in patients who received peri-procedural antibiotics (5.5%) compared to those who did not (4.5%).

Timely treatment of acute cholecystitis and cholangitis is necessary to prevent unwanted outcomes. Quiz Ref IDThe most important aspect of treatment is source control, but antimicrobial treatment is a necessary and important adjunct. The primary goal of antimicrobial therapy is to limit the systemic septic response and local inflammation and prevent surgical site infection and intrahepatic abscess formation. 1 Increasing antimicrobial resistance, particularly owing to extended-spectrum β-lactamase –producing Enterobacteriaceae, complicates selection of anti-infective agents, making knowledge of local epidemiological data important. Provision of antimicrobial therapy calls for a balance between ensuring adequate treatment of the pathogen and minimizing risk of collateral damage due to excessive antimicrobial administration.

Stratifying antimicrobial use based on severity of infection and whether it is a community-acquired or health care–associated infection, deescalating therapy once definitive culture results are available, and limiting duration of therapy when appropriate promote optimal antimicrobial use.

### Spectrum of pathogens in acute cholangitis in patients with and without biliary endoprosthesis [^693114d2]. The Journal of Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Knowledge of bacterial spectrum for acute cholangitis is essential for adequate empiric antibiotic treatment. Main focus of the study was to analyse the spectrum of pathogens in acute cholangitis with and without biliary endoprosthesis.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 1024 patients with acute cholangitis treated at a German tertiary center.

Results

447 cholangitis episodes with positive bile and/or blood cultures obtained from 388 patients were studied. In total, 1088 pathogen were isolated. The predominant strains were Enterococcus species (25%), followed by Escherichia coli (18%) and Klebsiella species (14%). Bacteraemia was mainly caused by E. coli (91/282; 32%) and Enterococcus species (550/282; 18%). The incidences of Enterococcus species [121(74%) vs. 89(60%); p = 0.011] and non-fermenters [41(25%) vs. 16(11%); p = 0.001] were significantly higher in cholangitis episodes with biliary endoprosthesis compared to cholangitis episodes without biliary endoprosthesis. In particular, more Pseudomonas aeruginosa [27(16%) vs. 12(8%); p = 0.027] and Enterococcus faecium [59(36%) vs. 34(23%); p = 0.013] were isolated from patients with a biliary endoprosthesis.

Conclusions

Unlike cholangitis without stent, the presence of biliary endoprosthesis in patients with cholangitis can serve as a surrogate indicator of nosocomial pathogens and therefore should be considered, when selecting empiric antimicrobial therapy.

Quality assessment

To assess the quality of included studies, we utilised the ROBINS-I tool, as shown in Fig. 2 a and b. Of the included studies, seven were judged to have an overall low risk of bias, while another six were assessed to have a critical risk of bias. These critically biased studies were abstract-only publications, which limited our ability to evaluate essential variables such as confounding factors and outcome measurement methods due to the lack of full-text data. Additionally, the inherent nature of abstract publications led to incomplete reporting of data and outcomes, resulting in their classification as having a critical risk of bias in this area. Two studies were found to have a serious risk of bias, primarily due to missing data and deviations from the intended intervention, while thirteen presented a moderate risk mainly due to lack of control for confounding factors as well as missing data and inappropriate outcome measurement.

Antibiotic prophylaxis regimens

All included studies, except Ferstl et al. (2022), reported the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ERCP. Ciprofloxacin was the most administered agent across various settings. Piperacillin, often in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, was also frequently used. Cotton et al. (2008)described shifts in antibiotic regimens over time, transitioning from ampicillin, gentamicin, and cephalosporins to ciprofloxacin in later phases (Table 2). Ferstl et al. (2022), in contrast, did not administer prophylactic antibiotics but focused on therapeutic strategies post-infection, comparing the efficacy of short- versus long-course regimens for managing post-ERCP cholangitis.

### Pharmacological interventions for primary biliary cholangitis: an attempted network meta-analysis [^1044b27c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Primary biliary cholangitis (previously primary biliary cirrhosis) is a chronic liver disease caused by the destruction of small intra-hepatic bile ducts resulting in stasis of bile (cholestasis), liver fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment of primary biliary cholangitis remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological interventions according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers to February 2017 to identify randomised clinical trials on pharmacological interventions for primary biliary cholangitis.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with primary biliary cholangitis. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with each other or with placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 74 trials including 5902 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. A total of 46 trials (4274 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. All the trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, all the evidence was low or very low quality. The proportion of participants with symptoms varied from 19.9% to 100% in the trials that reported this information. The proportion of participants who were antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) positive ranged from 80.8% to 100% in the trials that reported this information. It appeared that most trials included participants who had not received previous treatments or included participants regardless of the previous treatments received. The follow-up in the trials ranged from 1 to 96 months. The proportion of people with mortality (maximal follow-up) was higher in the methotrexate group versus the no intervention group (OR 8.83, 95% CI 1.01 to 76.96; 60 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). The proportion of people with mortality (maximal follow-up) was lower in the azathioprine group versus the no intervention group (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 224 participants; 2 trials; I² = 0%; low quality evidence). However, it has to be noted that a large proportion of participants (25%) was excluded from the trial that contributed most participants to this analysis and the results were not reliable. There was no evidence of a difference in any of the remaining comparisons. The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the D-penicillamine versus no intervention group (OR 28.77, 95% CI 1.57 to 526.67; 52 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). The proportion of people with serious adverse events was higher in the obeticholic acid plus ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) group versus the UDCA group (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.02 to 12.51; 216 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in any of the remaining comparisons for serious adverse events (proportion) or serious adverse events (number of events). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life at any time point.

Funding

nine trials had no special funding or were funded by hospital or charities; 31 trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; and 34 trials provided no information on source of funding.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on very low quality evidence, there is currently no evidence that any intervention is beneficial for primary biliary cholangitis. However, the follow-up periods in the trials were short and there is significant uncertainty in this issue. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary. Future randomised clinical trials ought to be adequately powered; performed in people who are generally seen in the clinic rather than in highly selected participants; employ blinding; avoid post-randomisation dropouts or planned cross-overs; should have sufficient follow-up period (e.g. five or 10 years or more); and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, health-related quality of life, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver transplantation. Alternatively, very large groups of participants should be randomised to facilitate shorter trial duration.
