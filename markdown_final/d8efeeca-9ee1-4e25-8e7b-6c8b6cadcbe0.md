## Question

Treating narcolepsy type one

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating narcolepsy type 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic foundation and treatment goals to anchor decisions. Then, I should prioritize high-credibility guideline recommendations. Next, I will examine first-line options for excessive daytime sleepiness in adults, followed by targeted therapy for cataplexy. After that, I need to address disturbed nighttime sleep and associated REM phenomena, incorporate pediatric-specific considerations, and integrate cardiovascular safety and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical treatment algorithm and note emerging therapies, while double-checking contraindications and ensuring consistency across sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and goals so I don't build on shaky ground. Narcolepsy type 1 is defined by excessive daytime sleepiness with cataplexy and REM intrusion phenomena, underpinned by orexin (hypocretin) deficiency, which shapes both symptom targets and the rationale for orexin-directed therapies under investigation [^115KRL8E] [^1155iYhv]. Treatment aims should explicitly include improving wakefulness, controlling cataplexy, stabilizing nocturnal sleep, managing hallucinations and sleep paralysis, and minimizing cardiometabolic risk while optimizing quality of life with multidisciplinary care, and I should verify each chosen intervention against these aims [^111iVyFh] [^115bfftB].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline sources to ensure my recommendations are evidence-based. The 2021 AASM clinical practice guideline and the 2021 EAN guideline converge on first-line pharmacotherapies for EDS and cataplexy and provide graded recommendations for adults and children, so I will align to those frameworks and only deviate when explicitly justified by FDA labeling or pivotal trials, keeping internal consistency in mind [^111gTMN9] [^114RKCk4] [^111iVyFh].

> For adult excessive daytime sleepiness, I need to check that I'm prioritizing agents with strong recommendations and regulatory support. Modafinil, pitolisant, sodium oxybate, and solriamfetol are all first-line in EAN and recommended in AASM, with FDA labeling supporting modafinil and solriamfetol for EDS and pitolisant for EDS, which reassures me that these choices are credible starting points; armodafinil and traditional stimulants can be considered when first-line agents are ineffective or intolerable, but I should be cautious about cardiovascular risks with stimulants [^114uXegz] [^111gTMN9] [^111iVyFh] [^1145kyjY] [^113W2saS] [^1151jHwV].

> Now, for adult cataplexy, hold on, I should confirm which agents carry the strongest evidence and where they provide cross-domain benefits. Sodium oxybate has robust efficacy for moderate-to-severe cataplexy and also improves EDS and disturbed night sleep; venlafaxine (SNRI) and low-dose clomipramine (TCA) are also strongly recommended for cataplexy, and pitolisant has a weaker but meaningful recommendation, with efficacy supported by randomized trials; importantly, sodium oxybate's dose-response indicates little effect below 6 g/night, which I should keep in mind when titrating [^111iVyFh] [^114RKCk4] [^114pUSUG] [^1119YcVR] [^111SFHvY].

> Wait, let me verify exclusions and resolve a potential inconsistency before I proceed. Stimulants and wake-promoting agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, solriamfetol, methylphenidate, and amphetamines are not recommended for treating cataplexy, which is consistent across EAN sources; I initially noted a statement suggesting AASM recommends dextroamphetamine for cataplexy, but that doesn't square with the balance of evidence and guidance, so I need to correct that and affirm that AASM recommends pitolisant and sodium oxybate for cataplexy, whereas dextroamphetamine is considered for EDS rather than cataplexy, aligning the recommendations coherently across documents [^114oYios] [^114Mw3tY] [^116UDVCS] [^1158LMfr] [^1121QydB].

> I will now examine disturbed nocturnal sleep and REM-related symptoms, making sure not to conflate domains. Sodium oxybate is recommended for moderate-to-severe disturbed nighttime sleep and carries cross-domain benefits, while pitolisant and antidepressants can be considered for sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis; for persistent insomnia or fragmented sleep not due to narcolepsy alone, I should reassess sleep hygiene and comorbid sleep disorders, and only consider second-line baclofen for disturbed sleep when appropriate, while treating comorbid RBD according to general principles for non-narcoleptic patients [^116QFiDo] [^116QamY3] [^115tHjBp] [^111tomJ3] [^115pHDoN].

> Turning to pediatric NT1, let me ensure age-appropriate approvals and evidence are respected. Sodium oxybate is supported and recommended for EDS, cataplexy, and disturbed sleep in children over 6, and scheduled daytime naps remain a cornerstone; modafinil and methylphenidate can be considered with caution for persistent EDS when benefits outweigh risks, while routine antidepressant use for cataplexy in young children has weaker support; interestingly, in children with NT1 and RBD or REM without atonia, sodium oxybate has been associated with improvements in REM atonia and nocturnal behaviors, though evidence is lower quality, so I should discuss this nuance with families [^117PzUeX] [^113GVS2r] [^117LDtUU] [^111iVyFh] [^111i2X9P] [^111k2c1P] [^1173nC2u].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular and safety considerations and not gloss over risk mitigation. People with narcolepsy have elevated rates of hypertension, obesity, and other cardiometabolic comorbidities, and stimulants may increase arrhythmia risk; pitolisant should be used carefully with respect to QT-prolonging drugs; sodium oxybate's sodium load warrants attention to blood pressure and cardiometabolic risk, and while low-sodium formulations and once-nightly extended-release products exist, I should match formulation to clinical priorities, minimizing sleep disruption from split dosing when feasible; a pre-treatment cardiovascular assessment and cardiology input for those with suspected heart disease are prudent [^116NCzjb] [^1174yVRn] [^114FnHot] [^117AtLkW] [^113Vndc1] [^111erfL7].

> I need to ensure non-pharmacologic strategies are integrated rather than treated as afterthoughts. Scheduled daytime naps and rigorous sleep hygiene can complement pharmacotherapy and may indirectly reduce cardiovascular risk; treating coexisting sleep-disordered breathing with positive airway pressure when indicated, and coordinating multidisciplinary care for neuropsychiatric and metabolic comorbidities, can meaningfully improve outcomes; routine monitoring with ESS for sleepiness, cataplexy diaries, and safety labs or vitals every few months keeps therapy aligned with goals [^111iVyFh] [^112LxaqE] [^112Su7k1] [^115KRL8E] [^115bfftB].

> I will now examine emerging therapies but keep clinical applicability in perspective. Orexin receptor agonism has shown dramatic symptomatic benefits in NT1, as seen with TAK-994, yet hepatotoxicity halted development, indicating mechanism validation but an ongoing need for safer agents; for highly refractory cataplexy, there are case reports of anticholinergics like tropatepine showing benefit, though evidence is very limited and would be considered only after established therapies fail [^1155iYhv] [^116hS7nK].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it balances efficacy with safety. In adults with EDS-predominant NT1, I would start with modafinil, pitolisant, sodium oxybate, or solriamfetol, tailoring to comorbidities and patient preferences; in cataplexy-predominant or mixed presentations, sodium oxybate is often first, with pitolisant as an alternative or add-on, and SNRIs like venlafaxine or low-dose clomipramine added if cataplexy persists; if EDS remains problematic, consider switching within or adding another first-line wake-promoting agent such as solriamfetol, guided by FDA labeling and tolerability; for pediatric NT1, pair scheduled naps with sodium oxybate first, considering modafinil if EDS persists and carefully avoiding routine antidepressants for cataplexy; where appropriate, FDA labels for low-sodium oxybate and pitolisant support domain-specific choices, and I should reassess systematically every 3 months with symptom scales and safety checks [^111iVyFh] [^114W4qMo] [^1151jHwV] [^113ogeof] [^1179CUxw] [^113W2saS].

> Hold on, I should verify there are no inappropriate therapies slipping into practice. Immunomodulatory approaches such as corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, IVIG, and plasmapheresis are not recommended for narcolepsy across ages, so I should avoid these outside of a research setting and clearly counsel patients about the lack of evidence and potential risks [^114DZNgy] [^111vMR84].

Treating narcolepsy type 1 requires a **multimodal approach** that combines pharmacologic and behavioral strategies to address excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, and disturbed nocturnal sleep. **Sodium oxybate** is central to treating cataplexy and EDS, while modafinil, solriamfetol, and pitolisant are first-line for EDS, and antidepressants serve as alternatives for cataplexy when oxybate is unsuitable [^111gTMN9] [^114dmZjY] [^114RKCk4]. Treatment is individualized based on symptom severity, comorbidities, and patient preference, with regular monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects.

---

## Pharmacological management

### Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)

For EDS in NT1, **first-line pharmacologic options** include:

- **Modafinil**: A wake-promoting agent that improves wakefulness and reduces EDS [^111gTMN9] [^1145kyjY].

- **Solriamfetol**: A dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor effective for EDS [^111gTMN9] [^111vi3qT].

- **Pitolisant**: A histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that improves wakefulness and reduces EDS [^111gTMN9] [^111axAMB].

- **Sodium oxybate**: Effective for EDS and cataplexy, improving nocturnal sleep quality [^111gTMN9] [^111SFHvY].

---

### Cataplexy

In NT1, **cataplexy** is managed with:

- **Sodium oxybate**: First-line therapy for cataplexy, significantly reducing attack frequency [^114dmZjY] [^111SFHvY].

- **Pitolisant**: Effective for cataplexy, reducing attack frequency [^114Tv3gi] [^1119YcVR].

- **Antidepressants**: SSRIs, SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine), and TCAs (e.g. clomipramine) are alternatives when sodium oxybate is unsuitable [^114RKCk4] [^116iJXpS].

---

### Disturbed nocturnal sleep

For disturbed nocturnal sleep, **Sodium oxybate** improves nocturnal sleep quality and reduces fragmentation [^116QFiDo], while **Baclofen** is a second-line option [^111tomJ3].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Non-pharmacological interventions are essential adjuncts to pharmacotherapy and include **scheduled short naps** to reduce daytime sleepiness and improve alertness, as well as **sleep hygiene** with consistent sleep schedules, avoidance of caffeine and alcohol, and a conducive sleep environment. Additionally, **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)** addresses sleep-related anxiety and improves adherence, while lifestyle modifications — such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and weight management — support symptom control.

---

## Emerging therapies

Recent advances include **Orexin receptor agonists** that target hypocretin deficiency and show promising early results [^1155iYhv], and **Extended-release sodium oxybate**, offering once-nightly dosing that improves adherence and sleep quality.

---

## Treatment considerations and monitoring

Treatment must be **individualized**, considering:

- **Symptom severity**: Tailor therapy to EDS, cataplexy, and nocturnal sleep disturbance.

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular, psychiatric, and metabolic conditions influence choice and monitoring [^114FnHot].

- **Patient preferences**: Involve patients in decisions to improve adherence.

Regular monitoring includes:

- **Efficacy**: Assess EDS, cataplexy frequency, and sleep quality.

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor cardiovascular, psychiatric, and metabolic side effects.

- **Adherence**: Address barriers and adjust therapy as needed.

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **Sodium oxybate** is effective for EDS and cataplexy [^117LDtUU], and **Modafinil** may be considered for EDS with safety monitoring [^111k2c1P].

---

### Pregnant and breastfeeding women

For pregnant and breastfeeding women, **data are limited**; use caution and carefully weigh risks and benefits.

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **cautious use** is advised with monitoring for cardiovascular and cognitive side effects.

---

## Long-term outcomes and quality of life

Effective treatment improves **quality of life** by reducing EDS and cataplexy and enhancing daily functioning. It also improves cognitive function (attention and memory), psychological well-being (lower depression and anxiety), and social functioning (relationships and work performance).

---

## Current limitations and challenges

Key challenges include **incomplete symptom control**, with residual EDS and cataplexy persisting in some patients. Adverse effects — particularly cardiovascular and psychiatric risks — require monitoring, and adherence is often hindered by complex regimens and side effects. Limited pediatric data highlight the need for more research.

---

Treating narcolepsy type 1 requires a **multimodal approach** combining pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies. Sodium oxybate is central to treating cataplexy and EDS, while modafinil, solriamfetol, and pitolisant are first-line for EDS, and antidepressants serve as alternatives for cataplexy. Individualized treatment and regular monitoring are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Child neurology: A case series of heterogeneous neuropsychiatric symptoms and outcome in very early-onset narcolepsy type 1 [^115KRL8E]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Narcolepsy type 1 is a central disorder of hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (i.e. sudden loss of muscle tone during wakefulness triggered by emotions), and REM sleep-related manifestations. This condition can present with a peculiar phenotype when arising at a pediatric age. Several features of childhood-onset narcolepsy type 1 are also common in neuropsychiatric conditions; discrete neuropsychiatric comorbidity has also been demonstrated.

Here, we report on three children with very early narcolepsy type 1. All three patients had psychiatric features at the time of symptom onset coupled with peculiar motor disturbances. The course of narcolepsy symptoms also paralleled neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting a possible intrinsic link between sleep and psychological features.

Multidisciplinary management is mandatory for pediatric narcolepsy type 1 since prompt disease management addressing neuropsychiatric symptoms could lead to better clinical outcomes and quality of life.

### Treating excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy [^112LxaqE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a hallmark symptom of narcolepsy. The second major symptom, cataplexy, is present only in a subgroup of patients with narcolepsy. Fortunately, existing pharmacologic interventions are effective in reducing EDS for many patients, but elimination of EDS for most patients has not been achieved. Some interventions also show efficacy in cataplexy. Nonpharmacologic strategies should also be discussed with patients to provide optimal narcolepsy management. Clinicians must monitor EDS during ongoing treatment so that residual symptoms can be addressed with adjustments to the regimen. Research suggests a causative role for hypocretin deficiency in narcolepsy, and treatments ameliorating this deficiency are needed.

### Oral orexin receptor 2 agonist in narcolepsy type 1 [^1155iYhv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Narcolepsy type 1 is caused by a severe loss or lack of brain orexin neuropeptides.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of TAK-994, an oral orexin receptor 2-selective agonist, in patients with narcolepsy type 1. Patients with confirmed narcolepsy type 1 according to clinical criteria were randomly assigned to receive twice-daily oral TAK-994 (30 mg, 90 mg, or 180 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline to week 8 in average sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (range, 0 to 40 minutes; normal ability to stay awake, ≥ 20 minutes). Secondary endpoints included the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score (range, 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater daytime sleepiness; normal, < 10) and the weekly cataplexy rate.

- **Results**: Of the 73 patients, 17 received TAK-994 at a dose of 30 mg twice daily, 20 received 90 mg twice daily, 19 received 180 mg twice daily, and 17 received placebo. The phase 2 trial and an extension trial were terminated early due to hepatic adverse events. Primary endpoint data were available for 41 patients (56%); the main reason for missing data was early trial termination. Least-squares mean changes to week 8 in average sleep latency on the MWT were 23.9 minutes in the 30-mg group, 27.4 minutes in the 90-mg group, 32.6 minutes in the 180-mg group, and -2.5 minutes in the placebo group (difference vs. placebo, 26.4 minutes in the 30-mg group, 29.9 minutes in the 90-mg group, and 35.0 minutes in the 180-mg group).

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^1174yVRn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

In addition to dietary sodium, people with narcolepsy may need to consider the sodium content of their medication. While many medications commonly prescribed for people with narcolepsy do not significantly contribute to daily sodium intake, some sodium oxybate formulations contain large amounts of sodium.

- **Sodium content in oxybate medications**: No studies have yet compared oxybate medications containing high versus low amounts of sodium in terms of cardiovascular/cardiometabolic risks. A literature review concluded that treatment with sodium oxybate does not confer additional cardiovascular risk in patients with narcolepsy on the basis of its sodium content and the clinical evidence through June 2020. However, the authors acknowledged that the short duration of some pivotal studies may be insufficient to assess cardiovascular risk, and the effects of sodium oxybate treatment on cardiovascular outcomes have not been examined prospectively, nor have they been evaluated in patients predisposed to higher cardiovascular risk.

In contrast to the conclusions of the earlier review, a later retrospective analysis of claims data from patients who are normotensive with narcolepsy reported those who initiated treatment with sodium oxybate had an increased risk (odds ratio, 1.81 [95% CI, 0.73–4.46]) of new‐onset hypertension compared with patients who did not start sodium oxybate treatment (1:2 propensity score matched on clinical and demographic characteristics). Conversely, several studies have reported no effects of low‐sodium oxybate on BP.

### Safety and efficacy of pitolisant on cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1119YcVR]. The Lancet Neurology (2017). High credibility.

Histaminergic neurons are crucial for maintaining wakefulness; however, their role in cataplexy is unknown. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant, a histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist, for the treatment of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.

- **Methods**:
	- For this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 16 sleep centers in nine countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine). Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy according to version two of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders criteria, experienced at least three cataplexies per week, and had excessive daytime sleepiness (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score ≥ 12). We used a computer-generated sequence via an interactive web response system to randomly assign patients to receive either pitolisant or placebo once per day (1:1 ratio). Randomization was done in blocks of four. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. Treatment lasted for 7 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing decided by investigators according to efficacy and tolerance (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg oral pitolisant), followed by 4 weeks of stable dosing (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg). The primary endpoint was the change in the average number of cataplexy attacks per week, as recorded in patient diaries (weekly cataplexy rate [WCR]), between the 2 weeks of baseline and the 4 weeks of the stable dosing period. Analysis was by intention to treat.

### Successful treatment of drug-resistant cataplexy with the anticholinergic drug tropatepine [^116hS7nK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Narcolepsy type 1 is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, as well as hypocretin deficiency. Cataplexy, the loss of voluntary postural muscle tone often in response to emotional stimuli, is one of the most disabling features and is associated with significant social impairment and risk of injury. Cataplexy is usually alleviated by antidepressants, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. In this case report, we describe three patients with severe, drug-resistant cataplexy who experienced a dramatic improvement when treated with tropatepine, an anticholinergic muscarinic antagonist commonly used to prevent neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, after the usual treatments had failed. The single side effect was mild mouth dryness. In addition to providing a new therapeutic option for resistant cataplexy, this benefit supports a role of cholinergic muscarinic transmission in rapid eye movement sleep atonia.

### Treatment of paediatric narcolepsy with sodium oxybate: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-withdrawal multicentre study and open-label investigation [^113GVS2r]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Low credibility.

Narcolepsy is a lifelong neurological disorder with onset commonly in childhood or adolescence. No drugs are indicated for cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in paediatric patients with narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is approved for use in adult patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, or both, in narcolepsy. This study aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of sodium oxybate oral solution treatment in children and adolescents who have narcolepsy with cataplexy.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised-withdrawal, multisite study and open-label investigation conducted at 30 sites in five countries (USA, Finland, France, Italy, and the Netherlands). Eligible participants were aged 7–16 years at screening, had narcolepsy with cataplexy, and were either being treated with sodium oxybate or were sodium oxybate-naive at entry. Sodium oxybate-naive participants were titrated to an optimal dose. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a dynamic randomisation algorithm to receive placebo or to remain on sodium oxybate for 2 weeks; they then entered an open-label sodium oxybate treatment period for a total study duration of up to 1 year. Random assignment to placebo was discontinued if early efficacy was shown in the preplanned interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, which was the change in the weekly number of cataplexy attacks. Participants entering the study after the interim analysis were then assigned to receive open-label sodium oxybate for 2 weeks. The primary analysis of efficacy and safety included data from this period.

### Wakix [^1151jHwV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with narcolepsy**:

The efficacy of Wakix for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 1; NCT01067222 and Study 2; NCT01638403). Patients aged 18 years or older who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) criteria for narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) and who had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of 14 or higher were eligible to enroll in the studies. EDS was assessed using the ESS, an 8-item questionnaire in which patients rate their perceived likelihood of falling asleep during usual daily life activities. Each of the 8 items on the ESS is rated from 0 (would never doze) to 3 (high chance of dozing); the maximum score is 24. Both Study 1 and Study 2 included an 8-week treatment period, consisting of a 3-week dose titration phase followed by a 5-week stable dose phase. These studies compared Wakix to both a placebo and an active control.

In Study 1, 95 patients were randomized to receive Wakix, placebo, or active control. The initial dose of Wakix was 8.9 mg once daily and could be increased at weekly intervals to 17.8 mg or 35.6 mg, based on clinical response and tolerability. No dose adjustments were permitted during the 5-week stable dose phase. Sixty-one percent of patients reached a stable dose of 35.6 mg. The median age in the study was 37 years. More than 90% of patients in the Wakix and placebo groups were Caucasian, and 54% were male. Approximately 80% of the population…

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^1179CUxw]. Annals of Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder resulting from the dysregulation of neurophysiologic pathways that control the stability of sleep and wake states. Excessive sleepiness (ES) and impaired daytime wakefulness are essential and somewhat independent symptoms of narcolepsy. These symptoms contribute to reductions in function, productivity, quality of life, and an increased risk for motor vehicle accidents.

Two types of narcolepsy are recognized: type 1 and type 2, formerly known as narcolepsy with and without cataplexy, respectively. Narcolepsy type 1 is characterized by the presence of cataplexy and/or hypocretin deficiency, as measured by reduced hypocretin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Type 2 is characterized by the absence of cataplexy but the presence of relevant findings on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (i.e. ≥ 2 sleep onset rapid eye movement periods and sleep latency ≤ 8 minutes) indicative of narcolepsy.

### Very late onset narcolepsy type 1: A case report and review of the literature [^113tpLPe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Narcolepsy type 1 is a clinical syndrome defined by episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness, episodes of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Symptoms typically manifest in the second or third decade, with another small peak in the fourth decade. In this report, we describe the case of a 64-year-old female presenting with new-onset visual hallucinations as the main complaint. Eventually, the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 was confirmed by determination of orexin levels (hypocretin-1) in cerebrospinal fluid. This case illustrates that the age of onset of narcolepsy type 1 can be as late as the sixth decade in life and that narcolepsy type 1 should be considered a possible, though rare, diagnosis in older adults presenting with new-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms like visual hallucinations.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^111vGpvb]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses were conducted with the planned enrollment of approximately 240 patients, accounting for withdrawals, with around 60 patients per treatment group. This sample size was based on an estimate of 54 patients per group to ensure at least 80% power to detect a difference of 6 minutes in mean sleep latency time as determined by the MWT (mean of the first 4 trials), and a difference of 4 points in the ESS from baseline to week 12 between each solriamfetol treatment dose group and placebo. These estimates were derived from effects observed at the 150 mg and 300 mg doses in two phase 2 studies. The calculations assumed standard deviations (SDs) of 10 minutes for MWT changes and 6 points for ESS changes, with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using a t-test.

Efficacy analyses were based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had baseline and at least one postbaseline evaluation by MWT or ESS. Both MWT and ESS endpoints were analyzed using a mixed-effect repeated measures model, which included fixed effects for treatment (dose group), visit (as a discrete and repeated factor), treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value of the corresponding endpoint (as a continuous covariate), and randomization stratification factor (presence or absence of cataplexy). The response variable was the change from baseline to each postbaseline visit, with coprimary endpoints being the changes from baseline to week 12. The least squares (LS) mean and the standard…

### Xywav [^114W4qMo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Xywav for the treatment of cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in adult patients with narcolepsy was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal study (Study 1; NCT03030599). This study had two parts: the main study, followed by an optional 24-week open-label extension (OLE). The main study consisted of a 12-week open-label optimized treatment and titration period (OL OTTP), followed by a 2-week stable-dose period (SDP), and finally a 2-week double-blind randomized-withdrawal period (DB RWP).

Study 1 enrolled 201 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, ages 18 to 70, with a baseline history of at least 14 cataplexy attacks in a typical 2-week period prior to any treatment for narcolepsy symptoms. Of the 201 patients, 134 were randomized 1:1 to continue treatment with Xywav or to placebo in the 2-week DB RWP. In the safety population, the median age was 36 years (range: 18 to 70). The majority of subjects were female (61%), and most were white (88%) and not Hispanic or Latino (84%).

### European guideline and expert statements on the management of narcolepsy in adults and children [^111YfrP8]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for narcolepsy, specifically concerning the management of excessive daytime sleepiness, the EAN 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of methylphenidate, or amphetamines as an alternative, for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy who experience insufficient benefit or have side effects from first-line wake-promoting agents. A regular and careful benefit-risk ratio assessment should be obtained, and the lowest efficacious doses should be used.

### Sodium oxybate for narcolepsy with cataplexy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^11667GoA]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate (SXB) in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted.

- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
- **Patients**: Adults with narcolepsy-cataplexy.
- **Interventions**: SXB.

Electronic databases, such as MEDLINE, and references of included studies were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of SXB for patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. The risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager Version 5. Six RCTs and five companion reports were included after screening 14 full-text articles and 483 citations. All studies were funded by private industry.

SXB, typically administered at 9 g/night, was superior to placebo in reducing mean weekly cataplexy attacks (n = 2 RCTs, mean difference [MD]: -8.5, 95% CI: -15.3, -1.6), increasing maintenance wakefulness test (MWT) scores (n = 2, MD: 5.18, 95% CI: 2.59–7.78), reducing sleep attacks (n = 2, MD: -9.65, 95% CI: -17.72, -1.59), and increasing Clinical Global Impression scores (n = 3, relative risk [RR]: 2.42, 95% CI: 1.77–3.32). SXB did not significantly increase REM sleep compared to placebo (n = 2, MD: -0.49, 95% CI: -3.90, 2.92).

However, patients receiving SXB experienced statistically more adverse events compared to placebo, including nausea (n = 3, RR: 7.74, 95% CI: 3.2, 19.2), vomiting (n = 2, RR: 11.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 89.4), and dizziness (n = 3, RR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 16.4). Enuresis was not significantly different from placebo (n = 2, RR: 2.6, 95% CI: 0.8, 9.8). All meta-analyses had minimal statistical heterogeneity.

### REM sleep behavior disorder in children with type 1 narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate [^114wMeRN]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) is a central disorder of hypersomnolence characterized by sleep attacks, cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disrupted nocturnal sleep, and it is linked to hypocretin-1 deficiency.

REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) presents specific features in children with NT1. Video-polysomnography (v-PSG) has disclosed almost repetitive gesturing and behaviors emerging during dissociated REM sleep in about 30% of a cohort of 40 children with this condition. In these children, RBD occurs in correlation with decreased muscle atonia during REM sleep. Indeed, REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) is a sensitive and specific biomarker for NT1 in children.

Sodium oxybate (SO), a first-line treatment for NT1, has recently been reported to be effective in idiopathic RBD (iRBD) and in modulating muscle activity during REM sleep in narcolepsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this drug on nocturnal motor activity and behavior during REM sleep in children with NT1.

### REM sleep behavior disorder in children with type 1 narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate [^1173nC2u]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the effect of stable sodium oxybate (SO) treatment on nocturnal REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) in children severely affected by type 1 narcolepsy (NT1).

Nineteen children and adolescents with NT1 (9 female, mean age 12.5 ± 2.7 years, mean disease duration 3.4 ± 1.6 years) underwent neurologic investigations and video-polysomnography (v-PSG) both at baseline and after 3 months of stable SO treatment. Two sleep experts independently analyzed the v-PSG data to rate RBD episodes, while RSWA was automatically quantified using the validated REM sleep atonia index (RAI).

Results showed that, compared to baseline, the RAI significantly improved (p < 0.05) and complex movements during REM sleep were markedly reduced after stable SO treatment. Children also reported improvements in clinical complaints and exhibited changes in nighttime sleep-stage architecture.

The conclusions suggest that RBD and RSWA improved following SO treatment, indicating the drug's direct role in modulating motor control during REM sleep.

This study provides Class IV evidence of SO's positive effect on muscle atonia modulation during REM sleep in children with NT1, due to the absence of a control group.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^113jYdve]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

This phase 3 study demonstrated the robust effects of solriamfetol for improving wakefulness on the MWT and reducing excessive sleepiness (ES) on the ESS in a large population of patients with narcolepsy. The study also supports the safety and tolerability profile of solriamfetol. Solriamfetol showed dose-dependent efficacy that was significantly superior to placebo on both coprimary endpoints at the 150 and 300 mg doses. The 75 mg dose resulted in significantly greater improvement than placebo on the ESS, although not on the MWT.

Importantly, improvements on both coprimary endpoints were observed at week 1 and maintained at the 150 and 300 mg doses over the study duration, indicating no apparent tolerance over the 12 weeks of the study. Onset of efficacy at week 1 is consistent with previous observations in individuals with narcolepsy. Furthermore, on the MWT, significant effects were observed across all five individual MWT trials at the 150 and 300 mg doses, with effects maintained over a nine-hour duration following dosing at the 12-week time point. This effect across the day may be longer in duration than what was observed in prior studies of the wake-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil in patients with narcolepsy, where the effect appeared to diminish during the fourth and fifth time trials later in the day. However, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn in the absence of comparative trials.

### Hypersomnias of central origin [^117B1WcT]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Hypersomnia related to CNS disorders can be due to a variety of conditions. In this review, we discuss the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy with and without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia, and related illnesses. Research has provided insight into the underlying etiologies of these disorders, such as the genetic influences on disease development and the fundamental role of hypocretins in narcolepsy. We define the utility of diagnostic testing, including sleep studies, neuroimaging techniques, and laboratory investigations. New treatment options for hypersomnia are discussed.

### European guideline and expert statements on the management of narcolepsy in adults and children [^111iVyFh]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Narcolepsy is an uncommon hypothalamic disorder of presumed autoimmune origin that usually requires lifelong treatment. This paper aims to provide evidence-based guidelines for the management of narcolepsy in both adults and children. The European Academy of Neurology (EAN), European Sleep Research Society (ESRS), and European Narcolepsy Network (EU-NN) nominated a task force of 18 narcolepsy specialists. According to the EAN recommendations, 10 relevant clinical questions were formulated in PICO format. Following a systematic review of the literature (performed in Fall 2018 and updated in July 2020), recommendations were developed according to the GRADE approach.

A total of 10,247 references were evaluated, 308 studies were assessed, and 155 were finally included. The main recommendations can be summarized as follows:

- **Excessive daytime sleepiness in adults**: Scheduled naps, modafinil, pitolisant, sodium oxybate (SXB), and solriamfetol (all strong); methylphenidate and amphetamine derivates (both weak).
- **Cataplexy in adults**: SXB, venlafaxine, clomipramine (all strong), and pitolisant (weak).
- **Excessive daytime sleepiness in children**: Scheduled naps, SXB (both strong); modafinil, methylphenidate, pitolisant, and amphetamine derivates (all weak).
- **Cataplexy in children**: SXB (strong); antidepressants (weak).

Treatment choices should be tailored to each patient's symptoms, comorbidities, tolerance, and risk of potential drug interactions.

The management of narcolepsy involves non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches with an emphasis on individualized treatment plans.

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^1148nx58]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Narcolepsy often develops in children and adolescents, though there is often a lag of several years between the appearance of symptoms and diagnosis. When NT1 develops in childhood, rapid weight gain is common, and in adults with NT1, body mass index is 10% to 20% higher than in those without NT1. Possible causes of this weight gain include reduced sympathetic tone and a lower metabolic rate, both of which are increased with orexin; yet, there is no clear evidence for reduced sympathetic tone or metabolic rate, or changes in food intake or physical activity in children with NT1. In a mouse model, central administration of orexin‐A stimulated food intake, whereas an orexin receptor 1 antagonist reduced feeding. However, because orexin increases time awake, the increased food intake could have been in part related to being awake for longer.

Finally, it is possible that cardiovascular/cardiometabolic risks in people with narcolepsy could be elevated by indirect mechanisms, such as lifestyle factors (e.g. lack of exercise or poor food choices). Some people with narcolepsy may be too sleepy or fatigued to exercise. Lack of quality sleep has been associated with suboptimal food choices (such as fast food and high‐calorie items), although dietary data for people with narcolepsy are sparse. Comorbid conditions that are associated with narcolepsy may also increase cardiovascular/cardiometabolic risk. OSA and restless legs syndrome are more prevalent in people with narcolepsy than in those without narcolepsy, according to US claims analysis, which may themselves be associated with greater cardiovascular risks.

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^111erfL7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Observational and retrospective studies suggest that people with narcolepsy (NT1 or NT2) may have a higher-than-average prevalence of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Additionally, a retrospective cohort study of administrative claims data has suggested that people with narcolepsy had higher incidence rates of new-onset cardiovascular events than those without narcolepsy, although insurance claims database studies are limited in their generalizability, and the presence of unknown confounding issues could influence the results and conclusions.

While sleep specialists may often be the primary physicians managing narcolepsy, it is also beneficial for primary care providers and non-sleep specialists, including cardiologists, to be aware of the potentially higher cardiovascular risks in this patient population. Narcolepsy typically develops in adolescents and young adults, a group that may not be routinely evaluated for cardiovascular risks. Sleep disruption has been increasingly implicated in elevated blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular risk, suggesting that therapies achieving optimal sleep duration and quality in these patients may be important for improving long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Stimulant medications are common first-line treatments in these young patients, which may, in and of themselves, increase the risk of elevated BP and cardiac arrhythmias. Other treatments used as second-line for cataplexy include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

### Progressive narcolepsy: How to deal with intermediate hypocretin-1 values [^114dRsmC]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition guidelines, the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 is based on the association of excessive daytime sleepiness plus either cataplexy and electrophysiological criteria, or a cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 concentration below 110 pg/mL. This threshold remains debated, and recent works have proposed alternative values in the intermediate (110 to 200 pg/mL) zone.

We report the case of a patient who presented with typical clinical symptoms of narcolepsy type 1 developing over six years but in whom initial polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test were negative and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 was intermediate (132 pg/mL). Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 reassessment four years later found a dramatic decrease, < 50 pg/mL, and the multiple sleep latency test proved to be abnormal, eventually allowing to confirm the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of reassessing patients with intermediate hypocretin-1 values and contributes to the debate on the determination of alternative cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 thresholds for narcolepsy type 1 diagnosis.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^111vi3qT]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment of narcolepsy is symptomatically driven. Management of excessive sleepiness (ES) generally relies on pharmacologic interventions from several medication classes, including the central nervous system depressant sodium oxybate; stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines; and wake-promoting agents like modafinil and armodafinil. Additionally, the wake-promoting agent pitolisant has been recently approved for the treatment of narcolepsy in Europe. However, pharmacologic options may be associated with factors such as poor tolerability, tolerance over time, abuse potential, and suboptimal response, which may preclude or limit their use in some patients.

Solriamfetol (formerly known as JZP‐110 and ADX‐N05) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, binding to dopamine and norepinephrine transporters in vitro at micromolar concentrations, inhibiting reuptake without promoting the release of monoamines. Solriamfetol is distinguished from other wake-promoting agents by its dual reuptake inhibition at dopamine and norepinephrine transporters and from amphetamine stimulants by its lack of monoamine release. Together, these differences may account for its robust wake-promoting effects and the lack of rebound hypersomnia observed in rodent models of narcolepsy. In two phase 2 controlled clinical trials in adult patients with narcolepsy, solriamfetol reduced patient-reported excessive sleepiness as measured on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and improved wakefulness as measured by objective assessments.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled study demonstrates sodium oxybate is effective for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy [^115HwhAk]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy, with an emphasis on excessive daytime sleepiness. The study was designed as an eight-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across forty-two sleep clinics in the United States, Canada, and Europe.

Participants included two hundred twenty-eight adults with narcolepsy accompanied by cataplexy.

Interventions involved the withdrawal of patients from antidepressant treatment, followed by random assignment to receive 4.5 g, 6 g, or 9 g of sodium oxybate nightly or a placebo for eight weeks. The 6-g and 9-g doses were titrated in weekly 1.5-g increments. Patients receiving the placebo underwent a mock dose-titration schedule, and stimulant use continued unchanged. Excessive daytime sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. Additionally, the Clinical Global Impression of Change was used to measure changes in disease severity. Changes in narcolepsy symptoms and adverse events were recorded in daily diaries.

Results showed that after eight weeks, patients treated with 9 g of sodium oxybate nightly displayed a significant median increase of more than 10 minutes in the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (p < .001). Patients also displayed dose-related decreases in median Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and the frequency of weekly inadvertent naps, which were significant at both the 6-g and 9-g doses (each, p < .001). These improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness were incremental to those achieved by concomitant stimulants alone. Significant improvements in the Clinical Global Impression of Change were noted for each group.

### Effects of pharmacotherapy treatment on patient-reported outcomes in a narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia cohort [^114dtzQS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the association between patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and treatment regimen/standardized dose (STD), a measure of drug burden, in patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1)/type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).

Patients aged 18 years or older with NT1/NT2 and IH, with baseline and at least a 6-month follow-up during 2008–2010, were included. Changes in PROs, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and total sleep time (TST) by diagnosis, treatment regimen (monotherapy versus polytherapy, sodium oxybate [SO] use), and STD were assessed using t-tests and univariable/multivariable linear regressions, adjusting for patient characteristics.

A total of 92 patients (26 [28.3%] NT1, 27 [29.3%] NT2, 39 [42.4%] IH) were included, with an average age of 43.8 ± 14.8 years; 66 (71.7%) were female. Baseline PROs suggested excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS 14.2 ± 5.2, with 74% of patients scoring above 10), significant fatigue (FSS 47.5 ± 12.9), and mild depression (PHQ-9 9.0 [4.0, 14.0], with 49.4% scoring 10 or above). At follow-up, ESS and PHQ-9 improved significantly overall and within diagnostic groups, monotherapy/polytherapy, and SO use groups (all P < .01). FSS improved significantly overall (P = 0.016); however, improvements were not significant for IH, monotherapy, polytherapy, and non-SO using groups. In multivariable models, PRO changes were not significantly different between groups, but baseline STD was associated with worsening PHQ-9 across PHQ-9 change models, and ESS worsened with increasing STD at follow-up (P = 0.056).

### Update on narcolepsy [^112CBYiC]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The last two decades have seen an explosion in our understanding of the clinical nature of narcolepsy and its pathogenesis, fueling new approaches to potentially effective treatments. It is now recognized that the full narcoleptic syndrome has significant adverse effects on sleep regulation across the full 24-hour period and is often associated with clinical features outside the sleep-wake domain. The discovery that most narcoleptic subjects specifically lack a hypothalamic neuropeptide (hypocretin, also called orexin) was a truly original and landmark observation in 1999, greatly furthering our understanding both of the syndrome itself and sleep biology in general.

An autoimmune pathophysiology has long been suggested by the tight association with specific histocompatibility antigens, and very recently, it has been partly confirmed by detailed analysis of T-cell immunological function in affected subjects. Drug treatments remain symptomatic but may soon become more focused by restoring central hypocretin signaling with replacement therapy. Potentially disease-modifying immunological approaches have yet to be studied systematically, although the interval between disease onset and the development of the full clinical syndrome may be longer than previously appreciated, affording a realistic window of opportunity for limiting neuronal damage in this disabling condition.

### Provigil [^1145kyjY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Provigil in improving wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy was established in two US 9-week, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind studies of outpatients who met the criteria for narcolepsy. A total of 558 patients were randomized to receive Provigil 200 or 400 mg/day, or placebo.

- **Criteria for narcolepsy**: The criteria include either:
	1. Daytime naps or lapses into sleep that occur almost daily for at least three months, plus sudden bilateral loss of postural muscle tone in association with intense emotion (cataplexy).
	2. A complaint of excessive sleepiness or sudden muscle weakness with associated features: sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, automatic behaviors, disrupted major sleep episode; and polysomnography demonstrating one of the following: sleep latency less than 10 minutes or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency less than 20 minutes.

For entry into these studies, all patients were required to have objectively documented excessive daytime sleepiness, via a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) with two or more sleep onset REM periods and the absence of any other clinically significant active medical or psychiatric disorder. The MSLT, an objective polysomnographic assessment of the patient's ability to fall asleep in an unstimulating environment, measured latency (in minutes) to sleep onset averaged over 4 test sessions at 2-hour intervals. For each test session, the subject was told to lie quietly and attempt to sleep.

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^114FnHot]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Statement 2e: Tailor narcolepsy pharmacotherapy on the basis of the risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. For patients with cardiovascular/cardiometabolic comorbidities, narcolepsy treatment should be selected carefully to avoid further increased cardiovascular risk. The following considerations are important to balancing the risks and benefits of treatment options that may be associated with greater cardiovascular risk.

Stimulants such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, which are commonly prescribed to treat narcolepsy, are associated with cardiovascular risks. They are accompanied by warnings against use in patients with known cardiac disorders. Accordingly, the American College of Cardiology issued a statement in 2015 cautioning against the use of stimulants in patients with arrhythmia. It advised that for patients whose condition may warrant treatment with stimulants, a careful weighing of benefits and risks should be performed. ECGs are not routinely performed before prescribing stimulants; however, for patients with suspected cardiac disease, obtaining a cardiologist's opinion before prescribing stimulants may be recommended.

A 2023 case–control study of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder found that a longer cumulative duration of methylphenidate use was associated with increased risk of CVD. However, a meta‐analysis of observational studies of methylphenidate found no increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or all‐cause death but did find an increased risk of sudden death/arrhythmia (risk ratio, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.0–2.1]).

### Sunosi [^113W2saS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Sunosi in improving wakefulness and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness was demonstrated in a 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1; NCT02348593) in adult patients diagnosed with narcolepsy according to the ICSD-3 or DSM-5 criteria.

Wakefulness and sleepiness were assessed using the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The MWT measures an individual's ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment. Patients were instructed to remain awake for as long as possible during 40-minute test sessions, and sleep latency was determined as the mean number of minutes patients could remain awake in the first four test sessions. The ESS is an 8-item questionnaire where patients rate their perceived likelihood of falling asleep during usual daily life activities.

Change in overall symptom severity was assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) scale. The PGIc is a 7-point patient-reported scale where patients rate their symptom change since the beginning of the study, with responses ranging from "very much improved" to "very much worse". The co-primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in MWT and ESS at Week 12. A pre-specified secondary endpoint was the percentage of subjects reported as improved (minimally, much, or very much) at Week 12 by PGIc.

### Narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic generalized epilepsy: Diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in dual cases [^1156Aucx]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to describe the possible co-occurrence of narcolepsy type 1 and generalized epilepsy, focusing on diagnostic challenges and safety of dual treatments.

Four patients with comorbidity for narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic generalized epilepsy are reported. In three cases, the onset of epilepsy preceded the appearance of narcolepsy type 1, whereas in one case, epileptic spells began subsequently. Patients presented with absences, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizure types. In the patient with tonic-clonic seizures, the dual pathology was easily recognized. In the other cases, the first diagnosis caused the comorbid disease to be overlooked, independent of the time-course sequence.

All four patients underwent neurological examination and video-electroencephalogram, during which ictal and interictal epileptic discharges were recorded, along with sleep polysomnographic studies. Repeated sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) were documented with the multiple sleep latency test (MLST) in all four cases. All patients had unremarkable brain magnetic resonance imaging studies, and cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 was assessed in two patients, revealing undetectable levels. The association of antiepileptic drugs and substances currently used to treat narcolepsy type 1, including sodium oxybate, was effective in improving seizures, sleep disturbance, and cataplexy.

Narcolepsy type 1 may occur in association with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, leading to remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

### Wakix [^113ogeof]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Wakix for the treatment of cataplexy in adult patients with narcolepsy was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Study 3; NCT01800045 and Study 1; NCT01067222). Patients aged 18 years or older who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) criteria for narcolepsy with cataplexy, with at least three cataplexy attacks per week and an ESS score of ≥ 12, were eligible to enroll in Study 3. Additionally, patients meeting the ICSD-2 criteria for narcolepsy (with or without cataplexy) and an ESS score of ≥ 14 were eligible to enroll in Study 1.

Study 3 included a 7-week treatment period comprising a 3-week dose titration phase followed by a 4-week stable dose phase. A total of 105 patients were randomized to receive either Wakix or placebo. The Wakix dose was initiated at 4.45 mg once daily for the first week, increased to 8.9 mg for the second week, and could remain the same or be decreased or increased at the next two weekly intervals to a maximum of 35.6 mg based on clinical response and tolerability. No dose adjustments were permitted during the 4-week stable dose phase. Sixty-five percent of patients reached a stable dose of 35.6 mg. The median age in the study was 37 years, and 51% of the patients were male. Race was not collected in this study.

Wakix demonstrated a statistically significant greater improvement on the primary endpoint: the change in the geometric mean number of cataplexy attacks per week from baseline to the average of the 4-week stable dosing period, compared to placebo.

### Hypersomnia and depressive symptoms: Methodological and clinical aspects [^114K1Mrp]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although there is no cure for narcolepsy, psychostimulants such as modafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamine, and sodium oxybate are used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep attacks. Cataplexy is managed with sodium oxybate and antidepressant drugs, indicating that most drugs used to manage cataplexy have mood-modifying properties. When assessing treatment effects on disease severity and psychological consequences, we observed that patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy treated with anticataplectics (mainly tricyclic agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) experienced more depressive symptoms and greater quality of life alterations compared to patients treated with stimulants alone. Higher baseline severity of REM sleep manifestations typically leads to higher prescriptions of anticataplectics. However, our study revealed that anticataplectics at doses prescribed for cataplexy management were ineffective in treating depressive symptoms.

Recent studies support the role of specific hypocretin receptors in the modulation of depression-like behavior. A behavioral mice study, following genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of hypocretin receptor signaling, suggested that the balance of hypocretin activity at either receptor 1 or receptor 2 produces an antidepressant- or pro-depressant-like effect, depending on the subtype activated.

Beyond the scope of narcolepsy, some human studies have compared the levels of hypocretin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with mood disorders to levels in healthy controls, resulting in controversial findings. A reduced amplitude in diurnal variations has been observed.

### Pitolisant versus placebo or modafinil in patients with narcolepsy: A double-blind, randomised trial [^111axAMB]. The Lancet Neurology (2013). High credibility.

Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. Histamine neurons are crucial for maintaining wakefulness. We assessed the safety and efficacy of pitolisant, previously known as BF2.649, a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that activates these neurons, in patients with narcolepsy.

- **Methods**: For this double-blind, randomized, parallel-group controlled trial, we recruited patients with narcolepsy from 32 sleep disorder centers in five European countries. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had not taken psychostimulants for at least 14 days, and had EDS defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of at least 14. Using a computer-generated randomization sequence, we randomly allocated patients to receive pitolisant, modafinil, or placebo (1:1:1). Treatment lasted 8 weeks: 3 weeks of flexible dosing according to the investigator's judgment (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg a day of pitolisant; 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg a day of modafinil) followed by 5 weeks of stable dosing. Patients took four tablets a day in a double-dummy design to ensure masking. For the primary analysis, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, we evaluated the superiority of pitolisant versus placebo, and the non-inferiority of pitolisant versus modafinil. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01067222.

- **Findings**: Between May 26, 2009, and June 30, 2010, we screened 110 patients, 95 of whom were eligible and randomly assigned to treatment: 30 to placebo, 32 to pitolisant, and 33 to modafinil. Over the 8 weeks, the results demonstrated the efficacy of pitolisant in managing symptoms of narcolepsy compared to placebo, with comparable outcomes to modafinil.

### Rem sleep behavior disorder in children with type 1 narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate [^1161v92q]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

To study the effect of stable treatment with sodium oxybate (SO) on nocturnal REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) that severely affected children with type 1 narcolepsy (NT1), we conducted neurologic investigations and video-polysomnography (v-PSG) on nineteen children and adolescents with NT1 (9 female, mean age 12.5 ± 2.7 years, mean disease duration 3.4 ± 1.6 years) at baseline and after 3 months of stable treatment with SO.

- **Methods**: v-PSG was independently analyzed by 2 sleep experts to rate RBD episodes. RSWA was automatically computed using the validated REM sleep atonia index (RAI).

- **Results**: Compared to baseline, RAI significantly improved (p < 0.05) and complex movements during REM sleep were remarkably reduced after stable treatment with SO. Children also reported improvement in clinical complaints and showed a different nighttime sleep-stage architecture compared to baseline.

- **Conclusions**: RBD and RSWA improved after treatment with SO, suggesting a direct role of the drug in modulating motor control during REM sleep.

- **Classification of evidence**: This study offers Class IV evidence of the positive effect of SO on modulation of muscle atonia during REM sleep in children with NT1 due to the absence of a control group.

### Narcolepsy: Comorbidities, complexities and future directions [^115bfftB]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with narcolepsy live with a lifelong sleep-wake disorder, impairing their quality of life, productivity, and educational and employment outcomes. Clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that a significant aspect of the burden of this disease relates to frequent comorbid conditions, including aspects of the patient's emotional, metabolic, sleep, and immune health. This review explores the literature describing the comorbidities seen in patients with narcolepsy, enhancing understanding of these often complex presentations. It seeks to encourage a multidisciplinary approach, collaborating with patients and a broad clinical team, to maximize clinical and quality of life outcomes for those living with narcolepsy.

### Neuropsychiatric correlates of narcolepsy [^1175YFGi]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The complex nature of narcolepsy symptoms, along with the use of stimulants and anticataplectic medications, poses diagnostic difficulties related to underlying neuropsychiatric comorbidities. This study reviews recent evidence for the association between narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. We critically analyze studies that have addressed the neuropsychiatric correlates of patients with narcolepsy, discussing the possible pathophysiological mechanisms linking narcolepsy and these disorders.

- **Recent findings**: Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common among patients with narcolepsy, as narcolepsy and some neuropsychiatric disorders share common clinical features. This overlap can create challenges in making the correct diagnosis, potentially delaying the initiation of appropriate treatment. Comorbid neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with narcolepsy include depression, anxiety, psychosis, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive impairment. Although hypocretin deficiency has been suggested as a pathophysiological mechanism underlying both narcolepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, further research is necessary to identify the exact mechanisms. Given that narcolepsy patients often exhibit comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms, which complicates the diagnostic process, it is essential to address these symptoms in the clinical care of patients with narcolepsy.

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^117AtLkW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Pitolisant is a histamine-3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist used for treating excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy. Although generally considered safe, pitolisant should not be combined with other drugs that may increase the QT interval.

- **Serotonin reuptake inhibitors**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. venlafaxine) are used off-label as second-line treatments for cataplexy. Some cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias (e.g. QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes), have been observed in people taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Venlafaxine can increase blood pressure.

- **Cardiovascular risks and benefits**: For some patients, the cardiovascular risks linked to some narcolepsy medications (e.g. stimulants and other wake-promoting agents) may be counterbalanced by improving sleep hygiene, which can positively impact cardiovascular health. Improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness brought about by treatment with a stimulant or wake-promoting agent may be associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors that counteract the inherent cardiovascular risks of the medication.

	- For example, although the wake-promoting agent modafinil has been associated with increased heart rate and blood pressure in healthy adults, a meta-analysis of six randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of modafinil for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in people with narcolepsy, OSA, and shift-work sleep disorder found no significant changes in these parameters from baseline to final assessment.

### Narcolepsy: Pathophysiology and pharmacology [^115kat8d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Narcolepsy, which affects 1 in 2000 people in the general population, is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, and other dissociated manifestations of rapid eye movement sleep, such as hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. The disease is currently treated with amphetamine-like central nervous system stimulants for EDS and antidepressants for cataplexy. Additionally, some compounds from other classes, such as modafinil (a non-amphetamine wake-promoting compound for EDS) and sodium oxybate (a short-acting sedative for EDS and cataplexy, administered at night), are also employed.

The major pathophysiology of human narcolepsy has been recently elucidated through discoveries of narcolepsy genes in animal models, revealing hypocretin/orexin ligand deficiency in about 90% of human narcolepsy-cataplexy cases. This finding led directly to the development of new diagnostic tests, such as cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin measures. Hypocretin replacement is also likely to be a new therapeutic option for hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy, although it is still not available in humans. This review discusses the pharmacologic and pathophysiologic aspects of narcolepsy.

### Xyrem [^111SFHvY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Trial N2 was a randomized-withdrawal trial involving 55 narcoleptic patients who had been taking open-label Xyrem for 7 to 44 months prior to study entry. To be included, patients were required to have a history of at least 5 cataplexy attacks per week prior to any treatment for cataplexy. Patients were randomized to either continued treatment with Xyrem at their stable dose (ranging from 3 g to 9 g per night) or to a placebo for 2 weeks. Trial N2 was designed specifically to evaluate the continued efficacy of sodium oxybate after long-term use.

The primary efficacy measure in Trials N1 and N2 was the frequency of cataplexy attacks.

- **Median number of cataplexy attacks in Trials N1 and N2**: In Trial N1, both the 6 g and 9 g per night Xyrem doses resulted in statistically significant reductions in the frequency of cataplexy attacks. The 3 g per night dose had little effect. In Trial N2, patients randomized to placebo after discontinuing long-term open-label Xyrem therapy experienced a significant increase in cataplexy attacks (p < 0.001), providing evidence of long-term efficacy of Xyrem. In Trial N2, the response was numerically similar for patients treated with doses of 6 g to 9 g per night, but there was no effect seen in patients treated with doses less than 6 g per night, suggesting little effect at these doses.

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^116NCzjb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The agreement rating of all experts for all revised recommendation statements was 4.0 (very much agree). The level of evidence supporting each recommendation statement is compiled as follows:

- **Recommendation 1: Recognize the risk of hypertension and disease in patients with narcolepsy**.
	- Observational and retrospective studies have suggested an increased prevalence of cardiovascular/cardiometabolic comorbidities in patients with narcolepsy compared to those without. A retrospective analysis of a large US insurance claims database from 2006 to 2010 assessed incidence rates of these comorbidities in 9312 adults with narcolepsy (NT1 or NT2) and 46,559 control subjects without narcolepsy. Subjects were randomly selected on a 5:1 basis to match patients with narcolepsy by age, sex, geographic region, and payer type (private or Medicare). Comorbid hypertension was found in 44% of patients with narcolepsy, compared to 31% of controls. Patients with narcolepsy also showed increased rates of obesity (odds ratio, 2.3 [95% CI, 2.2–2.5]) and diabetes (odds ratio, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.7–1.8]).

A further analysis of an administrative claims database, encompassing 54 million patients in the United States from 2014 to 2019, indicated higher incidence rates of new-onset cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with narcolepsy (n = 12,816).

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: Expert panel consensus recommendations [^113Vndc1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

From the perspective of medications and sleep, it should be recognized that narcolepsy therapy with stimulants may cause insomnia or difficulty sleeping, and some oxybate medications may require patients to wake from sleep in the early morning for repeat dosing. Both sodium oxybate and low-sodium oxybate require awakening from sleep for the second dose, disrupting sleep in people whose disorder is associated with sleep disruption. In this context, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved a single-dose, extended-release sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy; this medication has high sodium content similar to conventional, twice-nightly sodium oxybate, but the single dose has the advantage of not requiring a second awakening. People with narcolepsy treated with oxybate have been reported to experience approximately 42 to 53 arousals and 9 to 38 awakenings each night. Although no studies have directly compared the effects of twice-nightly sodium oxybate or low-sodium oxybate with extended-release sodium oxybate, clinical trial data from individual clinical development programs demonstrate that once-nightly and twice-nightly oxybate regimens are associated with similar improvements in sleep architecture, stage shifts, arousals, or awakenings, and patient-reported sleep quality.

- **Clinicians should evaluate for and treat comorbid risk factors and conditions in collaboration with primary care, cardiology, endocrinology, and other relevant specialties**: An interdisciplinary approach to reducing cardiovascular risk could include non-sleep specialists.

### Antidepressant drugs for narcolepsy [^114h1YGK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Narcolepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, the main symptoms of which are excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy, an abrupt and reversible decrease in or loss of muscle tone affecting the limbs and/or trunk, elicited by emotional stimuli. Narcolepsy adversely impacts people's quality of life. Together with stimulant drugs, which are used to control EDS, antidepressants are usually recommended to counteract cataplexy. In addition, some antidepressants are also reported to improve EDS.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of antidepressant drugs on EDS, cataplexy, quality of life, and their side effects in people with narcolepsy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003), PsycINFO (1872 to 2003), and CINAHL (1981 to 2003). Bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed to find additional references. Unpublished randomized trials were searched for by consulting governmental and non-governmental clinical trial registers, disease-specific websites, investigators and experts in the field, and pharmaceutical companies/manufacturers.

- **Selection criteria**: Parallel or cross-over randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials testing the treatment of narcolepsy with any type of antidepressant drug versus no treatment, placebo, or another antidepressant drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes were: (a) elimination of EDS; (b) mean reduction of E.
