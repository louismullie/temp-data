## Question

What did the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC trial show about the effectiveness of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in men who have sex with men?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC trial showed about the effectiveness of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in men who have sex with men (MSM). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and population. Then, I should verify the intervention details and dosing. Next, I will examine the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes with precise figures. After that, I need to check safety and tolerability. Finally, I should consider antimicrobial resistance signals, how these results compare with other trials, and what guidelines and meta-analyses say about applicability and strength of evidence.

> Let me first confirm the study design and population so I don't misstate the context. ANRS 174 DOXYVAC was a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with a 2×2 factorial design that enrolled HIV-negative MSM with a history of bacterial STIs in the prior 12 months who were already on HIV PrEP within the ANRS PREVENIR cohort, with a median follow-up of 14 months and 545 participants in the modified intention-to-treat analysis for the doxycycline comparison, which establishes a high-risk, PrEP-using MSM population as the target group [^9e8939ba] [^d8cae2a1].

> I need to verify the intervention specifics. The doxycycline PEP regimen was 200 mg orally as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after condomless sex, with a maximum of three 200 mg doses per week, which is the same 200 mg post-exposure dose used in other pivotal trials and aligns with current guideline dosing recommendations [^9e8939ba] [^b3039634].

> Now, the primary outcome: I should double-check the exact incidence and hazard ratio. The trial's coprimary endpoint for doxycycline PEP was time to first chlamydia or syphilis, and the incidence was 8.8 per 100 person-years in the doxycycline arm versus 53.2 per 100 person-years in the no-PEP arm, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.17 with a 95% CI of 0.12–0.26 and P < 0.0001, which corresponds to an approximately 83% relative reduction in chlamydia or syphilis acquisition [^9e8939ba] [^d8cae2a1].

> Wait, let me verify the gonorrhea signal because that's where results vary across studies. For incident gonorrhea, the trial reported 45.5 per 100 person-years with doxycycline versus 68.4 per 100 person-years without, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.67 and 95% CI 0.52–0.87, indicating a significant 33% relative reduction, which contrasts with the null gonorrhea effect seen in the earlier IPERGAY substudy and is less robust than the chlamydia/syphilis effect but still statistically significant in this analysis [^d8cae2a1] [^4fbb9252].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and tolerability so I don't overstate risks. Serious adverse events were uncommon, with only one drug-related serious adverse event (a fixed-drug eruption) in the doxycycline arm, and discontinuations for gastrointestinal reasons occurred in 2% of participants, which is consistent with the known tolerability profile of doxycycline in this context [^9e8939ba] [^e41330e0].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial resistance considerations because they meaningfully inform implementation. A substudy of DOXYVAC found higher rates of high-level tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from the doxycycline arm (35.5% vs 12.5%) and more frequent detection of the mosaic penA34.007 allele associated with decreased cefixime susceptibility, reinforcing the need for ongoing AMR surveillance and judicious, targeted use rather than broad rollout [^70dc3106] [^b4098005].

> Let me consider how these results fit within the broader evidence base so I don't overgeneralize. The DOXYVAC findings align with the US DoxyPEP trial, which showed roughly 70% reductions in overall bacterial STIs and large reductions in chlamydia and syphilis with a smaller but significant gonorrhea reduction, and with a meta-analysis indicating strong efficacy for chlamydia and syphilis and modest, heterogeneous effects for gonorrhea, supporting external validity in MSM and transgender women populations [^4415c737] [^f5c3daa4].

> I should confirm guideline positions to ensure my interpretation matches current standards. CDC recommends offering doxycycline PEP to MSM and transgender women with a bacterial STI in the past 12 months using shared decision-making, with 200 mg within 72 hours after sex and no more than 200 mg in 24 hours, and emphasizes quarterly STI screening and reassessment of ongoing need, which directly reflects the regimen and population studied in DOXYVAC [^b3039634] [^1eec20d4].

> But wait, what about applicability beyond MSM and transgender women? I need to check that limitation. The Kenyan dPEP trial in cisgender women did not show efficacy, likely due to low adherence and high background tetracycline resistance, so DOXYVAC's efficacy conclusions should not be extrapolated to cisgender women at this time, and guidelines appropriately restrict recommendations pending better data in that population [^b1e4d464] [^6d5bb87a].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. ANRS 174 DOXYVAC demonstrated that doxycycline PEP reduced incident chlamydia or syphilis by about 83% and incident gonorrhea by about 33% in high-risk, PrEP-using MSM, with good tolerability but with measurable increases in tetracycline resistance markers in gonorrhea, supporting targeted, guideline-concordant use with ongoing AMR surveillance and periodic reassessment of benefit-risk balance [^9e8939ba] [^d8cae2a1] [^70dc3106].

---

The ANRS 174 DOXYVAC trial showed that **doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) reduced incident chlamydia and syphilis by about 80%** (aHR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12–0.26) in HIV-negative MSM with recent STIs, with a smaller but significant reduction in gonorrhea (aHR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52–0.87) [^9e8939ba] [^d8cae2a1]. The regimen was **well tolerated**, with only 2% discontinuing for gastrointestinal reasons and one serious adverse event (fixed drug eruption) [^9e8939ba] [^e41330e0]. These results support doxyPEP as an effective, acceptable strategy for high-risk MSM, while ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is essential [^b3039634] [^70dc3106].

---

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized, 2×2 factorial trial.
- **Population**: HIV-negative MSM aged ≥ 18 years with ≥ 1 bacterial STI in the prior 12 months, enrolled in the ANRS PREVENIR PrEP cohort.
- **Intervention**: DoxyPEP 200 mg within 72 hours after condomless sex (max 3 doses/week) vs no PEP; also tested 4CMenB vaccine vs no vaccine.
- **Primary outcome**: Time to first chlamydia or syphilis infection (coprimary with gonorrhea for the vaccine arm).
- **Follow-up**: Median 14 months (IQR 9–18); 545 participants analyzed.

---

## Key findings

### Efficacy

- **Chlamydia/syphilis**: 8.8 vs 53.2 per 100 person-years in doxyPEP vs no PEP; aHR 0.17 (95% CI 0.12–0.26; P < 0.0001) — an ~80% reduction.
- **Gonorrhea**: 45.5 vs 68.4 per 100 person-years; aHR 0.67 (95% CI 0.52–0.87; P = 0.003) — a ~33% reduction.
- **Syphilis alone**: 2.9 vs 14.5 per 100 person-years; aHR 0.21 (95% CI 0.11–0.41) — a ~79% reduction.

---

### Safety and tolerability

Safety and tolerability were favorable: **serious adverse events** were rare, with only one drug-related serious adverse event (fixed drug eruption) reported [^9e8939ba]. Discontinuations due to gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 2% of participants, and no deaths occurred during the study [^9e8939ba].

---

### Antimicrobial resistance considerations

Resistance concerns were addressed: **tetracycline resistance** in Neisseria gonorrhoeae was more frequent in the doxyPEP arm (35.5% vs 12.5%; p = 0.043), though ceftriaxone susceptibility remained unchanged [^70dc3106]. The gut resistome showed a modest increase in tetracycline resistance genes without changes in microbiome diversity, supporting ongoing surveillance [^3e06e663].

---

## Clinical implications and guidelines

- **CDC 2024**: Recommends doxyPEP for MSM and transgender women with ≥ 1 bacterial STI in the past 12 months, using shared decision-making and quarterly screening [^b3039634] [^1eec20d4].
- **IDSA 2024**: Supports doxyPEP for MSM and transgender women with recent STIs, with quarterly screening and reassessment [^f770e1ad].
- **WHO 2024**: Recommends doxyPEP for MSM and transgender women at high risk, with AMR monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Open-label design**: Potential bias; however, objective STI testing mitigates this.
- **Generalizability**: Limited to HIV-negative MSM on PrEP; unclear in cisgender women and heterosexual men [^b1e4d464].
- **AMR**: Requires ongoing surveillance and stewardship [^70dc3106] [^3e06e663].

---

## Conclusion

The ANRS 174 DOXYVAC trial demonstrates that **doxyPEP significantly reduces chlamydia and syphilis by ~80% and gonorrhea by ~33%** in high-risk HIV-negative MSM, with good tolerability and manageable resistance concerns. These data support targeted doxyPEP implementation with routine screening and AMR surveillance [^9e8939ba] [^b3039634].

### Doxycycline prophylaxis and meningococcal group B vaccine to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections in France (ANRS 174 DOXYVAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design [^9e8939ba]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are reported among men who have sex with men (MSM) and new interventions are needed. We aimed to assess whether post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with doxycycline could reduce the incidence of chlamydia or syphilis (or both) and whether the meningococcal group B vaccine (4CMenB) could reduce the incidence of gonorrhoea in this population.

Methods

ANRS 174 DOXYVAC is a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial with a 2×2 factorial design conducted at ten hospital sites in Paris, France. Eligible participants were MSM aged 18 years or older, HIV negative, had a history of bacterial STIs within the 12 months before enrolment, and who were already included in the ANRS PREVENIR study (a cohort of MSM using pre-exposure prophylaxis with tenofovir and emtricitabine for HIV prevention). Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to doxycycline PEP (two pills of 100 mg each orally within 72 h after condomless sex, with no more than three doses of 200 mg per week) or no PEP groups and were also randomly assigned (1:1) to the 4CMenB vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline, Paris, France; two intramuscular injections at enrolment and at 2 months) or no vaccine groups, using a computer-generated randomisation list with a permuted fixed block size of four. Follow-up occurred for at least 12 months (with visits every 3 months) up to 24 months. The coprimary outcomes were the risk of a first episode of chlamydia or syphilis (or both) after the enrolment visit at baseline for the doxycycline intervention and the risk of a first episode of gonorrhoea starting at month 3 (ie, 1 month after the second vaccine dose) for the vaccine intervention, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (defined as all randomly assigned participants who had at least one follow-up visit). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04597424 (ongoing).

Findings

Between Jan 19, 2021, and Sept 19, 2022, 556 participants were randomly assigned. 545 (98%) participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis for the doxycycline PEP and no PEP groups and 544 (98%) were included for the 4CMenB vaccine and no vaccine groups. The median follow-up was 14 months (IQR 9-18). The median age was 40 years (34-48) and all 545 participants were male. There was no interaction between the two interventions (p≥0·1) for the primary outcome. The incidence of a first episode of chlamydia or syphilis (or both) was 8·8 per 100 person-years (35 events in 362 participants) in the doxycycline PEP group and 53·2 per 100 person-years (80 events in 183 participants) in the no PEP group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0·17 [95% CI 0·12-0·26]; p<0·0001). The incidence of a first episode of gonorrhoea, starting from month 3 was 58·3 per 100 person-years (103 events in 274 participants) in the 4CmenB vaccine group and 77·1 per 100 person-years (122 events in 270 participants) in the no vaccine group (aHR 0·78 [95% CI 0·60-1·01]; p=0·061). There were no deaths during the study. One drug-related serious adverse event (fixed-drug eruption) occurred in the doxycycline PEP group. Six (2%) participants in the doxycycline group discontinued doxycycline PEP because of gastrointestinal adverse events.

Interpretation

Doxycycline PEP strongly reduced the incidence of chlamydia and syphilis in MSM, but we did not show efficacy of the 4CmenB vaccine for gonorrhoea. Doxycycline PEP should be assessed in other populations, such as heterosexual men and women, and its effect on antimicrobial resistance carefully monitored.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline to prevent sexually transmitted infections in men who have sex with men: an open-label randomised substudy of the ANRS IPERGAY trial [^4fbb9252]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been reported among men who have sex with men. We aimed to assess whether post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with doxycycline could reduce the incidence of STIs.

Methods

All participants attending their scheduled visit in the open-label extension of the ANRS IPERGAY trial in France (men aged 18 years or older having condomless sex with men and using pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine) were eligible for inclusion in this open-label randomised study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) at a central site to take a single oral dose of 200 mg doxycycline PEP within 24 h after sex or no prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a first STI (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or syphilis) during the 10-month follow-up. The cumulative probability of occurrence of the primary endpoint was estimated in each group with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The primary efficacy analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomised participants. All participants received risk-reduction counselling and condoms, and were tested regularly for HIV. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01473472.

Findings

Between July 20, 2015, and Jan 21, 2016, we randomly assigned 232 participants (n=116 in the doxycycline PEP group and n=116 in the no-PEP group) who were followed up for a median of 8·7 months (IQR 7·8-9·7). Participants in the PEP group used a median of 680 mg doxycycline per month (IQR 280-1450). 73 participants presented with a new STI during follow-up, 28 in the PEP group (9-month probability 22%, 95% CI 15-32) and 45 in the no-PEP group (42%, 33-53; log-rank test p=0·007). The occurrence of a first STI in participants taking PEP was lower than in those not taking PEP (hazard ratio [HR] 0·53; 95% CI 0·33-0·85; p=0·008). Similar results were observed for the occurrence of a first episode of chlamydia (HR 0·30; 95% CI 0·13-0·70; p=0·006) and of syphilis (0·27; 0·07-0·98; p=0·047); for a first episode of gonorrhoea the results did not differ significantly (HR 0·83; 0·47-1·47; p=0·52). No HIV seroconversion was observed, and 72 (71%) of all 102 STIs were asymptomatic. Rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported in 62 (53%) participants in the PEP group and 47 (41%) in the no-PEP group (p=0·05).

Interpretation

Doxycycline PEP reduced the occurrence of a first episode of bacterial STI in high-risk men who have sex with men.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis and meningococcal group B vaccine to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections in France (ANRS 174 DOXYVAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design [^d8cae2a1]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The study ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) was published by Jean-Michel Molina and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Chlamydia trachomatis infection, Gonorrhea, Syphilis and Gonococcal urethritis. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the trial question was: what is the role of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in MSM? In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the population was: 545 male patients. The inclusion criteria were adult MSM, HIV-negative, with a history of bacterial STIs within the past 12 months. The key exclusion criteria were previous meningococcal group B vaccination; current treatment with doxycycline; doxycycline allergy or other contraindication for use. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the interventions were: n=362 doxycycline PEP (two tablets of 100 mg each PO within 72 hours after condomless sex, with no more than 3 doses of 200 mg/week) n=183 no PEP (no doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis). In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of first episode of Chlamydia or syphilis, or both (8.8/100 py vs. 53.2/100 py; HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.26). In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the incidence of first episode of gonorrhea (45.5/100 py vs. 68.4/100 py; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.87) Significant decrease in the incidence of first episode of syphilis (2.9/100 py vs. 14.5/100 py; HR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.41) Significant decrease in the incidence of cumulative incidence of Chlamydia or syphilis (or both) (8.5/100 py vs. 56/100 py; IRR 0.15, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.22). In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (doxycycline PEP) study, the conclusion was: in adult MSM, HIV-negative, with a history of bacterial STIs within the past 12 months, doxycycline PEP was superior to no PEP with respect to the incidence of first episode of Chlamydia or syphilis, or both.

The study ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) was published by Jean-Michel Molina and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Gonorrhea, Gonococcal urethritis and Gonococcal proctitis. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the trial question was: what is the role of meningococcal group B vaccine in MSM? In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the population was: 544 male patients. The inclusion criteria were adult MSM, HIV-negative, with a history of bacterial STIs within the past 12 months. The key exclusion criteria were previous meningococcal group B vaccination; current treatment with doxycycline; doxycycline allergy or other contraindication for use. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the interventions were: n=274 4CMenB vaccine (two IM injections of meningococcal group B vaccine 2 months apart at enrolment and at 2 months after randomization) n=270 no vaccine (no meningococcal group B vaccine). In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of first episode of gonorrhea starting at 3 months (58.3/100 py vs. 77.1/100 py; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.01). In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of first episode of rectal gonorrhea (29.7/100 py vs. 33.1/100 py; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.28) No significant difference in the incidence of first episode of culture-positive gonorrhea (14.7/100 py vs. 15.8/100 py; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.65) No significant difference in the incidence of cumulative incidence of gonorrhea (52.6/100 py vs. 62.4/100 py; IRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.07). In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC (4CMenB vaccine) study, the conclusion was: in adult MSM, HIV-negative, with a history of bacterial STIs within the past 12 months, 4CMenB vaccine was not superior to no vaccine with respect to the incidence of first episode of gonorrhea starting at 3 months.

### Evidence-informed provision of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^01d2118f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces the risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among men who have sex with men and transgender women. In the United States, doxy-PEP is in an early stage of integration into clinical practice, and national guidelines for its use were recently released. The goal of this manuscript is to provide practical guidance for clinicians who are considering or currently prescribing doxy-PEP. We address five clinical questions using post hoc analyses of data from the DoxyPEP randomized controlled trial and discuss the potential implications and limitations of each question with the goal of informing clinical practice and implementation of doxy-PEP programs. The questions address patient eligibility criteria for doxy-PEP, the expected benefit and associated doxy-PEP doses for the average patient, the initial number of doses prescribed, and laboratory monitoring of persons taking doxy-PEP.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^bca9f9da]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Also in 2022, the French ANRS DOXYVAC study, which enrolled MSM on HIV PrEP for at least 6 months and who had at least one STI in the 12 months before enrollment, was stopped early because of intervention efficacy. This trial randomly assigned MSM to PEP with doxycycline monohydrate within 24–72 hours of sex (N = 332) or no doxy PEP (N = 170) and then to vaccination with 4CMenB (Bexsero) (N = 257) or no vaccine (N = 245). Participants were followed up to 96 weeks with the primary efficacy endpoint of impact of doxy PEP on time to first episode of syphilis or chlamydia. Initial results demonstrated that doxy PEP was associated with significant reductions in gonorrhea (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.49; 95% CI = 0.32–0.76), chlamydia (aHR: 0.11; 95% CI = 0.04–0.30), and syphilis (aHR: 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09–0.47) (15).

The only trial conducted among cisgender women was an open-label 1:1 randomized trial of doxycycline 200 mg within 72 hours of sex versus standard of care conducted during 2020–2022 in 449 cisgender Kenyan women. It found no significant reduction in bacterial STIs (RR: 0.88; 95% CI = 0.60–1.29), chlamydia (RR: 0.73; 95% CI = 0.47–1.13), or gonorrhea (RR: 1.64; 95% CI = 0.78–3.47) (16). Syphilis efficacy could not be evaluated because there were only two early syphilis infections during the study. Although women assigned to doxy PEP reported event-driven dosing coverage in 78% of weekly surveys, hair studies found that doxycycline was detected in only 29% of participants in the doxycycline arm, suggesting that nonadherence might have been the reason for lack of efficacy; however, additional reasons for lack of efficacy, such as biologic differences, still need to be explored (16, 17).

### Antimicrobial drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infections in men using doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis. A substudy of the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC trial [^70dc3106]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial STI prevention by doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (DoxyPEP) in men who have sex with men (MSM) has raised concerns about antimicrobial drug resistance (AMR). We studied the impact of DoxyPEP on Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) AMR in the ANRS 174 DOXYVAC trial.

Methods

MSM on HIV PrEP randomized to DoxyPEP (n= 362) or no-PEP (n=183) arms were tested for GC at baseline and every three months thereafter, by culture and NAAT. MICs were determined with Etest (Biomerieux) and interpreted according to EUCAST guidelines. We performed whole-genome sequencing and/or PCR sequencing on GC isolates and NAAT-positive samples, using Fisher's exact tests for comparisons.

Results

From January 2021 to February 2023, MICs were determined for 78 GC isolates, and 233 NAAT only GC-positive samples were analysed to identify the molecular determinants of resistance. All GC isolates were resistant to tetracycline with a significant increase in rate of high-level tetracycline resistance mediated by the tetM gene in the DoxyPEP arm than in the no-PEP arm (35.5 vs. 12.5%, respectively p=0.043). The MICs of ceftriaxone, fluoroquinolones and azithromycin were similarly distributed in the DoxyPEP and no-PEP arms. All GC isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefixime, but isolates with decreased susceptibility to cefixime linked to the mosaic penA34.007 allele were more frequent in the DoxyPEP arm than the no-PEP arm (32.3% vs 10.0%, respectively p=0.033).

Conclusions

DoxyPEP use was associated with a significant increase in high-level tetracycline resistance and decreased susceptibility to cefixime in GC. AMR should therefore be closely monitored when using this strategy.

### Postexposure doxycycline to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^4415c737]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among men who have sex with men (MSM) are needed.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, randomized study involving MSM and transgender women who were taking preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PrEP cohort) or living with HIV infection (persons living with HIV infection [PLWH] cohort) and who had had Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea), Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia), or syphilis in the past year. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to take 200 mg of doxycycline within 72 hours after condomless sex (doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis) or receive standard care without doxycycline. STI testing was performed quarterly. The primary end point was the incidence of at least one STI per follow-up quarter.

Results

Of 501 participants (327 in the PrEP cohort and 174 in the PLWH cohort), 67% were White, 7% Black, 11% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 30% Hispanic or Latino. In the PrEP cohort, an STI was diagnosed in 61 of 570 quarterly visits (10.7%) in the doxycycline group and 82 of 257 quarterly visits (31.9%) in the standard-care group, for an absolute difference of -21.2 percentage points and a relative risk of 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.46; P<0.001). In the PLWH cohort, an STI was diagnosed in 36 of 305 quarterly visits (11.8%) in the doxycycline group and 39 of 128 quarterly visits (30.5%) in the standard-care group, for an absolute difference of -18.7 percentage points and a relative risk of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.60; P<0.001). The incidences of the three evaluated STIs were lower with doxycycline than with standard care; in the PrEP cohort, the relative risks were 0.45 (95% CI, 0.32 to 0.65) for gonorrhea, 0.12 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.25) for chlamydia, and 0.13 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.59) for syphilis, and in the PLWH cohort, the relative risks were 0.43 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.71), 0.26 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.57), and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.04 to 1.29), respectively. Five grade 3 adverse events and no serious adverse events were attributed to doxycycline. Of the participants with gonorrhea culture available, tetracycline-resistant gonorrhea occurred in 5 of 13 in the doxycycline groups and 2 of 16 in the standard-care groups.

Conclusions

The combined incidence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis was lower by two thirds with doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis than with standard care, a finding that supports its use among MSM with recent bacterial STIs.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^c9fcb437]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2022, a randomized open-label clinical trial (DoxyPEP) in San Francisco, California, and Seattle, Washington, evaluating 501 MSM and TGW with HIV infection (N = 174) or on HIV PrEP (N = 327) with a history of condomless sex with one or more male partner and one or more STIs during the previous 12 months found that oral doxycycline hyclate 200 mg self-administered ideally within 24 hours but no later than 72 hours after condomless anal, oral, or vaginal sex significantly reduced the incidence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis (14). Reductions were noted in relative risk (RR) of gonorrhea among persons taking HIV PrEP (RR: 0.45; 95% CI = 0.34–0.65) and persons with HIV infection (RR: 0.43; 95% CI = 0.26–0.71); chlamydia (RR: 0.12; 95% CI = 0.05–0.25 and RR: 0.26; 95% CI = 0.12–0.57) and early syphilis (RR: 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03–0.59 and RR: 0.23; 95% CI = 0.04–1.29) also were reduced. The number needed to treat to prevent a quarterly visit with an incident STI was 4.7 in the PrEP cohort and 5.3 in persons living with HIV infection. Participants were advised to take no more than 200 mg of doxycycline every 24 hours. In the intervention arm, 86% reported taking doxycycline always or often and 71% reported never missing doxycycline within 72 hours of condomless sex.

### Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis: awareness, beliefs, and interest among patients with and at risk for HIV [^b0165259]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rates of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the United States (US) have increased 2% from 2018 to 2022. Overall, half of STI cases were diagnosed among young people between the ages of 15 to 24, and STIs disproportionately affect gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (MSM) as well as non-White sub-groups. Associated costs related to the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial STIs account for $1.4 billion in healthcare expenditures annually, underscoring the importance of effective treatment and prevention modalities. Doxycycline is an antibiotic in the tetracycline class that is currently indicated as first-line therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and as alternative therapy for syphilis. Recently, use of doxycycline, given as a single (200 mg), post-exposure dose within 72 h of sexual activity was studied in several randomized clinical trials with promising results. Initially, a small (N = 232) sub-study within the IPERGAY trial in France showed that use of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) among MSM and transgender women (TGW) on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) significantly lowered the incidence of CT (-70%) and syphilis (-73%) but not gonorrhea (GC, -17%) when compared to placebo. Two larger randomized clinical trials, the DoxyPEP (N = 501, MSM/TGW with HIV or on PrEP) and DOXYVAC (N = 502, MSM on PrEP) studies, confirmed these results and also reported significant reductions of GC STIs (risk reduction ranges: CT, 74–89%; GC, 51–57%; syphilis, 77–87%). The dPEP trial in Kenya evaluated the use of doxy-PEP among cisgender women and did not find a significant reduction in the incidence of STIs, however, hair-sample analysis suggested low utilization of doxy-PEP amongst the study population. While results from the DoxyPEP and DOXYVAC trials are encouraging, the implications of doxy-PEP use on the gastrointestinal microbiome, development of antibiotic drug resistance, and behavioral changes in sexual risk avoidance remain potential concerns.

### Doxycycline to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections in the USA: final results from the doxyPEP multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and open-label extension [^68d66ba4]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) is a promising intervention to reduce bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We evaluated the effect of doxy-PEP on STI incidence and antimicrobial resistance in men who have sex with men and transgender women for up to 12 months of follow-up, inlcuding an open-label extension.

Methods

DoxyPEP, an open-label trial in Seattle (WA, USA) and San Francisco (CA, USA) among men who have sex with men and transgender women with at least one bacterial STI in the past year, randomly assigned participants by clinic (with computer-generated variable block sizes) 2:1 to doxy-PEP (200 mg doxycycline delayed-release tablets 24-72 h after condomless sex) or standard care. The independent endpoint adjudication committee was masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was presence of one or more bacterial STIs (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or early syphilis) each quarter. This outcome was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat cohort, which included participants with at least one follow-up quarter (ie, ∼3 months) in their as-randomised assignment. After early termination of the randomised phase for efficacy, all participants still enrolled were offered doxy-PEP in an open-label extension (OLE). We report quarterly incidence of bacterial STIs for the as-randomised and OLE periods. Safety was assessed in all participants with any follow-up data. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03980223) and is completed.

Findings

From Aug 19, 2020, to May 13, 2022, we enrolled 637 participants; 592 participants completed at least one follow-up quarter in the randomised phase (411 in the doxy-PEP group and 181 in the standard-care group) and 282 in the OLE phase (207 in the doxy-PEP group and 82 in the standard-care group). STIs were present in 129 (12·0%) of 1077 quarters in the doxy-PEP group versus 139 (30·5%) of 455 quarters in the standard-care group during the as-randomised period, showing an absolute difference of 19 percentage points and a relative risk of 0·39 (95% CI 0·31-0·49, p<0·0001). During the OLE, STIs were diagnosed in 51 (13%) of 388 quarters among those continuing doxy-PEP and 25 (17%) of 145 quarters among standard-care participants who initiated doxy-PEP. Throughout all quarters for participants on doxy-PEP, there was one grade 2 laboratory abnormality and five grade 3 adverse events that were possibly or probably related to doxy-PEP. No serious adverse events were attributed by site investigators to doxycycline. Of participants with positive gonorrhoea cultures during the study, eight (27%) of 29 taking doxy-PEP versus five (24%) of 21 not taking doxy-PEP had tetracycline resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration ≥2 μg/mL).

Interpretation

Doxy-PEP was effective in reducing bacterial STIs in this population of men who have sex with men and transgender women, including during an open-label extension when doxy-PEP efficacy was known. Doxy-PEP was well tolerated, highly acceptable, and with no new safety signals.

### Urgent need to understand and prevent gonococcal infection: from the laboratory to real-world context [^28314d6a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Several clinical trials of 4CMenB in prevention of gonorrhea are currently underway in countries including the United States, Thailand, Australia, Kenya, and Hong Kong (Figure 3). The first clinical trial to publish results was the National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS) DOXYVAC trial, which assessed the effect of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and 4CMenB against gonorrhea infection in men who have sex with men receiving PReP doxycycline therapy and with a history of an STI in the past 12 months. The results of the study were inconclusive. An interim analysis suggested a reduction in the number of cases of gonorrhea infection with both interventions, and the study was prematurely discontinued on the recommendation of the data and safety management board to offer doxycycline PEP and 4CMenB to all trial participants. However, the final, postaudit analysis of the study reported that vaccine efficacy of 4CMenB against gonorrhea infection did not meet statistical significance (22% [95% confidence interval, −1% to 40%]; P =.061) (Figure 2).

### Efficacy of postexposure prophylaxis with doxycycline (doxy-PEP) in reducing sexually transmitted infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f5c3daa4]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review aimed to identify the efficacy, adherence, safety and impact on antimicrobial resistance of postexposure prophylaxis with doxycycline (Doxy-PEP) in different populations.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from inception to 29 May 2024. Two reviewers independently screened the studies and extracted data. We included randomised clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of Doxy-PEP within 72 hours after condomless sex. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to compare the risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) between Doxy-PEP and no prophylaxis. The risk of bias was assessed with the risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and the certainty of evidence (CoE) with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).

Results

Four studies were included in the systematic review, totalling 1727 participants. Studies were conducted between 2015 and 2022. Most participants (73%) were men who have sex with men, and the median age of participants varied from 24 to 43 years. Doxy-PEP reduced the risk of having any bacterial STI in different populations by 46% (hazard ratio (HR) 0.54; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.75; CoE moderate), the risk of chlamydia by 65% (relative risk (RR) 0.35; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.82; CoE low) and syphilis by 77% (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.41; CoE high), without significant effect for risk of gonorrhoea infection (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.26; CoE very low). The self-reported adherence rate of Doxy-PEP was approximately 80% and one drug-related serious adverse event was reported.

Conclusion

Doxy-PEP reduced the incidence of chlamydia and syphilis infections. No significant reduction in gonorrhoea infection was observed. This strategy seems promising for some high-risk groups; however, there is still a lack of information on the induction of bacterial resistance and long-term adverse events.

Table 1. 
Key Characteristics of Completed Studies on Doxycycline Prophylaxis for Sexually Transmitted Infections

An open-label extension of the French national HIV research agency (France Recherche Nord & sud Sida-hiv hépatites [ANRS]) Intervention Préventive de l’Exposition aux Risques avec et pour les Gays (IPERGAY) HIV-prevention study continued participant access to HIV PrEP and examined doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (Doxy PEP) in MSM and transgender women without HIV. Participants (n = 232) were randomly assigned 1:1 to the intervention—doxycycline 200 mg within 24–72 hours of condomless sexual encounters up to 3 times per week—or to no prophylaxis. Those taking Doxy PEP had lower STI incidence (hazard ratio, 0.57; P =.014). Chlamydia trachomatis and syphilis diagnoses were significantly lower in the intervention arm, with a relative reduction of 70–73% in the intention-to-treat analysis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae diagnoses did not differ except for fewer urethral cases in those using Doxy PEP. Four of 9 NG-positive cultures, all from the control arm, had high-level tetracycline resistance consistent with the French background rate. Eighty-two percent (n = 31) of participants with NG detected by nucleic acid amplification testing had genotypic markers of tetracycline resistance; there was no difference between study arms (P =.4). All CT culture isolates (n = 5) were doxycycline susceptible. Adherence was high in the Doxy PEP arm; 63% had doxycycline detected in at least 1 plasma specimen. Twenty-nine (21.5%) Doxy PEP patients discontinued doxycycline, 8 for gastrointestinal side effects. Sexual behaviors did not generally differ between the 2 groups.

While not direct clinical evidence, a modeling study examining the impact of Doxy PrEP on syphilis among Australian MSM estimated that if 50% of MSM used Doxy PrEP and it was 70% effective syphilis would decrease by 50% after 12 months and 85% after 10 years. The authors predicted a similar effect if only 50% of men with more than 20 partners in 6 months were taking doxycycline.

### Postexposure doxycycline to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^e6707844]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study DoxyPEP was published by Anne F Luetkemeyer and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis infection, Syphilis and Gonococcal urethritis. In the DoxyPEP study, the trial question was: what is the role of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis among MSM and transgender women with recent bacterial STIs? In the DoxyPEP study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the DoxyPEP study, the population was: 501 patients (19 female, 482 male). The inclusion criteria were MSM and transgender women with bacterial STIs in the previous 12 months. The key exclusion criteria were tetracycline allergy; receipt of medications with drug interactions with doxycycline; plan for receipt of doxycycline for an extended period. In the DoxyPEP study, the interventions were: n=339 doxycycline (at a dose of 200 mg within 72 hours of condomless sex) n=162 standard care (standard of care without the use of doxycycline). In the DoxyPEP study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in any STIs per follow-up quarter, in pre-exposure prophylaxis cohort (10.7% vs. 31.9%; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.46). In the DoxyPEP study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in STIs per follow-up quarter, in persons living with HIV infection cohort (11.8% vs. 30.5%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.6) Significant decrease in gonorrhea infection in pre-exposure prophylaxis cohort (9.1% vs. 20.2%; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.65) Significant decrease in Chlamydia infection in pre-exposure prophylaxis cohort (1.4% vs. 12.1%; RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.25). In the DoxyPEP study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the DoxyPEP study, the conclusion was: in MSM and transgender women with bacterial STIs in the previous 12 months, doxycycline was superior to standard care with respect to any STIs per follow-up quarter, in pre-exposure prophylaxis cohort.

### Impact of doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) for sexually transmitted infections on the microbiome of men who have sex with men on HIV PrEP [^7799828a]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) has shown potential in preventing bacterial sexually transmitted infections, but the impact on the microbiome is unknown. This study assessed rectal microbiome changes over 48 weeks in 41 participants on HIV PrEP (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) enrolled in an open-label, randomized pilot trial comparing immediate (100mg PO daily started immediately and continued to week 48) versus deferred doxyPrEP (100mg PO daily starting at week 24, continued to week 48) in HIV-negative gay and bisexual men (Clinical Trial #: NCT02844634). Primary study outcomes included feasibility, adherence, and tolerability of the dual PrEP regimen, while exploratory outcomes included rectal microbiome changes. We performed 16S rRNA sequencing from participants that collected baseline, week 24, and week 48 samples. Microbial composition did not significantly change over time in either study arm as measured by individual taxa levels, or alpha and beta diversity at the genus level. A slight decrease (<10%) in alpha diversity was observed at the phylum level in the immediate arm, but not the deferred arm. This study shows doxyPrEP use results in minimal compositional changes in the microbiome over 12 months. Further research is needed to explore the impact of doxycycline for STI prevention on microbiome function and antimicrobial resistance.

### Filling in the gaps: updates on doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^035951ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past two decades, cases of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia have been rising in the United States, disproportionately among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), as well as racial and ethnic minorities of all genders. In this review, we address updates about the evidence on doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) for prevention of bacterial STIs, including efficacy, safety, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), acceptability, modeling population impact, and evolving guidelines for use. Equitable implementation of doxy-PEP will require evaluation of who is offered and initiates it, understanding patterns of use and longer-term STI incidence and AMR, provider training, and tailored community education.

### Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis: awareness, beliefs, and interest among patients with and at risk for HIV [^7e7d21d8]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

This promising data on the efficacy of doxy-PEP led health departments and other agencies across the U.S. to devise protocols regarding the use of doxy-PEP in people at risk for bacterial STIs. Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published considerations regarding the use of doxy-PEP for STI prevention. These protocols and guidelines have helped providers identify priority populations and provide guidance regarding appropriate monitoring of patients while on doxy-PEP and are critical given recent studies have shown that up to 10% of MSM are taking antibacterial STI prophylaxis without guidance. Additional data regarding patient knowledge, beliefs and perspectives of doxy-PEP is needed to help inform providers, health educators, and policy makers as doxy-PEP is implemented in real-world settings. We conducted a cross-sectional, single-cohort survey study to assess patient awareness, beliefs, interest in, use patterns, and concerns of doxy-PEP, and anticipated effects of doxy-PEP access on sexual risk practices.

KNOWLEDGE GAPS AND CHALLENGES

While the studies described above help address some of the knowledge gaps around Doxy PEP/PrEP, there remain multiple areas for further research, particularly around efficacy and potential benefits and harms.

Quality of the Evidence

Efficacy

Studies on Doxy PEP/PrEP used 2 doxycycline dose/regimen options: 100 mg daily or 200 mg single-dose post–condomless sex event. Investigators selected those regimens from experience with doxycycline prophylaxis in other infectious diseases and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of TP. The efficacy of doxycycline for pre- or postexposure prophylaxis has yet to be definitively determined. While the 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to date had similar levels of efficacy (~70%), the estimated effect sizes were imprecise because of modest sample sizes. Additionally, it is unknown which specific sex acts were protected. Studies underway will lead to more precise measures of overall efficacy and efficacy for specific sexual behaviors. Those measures are important to inform clinical decision making, cost-effectiveness analyses, community education, and patient counseling.

Population of Focus

Public health experts have long promoted controlling STIs in a core population of individuals with a high number of sexual contacts as an approach to reduce STIs in the general population. Modeling based on Australian parameters suggests that focusing on MSM with higher numbers of sex partners (>20 partners in 6 months) would be almost as effective as broader Doxy PrEP use. Current and planned studies have generally focused on MSM at higher risk of STIs and/or HIV infection, but criteria vary and sample sizes may not be sufficient to stratify results for subpopulations with more elevated risk. Additional modeling studies or pooled analyses may be useful to identify the characteristics of populations most suitable for maximizing the impact of doxycycline prophylaxis.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^1092a407]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been increasing over the past 2 decades in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. With the widespread use of early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, which virtually eliminates transmission risk, and the availability of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, there have been attitudinal changes regarding HIV infection with resultant increases in sexual contact and declines in condom use. Doxycycline is used for primary prophylaxis in a number of infectious diseases. We conducted a state-of-the-art review to examine the current state of research, knowledge gaps, and challenges around the use of doxycycline prophylaxis to prevent syphilis and other STIs. International academic and government experts met in March 2019 to frame the initial inquiry, which was supplemented by focused literature searches. Two small short-term randomized controlled trials examining doxycycline prophylaxis found high efficacy. Five additional clinical studies are underway or in development. Studies differed in design, population, outcomes, and safety measures. Doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial STIs shows promise. Better and more robust data are needed on efficacy; target population; community acceptability; behavioral risk compensation; doxycycline dose, regimen, and formulation; long-term safety; antimicrobial resistance; cost-effectiveness; and risk–benefit.

### Bacterial sexually transmitted infections and related antibiotic use among individuals eligible for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States [^dcd3e64c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a substantial burden due to their prevalence and potential sequelae. In the United States (US), >2.4 million gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis cases were reported in 2023, and the number of reported syphilis cases was 80% higher than in 2018. Young people, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women (TGW), and people living with HIV (PLWH) experience disproportionate STI burden,.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for prevention of bacterial STIs among certain populations in 2024 on the basis of shared clinical decision-making between patients and their healthcare providers. These recommendations encompass MSM and TGW who were diagnosed with a bacterial STI in the preceding 12 months. Doxycycline is typically well-tolerated and used for many acute bacterial infections. Longer-term courses are also prescribed for malaria prophylaxis and for skin conditions, including moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne. DoxyPEP consists of 200 mg doxycycline taken orally within 72 h (and ideally <24 h) after sex. Recent trials have demonstrated that doxyPEP reduces the incidence of chlamydia and syphilis infections among MSM, TGW, and PLWH by approximately 70% –. Results were less promising for gonorrhea infections, with efficacy estimates spanning 17% in a French trialto 55% in a US trial.

### Impact of doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) for sexually transmitted infections on the microbiome of men who have sex with men on HIV PrEP [^0629051f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, we show that doxycycline 100 mg daily as doxyPrEP does not have a major effect on gut microbiome composition over a period of 48 weeks, supporting the safety profile of doxycycline for PrEP. These data are important to advance our understanding of how doxyPrEP interventions may impact the human microbiome. Further research and monitoring of the impact of doxyPrEP on the gut microbiome and antimicrobial resistance are warranted to guide the safe implementation of doxyPrEP for STI prevention.

Potential Harms from Doxycycline

Clinical Adverse Events in Doxy PEP Trials

Three clinical trials of doxy PEP were found that reported on adverse events (13 – 15). In the IPERGAY study, gastrointestinal side effects were more commonly reported in the PEP group (53% versus 41%; p = 0.05) (13). In the DoxyPEP study, one grade 2 laboratory abnormality and five grade 3 adverse events occurred that were possibly or probably related to doxycycline. No serious adverse events were attributed to doxycycline. The observed difference in mean absolute annualized weight change adjusted for baseline weight was not statistically significant between the two groups. Eighteen participants discontinued the study early; five in the doxy PEP arm discontinued the medication because of intolerance or patient preference and 13 in the standard of care arm, including six who discontinued so that they could take doxy PEP outside of the study (14). In the DOXYVAC study, three persons (0.9%) discontinued doxy PEP because of gastrointestinal adverse events (n = 2) or fear of adverse events (n = 1) (15).

Clinical Adverse Events from Other Uses of Doxycycline

To further examine data on daily longer-term (≥8 weeks) doxycycline use, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted (18). A total of 67 articles published during 1987–2022 were included in the review on clinical adverse events; half of the studies included doxycycline use for acne treatment (N = 13), malaria prophylaxis (N = 11), and rosacea treatment (N = 14). A meta-analysis conducted by CDC included 18 studies that enrolled generally healthy persons and that also had a placebo arm to evaluate any adverse events between participants in the doxycycline group versus the no doxycycline (placebo) group. The meta-analysis found an increased risk for persons on daily doxycycline experiencing gastrointestinal or dermatological adverse events compared with placebo. No significant differences were observed for any, severe, or neurologic adverse events. Participants were more likely to be unenrolled from clinical trials because of adverse events in the doxycycline group compared with the placebo group. Serious side effects were rare.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for sexually transmitted infections—efficacy, resistance, and use recommendations are detailed as follows: The final analysis confirmed preventative effects of doxyPEP against first episodes of chlamydia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.14; 95% CI, .09–.23; P < .0001), syphilis (aHR, 0.21; 95% CI, .11–.41; P < .001), and gonorrhea (aHR, 0.67; 95% CI, .52–.87; P = .003). Consistent with local epidemiology, high-level tetracycline resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration > 8 mg/L) was more common in incident samples from the doxyPEP arm than the control arm (36% vs 13%). In a randomized, open-label trial among transgender women and men who have sex with men in Kenya, there was no difference between the doxyPEP arm and the standard-of-care arm in the incidence of chlamydia or gonorrhea, and in a subset of the doxyPEP arm, doxycycline was present in only 29% of hair samples, while high-level tetracycline resistance was seen in 100% of gonorrhea samples identified at baseline and at study end. DoxyPEP is recommended for cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with cisgender men and for transgender women who have a history of at least 1 diagnosis of syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea within the last 12 months or who anticipate sexual activities associated with increased likelihood of STI acquisition; no recommendations can be made at this time for cisgender women, cisgender heterosexual men, transgender men, and other gender-diverse persons, and use in these populations should be based on shared decision-making. Those who receive doxyPEP should continue to receive routine screening for asymptomatic STIs and ongoing evaluation of the need for continuing doxyPEP, and the main concern for doxyPEP implementation is the risk of antimicrobial resistance; providing doxyPEP to all PrEP users or people with HIV prevented more STIs but was less efficient and exposed more people to doxycycline (higher number needed to treat to prevent 1 STI).

### Impact of doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) for sexually transmitted infections on the microbiome of men who have sex with men on HIV PrEP [^85c1306e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Globally, sexually transmitted infections (STI) continue to increase significantly, notably the bacterial STIs syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea. STIs often disproportionately burden key populations, including gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM), along with transgender women. Three recent clinical trials in GBM and transgender women have demonstrated the efficacy of doxycycline taken as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for STI prevention (when compared to standard of care), demonstrating an overall reduction in incidence ~70% –. Subsequent analyses of ‘real-world’ doxyPEP use have demonstrated reductions in chlamydia and syphilis of 50–80%, with no to modest reductions in gonorrhea,. Daily doxycycline taken as STI pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) has also shown promise for STI prevention, though these were smaller pilot studies with small participant numbers –. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that has been in use since the 1960s, and is safe, inexpensive, generally well-tolerated, and is a recommended treatment for both syphilis and chlamydia. DoxyPEP and doxyPrEP represent a tremendous advancement in STI prevention, and based on the clinical trial data, doxyPEP is already being formally recommended by various organizations, with formal guidelines published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Though doxyPEP remains the intervention with more evidence for STI prevention, clinical trials examining doxyPrEP have been ongoing for a decade, demonstrating promising efficacy data as well –. Both interventions are currently being compared in a large, multi-center Canadian non-inferiority clinical trial (NCT04762134), which will comparatively examine efficacy, tolerability, and preferences. As with HIV PrEP, where the concept of choice between different modalities (e.g. daily vs. on-demand; oral vs. injectable) is key to uptake, adherence and ultimately efficacy, the same can likely be said about doxycycline for STI prevention. Additionally, one cannot assume that one will necessarily be preferred over the other by patients, as evidenced by previous work demonstrating high acceptability of both doxyPEP and doxyPrEP among GBM, and the ongoing uncertainty around comparative tolerability and acceptability between doxyPEP and doxyPrEP.

Prevention of sexually transmitted infections—evidence summary for doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP): Some individuals with recurrent STIs may benefit from doxyPEP, defined as a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg taken as soon as possible after sex but no later than 72 hours afterward, with a maximum dose of 200 mg within 24 hours; the randomized, open-label DoxyPEP trial in Seattle and San Francisco included 630 cisgender gay and bisexual men and transgender women and reported relative risks for syphilis (RR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.04–1.29), chlamydia (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, .12–.57), and gonorrhea (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, .26–.71); in the PrEP cohort, RRs were 0.45 (95% CI, .32–.65) for gonorrhea, 0.12 (95% CI, .05–.25) for chlamydia, and 0.13 (95% CI, .03–.59) for syphilis; in the cohort of people with HIV, RRs were 0.43 (95% CI, .26–.71) for gonorrhea, 0.26 (.12–.57) for chlamydia, and 0.23 (95% CI, .04–1.29) for syphilis; antimicrobial resistance findings were inconclusive, though 6 of 20 incident gonorrhea isolates in the doxycycline arm displayed tetracycline resistance.

### Impact of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections on the gut microbiome and antimicrobial resistome [^3e06e663]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) reduces bacterial sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Although poised for widespread clinical implementation, the impact of doxy-PEP on antimicrobial resistance remains a primary concern as its effects on the gut microbiome and resistome, or the antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) present in the gut microbiome, are unknown. To investigate these effects, we studied participants from the DoxyPEP trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing doxy-PEP use, a one-time doxycycline 200-mg dose taken after condomless sex (DP arm, n = 100), to standard of care (SOC arm, n = 50) among men who have sex with men and transgender women. From self-collected rectal swabs at enrollment (day-0) and after 6 months (month-6), we performed metagenomic DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) or metatranscriptomic RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). DNA-seq data were analyzable from 127 samples derived from 89 participants, and RNA-seq data were analyzable from 86 samples derived from 70 participants. We compared the bacterial microbiome and resistome between the two study arms and over time. The median number of doxycycline doses taken since enrollment by participants with DNA-seq data was zero (interquartile range (IQR): 0–7 doses) for the SOC arm and 42 (IQR: 27–64 doses) for the DP arm. Tetracycline ARGs were detected in all day-0 DNA-seq samples and in 85% of day-0 RNA-seq samples. The proportional mass of tetracycline ARGs in the resistome increased between day-0 and month-6 in DP participants from 46% to 51% in the metagenome (P = 2.3 × 10 −2) and from 4% to 15% in the metatranscriptome (P = 4.5 × 10 −6), but no statistically significant increases in other ARG classes were observed. Exposure to a higher number of doxycycline doses correlated with proportional enrichment of tetracycline ARGs in the metagenome (Spearman’s ρ = 0.23, P = 9.0 × 10 −3) and metatranscriptome (Spearman’s ρ = 0.55, P = 3.7 × 10 −8). Bacterial microbiome alpha diversity, beta diversity and total bacterial mass did not differ between day-0 and month-6 samples from DP participants when assessed by either DNA-seq or RNA-seq. In an abundance-based correlation analysis, we observed an increase over time in the strength of the correlation between tetracycline ARGs and specific bacterial taxa, including some common human pathogens. In sum, doxy-PEP use over a 6-month period was associated with an increase in the proportion of tetracycline ARGs comprising the gut resistome and an increase in the expression of tetracycline ARGs. At 6 months of doxy-PEP use, no residual differences were observed in alpha and beta diversity or taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome. As doxy-PEP is implemented as a public health strategy, further studies and population-level surveillance of doxycycline-resistant pathogens are needed to understand the implications of these findings.

STUDIES UNDERWAY OR IN DEVELOPMENT

The meeting participants discussed 5 studies underway or in development on Doxy PEP/PrEP (Table 2). A pilot study, the Dual Daily HIV and Syphilis PrEP (DuDHS) Study in Canada, is examining concurrent daily HIV PrEP and Doxy PrEP in MSM without HIV. The study will randomize 50 participants 1:1 to immediate Doxy PrEP versus delayed initiation after 6 months; all participants will receive 1 year of HIV PrEP. The primary objective is to examine the acceptability, adherence, and tolerability of daily HIV PrEP and Doxy PrEP. The study will also evaluate STI incidence, sexual behavior, tetracycline-class bacterial resistance through culture of the oropharynx and nares, and an evaluation of the rectal microbiome. As of March 2019, investigators have not detected any STIs in the patients receiving Doxy PrEP in contrast to 3 patients with rectal CT in the delayed arm. No serious adverse events have occurred, although participants in the treatment arm have reported more nausea. The Daily Doxycycline in HIV+ for Syphilis PrEP (DaDHS) Study is examining Doxy PrEP in MSM living with HIV; 52 participants with a prior history of syphilis will be randomized 1:1 to daily doxycycline 100 mg or placebo.

Table 2. 
Key Characteristics of Studies in Progress or Development on Doxycycline Prophylaxis for Sexually Transmitted Infections, March 2019

The Syphilaxis Study in Australia will be a single-arm study of Doxy PrEP in 350 MSM and transgender persons reporting recent sex with men. MSM with a history of regular STI testing are eligible if they are living with HIV or do not have HIV and are using HIV PrEP. The study will use medical records to measure before–after frequencies of STI diagnoses and an existing STI surveillance database to compare frequencies between study participants and unenrolled MSM. Participants will record doxycycline use daily and complete quarterly questionnaires. The primary goals are to measure acceptability of daily doxycycline and effectiveness in preventing syphilis, NG, and CT.

In France, a substudy within the large ANRS Prevenir PrEP cohort (n = 3000) will use a randomized, open-label, factorial design to examine the efficacy of meningococcal type B vaccine in preventing NG infection and the use of Doxy PEP 200 mg to prevent chlamydia and syphilis in participants with a prior STI diagnosis in the past 18 months. Seven hundred participants will be randomized 2:1 to Doxy PEP or no PEP and 1:1 to meningococcal type B vaccine or no vaccine.

Identifying Populations that Would Benefit Most from Doxy PEP

The goal of doxy PEP is for persons who would benefit most to have access to the intervention while minimizing antimicrobial use. Data from the DoxyPEP study indicate that persons in the study took, on average, an additional 43 doses of doxycycline to prevent an average of 1.3 bacterial STIs annually. Other studies have found that among MSM taking HIV PrEP, a subset of persons account for the majority of bacterial STIs. For example, in one study of 2,981 MSM, 25% of persons accounted for 76% of bacterial STIs (25). Although models indicate that a substantial number of MSM would need to use STI PEP or PrEP for population-level effectiveness, this effect would be most pronounced if focused on subpopulations with higher likelihood of STIs (26) compared with the broader MSM and TGW population (27, 28). In a cohort of MSM and TGW and nonbinary persons assigned male sex at birth, prescribing doxy PEP for 12 months after an STI diagnosis was the most efficient strategy, averting 42% of STIs with the number needed to treat for 1 year to avert any STI of 2.2 (29).

### Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Belgium: awareness, use and antimicrobial resistance concerns in a cross-sectional online survey [^e21ed9b7]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) in reducing the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men who have sex with men (MSM).In these RCTs, doxyPEP reduced the incidence of Chlamydia trachomatis by 70%–88% and syphilis by 73%–87%.The efficacy of doxyPEP on the incidence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is less clear, with some studies demonstrating a reduction in NG cases, whereas others found no effect on incidence.The main concerns related to doxyPEP use are that it could induce resistance to tetracyclines and other antimicrobials in NG and other bacteria and could lead to deleterious alterations in the resistome and microbiome.For these reasons, while some guidelines promote the use of doxyPEP in MSM, others advised against it.

There are reports of informal use of antibiotics for STI prevention in countries where doxyPEP is not currently recommended. For instance, in 2020, it has been shown that 2%–10% of MSM reported using doxyPEP in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia.In Belgium, we found that about 3.2% of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users reported having ever taken antibiotics preventatively for bacterial STIs in 2022.While the use seemed rather limited, the awareness of such practices was high, with about one-third of PrEP users having heard of doxyPEP and one-tenth knowing someone who currently used doxyPEP.DoxyPEP has also gained a lot of attention in the past year, following the publication of the results of several doxyPEP RCTs and its roll-out in San Francisco.We, therefore, hypothesised that the awareness and use of doxyPEP in Belgium have increased since 2022.

We aimed to assess the awareness, willingness to use and use of doxyPEP among MSM and transgender women (TGW) in Belgium in 2024. Moreover, we aimed to assess sociodemographic factors and sexual behaviours associated with doxyPEP use and concerns regarding the effect of doxyPEP on antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

### Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis and bacterial sexually transmitted infections among individuals using HIV preexposure prophylaxis [^68cf4e1f]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the receipt of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) associated with declines in incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) outside of clinical trials?

Findings

In this cohort study of 11 551 individuals (95.1% male) receiving HIV preexposure prophylaxis in an integrated health system in California, 2253 were dispensed doxyPEP. Among doxyPEP recipients, quarterly STI positivity significantly declined from before to after starting doxyPEP by 79% for chlamydia, 80% for syphilis, and 12% for gonorrhea.

Meaning

These findings suggest that doxyPEP may offer substantial benefits for decreasing population-level STI transmission with broader implementation.

Impact of doxy-PEP on Sexual Behavior

Respondents generally believed that doxy-PEP would impact sexual behavior. Most respondents (88%) believed doxy-PEP would increase condomless sex and/or number of sexual partners among respondents’ or others within the broader community (Fig. 5 A). While 48% of respondents believed they would partake in more condomless sex or have a greater number of sexual partners due to a doxy-PEP prescription, most respondents (88%) thought that doxy-PEP would lead to an increase in condomless sex and/or the number of sexual partners for others in the broader community (Fig. 5 B).

### Beyond behavioural change: prioritising structural solutions to control bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^5c5278d9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Another trial with a similar design was conducted among young women using oral HIV PrEP in Kenya but did not show any significant impact of DoxyPEP on incidence of STIs.However, there was only a single case of syphilis in these women, all strains of N. gonorrhoeae in both arms were highly resistant to doxycycline, and importantly adherence to doxyPEP was low, with only 29% of visits among women randomized to the DoxyPEP arm with doxycycline detected in hair samples (consistent with drug intake in the previous month). So the results of this trial cannot dismiss the efficacy of DoxyPEP in women, which is plausible according to a pharmacokinetics study demonstrating high (above bacterial MICs) and prolonged (2–4 days) concentrations of doxycycline in blood, urine, vaginal and cervical swabs and biopsies in women following a single dose of 200 mg of doxycycline.In addition, a small study conducted among female sex workers in Japan reported an overall reduction of STIs with daily doxycycline prophylaxis suggesting that DoxyPEP might also be effective in this community.More data is needed in cis-women given the substantial burden of bacterial STIs by individuals of reproductive potential and the consequences on pregnancy and infant outcomes. A trial in the US (ATN 173) will evaluate post-exposure and weekly dosing among adolescents and young people assigned female at birth.

### Potential impact of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis prescribing strategies on incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^a3cc4973]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) reduces bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence in people with HIV (PWH) or using HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Given concerns about widespread antibiotic use, we identified doxyPEP prescribing strategies to minimize use while maximizing impact on STIs.

Methods

We used electronic health records of gay and bisexual men (GBM), transgender women, and non-binary people assigned male sex at birth with ≥2 STI tests (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) at an LGBTQ-focused health center during 2015-2020. We defined 10 hypothetical doxyPEP prescribing strategies based on PrEP use, HIV status, or STI history. We estimated doxyPEP use and STI diagnoses averted in counterfactual scenarios in which people meeting prescribing criteria received doxyPEP, assuming STI rates during use would have been reduced by clinical trial efficacy estimates.

Results

Among 10,546 individuals (94% GBM), rate of any STI was 35.9/100 person-years. Prescribing doxyPEP to all individuals would have averted 71% of STI diagnoses (number needed to treat for one year to avert one STI diagnosis, NNT=3.9); prescribing to PrEP users/PWH (52%/12% of individuals) would have averted 60% of STI diagnoses (NNT=2.9). Prescribing doxyPEP for 12 months after STI diagnosis would have reduced the proportion using doxyPEP to 38% and averted 39% of STI diagnoses (NNT=2.4). Prescribing after concurrent or repeated STIs would have maximized efficiency (lowest NNTs) but prevented fewer STIs.

Conclusions

Prescribing doxyPEP to individuals with STIs, particularly concurrent or repeated STIs, could avert a substantial proportion of all STI diagnoses. The most efficient prescribing strategies are based on STI history rather than HIV status or PrEP use.

Discussion

We found that about one in ten MSM in Belgium has ever used doxyPEP, with a majority of these individuals having used it in the prior 6 months. DoxyPEP use was associated with reporting STIs in the preceding year, living with HIV or taking PrEP, and having engaged in chemsex in the preceding 6 months. Willingness to use doxyPEP was high but decreased after presenting information about the potential effects of doxyPEP on AMR while concerns of doxyPEP side effects increased after presenting information about the potential effects of doxyPEP on AMR.

Our finding that approximately 10% of MSM in Belgium have used doxyPEP is consistent with previous studies. Surveys in the UK and Australia found that 9% and 10% of PrEP users were already using doxyPEP, respectively, despite not being formally recommended at the time.In Belgium in 2022, we found that 3.2% of PrEP users were using antibiotics for STI prevention and 28.9% had heard of it.These proportions seem to have increased, although careful consideration should be taken when comparing studies with different sampling methodologies, timeframes and study populations. The publication of doxyPEP RCT results and its implementation in San Francisco may have increased awareness and informal use among MSM. Some participants in our study reported learning about doxyPEP through international friends or organisations, supporting this hypothesis. Furthermore, other European countries recently reported similar levels of informal doxyPEP use.

### Impact of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections on the gut microbiome and antimicrobial resistome [^b4098005]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) is highly efficacious in preventing bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in randomized, controlled clinical trials among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women living with HIV or on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection –. This new public health strategy has been incorporated into guidelines for STI prevention for MSM and transgender women by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with World Health Organization guidelinesin process. Widespread implementation of doxy-PEP among all MSM and transgender women could increase doxycycline consumption substantially, with high-end estimates of as much as 3.36 million doses per month in the United States. As such, a primary outstanding concern is the potential for doxy-PEP to select for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and adversely impact the human microbiome –.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health challenge that complicates the management of infectious diseases. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both human healthcare and agriculture are major contributors to this problem –. Multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can be resistant to all first line antimicrobial treatments, has been increasing in prevalence and has been labeled as an urgent threat by the US CDC –. Given this, there are concerns that doxy-PEP implementation may lead to increased tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae, which may be less susceptible to doxy-PEP; to co-selection for beta-lactam resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, which is currently the first-line antibiotic treatment; and to selection for antimicrobial resistance in commensal organisms as well as disease-causing pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus.

### Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis and bacterial sexually transmitted infections among individuals using HIV preexposure prophylaxis [^a67f589c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In recent clinical trials, 200-mg doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) taken within 72 hours of sex has been shown to reduce the risk of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs)—specifically chlamydia and syphilis, with mixed results for gonorrhea—among people assigned male sex at birth and either living with HIV or using HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In October 2022, San Francisco, California, became the first US jurisdiction to issue guidance on doxyPEP provision.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released clinical guidelines in June 2024 recommending that clinicians counsel all gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and transgender women with a bacterial STI diagnosis in the past 12 months about doxyPEP and offer doxyPEP through shared decision-making.Evidence of the prevention benefits of doxyPEP in clinical practice may help support implementation.

In this study, we describe scale-up of doxyPEP among HIV PrEP users in a large health care system in California. We had 3 objectives: (1) describe doxyPEP uptake, including characteristics of early adopters and patterns of use; (2) evaluate changes in bacterial STI incidence and testing from before to after doxyPEP initiation among doxyPEP recipients; and (3) compare trends in STI incidence before and after doxyPEP implementation between individuals dispensed and not dispensed doxyPEP.

### Impact of doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) for sexually transmitted infections on the microbiome of men who have sex with men on HIV PrEP [^fed0b3b2]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Though work is currently ongoing in the abovementioned doxyPEP clinical trials to characterize microbiome changes in study participants, to our knowledge, there is no published data on microbiome impacts from doxycycline prophylaxis used for STI prevention. As the broader rollout of doxyPEP occurs, and as alternative doxycycline-based STI prevention options like doxyPrEP are explored, it is critical that these yet-unknown impacts are further characterized in order to better inform the appropriate implementation of these novel prevention tools. Studying microbiome changes with doxyPrEP could be further informative for doxyPEP strategies, as it provides additional, longer-term data on potential impacts of doxycycline that differ in dosing levels and dosing frequency.

In this study, we systematically characterize the compositional microbiome of participants on HIV PrEP enrolled in a previously publisheddoxycycline PrEP study over a 48-week study period. Here we show minimal changes in the rectal microbiome composition of study participants using doxyPrEP over 12 months.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in people with HIV—In a pilot study, 30 MSM with HIV with previous syphilis were randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg daily for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention; doxycycline was associated with a lower incidence of syphilis, but this did not reach statistical significance due to small sample size. Post-exposure prophylaxis (doxycycline 200 mg after unprotected anal sex) has been studied among MSM and transgender women, with a reduction in incident syphilis by 73%. Several recent randomized open-label clinical trials have found that doxycycline 200 mg after condomless sex among MSM or transgender women with HIV or on HIV PrEP significantly reduced chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis acquisition; however, a randomized trial of cisgender women on HIV PrEP administered doxycycline 200 mg within 72 hours after sex did not reduce chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis acquisition. There is ongoing evaluation regarding the potential impact of STI postexposure prophylaxis on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome, and other studies are underway or in development regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial STIs.

Recommendations

Rationale

Because of increasing rates of bacterial STIs and the reported high efficacy for the reduction of STIs in the reviewed clinical trials, the potential benefits of doxy PEP are notable. Systematic reviews of potential harms appear low in the short-term and unknown but potentially concerning in the long-term. Overall, the intervention appears feasible and acceptable and will require a focused effort for equitable implementation. In considering all of these issues, and in review of studies of populations who would likely benefit most from an intervention to reduce bacterial STIs balancing efficacy and the risk for antimicrobial resistance, the following considerations are recommended.

Populations

CDC recommends that providers should counsel gay, bisexual, and other MSM and TGW with a history of at least one bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) during the past 12 months about the benefits and harms of using doxy PEP (Box 1). Although not directly assessed in the trials included in these guidelines, doxy PEP could be discussed, using a shared decision-making approach, with MSM and TGW who have not had a bacterial STI diagnosed during the previous year but will be participating in sexual activities that are known to increase the likelihood of exposure to STIs. Although the pharmacokinetics of doxycycline and experience in treating bacterial STIs suggest that doxy PEP should be effective in other populations, clinical data to support doxy PEP in other populations (i.e. cisgender women, cisgender heterosexual men, transgender men, and other queer and nonbinary persons assigned female at birth) are limited. As a result, providers should use their clinical judgement and shared decision-making to inform use of doxy PEP with populations that are not part of CDC recommendations.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis to prevent sexually transmitted infections in women [^b1e4d464]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been shown to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among cisgender men and transgender women, but data from trials involving cisgender women are lacking.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, open-label trial comparing doxycycline PEP (doxycycline hyclate, 200 mg taken within 72 hours after condomless sex) with standard care among Kenyan women 18 to 30 years of age who were receiving preexposure prophylaxis against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The primary end point was any incident infection with Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , or Treponema pallidum . Hair samples were collected quarterly for objective assessment of doxycycline use.

Results

A total of 449 participants underwent randomization; 224 were assigned to the doxycycline-PEP group and 225 to the standard-care group. Participants were followed quarterly over 12 months. A total of 109 incident STIs occurred (50 in the doxycycline-PEP group [25.1 per 100 person-years] and 59 in the standard-care group [29.0 per 100 person-years]), with no significant between-group difference in incidence (relative risk, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.29; P=0.51). Among the 109 incident STIs, chlamydia accounted for 85 (78.0%) (35 in the doxycycline-PEP group and 50 in the standard-care group; relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.13). No serious adverse events were considered by the trial investigators to be related to doxycycline, and there were no incident HIV infections. Among 50 randomly selected participants in the doxycycline-PEP group, doxycycline was detected in 58 of 200 hair samples (29.0%). All N. gonorrhoeae -positive isolates were resistant to doxycycline.

Conclusions

Among cisgender women, the incidence of STIs was not significantly lower with doxycycline PEP than with standard care. According to hair-sample analysis, the use of doxycycline PEP among those assigned to receive it was low. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; dPEP ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04050540.).

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^b3039634]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

No vaccines and few chemoprophylaxis options exist for the prevention of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea). These infections have increased in the United States and disproportionately affect gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). In three large randomized controlled trials, 200 mg of doxycycline taken within 72 hours after sex has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by >70% and gonococcal infections by approximately 50%.

This report outlines CDC’s recommendation for the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxy PEP), a novel, ongoing, patient-managed biomedical STI prevention strategy for a selected population. CDC recommends that MSM and TGW who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) diagnosed in the past 12 months should receive counseling that doxy PEP can be used as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Following shared decision-making with their provider, CDC recommends that providers offer persons in this group a prescription for doxy PEP to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex. The recommended dose of doxy PEP is 200 mg and should not exceed a maximum dose of 200 mg every 24 hours.

Doxy PEP, when offered, should be implemented in the context of a comprehensive sexual health approach, including risk reduction counseling, STI screening and treatment, recommended vaccination and linkage to HIV PrEP, HIV care, or other services as appropriate. Persons who are prescribed doxy PEP should undergo bacterial STI testing at anatomic sites of exposure at baseline and every 3–6 months thereafter. Ongoing need for doxy PEP should be assessed every 3–6 months as well. HIV screening should be performed for HIV-negative MSM and TGW according to current recommendations.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^9d43d264]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention—doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP): DoxyPEP (doxycycline [200 mg]) is recommended within 72 hours after condomless sex for cisgender men who have sex with men and transgender women, regardless of HIV status. Dosing is recommended no more frequently than daily. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests doxyPEP is effective for vaginal exposures and is recommended on a case-by-case basis for cisgender women at risk. Prescribe 30 doses (60 tablets or capsules) of doxyPEP at a time, and quarterly STI screening of contact sites and blood syphilis testing is recommended.

### High prevalence and high rate of antibiotic resistance of Mycoplasma genitalium infections in men who have sex with men: a substudy of the ANRS IPERGAY pre-exposure prophylaxis trial [^84a4106c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is an emerging pathogen among men who have sex with men (MSM) with raising rates of antibiotic resistance. This study assessed the prevalence and incidence of MG infection in MSM enrolled in the open-label phase of the ANRS IPERGAY trial with on-demand tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine for human immunodeficiency virus prevention and the impact of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

Methods

210 subjects were tested at baseline and at 6 months by real-time PCR assays for MG detection in urine samples and oropharyngeal and anal swabs. Resistance to azithromycin (AZM), to fluoroquinolones (FQs), and to doxycycline was investigated in the French National Reference Center of Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).

Results

The all-site prevalence of MG at baseline was 10.5% (6.3% in urine samples, 4.3% in anal swabs, 0.5% in throat swabs) and remained unchanged at 6 months whether or not PEP was used: 9.9% overall, 10.2% with PEP, 9.6% without. The overall rate of MG resistance (prevalent and incident cases) to AZM and FQs was 67.6% and 9.1%, respectively, with no difference between arms. An in vivo mutation of the MG 16S rRNA, which could be associated with tetracycline resistance, was observed in 12.5% of specimens tested.

Conclusions

The prevalence of MG infection among MSM on pre-exposure prophylaxis was high and its incidence was not decreased by doxycycline prophylaxis with a similar high rate of AZM and FQ resistance, raising challenging issues for the treatment of this STI and supporting current recommendations to avoid testing or treatment of asymptomatic MG infection.

### Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis and sexually transmitted infection trends [^3c985ac4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been associated with rises in serious morbidity. While doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP), a strategy in which individuals take doxycycline, 200 mg, after condomless sex to prevent bacterial STIs, has been shown to be efficacious in randomized clinical trials, doxyPEP's potential effect on population-level STI incidence is unknown.

Objective

To assess the association of citywide doxyPEP guideline release with reported chlamydia, gonorrhea, and early syphilis cases in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in transgender women in San Francisco, California.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-level interrupted time series analysis of reported San Francisco STI cases measured monthly cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and early syphilis prior to (July 2021-October 2022) and after (November 2022-November 2023) release of citywide doxyPEP guidelines in October 2022. All reported chlamydia, gonorrhea, and early syphilis cases among MSM and transgender women in San Francisco during the period of analysis were included. Data were analyzed November 2023 to July 2024.

Exposure

Release of doxyPEP citywide guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage change between projected and observed chlamydia, gonorrhea, and early syphilis cases in the 13-month postexposure period.

Results

Citywide, there were 6694 cases of chlamydia, 9603 cases of gonorrhea, and 2121 cases of early syphilis among MSM and transgender women during the analytic period. STI cases among MSM and transgender women decreased significantly compared with model projections for chlamydia (-6.58% per month; 95% CI, -7.99% to -5.16%) and early syphilis (-2.68% per month; 95% CI, -3.75% to -1.60%) after doxyPEP implementation. By the end of the 13-month postperiod in November 2023, chlamydia and early syphilis cases decreased -49.64% (95% CI, -59.05% to -38.06%) and -51.39% (95% CI, -58.21% to -43.46%), respectively, compared with projected cases. There was a significant increase in monthly gonorrhea cases compared with projections (1.77% per month; 95% CI, 0.87% to 2.67%).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that San Francisco's doxyPEP guideline release was associated with decreases in reported cases of chlamydia and early syphilis, but not gonorrhea, among MSM and transgender women in San Francisco. Further analyses are needed to assess whether declines are sustained and monitor for adverse consequences, including antimicrobial resistance. Supporting doxyPEP implementation for MSM and transgender women at risk for STIs could have a significant impact on the nationwide STI epidemic.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^0b954f1e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary work group of CDC staff who are physicians with expertise in infectious diseases, STIs, HIV, and public health. A systematic literature review was conducted to inform the question: Does doxycycline taken after vaginal, anal, or oral sex decrease bacterial STIs (i.e. syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) compared with not taking doxycycline? Studies published through June 2023 using MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase were included. Studies that met inclusion criteria (i.e. randomized controlled trials, written in English, and evaluated doxy PEP as STI prophylaxis) were given a summary strength of evidence rating using the same approach as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents (Table) (12). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations evidence-to-decision framework was used to weigh the benefits and harms, values, acceptability, equity, and feasibility. Abstracts presented at major scientific meetings (i.e. Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections and the STI and HIV World Congress) also were reviewed. Literature reviews also were conducted to address the question: Does long-term doxycycline use cause substantial harms such as the development of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, and dermatologic, gastrointestinal, neuropsychiatric, and metabolic side effects? Evidence was not graded. Further details regarding search strategies are available.

TABLE 
Rating scheme for strength and quality of evidence supporting CDC recommendations

In addition to the literature reviews, the National Association of County and City Health Officials held a virtual 2-day consultation December 5 and 6, 2022, during which multiple experts, stakeholders, and community members discussed doxy PEP, including benefits and potential harms of use. The meeting report was reviewed by the Doxy PEP Guidelines Development Workgroup, and findings from the consultation were considered during the development of these recommendations. A virtual bioethics consultation took place April 14 and May 1, 2023, and included bioethics experts, academic experts in infectious diseases and health equity, community advocates, and CDC staff. This consultation resulted in a publication, and opinions from individual experts were considered in the development of the guidelines and implementation plans.

CURRENT EVIDENCE ON DOXYCYCLINE PROPHYLAXIS

Doxycycline is a moderate-spectrum, second-generation tetracycline that is generally well tolerated. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. First introduced commercially in the 1960s, doxycycline has been used by millions to manage acne and as primary prophylaxis for scrub typhus, leptospirosis, malaria, and Lyme disease. There are anecdotal reports of doxycycline used for syphilis prophylaxis among US and Australian military personnel during the Vietnam War. Doxycycline is a first-line agent for treatment of chlamydia and an alternative regimen for syphilis.

Several studies examined doxycycline prophylaxis for STI prevention (Table 1). In a small, open-label pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with prior syphilis were randomized 1:1 to daily doxycycline 100 mg as pre-exposure prophylaxis (Doxy PrEP) for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention. There was a 73% reduction (P =.02) in syphilis, NG, or CT in the Doxy PrEP group compared with the control group. Most intervention-arm participants maintained blood doxycycline levels of greater than 1 μg/mL. Reported sexual behaviors were similar in both groups.

### CDC clinical guidelines on the use of doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infection prevention, United States, 2024 [^63d7d6c2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Doxycycline, a broad-spectrum tetracycline antimicrobial, is well absorbed and tolerated, with a half-life of approximately 12 hours (4). Adverse effects most associated with doxycycline include photosensitivity and gastrointestinal symptoms including esophageal erosion and ulceration (5). Most adverse effects resolve with discontinuation of the medication. Doxycycline is the recommended treatment regimen for chlamydia and an alternative treatment for syphilis in nonpregnant patients with severe penicillin allergy or when penicillin is not available (6). Although currently not a recommended treatment for gonorrhea because of elevated antimicrobial resistance, doxycycline remains effective against many strains of N. gonorrhoeae in the United States (7).

In 2015, the treatment arm of a randomized clinical controlled trial studied the use of oral doxycycline hyclate 100 mg daily as STI PrEP among 30 men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV receiving antiretrovirals (8). At 48 weeks, persons who were assigned daily STI PrEP had a 73% reduction in bacterial STI incidence compared with persons in the comparison arm demonstrated by decreases in chlamydia and syphilis but not gonorrhea. The 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines included a systematic review of the available literature on STI PrEP and PEP and concluded that further studies were necessary to determine whether STI chemoprophylaxis would be an effective strategy for bacterial STI prevention (6). Since the study in 2015, there have been no new studies of STI PrEP, but three large randomized controlled trials among MSM and transgender women (TGW) studied STI PEP in the form of 200 mg of doxycycline taken after sex. These trials all demonstrated significant reductions in bacterial STI acquisition (syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea). Between 2023 and 2024, certain countries have issued varying position statements on the practice of doxy PEP ranging from recommending against widespread use because of concerns about antimicrobial resistance (9) to conditional use for MSM and TGW at risk for syphilis (10) or on a case-by-case basis (11). This report presents CDC’s updated clinical guidelines for health care providers to inform MSM and TGW who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) diagnosed in the past 12 months about the use of doxy PEP for preventing these bacterial STI infections.

Community Acceptability and Perceptions

Multiple surveys have demonstrated that doxycycline prophylaxis is acceptable to MSM. In an online survey of 2095 Australian MSM, 53% indicated they would be likely to take doxycycline to prevent syphilis and 76% indicated they would take doxycycline to reduce syphilis in the community. Among 1301 users of a US social-networking app for MSM, 84% were interested in trying Doxy PEP. Interest was higher among African-American and Latino/a respondents. At a joint Australia–New Zealand HIV/STI scientific meeting of clinical and public health experts in 2015, 52% of 63 providers felt that the benefits of doxycycline prophylaxis outweighed the risks, although 88% had some concerns about antimicrobial resistance.

Some MSM in North America and Europe may already be using doxycycline for STI prophylaxis. In a survey of MSM taking HIV PrEP in the United Kingdom, 6 of 106 respondents reported taking doxycycline to prevent STIs in the previous 6 months. In the ANRS IPERGAY Doxy PEP study 3–13% of participants in the placebo group had detectable doxycycline blood levels at each study visit. Doxycycline is also frequently available through online companies selling HIV PrEP.

Researchers and study participants have expressed concern about the potential for confusion between Doxy PEP/PrEP and HIV PrEP. Both medications can be used daily or intermittently. Individuals living with HIV may believe themselves to be ineligible for Doxy PEP/PrEP. Individuals without HIV may not understand that HIV PrEP does not protect them against STIs and Doxy PEP/PrEP does not protect them from HIV. Effective educational campaigns, designed using evidence from ongoing and future studies, will be critical to address those concerns.

Risk Compensation

Investigators have documented decreased condom use among MSM using HIV PrEP. While reports from completed Doxy PEP/PrEP trials have not identified similar changes in risk behavior, findings from the ongoing Canadian DuDHS study suggest some risk compensation might occur. Notably, risk compensation among people taking HIV PrEP was not identified in the initial placebo-controlled trials but only became evident in later uncontrolled trials.

Prevention of sexually transmitted infections—doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) should be integrated with tailored prevention and shared decision-making: Individuals with recurrent STIs and ongoing sexual activities at high likelihood of acquisition should receive tailored HIV and STI prevention messages; clinicians should discuss the potential benefits and harms of doxyPEP, and doxyPEP should be discussed with and offered to cisgender gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with cisgender men; transgender women; and people with HIV meeting stated risk criteria; the dose of doxycycline is 200 mg as a single dose (maximum 200 mg in 24 hours) ideally as soon as possible after sex but no later than 72 hours afterward; data are inadequate to support efficacy in cisgender women, cisgender heterosexual men, transgender men, and gender-diverse persons assigned female at birth, so shared decision-making should be used; persons who actively use doxyPEP should be screened for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea at 3- to 6-month intervals depending on sexual practices.

Sexual behaviour, HIV status and history of STIs

Eighty-six participants (86/845, 10.2%) were living with HIV, two-thirds (519/845, 61.4%) were taking PrEP, and 240 were HIV negative or had an unknown HIV status and were not taking PrEP (240/845, 28.4%; table 1). About half the participants reported an STI in the previous year (395/843, 46.9%), and 119 had more than two STIs in the previous year (119/843, 14.1%). The most frequently reported STIs were gonorrhoea (242/844, 28.7%), chlamydia (222/844, 26.3%), followed by syphilis (118/844, 14.0%). The median self-perceived STI risk was 7 (IQR 5–8) on a scale of 0–10 (0 representing very low risk and 10 very high risk). Most participants were rather or very concerned about acquiring STIs (575/841, 68.4%) and found it rather or very important to protect themselves or their partners against STIs (751/837, 89.7% and 770/836, 92.1%, respectively). Around one-third of participants reported having engaged in chemsex in the previous 6 months (258/836, 30.9%).

### Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis and bacterial sexually transmitted infections among individuals using HIV preexposure prophylaxis [^7342be70]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) has been shown to decrease the incidence of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among people assigned male sex at birth in clinical trials, but data from clinical practice are limited.

Objective

To describe early uptake of doxyPEP and evaluate changes in STI incidence following doxyPEP initiation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study of adults (aged ≥18 years) dispensed HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during November 1, 2022, to December 31, 2023, examined electronic health record data to compare HIV PrEP users dispensed and not dispensed doxyPEP and rates of bacterial STIs before and after starting doxyPEP. Individuals were followed up from their first recorded STI test on or after November 1, 2020, until December 31, 2023, or discontinuation of health plan membership.

Exposure

Pharmacy dispensing data were used to define doxyPEP recipients.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between individuals dispensed and not dispensed doxyPEP. Primary outcomes were incident chlamydia, gonorrhea, or infectious syphilis measured as quarterly STI positivity (proportion of individuals testing positive at least once per quarter). Among doxyPEP recipients, rate ratios (RRs) compared mean quarterly STI positivity from 24 months before to 12 months after starting doxyPEP. In an exploratory analysis, STI trends were evaluated for the full cohort, stratified by receipt of doxyPEP.

Results

Among 11 551 HIV PrEP users (mean [SD] age, 39.9 [12.1] years; 95.1% male), 2253 (19.5%) were dispensed doxyPEP, of whom 2228 (98.9%) were male and 1096 (48.6%) had an STI in the year before starting doxyPEP. Compared with individuals not dispensed doxyPEP, doxyPEP recipients were older (mean [SD] age, 40.4 [10.8] vs 39.8 [12.4] years; P=.04) and had used HIV PrEP longer (mean [SD], 4.2 [2.8] vs 3.4 [2.6] years; P<.001), and a higher proportion were commercially insured (2091 [92.8%] vs 8270 [88.9%]; P<.001). Among doxyPEP recipients, quarterly chlamydia positivity decreased from 9.6% (95% CI, 9.0%-10.3%) before starting doxyPEP to 2.0% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.6%) after starting doxyPEP (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.16-0.27; P<.001), with significant declines for each anatomic site of infection. Quarterly gonorrhea positivity decreased from 10.2% (95% CI, 9.6%-10.9%) before starting doxyPEP to 9.0% (95% CI, 8.0%-10.1%) after starting doxyPEP (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00; P=.048); site-specific declines were significant for rectal (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.97; P=.02) and urethral (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.79; P=.001) gonorrhea, but not pharyngeal gonorrhea. Quarterly syphilis positivity decreased from 1.7% (95% CI, 1.4%-1.9%) before starting doxyPEP to 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%) after starting doxyPEP (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.11-0.37; P<.001). Positivity for STIs remained stable in individuals not dispensed doxyPEP.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that receipt of doxyPEP was associated with substantial declines in chlamydia and syphilis incidence and modest declines in urethral and rectal gonorrhea incidence among individuals using HIV PrEP. These findings suggest that doxyPEP may offer substantial benefits for reducing population-level STI transmission with broader implementation.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis to prevent sexually transmitted infections in women [^8cae2ba0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study dPEP-KE was published by Jenell Stewart and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chlamydia trachomatis infection, Gonorrhea, Syphilis and Gonococcal urethritis. In the dPEP-KE study, the trial question was: what is the role of doxycycline prophylaxis for STIs in cisgender women? In the dPEP-KE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the dPEP-KE study, the population was: 449 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult cisgender women who were receiving HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; allergy to tetracycline class; receipt of medications contraindicated with doxycycline; recent use of prolonged antibiotics in the month prior to enrollment. In the dPEP-KE study, the interventions were: n=224 doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg doxycycline hyclate within 72 hours after condomless sexual intercourse plus quarterly STI testing and treatment) n=225 standard care (quarterly STI testing and treatment alone). In the dPEP-KE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of incident STIs (25.1/100 py vs. 29/100 py; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.29). In the dPEP-KE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in incident C. trachomatis infection (70% vs. 84.7%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.13) No significant difference in first C. trachomatis infection (15% vs. 18.5%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.27) No significant difference in first STI (20.9% vs. 22.1%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.42). In the dPEP-KE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the dPEP-KE study, the conclusion was: in adult cisgender women who were receiving HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis were not superior to standard care with respect to the incidence of incident STIs.

Adherence to treatment and dropout rate.

Ninety-one of the 101 participants who were randomized into the early treatment group received immediate treatment, whereas 84 of the 101 participants randomized to the delayed treatment group received the treatment 6 months after the early group. Participants who did not receive the study medication had relocated to new communities, traveled at the time of treatment, became pregnant, were breastfeeding, or refused the treatment (delayed group) (Figure 1). Three patients randomized to the early group received their treatment together with the delayed group. These three patients were excluded from the PP but were included in the ITT analysis. Adherence to treatment was very high with only one patient opting out during the delayed treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, a dropout rate of 23% was recorded in the early and 21% in the delayed treatment group (Figure 1).

Adverse events experienced by participants during treatment.

All AEs occurred within the first week of treatment and included general body pains, dizziness, diarrhea, headache, nausea, abdominal pains, and vomiting. A total of 16 (9.2%) of 174 participants who started the treatment reported one or more AEs (Table 2). One participant reported having two AEs (nausea and abdominal pains, lasting for 2 days) on the third day of treatment. Other participants only reported one of the AEs. Twelve of the AEs occurred in the early treatment group and five in the delayed treatment group. The AEs with the longest reported duration, diarrhea and dizziness reported by two participants, lasted for 3 days. There was no serious AE reported during the study. All reported AEs resolved spontaneously without intervention, and none of the participants who reported an AE stopped taking the trial medication.

### Impact of doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) for sexually transmitted infections on the microbiome of men who have sex with men on HIV PrEP [^86313fe6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Despite the clear efficacy data, many unresolved concerns exist, key amongst these are the impacts of doxyPEP and doxyPrEP on antimicrobial resistance and the human microbiome. The human microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms performing essential functions for immune development, defense against pathogens, and nutrient metabolism and plays a key role in diverse health conditions, including asthma, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergies –. Tetracyclines—and specifically doxycycline—appear to be relatively safe for the gut microbiome, based on their low likelihood of causing Clostridioides difficile infection,, the main cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea, which results from antibiotic-associated perturbations in the intestinal microbiome and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Few studies have directly examined the impact of doxycycline on the gut microbiome, and these have generally included few samples from a small number of participants. One such study examined gut microbiome changes in stool samples from 10 individuals administered doxycycline and probiotics versus an equal number of controls receiving probiotics alone. In those receiving doxycycline, a reduction in microbial diversity was seen, notably a decrease in Bifidobacterium, an important gut commensal. The treatment group also had a higher proportion of tetracycline-resistant bacteria than the control group. Some studies using in vitro methodologies have been variable, where some have shown little-to-no changes in microbial diversitywhile others have shown changes to important gut microbiota such as Lactobacillaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. A recent sub-analysis of samples from 89 participants of the US-based DoxyPEP trialshowed that doxycycline use did not measurably impact the relative abundance, alpha or beta diversity in the rectal microbiome, but did increase the proportion of tetracycline antimicrobial resistance genes in rectal microbiota after 6 months of doxy-PEP use. These microbiome changes were more pronounced in individuals who were using 25 doses of 200 mg or more in a 6-month time period, suggesting that dosage is an important factor. Antibiotic exposures for doxyPrEP in comparison to doxyPEP for STI prevention would likely be higher given the daily dosing regimen, though a very frequent doxyPEP user (e.g. using 4 weekly, 200mg doses) could theoretically surpass the weekly dosage of a daily user (i.e. 7 × 100 mg). For example, in the US DoxyPEP trialwhere microbiome effects were observed equates to an average doxycycline exposure of 4 × 200 mg/month (~800 mg/month), in comparison to a lower daily dosage (100 mg/daily, 3000 mg/month) but higher frequency and duration used in a recently published doxyPrEP study. This may result in differential impacts on the gut mucosal microbiome between doxyPrEP and doxyPEP strategies.

Anticipated reduction in STI burden due to doxyPEP

We modeled potential direct effects of doxyPEP on STI incidence within each population stratum, using pathogen-specific relative-risk estimates from a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of doxyPEP to quantify effect sizes. We estimated that doxyPEP would prevent 2.7, 2.5, and 1.4 gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis diagnoses, respectively, per 100 person-years of use among PrEP recipients (Fig. 1). Subsetting analyses to risk periods <3 months after a PrEP prescription fill or after a year of consistent PrEP use, doxyPEP would prevent 3.1–3.3 gonorrhea diagnoses, 2.9–3.0 chlamydia diagnoses, and 1.5–1.6 syphilis diagnoses per 100 person-years of use (Table S13). Considering only PrEP recipients who experienced ≥1 STI diagnosis in the preceding year, avertible incidence totaled 9.6, 8.1, and 3.1 gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis diagnoses, respectively, per 100 person-years of doxyPEP use. The avertible burden comprised 1.5–2.3 diagnoses of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis per 100 person-years within the general sample of PLWH, while among PLWH with ≥1 STI diagnosis in the preceding year, rates totaled 5.9–7.4 diagnoses per 100 person-years.

Fig. 1 
Incidence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis preventable by direct effects of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP).

We illustrate estimates of the incidence of diagnoses of gonorrhea (A), chlamydia (B), and syphilis (C) preventable by direct effects of doxyPEP among recipients within differing eligibility strata. Incidence rate difference (IRD) estimates compare between rates under counterfactual scenarios of doxyPEP receipt or non-receipt. Populations included in analyses encompass males and transgender individuals living with HIV (PLWH), who receive HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), or with a history of diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the preceding year. Follow-up for the estimates plotted encompasses 38,543 person-years at risk among PrEP recipients, 29,228 person-years at risk among PLWH, and 19,918 person-years at risk among people with prior STI diagnosis history, summed across all years of follow-up (2017–2019). Plotted points represent maximum-likelihood estimates and lines delineate 95% confidence intervals.

### A pilot, randomized controlled trial of dual daily HIV and sexually transmitted infection pre-exposure prophylaxis using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate / emtricitabine and doxycycline in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men and transgender women: the DuDHS study [^a43f98b7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women experience high sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates. This study evaluated the feasibility of doxycycline pre-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPrEP) for STI prevention in these key populations.

Methods

Sexually-active MSM and transgender women without HIV with prior syphilis were recruited. Participants initiated HIV PrEP with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) daily for 48 weeks, and were randomized 1:1 to daily doxyPrEP for 48 weeks (immediate arm), or doxyPrEP initiated at 24 weeks (deferred arm). Primary outcomes included adherence, measured using questionnaires, along with tolerability; STI incidence (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) was a secondary outcome. Nasal carriage of S. aureus was assessed serially for doxycycline resistance.

Results

Fifty-two participants were enrolled into the immediate (n=26) and deferred (n=26) arms. At 48 weeks, self-reported adherence (≥95%) was 75.0% vs. 66.7% (p=0.538) for TDF/FTC, and 70.8% vs. 61.9% (p=0.526) for doxycycline in the immediate vs. deferred arms, respectively. No doxyPrEP-related serious adverse events occurred. Incidence of any STI at 24 weeks was reduced in the immediate vs. deferred arms, and over 48 weeks, being on doxycycline (vs. being off; i.e. first 24 weeks of deferred arm) was associated with STI reduction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.36; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.89). Emergent doxycycline-resistant S. aureus was identified in six individuals, with five in the immediate arm (p=0.077).

Conclusions

Dual HIV/doxyPrEP is feasible and associated with a significant reduction in incident STI. Further evaluation of dosing strategies, efficacy and impact on antimicrobial resistance is warranted.

### Bacterial sexually transmitted infections and related antibiotic use among individuals eligible for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis in the United States [^104ce297]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our findings offer a quantitative basis for evaluating potential benefit-risk tradeoffs of differing doxyPEP implementation strategies. Benefits of doxyPEP alongside STI prevention may include alleviation of the medical costs, productivity losses, and stigma associated with STI diagnoses. However, preliminary data have identified increased prevalence of tetracycline resistance in S. aureus, group A Streptococcus, and the gut microbiome among doxyPEP recipients,,, and in S. aureus infections within populations eligible for doxyPEP use. Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and other bacterial pathogensremains a priority to understand implications for clinical care.

### Four-year experience of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) from an Italian multicentre cohort: incidence of sexually transmitted infections and renal toxicity [^ab4620bf]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious strategy to prevent HIV transmission recommended by national and international guidelines throughout the continents. To date it represents a cornerstone in terms of reduction of new HIV diagnoses and against the HIV pandemic.

The oral intake of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), by a “daily” or “on demand” approach, has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in people considered at risk of acquiring HIV. For this reason, the CDC now recommends discussing PrEP with all sexually active adults and adolescents and prescribing PrEP to people who request it, even if they do not report sexual or drug-injection practices that may put them at risk of acquiring HIV.

PrEP should be considered as a complementary method of prevention, together with the use of condoms, an adequate sexual education and should be routinely integrated in all sexual health-care systems. However, concerns still remain about the phenomenon of risk compensation, i.e. a reduced sexual risk perception derived from the awareness of PrEP efficacy against HIV transmission, which can lead to an increase in Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) spread.

Literature is not unanimous about the role of PrEP as driver of possible change in risky sexual behaviors, leading instead to an increased risk of STIs acquisition. Indeed, bacterial STI rate is constantly rising worldwide including Italy, especially in men who have sex with men (MSM). Considering this phenomenon, some randomized clinical trials were performed to assess the effectiveness and safety of doxycycline, as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) to prevent STI transmission in PrEP users with successful results.

Another matter of concern about the use of PrEP is represented by long-term potential toxicity of TDF, especially on kidney function. Kidney injury caused by TDF, manifesting as acute or chronic damage, as well as Fanconi syndrome, is well known and documented in people living with HIV (PLWH) using TDF containing regimens. Some studies investigated the impact of PrEP on serum creatinine levels and eGFR evolution, showing a worsening of kidney function, after a variable period of PrEP intake. These variations seem to be correlated with an older age and a lower initial eGFR. Even if complete functional recovery has been shown after drug discontinuation, irreversible renal impairment in a long-term daily use cannot be excluded.

Statistical Analysis

We used descriptive statistics to compare characteristics of individuals dispensed and not dispensed doxyPEP. For individuals dispensed doxyPEP, we described median numbers of pills dispensed in the first doxyPEP fill, fills per person, and doses in possession per month.

To evaluate changes in STI incidence and testing, we conducted (1) a primary analysis comparing STI positivity and testing before and after initiating doxyPEP among individuals dispensed doxyPEP and (2) an exploratory analysis of trends in quarterly STI positivity by calendar time in the full cohort, including those both dispensed and not dispensed doxyPEP, before and after doxyPEP was implemented at KPNC.

In the primary analysis on STI incidence among individuals dispensed doxyPEP, we compared quarterly STI positivity in the 24 months before to 12 months after initiating doxyPEP. For the primary analysis, we chose a pre/post descriptive analytic design. Inclusion of a matched control group with imputed index dates was deemed unsuitable given the likelihood of time-varying confounding arising from the association between the outcome of interest (STI diagnosis) and probability of starting doxyPEP. We defined a baseline window for each individual as the period from 90 days before to 14 days after the first doxyPEP fill. We excluded STI diagnoses during this window to minimize potential bias from increased STI detection around the time of doxyPEP initiation (ie, increased likelihood of starting doxyPEP following a recent STI diagnosis). We used Poisson regression to estimate mean percent change in STI positivity per quarter (trend), with corresponding 95% CIs, separately for the periods before and after individuals initiated doxyPEP. We then used Poisson regression to compute rate ratios (RRs) representing the relative difference in mean quarterly STI positivity from the period before to the period after doxyPEP initiation by including a time-updated independent variable indicating whether an individual had initiated doxyPEP. In these models, the dependent variable was STI positivity (restricted to a maximum of 1 positive test per individual per quarter), with an independent continuous time covariate (quarter from baseline). Robust standard error calculations clustered by individual accounted for multiple observations per person. To explore the potential effect on our results of some doxyPEP recipients not having a full 12 months of post–doxyPEP initiation follow-up, we compared mean STI positivity in the 12 months before to 6 months after starting doxyPEP among those who were dispensed doxyPEP before June 30, 2023, and therefore had at least 6 months of follow-up after starting doxyPEP.

### Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis awareness and use among transgender women in san francisco, 2023-2024: assessment one year after release of health department guidance [^1a54d96e]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

The San Francisco health department released guidelines on doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) for sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention in October 2022. Guidelines recommended doxy-PEP for transgender women (hereafter trans women) and men who have sex with men with a history of bacterial STI and condomless anal or oral sex in the last year. We assessed doxy-PEP awareness and use among trans women in San Francisco using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data from July 2023-May 2024, spanning 9-19 months after guideline release. In-person interviews recorded demographics, behaviors, HIV serostatus, STI history, and doxy-PEP awareness, discussion with a provider, and use in the last year. Among 339 trans women surveyed, 37% were aware of doxy-PEP. In the last year, 20% discussed doxy-PEP with a provider and 11% used doxy-PEP. Among trans women not living with HIV, awareness was correlated with age under 50 years (AOR 3.86, CI 1.92-7.74), engaging in sex work (AOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.02-3.38), and testing positive for a bacterial STI (AOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.35-6.33). Among those living with HIV, awareness of doxy-PEP was correlated with testing positive for an STI (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.22-7.64). Despite efficacy demonstrated for trans women in clinical trials and health department guidelines prioritizing doxy-PEP for trans women, awareness of this effective STI prevention method was low. These findings mirror the experience with HIV PrEP roll-out for trans women. Targeted interventions and differentiated delivery models are needed to improve access, engagement, and uptake in this population.

### Early adopters of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections in a real-world clinical setting [^c9245081]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (DoxyPEP) is a novel prevention approach which has demonstrated efficacy in preventing bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) including people who are living with HIV and those on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We evaluated patient knowledge and interest in DoxyPEP, as well as early adopters of its use.

Methods

In 2023, patients presenting for HIV and STI services at a primary care and sexual health clinic were asked about DoxyPEP knowledge, interest and use. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate demographics and behaviours associated with these outcomes.

Results

A total of n=421 people presented for care. Of these, 314 were MSM/TGW. Fifteen percent were Black/African-American, and 21% were Hispanic/Latino. A total of 50% of MSM/TGW had heard of DoxyPEP, 49% were interested and 18% reported prior DoxyPEP use. Having a history of STI infection ever (adjusted OR (aOR) 5.95, 95% CI 2.69 to 13.13) and in the past 12 months (aOR 2.99, 95% CI 1.56 to 5.72) were both associated with DoxyPEP use. Individuals who had ever used HIV PrEP had nearly three times the odds of ever taking DoxyPEP (aOR 2.88, 95% CI 1.56 to 5.30). There was no association between the use of DoxyPEP and race, ethnicity or HIV status.

Conclusions

Among MSM and TGW, there is already significant awareness, interest and use of DoxyPEP to prevent bacterial STIs. Public health efforts should focus on improving access and delivery of this STI prevention intervention to MSM and TGW.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV-CDC recommendations, United States, 2025 [^42aeb602]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

STI testing, PEP, and presumptive treatment in the context of HIV nPEP are specified: CDC STI Treatment Guidelines, 2021, recommend presumptive STI treatment after sexual assault, and presumptive STI treatment and PEP must be tailored to the clinical situation and might include an empiric antimicrobial regimen effective against named pathogens, postexposure hepatitis B vaccination with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin, and human papillomavirus or mpox vaccination. Certain health care professionals might await STI test results rather than provide presumptive treatment; if the initial STI tests are negative and presumptive STI treatment was not provided, STI testing can be repeated 1–2 weeks after the exposure. For GBMSM, a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline taken within 72 hours of condomless sex (doxy-PEP) might be considered as part of a comprehensive approach to STI care, and health care professionals who provide nPEP should remain up to date with relevant guidelines for STI diagnosis and treatment.

### BASHH updated position statement on doxycycline as prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections [^57c5ab3e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2017, BASHH and Public Health England, now the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), published a position statement on the use of doxycycline as prophylaxis for STIs.It advised ‘extreme caution in the use of doxycycline [as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)]…[and] that the use of doxycycline PEP should be restricted to the research setting’. However, increasingly evidence suggests that individuals at higher risk of acquiring bacterial STIs are already using antibiotics to prevent acquisition, accessed through several routes.Clinicians are therefore likely to be seeing patients who are self-sourcing antibiotics as STI prophylaxis. For that reason, and to support a person-centred approach to care, the BASHH position statement has been updated. It now includes information about key studies to date and concerns around antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in sexually and non-sexually transmitted infections, as well as providing recommendations for clinicians for how to advise patients about STI prophylaxis. Importantly, it remains the case that doxycycline taken as PEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for STIs is not endorsed by BASHH or UKHSA. This remains in line with international counterparts.The full position statement is available on the BASHH website:.

STI prophylaxis is the use of antibiotics as PEP or PrEP to reduce the risk of acquiring certain bacterial STIs. Only the use of doxycycline to prevent syphilis and chlamydia in men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women has been researched with a single published study powered to show efficacy.This open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) explored the efficacy of doxycycline PEP taken as a single 200 mg dose within the first 24 hours, and no later than 72 hours, after condomless sex among 232 MSM and transgender women using HIV-PrEP. A significant decrease was observed in the occurrence of first episode of chlamydia and for first episode of syphilis. No significant difference in the incidence of gonorrhoea was observed. An earlier open-label, pilot RCT of 100 mg doxycycline daily as PrEP involving 30 MSM living with HIV did observe reductions in both syphilis diagnosis, and diagnosis of either chlamydia or gonorrhoea, that were not statistically significant.Several further studies of doxycycline PrEP and PEP are ongoing.

### To whom should we prescribe doxy-PEP? A retrospective review of public health surveillance data for bacterial STI diagnoses among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in ottawa, Canada [^e316b199]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Internationally, there have been increases in the reported rates of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (bac-STIs), including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis.Data also suggest that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) account for a disproportionate number of these infections.While sexual health strategies for bac-STIs among gbMSM have historically included condom use and rescreening every 3–12 months,a new intervention is available. Known as doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP), this strategy involves giving a one-time 200 mg oral dose of doxycycline after sexual contact when bac-STI transmission could have occurred.

In June 2024, the US CDC released doxy-PEP guidelines,which recommended that healthcare providers offer this intervention to gbMSM who had been diagnosed with ≥1 bac-STIs in the preceding 12 months. The guidelinedetailed that doxy-PEP was to be used after sexual contact (ideally within 24 hours, but up to 72 hours later), and that it could be used up to daily, as needed. The CDC guidelinefurther specified that clinicians should prescribe as many doses as required until a patient’s next clinical follow-up (within 3 months), when another prescription could be given, if warranted.The CDC’s rationalefor endorsing doxy-PEP was twofold: first, if doxy-PEP could be distributed to populations with the greatest bac-STI burden, then it should decrease STI incidence overall; and, second, if doxy-PEP could be given only to those who account for a large proportion of bac-STIs, then fewer people would need to use this intervention for population-level benefits.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^f1e20c07]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs)—Doxycycline (Doxy-PEP) taken after condomless anal or oral sex is recommended for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women and nonbinary people at risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis within the past 12 months (evidence rating: AIa), and doxyPEP is also recommended, using a shared decision-making approach, for MSM and transgender women who have not had a bacterial STI during the previous year but have a high likelihood of condomless exposure to STIs (evidence rating: AIII). Initiating oral doxyPEP is recommended as quickly as possible (but certainly within 72 hours) after condomless sexual exposure for cisgender MSM and transgender women (evidence rating: AIa). This intervention reduces the incidence of chlamydia by 70% to 88% and early syphilis by 73% to 87%, while effects on gonorrhea are less consistent. Dosing may be taken as frequently as daily (evidence rating: BIa). One study of doxyPEP for cisgender women in Kenya did not show a protective effect, but pharmacologic modeling suggests that doxyPEP should be effective for vaginal exposures and should be considered on a case-by-case basis among individuals with likelihood of STI acquisition via vaginal exposure (evidence rating: BIII). DoxyPEP prescriptions are recommended in quantities of 30 doses at a time (evidence rating: CIII), and screening of sites/orifices with sexual contact as well as blood testing for syphilis is recommended quarterly (evidence rating: AIa).

### Doxycycline versus azithromycin for the treatment of rectal Chlamydia in men who have sex with men: a randomized controlled trial [^93ad1219]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Azithromycin and doxycycline are both recommended treatments for rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection, but observational studies suggest that doxycycline may be more effective.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared azithromycin (single 1-g dose) versus doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) for the treatment of rectal CT in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Seattle and Boston. Participants were enrolled after a diagnosis of rectal CT in clinical care and underwent repeated collection of rectal swabs for nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) at study enrollment and 2 weeks and 4 weeks postenrollment. The primary outcome was microbiologic cure (CT-negative NAAT) at 4 weeks. The complete case (CC) population included participants with a CT-positive NAAT at enrollment and a follow-up NAAT result; the intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants.

Results

Among 177 participants enrolled, 135 (76%) met CC population criteria for the 4-week follow-up visit. Thirty-three participants (19%) were excluded because the CT NAAT repeated at enrollment was negative. Microbiologic cure was higher with doxycycline than azithromycin in both the CC population (100% [70 of 70] vs 74% [48 of 65]; absolute difference, 26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 16-36%; P < .001) and the ITT population (91% [80 of 88] vs 71% [63 of 89]; absolute difference, 20%; 95% CI, 9-31%; P < .001).

Conclusions

A 1-week course of doxycycline was significantly more effective than a single dose of azithromycin for the treatment of rectal CT in MSM.

### Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Belgium: awareness, use and antimicrobial resistance concerns in a cross-sectional online survey [^10b76a88]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the awareness, willingness to use and use of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Belgium. Additionally, we aimed to identify factors associated with doxyPEP use and concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Methods

Cross-sectional online survey among MSM and TGW in Belgium in April 2024. Participants were recruited through sexual networking applications and social media of community-based organisations. Numerical variables were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test and categorical variables with χ 2 or Fisher's exact tests. Factors associated with doxyPEP use were assessed using logistic regression. Willingness to use doxyPEP and concerns about side effects/AMR were assessed before and after presenting a brief paragraph on the potential effects of doxyPEP on AMR.

Results

875 individuals initiated the survey. Almost all identified as men (860/875, 98.3%) with a median age of 40 years (IQR 32-48), 40.4% (n=352/875) had heard of doxyPEP and 9.4% (n=82/875) had used it, among whom the majority used it within the previous 6months (70/81, 86.4%). In multivariable logistic regression, doxyPEP use was associated with reporting ≥1sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the previous 12 months, engagement in chemsex, HIV status and pre-exposure prophylaxis use, and education level.About 80% of the participants initially reported being willing to use doxyPEP, and about 50% reported being concerned about side effects. After reading about the potential effects of doxyPEP on AMR, willingness to use decreased to 60% and concerns of side effects/AMR increased to around 70%.

Conclusions

Approximately 1 in 10 MSM in Belgium reported using doxyPEP. A recent history of STIs and STI risk factors were positively associated with doxyPEP use. Importantly, concerns about AMR and side effect influenced willingness to use doxyPEP. If doxyPEP is introduced, informing patients about doxyPEP benefits and risks is crucial to enable informed decision-making.

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for STIs

Providing HSV treatment to persons with HIV and HSV infection has not demonstrated benefit in reducing HIV acquisition among uninfected partners. A large randomized controlled trial evaluated mixed-status heterosexual couples among the partners with HIV infection who also were seropositive for HSV-2. Use of acyclovir had no effect on HIV transmission. These findings are consistent with a previous trial that reported no benefit of acyclovir in preventing HIV acquisition among persons seropositive for HSV-2.

Doxycycline prophylaxis has been examined for preventing bacterial STIs. In a pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with previous syphilis (two or more episodes since HIV diagnosis) were randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention. That study demonstrated a 73% reduction in any bacterial STI at any site, without substantial differences in sexual behavior. Additional studies examining doxycycline prophylaxis are under way or in development.

Postexposure Prophylaxis for HIV and STIs

Guidelines for using PEP aimed at preventing HIV and other STIs as a result of sexual exposure are available at. Sexually active persons seeking HIV PEP should be evaluated for PrEP after completing their PEP course and testing negative for HIV. HIV PEP is also discussed elsewhere in this report (see Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs). Genital hygiene methods (e.g. vaginal washing and douching) after sexual exposure are ineffective in protecting against HIV and STIs and might increase the risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), certain STIs, and HIV infection.

STI PEP in the form of doxycycline 200 mg taken after unprotected anal sex has been studied among MSM and transgender women; results demonstrated reduction in incident chlamydia and syphilis by 70% and 73%, respectively, but no effect on gonorrhea. Other studies are under way or in development regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial STIs. No long-term data are available regarding the impact of STI PEP on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome. Further studies are needed to determine whether STI PEP is an effective and beneficial strategy for STI prevention.

Regarding preventative measures for syphilis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis: awareness, beliefs, and interest among patients with and at risk for HIV [^99a28546]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) for sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, but little is known regarding patient beliefs and interest in doxy-PEP. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adults (≥ 19 years) receiving care for HIV treatment (PWH) or prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) between May-October 2023. The 32-question survey was organized into three parts: doxy-PEP awareness/beliefs/interest/concerns, sexual history, and demographics. Fishers Exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare responses between groups. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictive factors for doxy-PEP interest and concern(s). 166 participants completed the survey. Mean age was 43 years, 83% were male, 22% Black, and 13% Hispanic. Forty-one participants (25%) were on PrEP. Most respondents (75%) were unaware of doxy-PEP. Factors associated with doxy-PEP interest were respondents prescribed PrEP (aOR 2.67; 95% CI, 1.15–6.21) and belief of high risk for STI (aOR, 4.50; 95% CI, 2.24–9.07). Higher doxy-PEP concerns were associated with age ≤40 years (aOR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.47–6.52), > high school education (aOR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.64–7.33), and belief of high risk for STI (aOR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.21–5.50). In this single-site cohort survey study, most respondents were unaware of doxy-PEP but expressed interest and low levels of overall concern. Clinicians should offer doxy-PEP access to all patients at high risk for STIs or requesting the treatment after shared decision-making discussions.

### Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men and transgender women in Belgium: awareness, use and antimicrobial resistance concerns in a cross-sectional online survey [^8729e5ab]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

We aimed to assess the awareness, willingness to use and use of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Belgium. Additionally, we aimed to identify factors associated with doxyPEP use and concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Methods

Cross-sectional online survey among MSM and TGW in Belgium in April 2024. Participants were recruited through sexual networking applications and social media of community-based organisations. Numerical variables were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test and categorical variables with χ 2 or Fisher’s exact tests. Factors associated with doxyPEP use were assessed using logistic regression. Willingness to use doxyPEP and concerns about side effects/AMR were assessed before and after presenting a brief paragraph on the potential effects of doxyPEP on AMR.

Results

875 individuals initiated the survey. Almost all identified as men (860/875, 98.3%) with a median age of 40 years (IQR 32–48), 40.4% (n=352/875) had heard of doxyPEP and 9.4% (n=82/875) had used it, among whom the majority used it within the previous 6 months (70/81, 86.4%). In multivariable logistic regression, doxyPEP use was associated with reporting ≥1 sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the previous 12 months, engagement in chemsex, HIV status and pre-exposure prophylaxis use, and education level.

About 80% of the participants initially reported being willing to use doxyPEP, and about 50% reported being concerned about side effects. After reading about the potential effects of doxyPEP on AMR, willingness to use decreased to 60% and concerns of side effects/AMR increased to around 70%.

Conclusions

Approximately 1 in 10 MSM in Belgium reported using doxyPEP. A recent history of STIs and STI risk factors were positively associated with doxyPEP use. Importantly, concerns about AMR and side effect influenced willingness to use doxyPEP. If doxyPEP is introduced, informing patients about doxyPEP benefits and risks is crucial to enable informed decision-making.

Other studies have also shown doxycycline to have inadequate causal activity, or activity against the liver stage of the malaria parasite, which has implications for doxycycline's post-exposure course.–One randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy of doxycycline prophylaxis for P. falciparum malaria when taken by individuals exposed to mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum. Doxycycline was taken daily 3 days before exposure and for 6 days post exposure. Four of 12 persons taking that preventive regimen developed falciparum malaria 15–24 days after completing medications; the protective efficacy was 67% (95% CI = 35–90%).Another study found that of 60 soldiers who received 100 mg of doxycycline a day before deployment, 6 weeks during their deployment, and for 3 days after their return, none had falciparum malaria, whereas two developed vivax malaria.These studies suggest that doxycycline has some tissue schizontocidal activity for P. falciparum, but is insufficient for causal prophylaxis. Doxycycline would therefore have to be continued for a sufficient amount of time post exposure for successful suppression of parasites that emerge from the liver. Studies have observed that,–malaria developed within 3–4 weeks post exposure. It is therefore recommended that doxycycline prophylaxis be continued for 4 weeks post exposure.

Doxycycline's limited activity in the liver stages of Plasmodium also means that it does not kill P. vivax hypnozoites. Although very effective for preventing primary P. vivax infections, doxycycline is not effective at preventing relapses.

The dose of doxycycline required to achieve successful malaria prophylaxis was also examined. The efficacy of half-dose doxycycline (50 mg/day, N = 67) was compared with full-dose doxycycline (100 mg/day, N = 77). One open-label, randomized, controlled trial found that full-dose doxycycline was significantly more effective in prevention of P. vivax, however the study was not powered to detect a difference between the two doses of doxycycline in preventing P. falciparum infections.Another study examined the effectiveness of full-dose and half-dose doxycycline under operational conditions; adherence to medications was not enforced. Although adherence to full versus half-dose doxycycline was not examined, the study found that on average 73% of the doxycycline regimen was taken and that half-dose (33% infected) was significantly less effective than full-dose doxycycline (19% infected) at preventing both P. falciparum and primary P. vivax infection.

### Reply to boyd et al [^6c3bbffa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

—We welcome with great interest a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as proposed by Boyd et al, although we offer several concerns:

Syphilis is readily treatable and curable; doxycycline prophylaxis, therefore, would be considered an alternative to guideline-recommended quarterly testing and treatment, which alone may be sufficient. Although we agree that a fully powered clinical trial would determine if a daily pill for prophylaxis could add value over quarterly testing and treatment, the resources might be better spent on improving compliance with existing recommendations for frequent testing.

A clinical trial could evaluate whether STI prophylaxis would impair, or enhance, adherence to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This consideration would not apply to men who have sex with men (MSM) at high risk for certain STIs but at low risk for HIV (eg, MSM engaging only in condomless oral sex). Among MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition, pill-taking receptiveness might be best prioritized for HIV prevention efforts, as HIV remains without a cure and is responsible for worse outcomes; adherence to just 1 pill a day can prove challenging, as we observed in iPrEx. Alternatively, uptake of sexual health services may increase by offering a variety of prophylactic combinations, which might include HIV prophylaxis, STI prophylaxis, and contraception, depending on individual needs and desires.

Importantly, offering doxycycline as prophylaxis will increase antibiotic pressure and may lead to increased drug resistance, especially within communities and sexual networks where multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, such as gonorrhea, have already emerged.

Although doxycycline is typically well tolerated and there is extensive experience with its chronic use in acne or for long-term (including life-long) suppressive therapy, side effects such as sun sensitivity, esophagitis, and diarrhea are common.

Despite these cautions, we agree that STI prophylaxis or a combined approach (ie, PrEP plus) would be worthwhile to examine in trials.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxy PEP) counseling—CDC recommends all MSM (men who have sex with men) and TGW (transgender women) who have been diagnosed in the past 12 months with a bacterial STI receive counseling about doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis; doxy PEP involves taking doxycycline within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex, and although it may be effective in other populations, clinical data are limited, so providers can use clinical judgment and shared decision making for those not included in CDC recommendations.

Discussion

With overall STI incidence increasing to 2.5 million cases in 2022, particularly among key sub-groups such as younger people, gay and bisexual MSM, and non-White populations, the implementation of effective preventative STI interventions like doxy-PEP is of paramount importance. In this single site cohort survey study, we aimed to garner patient awareness, beliefs, and interest in doxy-PEP. We found nearly a third of our respondents had high interest in doxy-PEP despite unawareness with this as prevention modality. Further, respondents most interested in doxy-PEP were people on HIV PrEP and those believing they had a high risk for STI. While there was an overall low level of doxy-PEP concern, respondents noted concerns about the development of antibiotic drug resistance, doxycycline side effects, and cost. Lastly, respondents generally believed doxy-PEP would impact sexual behavior, but more so within the broader community than their own.

Similar results were found in two other studies representing patient beliefs and attitudes towards doxy-PEP in California. Spinelli and colleagues found high doxy-PEP interest among 84% of MSM survey respondents using a social networking application. While no difference in doxy-PEP interest was observed between participants on HIV PrEP and PWH, notable associated factors for doxy-PEP interest included condomless sex and STI diagnosis within the past year. Further, Park and colleagues found high doxy-PEP interest among 68% of MSM who completed an online survey study in California, US. In this study, STI diagnosis within the past year and HIV PrEP were both associated with doxy-PEP acceptability. Similarly, we found HIV PrEP respondents were more interested in doxy-PEP compared to PWH. This could be related to differences in demographics and sexual practices as HIV PrEP respondents generally reported higher risk sexual behaviors with more sexual partners, anonymous partners, and STIs compared to PWH respondents. Yet, our findings further highlight the disparities observed in STI incidence among key subgroups. Focused educational efforts for STI prevention interventions like doxy-PEP are needed for marginalized populations disparately effected by STIs and the providers who are caring for them. Providers should consider engaging all patients meeting criteria for use, regardless of HIV status, doxy-PEP interest, or risk of individual sexual practices, in discussions centered on STI/HIV prevention and education on interventions, such as doxy-PEP with potential doxy-PEP initiation after shared decision making.

Number-needed-to-treat for STI prevention via doxyPEP

We next applied our estimates of doxyPEP effects on STI diagnoses and antibiotic fill-days to quantify net changes in tetracycline fill-days per incident STI diagnosis prevented. We estimated that doxyPEP implementation would result in the equivalent of 76.0–93.9, 82.5–95.7, and 61.0–145.3 additional tetracycline fill-days for each prevented diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis, respectively, among all PrEP recipients and PLWH (Fig. 2 ; Table S16). For individuals within these strata who received ≥1 STI diagnosis in the preceding year, one diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis could be prevented with the equivalent of 32.2–36.5, 37.0–38.7, and 46.1–100.2 additional tetracycline fill-days, respectively. Increases in fill-days needed to prevent each gonorrhea and chlamydia diagnosis were only modestly lower among PrEP recipients and PLWH who received ≥2 or ≥3 STI diagnoses in the prior year.

Fig. 2 
Number-needed-to-treat for prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) via doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP).

We illustrate estimates of the excess tetracycline fill-days (standardized to resemble a 7-day treatment course for acute STI management) expected to occur for each diagnosis of gonorrhea (A), chlamydia (B), and syphilis (C) prevented by doxyPEP. We estimate the number-needed-to-treat by dividing the incidence rate differences for antibiotic use under counterfactual scenarios of doxyPEP receipt or non-receipt by the incidence rate difference for STI diagnoses under counterfactual scenarios of doxyPEP receipt or non-receipt. Populations encompass males and transgender individuals living with HIV (PLWH), who receive HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), or with a history of STI diagnoses in the preceding year. Follow-up for the estimates plotted encompasses 38,543 person-years at risk among PrEP recipients, 29,228 person-years at risk among PLWH, and 19,918 person-years at risk among people with prior STI diagnosis history, summed across all years of follow-up (2017–2019). Plotted points represent maximum-likelihood estimates and lines delineate 95% confidence intervals.

### To whom should we prescribe doxy-PEP? A retrospective review of public health surveillance data for bacterial STI diagnoses among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in ottawa, Canada [^20f5139a]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

In favour of doxy-PEP are findings from randomised controlled trials,which demonstrated that, when gbMSM used doxy-PEP after sexual contact, this intervention prevented syphilis and chlamydia acquisition by at least 70% and gonorrhoea by about 50%. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled studies,however, found that the preventive effect of doxy-PEP for gonorrhoea might be lower, ranging from 33% to 45%—and that its effect appeared to depend on local rates of gonorrhoea antibiotic resistanceand the site of infection (with potential lessened effectiveness for pharyngeal gonorrhoea infection).Also suggesting a more judicious use of doxy-PEP are medication side effects and the possibility of exacerbating antibiotic resistance.For side effects, doxycycline can cause photosensitivity and gastrointestinal upset (including oesophagitis).Regarding the development of antibiotic resistance, while most doxy-PEP studiesreported low rates of developed resistance for Staphylococcus aureus and no study reported any resistance for MRSA or Escherichia coli, other researchhas found that doxy-PEP use is associated with tetracycline-resistant group A streptococcus and S. aureus. Other concerns about doxy-PEP relate to healthcare burden: What volume of patients would be eligible for this intervention, and, if initiated, what might be the public health outcomes?

To understand the potential clinical demand and public health impact of doxy-PEP, we reviewed 4 years of public health bac-STI surveillance data for gbMSM in Ottawa, Canada, and analysed the number of infections and episodes of infections per person. We then estimated the number of individuals who would need treatment (ie, the number needed to treat (NNT)) to prevent a single bac-STI episode. Considering these data, we discuss the potential public health effects of offering doxy-PEP to gbMSM who have been diagnosed with 0, ≥1 or ≥2 bac-STI diagnoses.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^3b319c32]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV and STIs—Sexually active persons seeking HIV PEP should be evaluated for PrEP after completing their PEP course and testing negative for HIV, and genital hygiene methods after sexual exposure are ineffective in protecting against HIV and STIs and might increase the risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), certain STIs, and HIV infection. STI PEP in the form of doxycycline 200 mg taken after unprotected anal sex among MSM and transgender women demonstrated reduction in incident chlamydia and syphilis by 70% and 73%, respectively, but no effect on gonorrhea, and no long-term data are available regarding the impact of STI PEP on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome.
