## Question

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable colon cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in operable colon cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical question and the target population. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially FOxTROT and OPTICAL, and extract key outcomes. Next, I will examine safety, including obstruction risk and perioperative morbidity. After that, I should review subgroup considerations such as MMR status and T4 disease. Then, I need to check guideline positions and how they reconcile with trial data. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, acknowledge controversies, and outline future directions, making sure I double-check any overstatements along the way [^111UGPwg] [^115QURvw] [^113En9xL] [^111dDVCb].

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and population. We are evaluating short-course preoperative oxaliplatin–fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for radiologically staged locally advanced, operable colon cancer, typically cT3 with ≥ 5 mm extramural spread or cT4, N0–2, M0, where the comparator is upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, and the outcomes of interest include 2-year recurrence, R0 resection, pathologic downstaging, and safety signals such as obstruction and perioperative complications [^111UGPwg] [^1111gY5m] [^113En9xL].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized evidence. The FOxTROT phase III trial randomized 1,053 patients to 6 weeks of neoadjuvant oxaliplatin–fluoropyrimidine followed by surgery and 18 weeks of adjuvant therapy versus 24 weeks of postoperative chemotherapy, with a primary endpoint of residual disease or recurrence within 2 years; neoadjuvant therapy reduced 2-year recurrence from 21.5% to 16.9% (rate ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.98, P = 0.037) and increased histologically complete resections from 89% to 94%, with substantial T/N downstaging and tumor regression observed, and no excess in serious postoperative complications, which supports feasibility and early efficacy of sequencing part of chemotherapy before surgery [^111UGPwg] [^1111gY5m] [^115WNrJ6].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of the primary endpoint. A 28% relative reduction in 2-year recurrence is meaningful because recurrence risk is front-loaded in colorectal cancer; the authors note that using 2-year disease-free status instead of recurrence would have yielded a similar effect size and statistical significance, reinforcing that the signal is clinically credible even if overall survival was not mature at the time of reporting, which is expected given the study was not powered for OS [^11483Vou] [^116vvk9a].

> Next, I should review the OPTICAL phase III trial to ensure consistency. OPTICAL tested 3 months of mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX preoperatively versus upfront surgery with adjuvant therapy and did not meet its primary endpoint of improved 3-year DFS, though it achieved a 7% pathologic complete response and significant downstaging; importantly, there was a trend toward better DFS and a marked OS signal favoring neoadjuvant therapy, suggesting that while DFS was not statistically significant, pathologic benefits and potential survival gains are biologically plausible and may emerge with longer follow-up or in enriched subgroups [^115QURvw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety; I need to check obstruction risk and perioperative outcomes. In FOxTROT, 4.3% of patients on neoadjuvant therapy developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, yet most still underwent successful resection, and overall serious postoperative complications were not increased; importantly, a nested case–control analysis identified two pre-treatment predictors of high obstruction risk — endoscopic obstruction or inability to traverse the tumor and stricturing on imaging/endoscopy — which can be used to stratify patients and avoid delays in those at highest risk [^1111gY5m] [^115XB3hT] [^115AWvVv].

> I should confirm the role of MMR status because it may modulate benefit. In FOxTROT, MMR-deficient tumors had markedly lower regression rates and no reduction in 2-year recurrence with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas MMR-proficient tumors derived significant recurrence benefit, aligning with broader evidence that dMMR colon cancers respond poorly to conventional fluoropyrimidine–oxaliplatin chemotherapy; this argues for rapid MMR testing and consideration of immunotherapy strategies in dMMR disease rather than standard cytotoxic neoadjuvant therapy [^117HhLXf] [^112xCJC1] [^111u5znA].

> Let me consider T stage, especially cT4 disease, where local control and R0 resection are most challenging. Meta-analytic and observational data in T4 colon cancer show higher R0 rates and improved survival with neoadjuvant therapy compared with upfront surgery, and FOxTROT's downstaging signal, while diluted across the mixed T3–T4 cohort, is likely most impactful in T4 where margin positivity and multivisceral resections are more common; thus, T4 patients are a prime subgroup for neoadjuvant strategies pending definitive OS data [^116u2krf] [^112HYPzK] [^1111gY5m].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. NCCN advises that bulky nodal disease or clinical T4b may benefit from preoperative FOLFOX or CAPOX, and ASCRS suggests neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy can be considered to facilitate margin-negative resection in locally advanced cancers; notably, both bodies frame this as an option rather than a universal standard, reflecting that practice change is evolving but not yet mandated by mature survival data [^113En9xL] [^111dDVCb] [^112a6Mws].

> I need to ensure I address real-world implementation and overtreatment risk. National data show low uptake of neoadjuvant therapy and, in unselected cohorts, no OS advantage, likely reflecting selection bias, staging heterogeneity, and dilution of effect; conversely, single-center implementation reports demonstrate feasibility with modest workflow adjustments, and FOxTROT's own analysis estimates that about 24% of control patients were overtreated by radiologic upstaging, underscoring the need for improved selection and standardized imaging criteria to minimize unnecessary chemotherapy exposure [^111St7gK] [^112Uwq2c] [^116vvk9a].

> But wait, what about the biology of response and how it might guide adjuvant therapy. In FOxTROT, histologic regression after neoadjuvant therapy correlated strongly with freedom from recurrence, supporting the concept that chemo-sensitivity visible in the primary tumor may mirror systemic control; however, I should be cautious not to infer that patients with excellent regression should omit adjuvant therapy without prospective validation, as this remains investigational and could risk undertreatment if chemosensitive clones are precisely those benefiting most from full perioperative therapy [^115WNrJ6] [^112xCJC1].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while I double-check for internal consistency. For MMR-proficient, locally advanced colon cancer (cT3 with ≥ 5 mm extramural spread or cT4, N0–2), a 6-week preoperative oxaliplatin–fluoropyrimidine regimen followed by standard postoperative adjuvant therapy is a reasonable strategy that improves 2-year disease control and R0 resection without increasing serious perioperative morbidity; patients at high risk of obstruction should proceed directly to surgery, and MMR-deficient tumors should be channeled toward immunotherapy-based approaches rather than conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy [^115AWvVv] [^1111gY5m] [^111u5znA].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating survival benefits. While FOxTROT achieved a significant reduction in 2-year recurrence, OS differences were not statistically significant at the time of reporting, and OPTICAL did not meet its DFS endpoint; therefore, I should frame neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a promising, guideline-supported option with clear pathologic and early disease-control benefits, especially in T4 and pMMR disease, rather than a proven OS-altering standard pending longer follow-up and confirmatory trials [^1111gY5m] [^115QURvw] [^113En9xL].

> Finally, I need to outline future directions and uncertainties. Ongoing and planned trials, including FOxTROT2 in older or frail patients and FOxTROT3 testing triplet intensification, will refine selection and regimens; integration of ctDNA and molecular stratification may help personalize neoadjuvant and adjuvant decisions; and for dMMR cancers, neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials are poised to redefine preoperative management, though vigilance for progression and standardized response assessment remain critical to avoid compromising resectability [^111if2r6] [^116vvk9a] [^114KJgsC].

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a **preoperative treatment** for operable colon cancer, typically using FOLFOX or CAPOX for 6 weeks in locally advanced (T3–T4 or N+) disease [^111UGPwg]. The FOxTROT trial showed that NAC **reduced 2-year recurrence** versus standard adjuvant therapy (16.9% vs 21.5%) and improved histopathologic completeness of resection (94% vs 89%) without increasing perioperative morbidity [^111UGPwg] [^1111gY5m]. NAC is now **guideline-supported** for select patients with bulky nodal disease or clinical T4b tumors, but is not standard for all operable colon cancer [^113En9xL] [^112a6Mws]. Benefits include earlier treatment of micrometastases, tumor downstaging, and assessment of chemosensitivity; risks include overtreatment of low-risk patients and potential obstruction, which can be mitigated by careful selection and monitoring [^115ENLKL] [^115AWvVv].

---

## Clinical rationale and potential benefits

NAC offers several theoretical and practical advantages over traditional adjuvant chemotherapy, including:

- **Early treatment of micrometastatic disease**: NAC initiates systemic therapy earlier, potentially eradicating micrometastases before surgical resection [^111JGz3x].

- **Tumor downstaging**: NAC can reduce tumor size, facilitating easier surgical resection and potentially improving the likelihood of negative margins [^114pFMgS] [^1111gY5m].

- **Assessment of chemosensitivity**: Tumor response to NAC provides valuable prognostic information and may guide postoperative treatment decisions [^1111gY5m] [^112xCJC1].

- **Improved tolerability**: Preoperative chemotherapy may be better tolerated than postoperative therapy, as patients are generally healthier before major surgery [^115ENLKL].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting neoadjuvant chemotherapy

Several clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of NAC in operable colon cancer, with the FOxTROT trial providing the most robust evidence to date [^11483Vou].

---

### FOxTROT trial (2023)

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 1,053 patients with radiologically staged T3–4, N0–2, M0 colon cancer [^111UGPwg].

- **Intervention**: Six weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy followed by surgery and 18 weeks of postoperative chemotherapy, compared to standard postoperative chemotherapy alone [^111UGPwg].

- **Primary outcome**: Significant reduction in residual disease or recurrence within 2 years (16.9% vs 21.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.98) [^111UGPwg] [^1111gY5m].

- **Secondary outcomes**: Increased tumor regression, improved histopathologic completeness of resection (94% vs 89%), and no significant increase in perioperative complications [^111UGPwg] [^1111gY5m].

- **Conclusion**: NAC is superior to standard postoperative chemotherapy in reducing early recurrence and improving disease control without increasing surgical morbidity [^111UGPwg] [^1111gY5m].

---

### Other clinical trials

The **OPTICAL trial** evaluated mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX as NAC in locally advanced colon cancer and showed substantial pathologic downstaging and a trend toward improved disease-free survival, though the primary DFS endpoint did not reach statistical significance [^115QURvw]. The **PRODIGE 22 trial** likewise reported significant tumor regression and downstaging with perioperative FOLFOX, but no significant difference in 3-year overall or disease-free survival compared with adjuvant therapy alone [^117B8Gjf].

---

## Safety and tolerability

NAC has been shown to be **generally safe and well-tolerated**, with no significant increase in perioperative complications compared to standard care [^111UGPwg]. However, there is a small risk of bowel obstruction during the preoperative period, particularly in patients with obstructing or stricturing tumors [^115AWvVv]. Careful patient selection and close monitoring are essential to mitigate this risk [^115XB3hT].

---

## Patient selection criteria

NAC is **not universally applicable** to all patients with operable colon cancer. Current guidelines and clinical evidence support its use in selected patients with **high-risk features**, including:

- **Bulky nodal disease**: Large or clinically apparent lymph node involvement [^113En9xL].

- **Clinical T4 tumors**: Tumors invading adjacent organs or structures [^1141Todr].

- **Locally advanced disease**: T3 tumors with significant extramural spread or T4 tumors without distant metastasis [^113En9xL].

Patients with **early-stage disease, low-risk features, or significant comorbidities** may not benefit from NAC and may be better managed with standard surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated [^116hvWTD].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Major oncology guidelines have begun to incorporate NAC into clinical practice, albeit cautiously. The **NCCN guidelines** recommend considering neoadjuvant therapy for patients with bulky nodal disease or clinical T4b tumors, with FOLFOX or CAPOX as preferred regimens [^113En9xL]. The **ASCRS guidelines** similarly advise considering neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer to facilitate margin-negative resection [^111dDVCb].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite promising results, several limitations and controversies persist:

- **Lack of overall survival benefit**: Most trials have not demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, limiting widespread adoption of NAC as standard care [^116K1491].

- **Overtreatment risk**: Inaccurate radiologic staging may lead to overtreatment of low-risk patients, exposing them to unnecessary chemotherapy toxicity [^116vvk9a].

- **Need for further research**: Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to define optimal patient selection, chemotherapy regimens, and duration of preoperative therapy [^111if2r6].

---

## Future directions

Ongoing research aims to refine patient selection, optimize chemotherapy regimens, and integrate novel therapies such as immunotherapy for dMMR/MSI-H tumors [^111if2r6] [^111u5znA]. Biomarker-driven strategies and improved imaging techniques are expected to enhance the precision and effectiveness of NAC in operable colon cancer [^114pFMgS] [^113TT8aZ].

---

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising approach for select patients with **operable colon cancer**, particularly those with locally advanced disease. The FOxTROT trial demonstrates significant improvements in early disease control and surgical outcomes without increasing **perioperative morbidity** [^111UGPwg]. However, further research is needed to establish **overall survival benefits** and define optimal patient selection criteria [^116vvk9a].

The study FOxTROT was published by Dion Morton and colleagues in 2023 in the journal J Clin Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Colon cancer. In the FOxTROT study, the trial question was: what is the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with operable colon cancer? In the FOxTROT study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the FOxTROT study, the population was: 1053 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with radiologically staged T3–4, N0–2, M0 colon cancer. The key exclusion criteria were strong evidence of distant metastases or peritoneal nodules; peritonitis; colonic obstruction that has not been defunctioned; serious medical comorbidity; malignant disease within the preceding 5 years. In the FOxTROT study, the interventions were: n = 699 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine 6 weeks preoperatively plus 18 weeks postoperatively) n = 354 standard postoperative chemotherapy (postoperative chemotherapy for 24 weeks). In the FOxTROT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of residual disease or recurrence within 2 years (16.9% vs. 21.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98). In the FOxTROT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in mild or moderate tumor regression (58% vs. 18%; RR 3.22, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.13) No significant difference in death from colon cancer (12.3% vs. 15.3%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.05) No significant difference in death from all causes (15% vs. 17.8%; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.06). In the FOxTROT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess, wound infection, bronchopneumonia, rash, neutropenia. significant differences in requirement of further abdominal surgery (4.3% vs. 7.1%), PE or DVT (2.5% vs. 0.6%). In the FOxTROT study, the conclusion was: in patients with radiologically staged T3–4, N0–2, M0 colon cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was superior to standard postoperative chemotherapy with respect to the rate of residual disease or recurrence within 2 years.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cancer worldwide, with 1.7 million diagnoses annually. Standard treatment is surgery followed by adjuvant oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for those with a moderate- to high-risk disease. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), 20%-30% of patients develop recurrent disease that is usually incurable. Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has substantially improved outcomes in other gastrointestinal cancers, and has potential advantages over postoperative AC in colon cancer. Shrinking tumors before surgery may reduce the risk of incomplete resection and tumor cell-shedding during surgery.NAC can start many weeks earlier than AC so could be more effective in eradicating micrometastases, particularly as surgery induces growth factor activity, potentially stimulating tumor proliferation before AC is started. In addition, response to NAC, unlike AC, is observable, so could potentially guide subsequent treatment decisions.

However, there are potential disadvantages of NAC that have delayed its evaluation in colon cancer. Might toxicity during NAC compromise fitness for surgery or increase perioperative complications? Might chemoresistant cancers progress during NAC reducing the chance of surgical cure? Given the imprecision of radiologic staging, might low-risk patients be exposed to the toxicities and inconvenience of chemotherapy when surgery alone might have been considered sufficient?

By 2008, oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combinations had demonstrated good efficacy and tolerability as both adjuvant and advanced disease treatment, and spiral computed tomography (CT) scans could more reliably identify moderate- to high-risk colon cancers. We therefore initiated Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Targeted Receptor pre-Operative Therapy (FOxTROT), a randomized trial assessing the benefits and risks of advancing part of standard AC into the NAC setting. A short duration of NAC — just 6 weeks — was chosen to minimize the risk of on-treatment progression or residual toxicity. The planned total duration of chemotherapy was equal in both arms, allowing evaluation of sequencing rather than duration. An optional subrandomization evaluated whether, as in RAS -wildtype (wt) metastatic disease, adding panitumumab enhances response to NAC. An internal safety and feasibility pilot was included.

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^114pFMgS]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

A particular strength of neoadjuvant over metastatic studies is that pre-treatment and post-treatment tissue samples are available to assess markers of tumour response. If validated as a surrogate of long-term oncological outcome, regression grading provides the most statistically sensitive measure of chemosensitivity to allow identification of predictive molecular markers and, potentially, to guide postoperative adjuvant treatment. Radiological assessment after preoperative therapy provided supportive evidence for real downstaging and could also be useful in assessment of primary tumour response and the potential value of extending preoperative therapy.

In summary, we have shown that patients with locally advanced, but resectable, colon cancer can be appropriately selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CT scanning, can be molecularly stratified preoperatively, and can safely undergo preoperative chemotherapy followed by colonic resectional surgery, without incurring significant perioperative morbidity. We have also shown significant downstaging of primary tumours, including fewer incomplete resections and reduced apical lymph node metastases, after only 6 weeks of combination therapy. On the basis of these promising findings from the pilot phase, proceeding to the ongoing FOxTROT phase 3 study is appropriate; we aim to enrol at least a further 900 patients. If preoperative therapy results in fewer recurrences, as well as tumour downstaging, the established pathway of surgery then chemotherapy in the management of colon cancer could potentially change.

Introduction

Preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and radiotherapy are substantially more effective than similar postoperative therapy in oesophageal, gastric, and rectal cancer. Earlier treatment might be more effective at eradicating micrometastatic disease than the same treatment 3 months later, the typical period between diagnosis and starting postoperative chemotherapy, particularly because surgery increases growth factor activity in the early postoperative period, promoting more rapid tumour progression.

Shrinking of tumours before surgery might also reduce the frequency of tumour cell shedding during surgeryand of incomplete excision. Surgical resection margin involvement correlates strongly with locoregional recurrence, which can have a more aggressive phenotypeand respond poorly to systemic therapy. Other potential advantages of preoperative therapy are to make minimum access surgery practicable, enabling earlier return to normal activity, and better tolerability than similar treatment after major surgery, hence allowing increased dose intensity. Assessment of response to preoperative chemotherapy might also be useful in guiding postoperative drug selection.

Immunotherapy as upfront treatment in operable CRC

For operable colon cancer (stages I–III), traditional management has been surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for those at high risk of relapse, typically high-risk stage II and all stage III colon cancer. In rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are more frequently used to improve local control ahead of surgery. However, there has been recent interest in using neoadjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer patients, particularly in those with locally advanced tumours.

The large multicentre trial (FOxTROT) investigating the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk colon cancer has not yet produced results on final outcomes, including survival data. Currently, the standard of care for operable stage I–III colon cancer is surgery upfront, with adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk features. Little is known about immunotherapy in operable CRC, although a higher rate (around 25 per cent for colon cancer) of dMMR/MSI-H is expected in this setting, compared to metastatic CRC (dMMR reported to be 6–8 per cent) (Fig. 2). Hence, the prospect of a clinical benefit in operable colon cancer should be higher, particularly if guided by the relatively higher frequency of dMMR tumours. Also, rectal cancers with dMMR have a poor response to conventional radiochemotherapy, with anecdotal reports of a very good response to immunotherapy. One study in patients with rectal cancer investigated pretreatment biopsies and found an association between high tumour mutational burden and high T cell infiltration to have a better subsequent response to radiochemotherapy, possibly suggesting that adding immunotherapy may further enhance this effect.

PURPOSE

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has potential advantages over standard postoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer but requires formal evaluation.

METHODS

Patients with radiologically staged T3–4, N0–2, M0 colon cancer were randomly allocated (2:1) to 6 weeks oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine preoperatively plus 18 postoperatively (NAC group) or 24 weeks postoperatively (control group). Patients with RAS -wildtype tumors could also be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive panitumumab or not during NAC. The primary end point was residual disease or recurrence within 2 years. Secondary outcomes included surgical morbidity, histopathologic stage, regression grade, completeness of resection, and cause-specific mortality. Log-rank analyses were by intention-to-treat.

RESULTS

Of 699 patients allocated to NAC, 674 (96%) started and 606 (87%) completed NAC. In total, 686 of 699 (98.1%) NAC patients and 351 of 354 (99.2%) control patients underwent surgery. Thirty patients (4.3%) allocated to NAC developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, but there were fewer serious postoperative complications with NAC than with control. NAC produced marked T and N downstaging and histologic tumor regression (all P < .001). Resection was more often histopathologically complete: 94% (648/686) versus 89% (311/351), P < .001. Fewer NAC than control patients had residual or recurrent disease within 2 years (16.9% [118/699] v 21.5% [76/354]; rate ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98]; p = 0.037). Tumor regression correlated strongly with freedom from recurrence. Panitumumab did not enhance the benefit from NAC. Little benefit from NAC was seen in mismatch repair–deficient tumors.

CONCLUSION

Six weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for operable colon cancer can be delivered safely, without increasing perioperative morbidity. This chemotherapy regimen, when given preoperatively, produces marked histopathologic down-staging, fewer incomplete resections, and better 2-year disease control. Histologic regression after NAC is a strong predictor of lower postoperative recurrence risk so has potential use as a guide for postoperative therapy. Six weeks of NAC should be considered as a treatment option for locally advanced colon cancer.

Conclusion

There is still a need to evaluate what role and what effect there is to expect from neoadjuvant immunotherapy to potentiate surgery or even to replace surgical resection altogether in the future. It is an attractive option to potentially replace the need for cancer surgery with that of an effective oral drug alone; however, this should only be considered if the oncological outcome is sustained over time with a comparable or favorable complication profile and with comparable oncological outcomes.

Of 699 patients allocated to NAC, 674 (96%) started and 606 (87%) completed NAC. In total, 686 of 699 (98.1%) NAC patients and 351 of 354 (99.2%) control patients underwent surgery. Thirty patients (4.3%) allocated to NAC developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, but there were fewer serious postoperative complications with NAC than with control. NAC produced marked T and N downstaging and histologic tumor regression (all P < .001). Resection was more often histopathologically complete: 94% (648/686) versus 89% (311/351), P < .001. Fewer NAC than control patients had residual or recurrent disease within 2 years (16.9% [118/699] v 21.5% [76/354]; rate ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98]; p = 0.037). Tumor regression correlated strongly with freedom from recurrence. Panitumumab did not enhance the benefit from NAC. Little benefit from NAC was seen in mismatch repair-deficient tumors.

Conclusion

Six weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for operable colon cancer can be delivered safely, without increasing perioperative morbidity. This chemotherapy regimen, when given preoperatively, produces marked histopathologic down-staging, fewer incomplete resections, and better 2-year disease control. Histologic regression after NAC is a strong predictor of lower postoperative recurrence risk so has potential use as a guide for postoperative therapy. Six weeks of NAC should be considered as a treatment option for locally advanced colon cancer.

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^115f7GnS]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Discussion

FOxTROT is, to our knowledge, the first randomised trial to evaluate preoperative chemotherapy in primary colon cancer (panel). The pilot phase has provided clear evidence of downstaging with only 6 weeks of preoperative treatment. The significant reductions in apical node involvement, incomplete resections, and two pathological complete responses, are noteworthy since all have previously been shown to correlate with protracted disease-free survival. Tumour regression grading after preoperative chemotherapy also correlates with recurrence risk in other gastointestinal malignancies, and longer follow-up of the FOxTROT cohort should establish whether tumour regression grading is similarly prognostic in colon cancer.

### Neoadjuvant immunotherapy followed by surgery compared with upfront surgery alone in operable colon cancer with deficient mismatch repair: modeling oncological outcomes and numbers needed to treat [^111J6EZt]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current questions regarding the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in resectable colon cancer include determining which patients should receive immune checkpoint inhibitors upfront and how immune response may be elicited in early-stage colon cancers. Furthermore, even if complete response is reported at the time of pathology, the question remains whether this is sustainable over time if the tumor field is left in situ (i.e. not removed by surgery but subjected to surveillance), and if patients are still at risk of recurrence even if an initial immunotherapy effect is solicited. Another current issue is the cost of incorporating immunotherapy, as routinely administering it to all eligible patients would increase healthcare expenditure without demonstrating proven benefits to key oncological outcomes, such as the effect on overall survival.

The aim of this study was to compare data from a landmark neoadjuvant immunotherapy trial with a consecutive, real-life cohort, in terms of patient selection and putative clinical outcomes related to a scenario for which neoadjuvant immunotherapy could have been implemented. The related risk for recurrence, survival, complication patterns, and numbers needed to treat (NNT) is estimated and discussed.

### Preoperative chemotherapy for operable colon cancer: mature results of an international randomized controlled trial [^111gzmVu]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

We chose a short, 6-week neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of toxicity impairing surgical fitness, and chemoresistant cancers progressing to inoperability. This choice appears justified: NAC was well tolerated, with high completion rates. Surgical morbidity appeared lower rather than higher, which may be due to tumor downsizing after NAC. Despite the fact that one third of NAC patients showed no discernible histologic regression, only 4% developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, and all but one who did so were still able to undergo successful primary cancer resection. Therefore, pending randomized trials to explore longer durations, a 6-week NAC treatment remains our recommendation.

Over 80 hospitals took part in FOxTROT indicating that the results of this real world trial are generalizable to clinical practice. The median age of patients was 63, somewhat younger than in an unselected colon cancer population, but similar to that in pivotal AC trials. Just 28% (292/1,052) were aged over 70 years, compared with about 50% of incident cases, so they are likely to represent a fitter subset of older patients. However, it is still notable that they benefited at least as much from NAC as the younger patients.

In summary, patients with locally advanced but resectable colon cancer, selected using standard CT, may safely undergo 6 weeks of NAC before colon resection and then completion of AC. This does not increase perioperative morbidity, substantial tumor regression is achieved, and disease control is significantly better at 2 years than with the same chemotherapy given entirely postoperatively. NAC, like AC, is of less certain benefit in dMMR than pMMR cancers. Tumor regression after NAC is a strong predictor of lower postoperative recurrence risk and may provide a useful guide for later treatment. Six weeks of NAC should be considered as a treatment option for patients with locally advanced colon cancer.

Recurrence and Survival

The primary outcome, residual or recurrent disease within 2 years, occurred less often in NAC group patients: 16.9% (118/699) NAC versus 21.5% (76/354) control. This corresponded to a 28% lower recurrence rate with NAC than control: rate ratio (RR) = 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98, P = 0.037, Fig 3). The proportional reductions in colon cancer–specific mortality (RR = 0.74 [95% CI, 0.52 to 1.05, P = 0.095]), and all-cause mortality (RR = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06, P = 0.104]) were of similar magnitude but did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in death from noncolon cancer causes: 19 (2.7%) of 699 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) patients compared with 9 (2.5%) of 354 control patients (P = 0.87).

Risk of recurrence was strongly related to histologic regression grade (Fig 2 B): 5-year recurrence was 30% for those with no regression, falling progressively to 22% in mild, 13% in moderate, 7% in marked, and 0% in complete regression categories. Conversely, in the control group (not receiving NAC), the recurrence rate for the few tumors with a histologic appearance scored as mild (58/333 [17%]) or moderate (2/333 [1%]) regression was, if anything, higher than in tumors with no regression (RR = 1.66 [95% CI, 0.91 to 3.03], P = 0.102, Fig 2 C).

### Neoadjuvant immunotherapy followed by surgery compared with upfront surgery alone in operable colon cancer with deficient mismatch repair: modeling oncological outcomes and numbers needed to treat [^113PQf7w]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer burden and deaths worldwide, and its incidence is increasing. Despite undergoing surgical treatment with intent to cure, a considerable number of patients will still develop recurrence or distant metastasis and eventually die from the disease. Hence, systemic control is important and is achieved through both adjuvant chemotherapy and, more recently, neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. In operable stages I–III colon cancer, the risk for overtreatment with adjuvant chemotherapy is of concern, as many patients can be cured from surgery alone, and the risk for recurrence may be very low. Unfortunately, conventional chemotherapy administered as adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment has limitations in its effectiveness and precision; hence, a more targeted therapy is desired, preferably tailored to the intrinsic tumor biology. Immunotherapy has proven to be highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) metastatic CRCs. – Consequently, studies have investigated, and reported on, the use of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in resectable, early-stage colon cancer, but with no data on the effect of hard oncological endpoints such as implications on recurrence or risk of death from cancer. Furthermore, in rectal cancer with dMMR tumor, the option for an organ-sparing approach is attractive to patients, but organ-sparing may be less relevant in colon cancers. Currently, many trials are underway to further test the neoadjuvant immunotherapy approach in patients with resectable, non-metastatic colon and rectal tumors. Notably, the prevalence of dMMR in rectal cancer is < 3%, while the majority of dMMR tumors are found in the colon, with a prevalence of up to 15–25% reported. The overall prognosis for stage I–III colon cancer is generally good, and has been reported to be excellent for patients with dMMR; however, the risk of recurrence is related to T stage and metastasis to lymph nodes.

Bowel obstruction is a serious complication of colonic cancer and accounts for 50% of mortality within a year of diagnosis. It is the precipitant for the majority of emergency bowel cancer surgery, which incurs a 3-fold higher risk of death compared with a planned operation. – Bowel obstruction also has a detrimental impact on longer-term survival and oncological outcomes.

The Fluoropyrimidine, Oxaliplatin and Targeted-Receptor pre-Operative Therapy for patients with high-risk, operable colon cancer (FOxTROT) trialhas demonstrated the safety and efficacy of short-course neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with high-risk operable colon cancer. A substantial and rapid response to NAC was observed at histopathologic assessment of the resected tumor; up to 60% treated with a 6-week duration of NAC had tumor regression at surgery, which translated into a 25% reduction in recurrent or persistent disease at 2 years, compared with straight to surgeryand NAC can now be considered a therapeutic option in this patient group. However, for patients undergoing NAC, deferring surgery can put patients at risk of colonic obstruction. Oncologists need to be aware of this risk to their patients, as timely management is critical.

As more integrated treatment pathways are developed for high-risk colonic cancer, improved patient stratification for large bowel obstruction risk will be required. Recognizing patient's risk factors would inform the consent process, enrich multidisciplinary team (MDT) decision-making, and enable targeted active monitoring.

This study aimed to identify clinical, pathologic, radiologic, and endoscopic features of colon cancer that can be used to stratify patients at risk of bowel obstruction. This sought to inform perioperative management of locally advanced colon cancer.

### Colon cancer: feeling the imbalance? [^112fz6Fb]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

While neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard of care for rectal cancers in most centres, there is much interest in neoadjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer after the recent publication of the FOxTROT trial. The management of colon cancers seems to be heading down the same path as rectal cancer, where the radicality of surgery is replaced by chemotherapy intensification. The role of demanding procedures such as complete mesocolic excision with central venous ligation in this new paradigm of upfront chemotherapy remains uncertain and uninvestigated.

### Preoperative chemotherapy for operable colon cancer: mature results of an international randomized controlled trial [^11483Vou]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

FOxTROT is, to our knowledge, the first phase III trial evaluating NAC in operable colon cancer. It shows that short-course (6-week) NAC can be delivered safely and produces substantial tumor regression and downstaging, reducing the likelihood of incomplete resection. The primary objective — to detect a reduction in residual or recurrent disease within 2 years — was achieved, with a 28% lower event rate with NAC than AC. Chemotherapy toxicity was similar whether given before or after surgery, and surgical complications were, if anything, less in the NAC group.

FOxTROT results indicate that NAC then AC may be superior to conventional postoperative chemotherapy. Current clinical guidelines recommend preoperative chemotherapy as an option only for cT4 colon cancer because of low-quality evidence. It is therefore especially important to scrutinize the validity of the FOxTROT findings, and what guidance these provide for those considering implementing NAC.

Perhaps the first question is whether the observed reduction in 2-year residual or recurrent disease is sufficient to support a change in practice. This primary outcome was chosen because chemotherapy effects on recurrence are concentrated in the first 2 years, so we anticipated that any greater efficacy of NAC over AC would also be seen in this period, and this was precisely what we found. Also, most postoperative therapies that reduce early colorectal cancer recurrence also improve long-term survival. Hence, 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) is accepted as a basis to change practice. Unlike DFS, deaths from causes unrelated to cancer were not included in our primary outcome as, with both groups receiving chemotherapy, similar numbers were anticipated. Such deaths provide an important safety signal but are not a measure of efficacy. There were just 10 within 2 years and, reassuringly, fewer in the NAC than control group. So, had we used DFS rather than 2-year recurrence as primary outcome, the results would have been similar: RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93; p = 0.014 (Data Supplement). So, also, would a crude comparison of proportions of patients disease-free at the 2-year time point (82.5% [577/699] NAC v 76.8% [272/354] control, P = 0.027).

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^111TotoB]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and radiotherapy are more effective than similar postoperative treatment for oesophageal, gastric, and rectal cancers, perhaps because of more effective micrometastasis eradication and reduced risk of incomplete excision and tumour cell shedding during surgery. The FOxTROT trial aims to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy for colon cancer.

Methods

In the pilot stage of this randomised controlled trial, 150 patients with radiologically staged locally advanced (T3 with ≥ 5 mm invasion beyond the muscularis propria or T4) tumours from 35 UK centres were randomly assigned (2:1) to preoperative (three cycles of OxMdG [oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), l-folinic acid 175 mg, fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus, then 2400 mg/m(2) by 46 h infusion] repeated at 2-weekly intervals followed by surgery and a further nine cycles of OxMdG) or standard postoperative chemotherapy (12 cycles of OxMdG). Patients with KRAS wild-type tumours were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive panitumumab (6 mg/kg; every 2 weeks with the first 6 weeks of chemotherapy) or not. Treatment allocation was through a central randomisation service using a minimised randomisation procedure including age, radiological T and N stage, site of tumour, and presence of defunctioning colostomy as stratification variables. Primary outcome measures of the pilot phase were feasibility, safety, and tolerance of preoperative therapy, and accuracy of radiological staging. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 87163246.

Findings

96% (95 of 99) of patients started and 89% (85 of 95) completed preoperative chemotherapy with grade 3–4 gastrointestinal toxicity in 7% (seven of 94) of patients. All 99 tumours in the preoperative group were resected, with no significant differences in postoperative morbidity between the preoperative and control groups: 14% (14 of 99) versus 12% (six of 51) had complications prolonging hospital stay (p = 0·81). 98% (50 of 51) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had T3 or more advanced tumours confirmed at post-resection pathology compared with 91% (90 of 99) of patients following preoperative chemotherapy (p = 0·10). Preoperative therapy resulted in significant downstaging of TNM5 compared with the postoperative group (p = 0·04), including two pathological complete responses, apical node involvement (1% [one of 98] vs 20% [ten of 50], p < 0·0001), resection margin involvement (4% [four of 99] vs 20% [ten of 50], p = 0·002), and blinded centrally scored tumour regression grading: 31% (29 of 94) vs 2% (one of 46) moderate or greater regression (p = 0·0001).

Interpretation

Preoperative chemotherapy for radiologically staged, locally advanced operable primary colon cancer is feasible with acceptable toxicity and perioperative morbidity. Proceeding to the phase 3 trial, to establish whether the encouraging pathological responses seen with preoperative therapy translates into improved long-term oncological outcome, is appropriate.

NCCN Colon Cancer — neoadjuvant chemotherapy for resectable colon cancer notes that for bulky nodal disease or clinical T4b, neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFOX or CAPEOX may be considered prior to surgery. In FOxTROT feasibility, one hundred fifty patients with T3 (with ≥ 5 mm invasion beyond the muscularis propria) or T4 tumors were randomly assigned to three cycles of preoperative fluorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin followed by surgery and nine additional cycles, or to surgery with 12 cycles postoperatively, and preoperative therapy resulted in significant downstaging compared with postoperative therapy (P = 0.04). Mature results reported on 1053 total randomized patients, including 699 randomized to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 354 to the control group; the primary outcome of 2-year residual or recurrent disease was 16.9% with neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to 21.5% in the control group, and resection was more often histopathologically complete with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (94% vs. 89%; P < .001). These results support the feasibility of neoadjuvant therapy as a treatment option for colon cancer.

### Is there a role for neoadjuvant systemic therapy for cT4bM0 colon cancer? A propensity score-matched analysis of the national cancer database [^112HYPzK]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonmetastatic T4b colon cancer has been traditionally treated with upfront surgery, often requiring technically challenging multiorgan resection. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can potentially downsize these tumors and improve their resectability.

Objective

This study aimed to explore trends and outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use compared to upfront surgery in patients with nonmetastatic T4b colon cancer. This study also sought to determine factors associated with increased neoadjuvant chemotherapy use and with overall survival.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Settings

Conducted using the National Cancer Database.

Patients

Patients with nonmetastatic T4b colon cancer who underwent colectomy (2006–2016) were included in the study. Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were propensity-matched (1:2) to those who underwent upfront surgery in either clinically node-negative or node-positive disease.

Main Outcome Measures

Postoperative outcomes (length of stay, 30-d readmission, 30/90-d mortality), oncologic resection adequacy (R0 rate, number of resected/positive nodes), and overall survival were the main outcome measures.

Results

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used in 7.7% of the patients. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy use increased over the study period from 4% to 16% in the entire cohort, from 3% to 21% in patients with clinically node-positive disease, and from 6% to 12% in patients with clinically node-negative disease. Factors associated with increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy included younger age (OR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96–0.98; p < 0.001), male sex (OR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11–1.64; p = 0.002), recent diagnosis year (OR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12–1.20; p < 0.001), academic centers (OR 2.65; 95% CI, 2.19–3.22; p < 0.001), clinically node-positive (OR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01–1.49; p = 0.037), and tumor located in the sigmoid colon (OR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.97–3.02; p < 0.001). Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had significantly higher R0 resection compared with upfront surgery (87% vs 77%; p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with higher overall survival (HR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64–0.91; p = 0.002). On propensity-matched analyses, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival compared to upfront surgery in patients with clinically node-positive disease (57% vs 43%; p = 0.003) but not in patients with clinically node-negative disease (61% vs 56%; p = 0.090).

Limitations

Retrospective design.

Conclusion

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy use for nonmetastatic T4b has increased significantly on the national level, more so in patients with clinically node-positive disease. Patients with node-positive disease treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy had higher overall survival compared to those who underwent upfront surgery.

### The landmark series: chemotherapy for non-metastatic colon cancer [^1141KaMq]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Micrometastatic disease that is present at the time of surgery is responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths in patients with what is otherwise perceived to be local and regional colon cancer. The goal of perioperative therapy is to eliminate microscopic residual disease that would otherwise be left behind following surgery. A secondary goal specific to neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy is to downstage tumors deemed potentially not amenable to an R0 resection on the basis of a suspected T4b primary (locally invading into a surrounding structure). In this landmark series paper, we review the current standard for perioperative therapy in patients with colon cancer.

NCCN Colon Cancer — initial management and adjuvant therapy emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach, prioritization of clinical trials over standard therapy, and determination of MSI/MMR at diagnosis because recommendations can vary at all stages. For resectable disease, the recommended operation is an en bloc resection with adequate lymphadenectomy, with a goal of evaluating at least 12 nodes. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for stage III disease and is an option for some high-risk stage II patients, and the preferred regimens and duration depend on the pathologic stage and risk of recurrence. Patients with resectable T4b tumors or bulky nodal disease may receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy prior to colectomy.

### Incorporating neoadjuvant chemotherapy into locally advanced colon cancer treatment pathways: real-life experience of implementing FOxTROT [^112Uwq2c]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

The international FOxTROT trial, recently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology is the first randomized controlled trial testing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil in locally advanced, but operable, colon cancer. The trial met its primary endpoint with fewer patients experiencing recurrent or residual disease at 2years with NAC compared with the control (16.8% vs. 21.2%, risk ratio = 0.74, p = 0.042). Translating the findings of the FOxTROT trial into improved patient outcomes is dependent on implementation of new neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) pathways in colorectal cancer.

Method

We describe our experience implementing a novel neoadjuvant treatment pathway in colorectal cancer at a large UK teaching hospital.

Results

To date 64 patients have been commenced on the novel pathway following presentation and adoption of the FOxTROT trial results. We present key lessons and strategies developed across the multidisciplinary team to minimize impact on person hours, service capacity and budget, whilst building patient safety and confidence.

Conclusion

Use of NAC for locally advanced colon cancer has been shown to improve surgical outcomes and longer term cancer outcomes. Provision of NAC requires some modifications to current treatment pathways but can be delivered with team working and without the requirement for additional resources.

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^111qNq7b]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The FOxTROT study aims to randomly assign at least 1050 patients to detect a 25% proportional reduction (roughly 8% absolute difference) in recurrence at 2 years (eg, 32% reduced to 24%) with 80% power at p < 0·05. The prespecified sample size of 150 for the pilot phase was chosen pragmatically as a sufficient number to assess the potential rate of recruitment and any large differences in other primary outcomes. An independent steering committee advised whether to continue to the full study. Comparisons of preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy were by intention to treat including all patients randomly assigned to treatment groups, ignoring panitumumab allocation, and using t tests to compare continuous variables, Mantel-Haenszel tests of association for ordinal variables, and SAS 9.2 statistical software.

The trial is registered, number ISRCTN 87163246.

Role of the funding source

Introduction

Treatment of localized colon cancer typically involves complete mesocolic excision to ensure radicality. However, since 10–26% of colon cancers are at a locally advanced stage, extensive surgical resection leads to lower rates of adjacent organ preservation and increased positive surgical margins, postsurgical complications, and risk of local recurrence.

The degree of resection radicality significantly affects the long-term survival and local control (LC) in patients with locally advanced colon cancer (LACC). The incomplete resection with microscopic positive margins is a significant predictor of poor survival. Moreover, about 5% of colon cancers are initially inoperable due to extensive tumor infiltration, organ adherence, or lymph node metastasis. Therefore, converting unresectable LACC to a treatable status through neoadjuvant treatment is essential for these patients. Limited trials have demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) helps manage resectable LACC, downstaging the tumors and improving their regression rates with acceptable toxicity compared to postoperative therapy. However, few trials have investigated therapies that can convert unresectable LACC into a treatable disease.

The optimal treatment modality for LACC remains unclear owing to the lack of high-level clinical evidence. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal and esophageal cancers, given its ability to improve resection radicality, survival outcomes, and quality of life. However, the benefits of NACRT in LACC remain poorly understood, with only a few small-sample retrospective studies reporting its outcomes. We have previously presented several reports of over 100 patients with initially unresectable LACC receiving NACRT and subsequent surgical resection based on real-world clinical practice, with promising survival benefits. The encouraging results indicate that radiotherapy may be more beneficial than previously appreciated for the treatment of colon cancer. Nonetheless, no study has directly compared NACRT with NACT for LACC. Our randomized trial aims to investigate whether adding radiation to NACT can provide more surgical opportunities for patients with unresectable LACC, thereby improving their survival rates.

Locally advanced colon cancer — neoadjuvant therapy — Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy can result in tumor regression and may facilitate margin-negative excision of locally advanced cancers (weak recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B). A 2020 systematic review reported tumor volume reduction in two-thirds of patients, major pathologic regression in 4% to 37%, improved three-year disease-free survival in responders versus nonresponders (94% vs 63%, p = 0.005), and in matched cT4b patients a 23% lower three-year mortality with neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.6–0.98; p = 0.04), with no benefit for cT3 or cT4a tumors. In the FoXTROT trial, 1053 cT3–4N0–3M0 patients were randomized to oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy (12 cycles) or neoadjuvant therapy (3 cycles) followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (9 cycles); provisional results showed no differences in postoperative morbidity or mortality, significant T and N downstaging (p < 0.001), a pathological complete response rate of 3.8%, and a trend toward lower recurrent or persistent disease at two years (14.0% vs 17.5%). In PRODIGE 22 (104 patients with cT3–4 and/or N2), neoadjuvant chemotherapy increased tumor regression grades 1–2 (44% vs 8%, p < 0.001) and pTNM downstaging but showed no differences in three-year overall survival (90.3% vs 90.4%) or disease-free survival (76.8% vs 69.2%); clinical overstaging in one-third of control-arm patients was a limitation. An analysis of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) found three-year overall survival 74% vs 66% (p = 0.002) favoring neoadjuvant therapy in cT4b cancers and, after propensity matching, a 23% higher survival in the neoadjuvant group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60–0.98, p = 0.004), with no survival advantage for cT3 or cT4a. Neoadjuvant radiation therapy is not widely used, but single-center and NCDB studies concluded it may be associated with tumor downstaging, superior R0 resection rates, and improved overall survival in cT4 disease.

Moreover, tumours suitable for preoperative chemotherapy can now be accurately identified with a CT risk stratification algorithm based on the depth of tumour invasion beyond the muscularis propria. High-risk patients (stage T4 or T3 with ≥ 5 mm tumour invasion beyond muscularis propria) have a 53% 3-year recurrence-free survival compared with 87% for the good (T1/T2) or intermediate (T3 and < 5 mm tumour invasion beyond muscularis propria) prognostic groups.

The FOxTROT (Fluoropyrimidine Oxaliplatin and Targeted Receptor Pre-Operative Therapy) trial was designed to assess whether 6 weeks of an effective combination chemotherapy regimen given preoperatively to patients with radiologically staged, locally advanced, but potentially resectable colon cancer improves disease-free survival, and whether the addition of an EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody, panitumumab, to preoperative chemotherapy increases tumour shrinkage for patients with wild-type KRAS tumours. A feasibility phase, reported here, was incorporated to assess patient selection and recruitment, safety, and tumour response to preoperative treatment.

### Risk of bowel obstruction in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk colon cancer: a nested case-control-matched analysis of an international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (FOxTROT) [^115AWvVv]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to identify risk criteria available before the point of treatment initiation that can be used to stratify the risk of obstruction in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for high-risk colon cancer.

Background

Global implementation of NAC for colon cancer, informed by the FOxTROT trial, may increase the risk of bowel obstruction.

Methods

A case-control study, nested within an international randomized controlled trial (FOxTROT; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00647530). Patients with high-risk operable colon cancer (radiologically staged T3–4 N0–2 M0) that were randomized to NAC and developed large bowel obstruction were identified. First, clinical outcomes were compared between patients receiving NAC in FOxTROT who did and did not develop obstruction. Second, obstructed patients (cases) were age-matched and sex-matched with patients who did not develop obstruction (controls) in a 1:3 ratio using random sampling. Bayesian conditional mixed-effects logistic regression modeling was used to explore clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features associated with obstruction. The absolute risk of obstruction based on the presence or absence of risk criteria was estimated for all patients receiving NAC.

Results

Of 1053 patients randomized in FOxTROT, 699 received NAC, of whom 30 (4.3%) developed obstruction. Patients underwent care in European hospitals including 88 UK, 7 Danish, and 3 Swedish centers. There was more open surgery (65.4% vs 38.0%, P = 0.01) and a higher pR1 rate in obstructed patients (12.0% vs 3.8%, P = 0.004), but otherwise comparable postoperative outcomes. In the case-control-matched Bayesian model, 2 independent risk criteria were identified: (1) obstructing disease on endoscopy and/or being unable to pass through the tumor [adjusted odds ratio: 9.09, 95% credible interval: 2.34–39.66] and stricturing disease on radiology or endoscopy (odds ratio: 7.18, 95% CI: 1.84–32.34). Three risk groups were defined according to the presence or absence of these criteria: 63.4% (443/698) of patients were at very low risk (< 1%), 30.7% (214/698) at low risk (< 10%), and 5.9% (41/698) at high risk (> 10%).

Conclusions

Safe selection for NAC for colon cancer can be informed by using 2 features that are available before treatment initiation and identifying a small number of patients with a high risk of preoperative obstruction.

RESULTS

Characteristics of the Patients

Between May 15, 2008, and December 23, 2016, 1,053 (41%) of 2,591 potentially eligible patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to the NAC group (n = 699) or control group (n = 354), from 85 centers: 79 in the the United Kingdom (n = 949), three in Denmark (n = 88), and three in Sweden (n = 16). Baseline characteristics were balanced across groups (Data Supplement). Chosen chemotherapy was OxFU in 756 (72%), OxCap in 297 (28%); the planned total chemotherapy duration was 24 weeks in 992 (94%), and 12 weeks in 61 (6%). A total of 279 patients participated in the NAC ± panitumumab subrandomization. The median age was 63 years; baseline CT suggested T4 disease in 268 (25%) and lymph-node involvement in 792 (75%). The median follow-up was 3.1 (IQR, 2.5–4.9) years.

Another key finding is that a high-risk cohort suitable for combination chemotherapy can be identified by radiological assessment across multiple sites. The risk of exposing patients with early stage (pT2) disease to inappropriate chemotherapy was low, with only one patient of 51 (2%) being inaccurately upstaged, justifying the ongoing phase 3 trial. Chemotherapy for the 12% with pT3 tumours without additional risk factors is not unreasonable in view of the established efficacy of chemotherapy in stage 2 disease. In a parallel audit,93% of patients with radiologically staged T3 tumours with less than 5 mm invasion of the muscularis propria were found to have coexisting high-risk pathological features that justify chemotherapy and the eligibility criteria for the full FOxTROT study have been amended accordingly. As radiological staging of primary colon cancer is underdeveloped, a series of workshops — attended by 200 gastrointestinal radiologists — were held to standardise radiological selection criteria and similar training would be advisable in other neoadjuvant trials.

The population studied in FOxTROT seemed typical of those who might be considered for neoadjuvant therapy. The median age of 63 years is 10 years younger than the colon cancer population as a whole, but typical for trials of adjuvant chemotherapy. The distribution of tumours in the study largely reflects that of colonic tumours in the population, other than fewer tumours from the rectosigmoid region, probably because of consideration for radiotherapy, an exclusion criterion. The fairly high (20%) resection margin involvement in control patients is probably explained by more rigorous histopathological assessment and by selection of high-risk patients.

Delivery of KRAS mutation analysis across 35 UK sites was another challenge, since delay in treatment would preclude clinical use. Our 9-day median time from consent to KRAS testing to randomisation for panitumumab was achieved with a two-stage consent process and, importantly, a histopathology principal investigator at every site who helped to ensure that the biopsy sample was released for analysis promptly. Another concern that testing of small biopsies would be inaccurate also proved unfounded, with an assay failure rate of only 4%, and the concordance between KRAS mutation assays of matched samples from the multiple biopsies and resected tumour was 99%, showing the reliability of DNA-based assays of colon cancer biopsies.

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^115eVd5m]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Although an attractive concept, preoperative chemotherapy has not, until now, been assessed in operable colon cancer because of concerns that, if tumour growth occurred during the preoperative treatment phase, this could result in bowel obstruction necessitating emergency surgery, an outcome associated with high morbidity and mortality. Another concern is that inaccurate radiological tumour staging might result in inappropriate chemotherapy for low-risk patients. However, with more effective regimens and advances in radiological staging, preoperative chemotherapy has become a promising option.

Response rates higher than 50% are consistently achieved in metastatic colorectal cancer with chemotherapy regimens combining fluoropyrimidines with irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and even higher responses can be achieved — in KRAS wild-type tumours — by adding EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies, panitumumab or cetuximab, to combination chemotherapy. The proportional improvements in tumour response rate with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies depend on treatment stage, but the absolute improvements are similar: 15% (15% vs 0·4%, p < 0·0001), when used as single agents for patients who had not responded to standard chemotherapy, 18% (25% vs 7%, p < 0·0001), when added to second-line irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and 9% (57% vs 48%, p < 0·0001), when added to first-line chemotherapy (appendix). Efficacy of first-line anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies appears similar when background chemotherapy is fluorouracil or capecitabine-based and with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Thus, although EGFR-targeted therapies are ineffective, and might be harmful, in KRAS mutant tumours, response of metastatic KRAS wild-type colonic tumours is clearly increased by adding anti-EGFR therapies to chemotherapy, suggesting potential benefits as an adjuvant to preoperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in operable disease.

If the cancer is locally unresectable or the patient is medically inoperable, systemic therapy, radiation, and/or chemoradiation is recommended, possibly with the goal of converting the lesion to a resectable state.

### Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable metastatic colon cancer in non-academic and academic programs [^115rZu2F]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current NCCN guidelines encourage a course of systemic treatment for most patients with metastatic colon cancer planned to have liver or lung resection to increase the chance to eradicate microscopic disease. For resectable disease, both AC after resection and NAC (including perioperative chemotherapy given before and after surgery) are acceptable. Evidence supporting AC after resection of cancer come from studies showing PFS benefit in 642 patients in one meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials in 2012.JCOG0603 randomized patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastasis only to liver resection alone or liver resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. DFS at 5 years was improved in the chemotherapy group (49.8% vs 38.7%). However, there was no OS benefit (71.2% vs 83.1%). Another meta-analysis of 1896 patients from 10 trials also found improved DFS in patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy in 2015. Similarly, EORTC 40983, which compared perioperative chemotherapy and liver resection with resection alone in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis, showed only PFS benefit of adding perioperative chemotherapy, and there was no OS benefit. Both studies failed to show an OS benefit in these patients. However, due to the lack of evidence, the optimal sequencing of systemic therapy and surgical resection is not clear.

### Does neoadjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy improve the prognosis of high-risk stage II and III colon cancers? Three years' follow-up results of the PRODIGE 22 phase II randomized multicentre trial [^115SLKEh]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has proven valuable in locally advanced resectable colon cancer (CC) but its effect on oncological outcomes is uncertain. The aim of the present paper was to report 3-year oncological outcomes, representing the secondary endpoints of the PRODIGE 22 trial.

Method

PRODIGE 22 was a randomized multicentre phase II trial in high-risk T3, T4 and/or N2 CC patients on CT scan. Patients were randomized between 6 months of adjuvant FOLFOX (upfront surgery) or perioperative FOLFOX (four cycles before surgery and eight cycles after; FOLFOX perioperative). In wild-type RAS patients, a third arm testing perioperative FOLFOX-cetuximab was added. The primary endpoint was the tumour regression grade. Secondary endpoints were 3-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and time to recurrence (TTR).

Results

Overall, 120 patients were enrolled. At interim analysis, the FOLFOX-cetuximab arm was stopped for futility. The remaining 104 patients represented our intention-to-treat population. In the perioperative group, 96% received the scheduled four neoadjuvant cycles and all but one had adjuvant FOLFOX for eight cycles. In the control arm, 38 (73%) patients received adjuvant FOLFOX. The median follow-up was 54.3 months. Three-year OS was 90.4% in both arms [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85], 3-year DFS, RFS and TTR were, respectively, 76.8% and 69.2% (HR = 0.94), 73% and 69.2% (HR = 0.86) and 82% and 72% (HR = 0.67) in the perioperative and control arms, respectively. Forest plots did not show any subgroup with significant difference for survival outcomes. No benefit from adding cetuximab was observed.

Conclusion

Perioperative FOLFOX has no detrimental effect on long-term oncological outcomes and may be an option for some patients with locally advanced CC.

### Staging and prognosis of colon cancer [^114kj4Ga]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Significant advances have been made in all aspects of care relating to colorectal cancer. Although surgery will likely remain the mainstay of definitive treatment for the majority of colorectal malignancies, a better understanding of tumor progression and biology will help guide the choice of surgical therapy to best achieve a curative resection. Additionally, advances in the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies should continue to increase disease-free and overall survival when combined with appropriate operative resection. Although TNM staging remains our strongest tool at this point for establishing prognosis and directing therapy, expansion of our knowledge of the molecular events underlying colorectal tumorigenesis undoubtedly will lead to the refinement of our current staging and prognostic systems.

### Preoperative chemotherapy for operable colon cancer: mature results of an international randomized controlled trial [^116vvk9a]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

FOxTROT was not powered to detect differences in overall recurrence, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival, though the proportional reductions in these longer-term outcomes were of similar magnitude and add to the clinical relevance of the reduction in 2-year recurrence. Longer follow-up of FOxTROT and meta-analysis with more recent studies - may help determine whether these outcomes are also improved.

Another question is whether the observed effect might be attributable to less complete compliance in the control than NAC group. FOxTROT was designed to compare the same total quantity of chemotherapy in the two arms; however, 98% allocated to NAC started chemotherapy, whereas 25% of controls did not receive any chemotherapy. Most, predictably, had low-risk tumors of whom only five recurred within 2 years. Had they received chemotherapy, we estimate that one recurrence might have been prevented, which would make no material difference to the study findings. Hence, poor compliance with AC in lower-risk patients cannot account for the overall trial result.

The main disadvantage of NAC is that some patients with radiologically misclassified low-risk tumors receive unnecessary chemotherapy. In FOxTROT, 24% of control patients were found to have T3, N0 tumors without additional risk factors. For such patients whose recurrence risk is low, chemotherapy benefits are usually considered insufficient to justify the toxicity. Our ongoing review of FOxTROT radiology, and advances in radiologic techniques, should help improve the risk stratification algorithm for the deselection of patients with these lowest‐risk cancers.

It should also be noted that overtreatment occurs with adjuvant chemotherapy as well as NAC: even for high-risk operable colon cancer, around 10 patients are treated to prevent one recurrence. Regression grade after NAC might be useful in identifying which patients do and do not benefit from chemotherapy. For example, AC may not be needed for those with marked histologic regression after NAC who have a low risk of subsequent recurrence. This would need rigorous evaluation since it is also possible that patients with an excellent response to NAC are those who would benefit most from postoperative AC. Only randomized trials, perhaps incorporating circulating tumor DNA monitoring, can resolve these uncertainties.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine versus upfront surgery for locally advanced colon cancer: the randomized, phase III OPTICAL trial [^115QURvw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in colon cancer remains unclear. This trial investigated whether 3 months of modified infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) as NAC could improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced colon cancer versus upfront surgery.

Patients and Methods

OPTICAL was a randomized, phase III trial in patients with clinically staged locally advanced colon cancer (T3 with extramural spread into the mesocolic fat ≥ 5 mm or T4). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive six preoperative cycles of mFOLFOX6 or four cycles of CAPOX, followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC group), or immediate surgery and the physician's choice of adjuvant chemotherapy (upfront surgery group). The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population.

Results

Between January 2016 and April 2021, of the 752 patients enrolled, 744 patients were included in the mITT analysis (371 in the NAC group; 373 in the upfront surgery group). At a median follow-up of 48.0 months (IQR, 46.0–50.1), 3-year DFS rates were 82.1% in the NAC group and 77.5% in the upfront surgery group (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.03]). The R0 resection was achieved in 98% of patients who underwent surgery in both groups. Compared with upfront surgery, NAC resulted in a 7% pathologic complete response rate (pCR), significantly lower rates of advanced tumor staging (pT3–4: 77% v 94%), lymph node metastasis (pN1–2: 31% v 46%), and potentially improved overall survival (stratified HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.77]).

Conclusion

NAC with mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX did not show a significant DFS benefit. However, this neoadjuvant approach was safe, resulted in substantial pathologic downstaging, and appears to be a viable therapeutic option for locally advanced colon cancer.

### ASO author reflections: assessing the impact of neoadjuvant therapy: a real view perspective [^114662bn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Future

This study reinforces the understanding that post-neoadjuvant stage influences prognosis. While some may advocate 'complete' restaging prior to progressing to surgery, induction therapy is known to potentially impact on the reliability of staging modalities. It may also be important to consider the post-neoadjuvant stage when deciding on the merit of adjuvant treatment. There has been some suggestion that adjuvant treatment may confer some benefit in node-positive patients with adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and it already forms part of the standard of treatment in patients receiving MAGIC protocol chemotherapy. However, the ability to predetermine the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on disease stage based on specific biological factors of a tumor may further individualize oncological therapy, as demonstrated in colon cancer. This will guide informed decision among patients and clinicians moving forwards.

Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) delivers all intended preoperative treatment and shows high chemotherapy completion rates compared with postoperative approaches. This approach has patients complete all intended radiation therapy and chemotherapy before undergoing surgery with curative intent. In the rigorous setting of randomized trials, adjuvant chemotherapy completion rates range from 50% to 82%, whereas cohort and database studies outside trials report much lower completion ranging from 32% to 42%; by contrast, in a 2019 systematic review of 10 TNT studies including 648 patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy completion ranged from 86% to 100%. TNT is categorized as either induction TNT (systemic chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy and then consideration for surgery) or consolidation TNT (upfront radiation therapy followed by chemotherapy and then consideration for surgery), and another advantage of TNT is the decreased time interval to ileostomy closure that is facilitated by omitting adjuvant therapy.

### Surgical adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer: current approaches and future directions [^116bp9PE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Colon cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide. The role of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients with lymph node involvement has been established in a large number of clinical trials. However, its role in stage II colorectal cancer is less well established. 5-Fluorouracil has been the mainstay of therapy for the last four decades. With the development of novel chemotherapy and biological agents, we have entered into a new era for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The combination of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin has been shown to significantly improve disease-free survival and is now considered the standard of care for completely resected colon cancer in healthy patients. For rectal cancer patients with locally advanced tumors, neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery is the mainstay of treatment. The availability of oral chemotherapy agents has helped with the ease of administration and avoidance of indwelling catheters. A number of national clinical trials are under way to determine the role of targeted agents in combination with chemotherapy. The goal is to develop a regimen that would improve survival without excessive toxicity while maintaining quality of life. Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials whenever feasible. Despite the advances, many patients will develop recurrent disease. It is of utmost importance to develop molecular markers that could predict which patients are at high risk for disease recurrence. Clinical trials are under way to address this issue. Thus, it will be advantageous to be able to tailor therapy individually, according to the risk of recurrence.

### CT staging of colon cancer [^11655Gid]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Computer tomography (CT) has been the principal investigation in the staging of colon cancers. The information obtained with routine CT has been limited to identifying the site of the tumour, size of the tumour, infiltration into surrounding structures and metastatic spread. The Foxtrot trial National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) has been specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment in colon cancers by using preoperative chemotherapy with or without an anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody to improve outcome in high-risk operable colon cancer. Patients are selected based on their staging CT examination. The criteria for poor prognosis are T4 and T3 tumours with more than 5mm extramural depth. Thus the success of the trial would depend upon the confidence of the radiologist to identify the patients that would receive the neoadjuvant treatment. The aim of this review is to explain the process of identifying high-risk features seen on the staging CT images. This will help to identify a cohort of patients that could truly benefit from neoadjuvant strategies.

### Neoadjuvant therapy versus direct to surgery for T4 colon cancer: meta-analysis [^116u2krf]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite persistently poor oncological outcomes, approaches to the management of T4 colonic cancer remain variable, with the role of neoadjuvant therapy unclear. The aim of this review was to compare oncological outcomes between direct-to-surgery and neoadjuvant therapy approaches to T4 colon cancer.

Methods

A librarian-led systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CINAHL up to 11 February 2020 was performed. Inclusion criteria were primary research articles comparing oncological outcomes between neoadjuvant therapies or direct to surgery for primary T4 colonic cancer. Based on PRISMA guidelines, screening and data abstraction were undertaken in duplicate. Quality assessment was carried out using Cochrane risk-of-bias tools. Random-effects models were used to pool effect estimates. This study compared pathological resection margins, postoperative morbidity, and oncological outcomes of cancer recurrence and overall survival.

Results

Four studies with a total of 43 063 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with direct to surgery, neoadjuvant therapy was associated with increased rates of margin-negative resection (odds ratio (OR) 2.60, 95 per cent c.i. 1.12 to 6.02; n = 15 487) and 5-year overall survival (pooled hazard ratio 1.42, 1.10 to 1.82, I2 = 0 per cent; n = 15 338). No difference was observed in rates of cancer recurrence (OR 0.42, 0.15 to 1.22; n = 131), 30-day minor (OR 1.12, 0.68 to 1.84; n = 15 488) or major (OR 0.62, 0.27 to 1.44; n = 15 488) morbidity, or rates of treatment-related adverse effects.

Conclusion

Compared with direct to surgery, neoadjuvant therapy improves margin-negative resection rates and overall survival.

### Preoperative chemotherapy for operable colon cancer: mature results of an international randomized controlled trial [^112xCJC1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, apparent regression was associated with worse outcomes in control group patients. This may be because appearances similar to those associated with response to NAC are, in untreated patients, instead, indicative of high tumor stromal content, a poor prognostic feature. Since histologic regression is only prognostic after NAC, it must be an indicator of chemosensitivity, and not simply a surrogate for innately better-prognosis tumors. Hence, regression may reflect the effect of chemotherapy not just on the primary tumor but also on distant micrometastases and, consequently, long-term oncologic outcomes. This makes regression grade a potentially useful surrogate end point for future trials that might allow a more rapid assessment of novel NAC schedules.

FOxTROT, when launched in 2008, did not prespecify that lesser benefit was expected in dMMR tumors; however, dMMR has since been reported to predict nonbenefit from adjuvant fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in colon cancer, and from NAC in gastroesophageal cancer. Consistent with these studies, tumor regression was far less common in dMMR than pMMR tumors, although four pathologic complete regressions were seen. No reduction in recurrence was seen in patients with dMMR tumors. FOxTROT has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid KRAS testing before the panitumumab random assignment, and clinicians considering using NAC could implement rapid MMR assessment of diagnostic biopsies to exclude dMMR patients for whom neoadjuvant immunotherapy seems a more promising option.

Statistical analysis

The initial analysis was based on a modified intention-to-treat population (mITT), which included randomized patients who received at least two cycles of chemotherapy per randomized assignment. The per-protocol population (eligible and randomized participants who adhered to treatment assigned) and the as-treated population (eligible patients analyzed per treated received) were used as a key sensitivity analysis. AEs were summarized according to as-treated population. Categorical data were compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model. Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated using a Logistic regression model. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS (version 23.0; IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) and R statistical software (version 3.6.0).

### Session 1: the surgeon as a prognostic factor in colon and rectal cancer? [^114s4vnB]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The impact of quality of surgery, colorectal surgical specialization, training and expertise has been far greater on survival outcomes than adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies. The review of the evidence by Professor Martling and expert discussion addresses the evidence base and the crucial importance of the surgeon as a prognostic factor, and how this has been relatively neglected in comparison to other resources invested in improving the treatment of colorectal cancer.

### Comparison of Western and Asian guidelines concerning the management of colon cancer [^114kYrXu]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines are important to standardize treatments and optimize outcomes. Several societies have published authoritative guidelines for patients with colon cancer, and a certain degree of variation can be predicted.

Objective

This study aims to compare Western and Asian guidelines for the management of colon cancer.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for studies published between 2010 and 2017 by the online resources from the official Web sites of the societies/panels. Sources included guidelines by European Society of Medical Oncology, the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

Study Selection

Only full-text studies and the latest guidelines dealing with colon cancer were included. Studies and guidelines were separately assessed by 2 authors, who independently identified discrepancies and areas for further research. These were discussed and agreed with by all the authors.

Main Outcome Measures

The recommendations of the guidelines of each society were compared, seeking discrepancies and potential areas for improvement.

Results

Endoscopic techniques for the management of early colon cancer are discussed in detail in the Asian guidelines. Asian guidelines advocate extended (D3) lymphadenectomy on a routine basis in T3/T4 and in selected T2 patients, whereas such an approach is still under investigation in Western countries. Only US guidelines describe neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. All the guidelines recommend adjuvant treatment in selected stage II patients, but agreement exists that this is performed without solid evidence, because better outcomes are hypothesized based on studies including stage III or stage II/III patients. The role of cytoreductive surgery with intra-abdominal chemotherapy is dubious, and European guidelines only recommend it in the setting of trials. Asian guidelines endorse an aggressive surgical approach to peritoneal disease. Only US guidelines include a patient advocate in the drafting panel.

Limitations

Bias may have arisen from country-specific socioeconomic and cultural issues, and from the latest available updates.

Conclusions

Surgical approaches to colon cancer differ significantly among Western and Asian guidelines, reflecting different concepts of treatment. The role of adjuvant treatment in node-negative disease and quality-of-life assessment need further research.

### National landscape of neoadjuvant therapy in potentially resectable colon cancer [^111St7gK]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgery followed by pathology-guided adjuvant therapy is standard treatment for colon cancer. Data from the FOxTROT clinical trial showed potential benefit of a 6-wk neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in T3/T4 patients. The present study evaluated real-world outcomes of neoadjuvant therapy in a national cohort of patients with resectable colon cancer.

Methods

169,120 patients with clinical stage I, II, or III colon cancer from the National Cancer Database registry were included. Patients were categorized as having received neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery (NACT), surgery then adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), or surgery alone. Factors associated with treatment sequencing and outcomes were assessed.

Results

Of identified patients, 1.4% received NACT including 0.5% of stage I, 1.8% of stage II, and 3.0% of stage III. For stage I, 5-y overall survival (OS) was 74.7% after AC, 62.2% after NACT, and 76.4% after SA. For stage II, 5-y OS was 73.2% after AC, 66.8% after NACT, and 64.3% after SA. For stage III, 5-y OS was 67.3% after AC, 67.7% after NACT, and 42.4% after SA. Cox proportional-hazards model suggested NACT had worse outcomes versus AC in clinical stages I (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39–1.85, P < 0.01) and II (HR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.23–1.52, P < 0.01). In stage III, there was no difference in OS between NACT and AC (HR = 1.1, 95% CI 0.99–1.22, P = 0.05).

Conclusions

In a real-world national cohort of patients with resectable colon cancer, NACT had no OS benefit over AC. Future studies should examine which subset of patients might benefit from neoadjuvant approaches.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1139eGMa]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Colon Cancer — neoadjuvant therapy and conversion to resectability emphasizes that resection should not be undertaken unless complete removal of all known tumor is realistically possible (R0 resection), because incomplete resection or debulking has not been shown to be beneficial; any active metastatic systemic regimen can be used to downsize metastases, but irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based regimens may cause liver steatohepatitis and sinusoidal liver injury, and to limit hepatotoxicity it is recommended that surgery be performed as soon as possible after the patient's disease becomes resectable. Study data include: irinotecan plus 5-FU/LV enabled liver resection in 32.5% with median time to progression 14.3 months and median follow-up 19 months; a phase II NCCTG FOLFOX series treated 42 patients, with tumor reduction in 60% and resection in 17 patients (40%; 68% of responders) after a median 6 months of chemotherapy; another study of 1104 initially unresectable colorectal liver metastases reported secondary hepatic resection in 138 patients (12.5%) with a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 22%; and a retrospective Intergroup N9741 analysis of 795 previously untreated mCRC found 24 patients (3.3%; 2 of the 24 had lung metastases) underwent curative resection, with median overall survival (OS) 42.4 months.

Panitumumab

There was no indication that panitumumab enhanced the efficacy of NAC in RAS-wt patients: depth of extramural invasion was similar with versus without panitumumab: 6.2 versus 7.2 mm, P = 0.48. Seventeen percent (23/137) NAC + panitumumab versus 23% (30/133) NAC alone showed moderate or greater primary tumor regression (Data Supplement). The 2-year risk of residual or recurrent disease did not differ significantly: 18 versus 24 events; RR = 0.67 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.23), P = 0.19, Data Supplement.

Subgroup Analyses

There was limited statistical power to investigate heterogeneity between subgroups in the effect of NAC on 2-year recurrence (Data Supplement). The more highly powered comparison of tumor regression rates within subgroups (Data Supplement) showed similar efficacy of NAC in different radiologic T and N stages, left- and right-sided tumors, age groups, sexes, with OxCap and OxFU, with shorter or longer proposed treatment duration, whether RAS-wt or mutant, and whether or not randomly assigned for panitumumab. The only strong association seen was with mismatch repair (MMR) status: moderate or greater regression after NAC was seen in just 7% (8/115) of MMR-deficient (dMMR) compared with 23% (128/553) of MMR-proficient (pMMR) tumors (P < .001): Figure 4 A and Data Supplement. Similarly, there was no apparent reduction in 2-year disease recurrence in NAC patients with dMMR tumors (RR = 0.86 [0.42 to 1.76], P = 0.68), whereas, in pMMR tumors, the reduction in 2-year recurrence was significant: RR = 0.69 (0.50 to 0.97), P = 0.043: Figure 4. A similar pattern was seen for deaths from colon cancer (Data Supplement).

### Advances in chemotherapy for colorectal cancer [^111GALCW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists have a primary role in the management of colorectal cancer patients in that they frequently establish the diagnosis, direct or perform tumor staging evaluations, and initiate referrals for oncologic treatment. Several important advances have been made in the adjuvant treatment of colon and rectal cancers and in therapy of metastatic disease. These advances include the development of more effective combination chemotherapy regimens and molecularly targeted antibodies. These antibodies are directed against regulators of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor) and tumor cell growth (epidermal growth factor receptor) and have been shown to enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the treatment of localized rectal cancer, the integration of chemotherapy and radiation with surgery has resulted in neoadjuvant approaches that achieve improved tumor control, sphincter preservation, and reduce treatment-related toxicities. This review presents an update of the current approach to colon and rectal cancer treatment, highlighting recent chemotherapeutic advances in the management of these highly prevalent malignancies.

### Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy for initially unresectable locally advanced colon cancer: short-term outcomes of an open-label, single-centre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^117FF5ff]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first randomized clinical trial to compare NACRT with NACT to manage initially unresectable LACC. With advancements in radiotherapy, precise irradiation of mobile primary or metastatic tumor lesions, such as those in the lungs and colon, has improved significantly, leading to better tumor control and reduced AEs. Despite accumulating retrospective evidence suggesting that NACRT can enhance the survival of patients with colon cancer, no clear clinical practice guidelines have been established. Hence, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the short-term outcomes of NACRT and NACT in LACC. The initial analysis of the clinical and pathological outcomes in the first 45 patients demonstrated that NACRT is associated with a higher R0 resection rate, extended survival, and a favorable safety profile.

The ability of neoadjuvant therapy to downstage a tumor is crucial in converting unresectable LACC to a resectable disease. Some clinical trials have shown tumor downstaging in resectable LACC following NACT. In the FOxTROT trial, NACT reduced T4 disease from 31% to 21%. In the Danish trial, after NACT, 34% (24/71) of patients converted to a lower T stage, 11% progressed to a higher stage, and 66% achieved N0 status compared to the initial CT scan. Overall, the results of these trials were not entirely satisfactory.

Previous studies have shown that NACRT achieved a lower T stage in 66%–82% and a lower N stage in 84%–93% of patients. Consistent with these findings, we found that 72% and 80% of patients converted to a lower T and N stage, respectively, in the NACRT group compared to 10% and 20% patients in the NACT group after four cycles of chemotherapy. Our study also indicated a tendency towards a lower tumor regression grade with NACRT than with NACT.

The better tumor regression in this study can be attributed to the addition of local therapy, i.e. radiotherapy, which significantly improved the conversion and R0 resection rates compared to chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, NACRT may lead to higher organ preservation. Radiotherapy reduces tumor invasion, reducing the extent of radical resection required, thereby decreasing the risk of complications and the potential impact on survival, such as MVR.

### Systemic chemotherapy with or without cetuximab in patients with resectable colorectal liver metastasis (new EPOC): long-term results of a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^111scHbV]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

In the advanced disease setting, right-sided metastatic colon cancer has been reported to be less responsive to EGFR inhibition, the biology of which is currently being interrogated. In the New EPOC trial, survival of patients with liver metastases from right-sided cancers was affected more than that of patients with left-sided cancers by the addition of cetuximab, although there were relatively few right-sided cancers and the difference was not significant. Therefore, the biology underlying the right versus left phenomenon seen in advanced disease with EGFR inhibition in the neoadjuvant setting should be investigated in future trials.

Further interrogation of the progression events in the New EPOC population has revealed some informative observations. First, additional data collected after the interim analysis showed that there were numerically more multisite progressions in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group than in the chemotherapy alone group. Second, this updated analysis shows post-progression survival to be shorter for the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group. Therefore, the addition of cetuximab seems to have not only accelerated disease progression, but also might have led to the development of a more aggressive disease genotype and phenotype. Visual inspection of the survival curves suggests that progression was associated with early death in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group, but not in the chemotherapy alone group. These early deaths were mainly attributable to disease progression. The translational studies that are underway will be crucial to explaining these complex observations.

Overall, we have shown that survival in patients with operable colorectal liver metastases is significantly worse with the use of cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in the perioperative setting than with chemotherapy alone. This finding is robust, with no apparent confounding variables, and suggests that biological intervention in molecularly complex cancers might have unintended consequences. Cetuximab should not be used as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with operable colorectal liver metastases.

Management of locoregional recurrence — treatment options for patients with local or local-regional recurrence of colon cancer should be considered in a multidisciplinary setting, with a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Reported local-regional recurrence (LRR) rates are 4–7% with a median interval between initial resection and LRR of 18 to 24 months, and risk factors include higher T and N stages, left-sided tumors, omission of chemotherapy, a positive surgical margin at the index operation, and lymphovascular invasion. When LRR occurs in isolation or with resectable metastases, salvage surgery can be attempted with reasonable short- and long-term outcomes. In a systematic review of 505 patients, rerecurrence occurred in 41 of 188 patients (22%), median overall survival after resection ranged from 14 to 42 months, pooled overall five-year survival was 52%, and postoperative morbidity ranged from 21% to 68% with most complications considered minor. Selected series using neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally recurrent disease achieved an 87% R0 resection rate and a 100% three-year survival rate.

At three-year follow-up, there was a 7% better progression-free survival in the perioperative chemotherapy group compared with the surgery-alone group.

### The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in rectal cancer: a nationwide cohort study from the Netherlands [^116FbtjS]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer reduces disease recurrence and improves survival and has become standard treatment for patients with high‐risk Stage II–III colon cancer. It usually consists of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) or 5‐fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), which preferably starts within 4–8 weeks after surgery. Although rectal cancer has histological similarities with colon cancer, there are substantial differences in the approach to how we deal with rectal cancer compared with colon cancer, such as the use of preoperative high‐quality MRI, neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy regimens and total mesorectal excision (TME) — the standard surgical technique. Currently, there is no global consensus towards adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in rectal cancer; for example, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in the United States recommends adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of Stage III rectal cancer. However, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) considers the level of scientific evidence low and thus recommends that the decision on adjuvant chemotherapy should be jointly made by the patient and clinician.

A Cochrane systematic review showed that rectal cancer patients who were not treated with neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy benefitted from adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS). However, a meta‐analysis of four trials showed no improvement in OS or DFS. Although adjuvant chemotherapy in rectal cancer is not recommended by the Dutch guidelines, a recently published survey showed that some medical oncologists in the Netherlands do offer adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with Stage III rectal cancer.

The current understanding of the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in the management of nonmetastatic rectal cancer reveals a discernible knowledge gap pertaining to the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival. Recently, a retrospective study was published regarding the survival benefit in clinically node‐negative but pathologically node‐positive patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. The study focused only on patients who had not received any preoperative treatment. However, as neoadjuvant treatment is recommended in a substantial group of patients with rectal cancer, this patient group should be included in these types of analyses.

In this present study we assessed the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and OS in patients who either underwent neoadjuvant treatment (radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) or received no neoadjuvant treatment, using data from a nationwide database.

### Role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before simultaneous resection of colon cancer and liver metastases: a propensity-score matched analysis [^115MLZP8]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a controversy about the optimal management of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Both upfront surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy are viable options for CLM. The present study aimed to assess the short-term and survival outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before simultaneous resection of primary colon cancer and liver metastases.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Database (2015–2019) on patients with primary colon cancer and synchronous liver metastases. The main exposure was neoadjuvant chemotherapy before simultaneous resection of colon cancer and hepatic metastases. Propensity-score matching was used to match patients who had upfront surgery without neoadjuvant chemotherapy with patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, 30-day and 90-day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission, conversion to open surgery, surgical margins, and disease downstaging.

Results

Overall, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given to 38.3% of 4060 patients. After matching, 1446 patients (53% male) were included; 482 were in the neoadjuvant group and 964 were in the no-neoadjuvant group. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a longer restricted mean OS (46.7 vs. 40.6 months, P < .001) and significantly lower rates of 90-day mortality (3% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.008), 30-day unplanned readmission (4.8% vs. 8.8%, P = 0.002), positive surgical margins (6.5% vs. 15.1%, P < .001), and administration of adjuvant therapy (47.3% vs. 79.5%, P < .001). The 2 groups were comparable in hospital stay, 30-day mortality, and number of examined lymph nodes.

Conclusions

Giving neoadjuvant chemotherapy before simultaneous resection of colon cancer and hepatic metastases was associated with extended mean OS and reduced rates of 90-day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission, and positive surgical margins.

### Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable metastatic colon cancer in non-academic and academic programs [^115i3BAN]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

NAC converts disease to resectable status. In selected patients with unresectable liver lesions, induction chemotherapy may be used to convert it to resectable case. In a series of 1439 patients, 12.5% of the unresectable liver lesions became resectable with 5- and 10-year disease free survival (DFS) rate of 22% and 17%, respectively. In these situation, systemic treatment with chemotherapy, or immunotherapy for microsatellite instability (MSI) high tumors are rational choice.

For colon cancer with synchronous liver or lung metastasis, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommend upfront resection if complete resection (R0) is feasible; NAC before resection or AC after surgery are also acceptable choices. Perioperative/NAC has not been compared with AC in metastatic setting. We hypothesize that NAC confers an OS advantage over AC. Our study aimed at analyzing the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to examine the effect of treatment sequencing on overall survival of colon cancer patients with synchronous liver or lung metastasis treated by multidisciplinary approach within one year.

### The neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer: a review [^1114FJ8Z]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Rectal adenocarcinoma is an important cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and key anatomic differences between the rectum and the colon have significant implications for management of rectal cancer, especially in the curative setting. For stage II and III rectal cancers, combined chemoradiotherapy offers the lowest rates of local and distant relapse, and is delivered neoadjuvantly to improve tolerability and optimize surgical outcomes, particularly when sphincter-sparing surgery is an endpoint. We review both pivotal trial data that has shaped the current standard of care, fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy, while also presenting results from more recent studies, which aim to outperform this standard. Strategies combining 5FU radiotherapy with oxaliplatin, VEGF inhibition, EGFR inhibition, other targeted agents, and/or use of induction chemotherapy hold promise but thus far have failed to improve outcomes in randomized trials. Results of studies such as the ongoing PROSPECT trial may help further define our current therapeutic algorithm for stage II and III rectal cancer.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111JGz3x]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Colon Cancer — preoperative/perioperative systemic therapy strategy: The choice of regimen in the preoperative setting depends on several factors, including prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy exposure and regimen response/safety profiles. Biologics are not recommended in the preoperative metastatic setting, with the exception of initial therapy in patients with unresectable disease that may be converted to a resectable state or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy for dMMR/MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutation-positive disease. The optimal sequencing of systemic therapy and resection remains unclear; patients with resectable disease may undergo resection first followed by postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, or perioperative (neoadjuvant plus postoperative) systemic therapy can be used. Potential advantages of preoperative therapy include earlier treatment of micrometastatic disease, assessment of responsiveness, and avoidance of local therapy for early progression, whereas disadvantages include missing the "window of opportunity" for resection or difficulty identifying targets after a complete response; viable cancer has often been found pathologically despite complete response on CT, so during preoperative systemic therapy, frequent evaluations must be undertaken and close communication among clinicians and patients must be maintained.

Metastatic tumor(s) with a higher likelihood of being converted to resectable and/or ablatable are those in which the initial disease is confined to limited sites. When considering whether disease has been converted to resectable and/or ablatable, all original sites need to be amenable to treatment.

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^113v5Xzk]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

One patient in each group needed acute surgery because of incipient obstruction, with both proceeding to resectional surgery. No significant differences were seen in complication rates (table 2) or median time to hospital discharge (preoperative plus postoperative chemotherapy group: 7 days, IQR 5–10; postoperative only: 6 days, 3–8; p = 0·18) although there was a greater proportion of wound infections in the preoperative group (table 2). The proportions of patients with complications that prolonged hospital stay, or had procedures that resulted in a stoma or required further adominal surgery for anastomotic complications, were much the same for the two groups (table 2). The median delay after surgery to starting chemotherapy was 47 days (IQR 40–55) for patients allocated preoperative chemotherapy and 53 days (44–57) for patients allocated postoperative chemotherapy.

Table 2
Perioperative complications in the preoperative plus postoperative chemotherapy group compared with the postoperative chemotherapy group

Of those receiving chemotherapy, toxicity was similar between groups in the first 6 weeks and in subsequent treatment (appendix). 34% (32 of 94) of preoperative and 31% (12 of 39) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had grade 3 or worse toxicity in their first 6 weeks of chemotherapy (p = 0·72). 7% (seven of 94) of preoperative and 10% (four of 39) of postoperative chemotherapy patients had grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity; 11% (nine of 85) versus 21% (eight of 38) required dose reductions (p = 0·12) and 11% (ten of 95) versus 5% (two of 40) did not complete their first 6 weeks of chemotherapy (p = 0·31). Only one patient had surgery delayed, for 2 weeks, because of toxicity of preoperative chemotherapy — grade 4 neutropenia. For all 24 weeks of chemotherapy, 49% of patients (47 of 95) in the preoperative chemotherapy group and 51% of patients (20 of 39) in the postoperative group had any grade 3 or higher adverse events, with the most common being haematological (29% [28 of 95] and 28% [11 of 39]) and gastrointestinal (19% [18 of 95] and 21% [eight of 39]) adverse events (appendix).

### Optimizing neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer with oxaliplatin [^116TamP9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) is standard treatment for stage II-III rectal cancer. Fluoropyrimidine-based CRT prolongs disease-free survival over adjuvant CRT and improves local control over both adjuvant CRT and neoadjuvant radiotherapy alone, but does not prolong overall survival. New approaches to neoadjuvant therapy may improve outcome in this disease. Oxaliplatin, a standard component of chemotherapy for the treatment of both resected and metastatic colon cancer, is a potent radiosensitizer with synergistic radiosensitizing activity in combination with 5-FU in preclinical studies. Early clinical trials showed promising activity with the addition oxaliplatin to 5-FU-based CRT in stage II-III rectal cancer; however, early data from phase III trials seem to be disappointing. This article reviews the existing literature and explores the potential role of oxaliplatin as part of neoadjuvant CRT for rectal cancer.

### The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in rectal cancer: a nationwide cohort study from the Netherlands [^115fScLY]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective cohort study of a Dutch nationwide registry the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer was investigated. A significant 5‐year survival benefit was demonstrated in all patient subgroups, regardless of preoperative treatment (neoadjuvant radiotherapy, chemoradiation or no neoadjuvant treatment). The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in rectal cancer patients has been an ongoing matter of debate, unlike in colon cancer where adjuvant chemotherapy is considered standard treatment in high‐risk Stage II and III disease. A few European randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed in the past, all showing no significant difference in survival in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Of these, however, the PROCTOR‐SCRIPT trial closed prematurely because of slow patient accrual. A meta‐analysis of this trial, together with three other randomized phase II studies, showed no improvement in OS or DFS. Examining the results of the EORTC 22921 randomized study, less than 43% of the patients in the adjuvant chemotherapy group received the full treatment in the prescribed timeframe; therefore, conclusions regarding OS and DFS could be considered unreliable.

More recently, the results of the international, multicentre phase III RAPIDO trial also failed to demonstrate a difference in disease‐related treatment failure, but several remarks need to be made. First, patients were not randomized for treatment with or without adjuvant chemotherapy after previous chemoradiation therapy or short‐course radiotherapy followed by systemic CAPOX or FOLFOX. Second, it should be considered that the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy was not a primary endpoint. Third, the study was not powered for this specific aspect.

In a Cochrane review from 2012, data were analysed from 21 RCTs comparing adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in rectal cancer patients who were not treated with neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. In this review the investigators described that 5‐fluorouracil‐based postoperative chemotherapy improved OS by 17% and DFS by 25%. In all trials patients were treated with radical rectal surgery, preceded or not by preoperative radiotherapy and randomized for adjuvant chemotherapy. A limitation of these trials was that the role of neoadjuvant treatment was not addressed, while neoadjuvant therapy is standard care for many rectal cancer patients.

### Personalizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer: protocols for the international phase III FOxTROT2 and FOxTROT3 randomized controlled trials [^111if2r6]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

FOxTROT1 established a new standard of care for managing locally advanced colon cancer (CC) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Six weeks of neoadjuvant oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine (OxFp) chemotherapy was associated with greater 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) when compared with proceeding straight to surgery (STS). There is now a need to refine the use of NAC and identify those most likely to benefit. FOxTROT2 will aim to investigate NAC in older adults and those with frailty. FOxTROT3 will aim to assess whether intensified triplet NAC provides additional benefits over OxFp.

Method

FOxTROT2 and FOxTROT3 are international, open-label, phase III randomized controlled trials. Eligible patients will be identified by the multidisciplinary team. Patient age, frailty and comorbidities will be considered to guide trial entry. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to the intervention or control arm: 6weeks of dose-adapted neoadjuvant OxFp versus STS in FOxTROT2 and 6weeks of neoadjuvant modified oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan versus OxFp in FOxTROT3. The primary endpoint in FOxTROT2 is 3-year DFS. In FOxTROT3, tumour regression grade and 3-year DFS are co-primary endpoints.

Discussion

FOxTROT2 and FOxTROT3 will establish the FOxTROT platform, a key part of our long-term strategy to develop neoadjuvant treatments for CC. FOxTROT2 will investigate NAC in a population under-represented in FOxTROT1 and wider research. FOxTROT3 will assess whether it is possible to induce greater early tumour responses and whether this translates to superior long-term outcomes. Looking ahead, the FOxTROT platform will facilitate further trial comparisons and extensive translational research to optimize the use of NAC in CC.

### Overview of preoperative and postoperative therapy for colorectal cancer: the European and United States perspectives [^112fXsvP]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Surgery is the primary modality for cure in patients with localized colorectal cancer. However, despite potential curative surgery, the risk of recurrence is high. In colon cancer, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) is now established in stage III disease. The benefit of adjuvant treatment in stage II disease is likely to be small, and studies performed thus far have been generally underpowered to detect what might be a clinically significant effect on survival. Whereas bolus scheduling of 5-FU and LV is favored in North America, infusion of 5-FU/LV is preferred in Europe. Indeed, infused 5-FU/LV may be a safer partner with new drugs such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Oral fluoropyrimidines are attractive agents that might one day replace parenteral 5-FU. In rectal cancer, postoperative combined chemoradiation was recommended as standard practice in stages II and III disease. Despite a lack of randomized data demonstrating clinical benefit, preoperative chemoradiation has been increasingly used in patients with T3 disease in North America. However, preoperative radiation therapy is more frequently used in Europe. There are discrepancies in pathologic reporting of circumferential resection margin involvement and lymph node status between the United States and Europe. Standardized reporting with improved preoperative imaging would allow patients with truly early-stage disease to undergo more conservative management and be spared the morbidity and mortality of unnecessary adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment.

### Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy for initially unresectable locally advanced colon cancer: short-term outcomes of an open-label, single-centre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^111Ju6Yd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study revealed that the NACRT group had significantly longer PFS and OS than the NACT group, which can be primarily attributed to the higher resection rates observed in the former. Additionally, our previous studies have consistently shown that patients with better ypTMN stage have higher survival rates. These findings confirm our hypothesis that enhancing local therapy improves pathological outcomes and positively impacts the OS.

Acute toxicity is another important concern associated with NACRT. Studies on rectal cancer have demonstrated a favorable safety profile for doublet NACT combined with radiotherapy. This study showed no significant increase in toxicities with the addition of radiotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone, consistent with our previous findings of < 10% grade 3–4 GI toxicity. Notably, other trials, such as the FOxTROT, Danish, and Prodige 22 trials, which focused on NACT for LACC, reported a 7%–12% incidence of grade 3–4 GI toxicity. In the NACRT group, except one patient experienced intestinal perforation and was excluded during the initial stage of neoadjuvant treatment, potentially due to rapid tumor regression after chemotherapy, no other patients were required to emergency surgery for treatment-related complications. Two patients developed intestinal obstruction during chemoradiotherapy. No severe postoperative complications were observed after the radical resection. Considering the utilization of contemporary radiotherapy techniques for target delineation and treatment delivery, we show that NACRT is safe, well-tolerated, and associated with acceptable acute toxicities in patients with LACC. Our study did not analyze and compare the late toxicities of NACRT and NACT, which needs to be further explored in future research.

### Neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable metastatic colon cancer in non-academic and academic programs [^115fSDJK]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

NCDB is a large hospital-based database. Even with such a narrow population of interest, we were able to identify over 3000 patients. It is not possible to study this question in a prospective fashion in this number. Information was collected from both non-academic and academic programs mimicking the real-world situation. We show here an overall survival advantage of systemic chemotherapy pre-/perioperatively over postoperatively when added on to resection of both the primary and the metastatic colon cancer. However, this is helpful only in non-academic programs, which is unprecedented. Being a retrospective database study there is a risk of selection bias that could be hard to mitigate. There are also certain pieces of information which are not included as part of the database in NCDB; eg, it does not have information about the number and size of lesions in the metastatic organ which has important prognostic implication. It does not give details about chemotherapy agents, number of cycles of chemotherapy given therefore difficult to determine the benefit of chemotherapy in general. There is no information on BRAF mutational status neither.

### Feasibility of preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced, operable colon cancer: the pilot phase of a randomised controlled trial [^112veJny]. The Lancet: Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

Significant differences favouring preoperative therapy were seen in apical node involvement in the resected specimens (one of 98 vs ten of 50; p < 0·0001), TNM5 staging (p = 0·04), resection margin involvement (four of 99 vs ten of 50; p = 0·002), and retroperitoneal margin involvement (five of 94 vs eight of 44; p = 0·016; table 3). 31% of (29 of 94) tumours in the preoperative group with blinded centrally scored regression grades showed moderate to complete regression as compared with 2% (one of 46) in the control series (p = 0·0001). There were reductions in tumour diameter, tumour thickness, and depth of spread beyond the muscularis propria in the preoperative group compared with controls. There were two complete pathological responses and seven T2 tumours in the preoperative group, with only one T2 tumour in the control group. However, downstaging as assessed by T stage was not significant (table 3). The proportion of tumours with involved lymph nodes was lower (40% [39 of 98] vs 52% [26 of 50], test for association p = 0·039) in the preoperative chemotherapy group, with the number of lymph nodes identified for histology assessment being similar between groups.

Table 3
Tumour characteristics on pathological examination

55% (11 of 20) of the tumours apparently downstaged between initial radiological assessment and pathological examination were also downstaged on radiology assessment after preoperative chemotherapy. None were upstaged. Conversely, 35% (six of 17) of the tumours apparently upstaged between initial radiological assessment and pathological examination were also upstaged on postchemotherapy radiology. None were downstaged. Reductions in the mean depth of spread beyond the muscularis propria (12·8 [SD 8·4] to 9·0 [7·9] mm; p = 0·0022) and in the maximum tumour thickness (24·9 [12·2] to 19·0 [12·8] mm; p = 0·0018) were also seen in the second radiological assessment compared with baseline.

### Preoperative chemotherapy for operable colon cancer: mature results of an international randomized controlled trial… [^116LdaAM]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction 1Standard treatment is surgery followed by adjuvant oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for those with a moderate- to high-risk disease. 2Despite adjuvant chemotherapy, 20%-30% of patients develop recurrent disease that is usually incurable. 3, 4Preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy has substantially improved outcomes in other gastrointestinal cancers. 9In addition, response to NAC, unlike AC, is observable, so could potentially guide subsequent treatment decisions. 3, 10and spiral computed tomography scans could more reliably identify moderate- to high-risk colon cancers. 11We therefore initiated Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin and Targeted Receptor pre-Operative Therapy. Planned subgroup analyses were of NAC efficacy by randomization stratification variables and by biomarkers potentially predictive of treatment efficacy.

Patients allocated to NAC also had significant reductions in a range of other measures of tumor dimension and nodal invasion, in particular, tumor regression grading: complete regression in 24, with marked, moderate, or mild regression in a further 412 patients. By contrast, 82% allocated to control were scored by the central blinded review as showing no evidence of regression: Figure 2A and Data Supplement. Panitumumab P = 0.48. Seventeen percent NAC + panitumumab versus 23% NAC alone showed moderate or greater primary tumor regression. The 2-year risk of residual or recurrent disease did not differ significantly: 18 versus 24 events; RR = 0. 67, P = 0.19, Data Supplement. 31and from NAC in gastroesophageal cancer. 32Consistent with these studies, tumor regression was far less common in dMMR than pMMR tumors, although four pathologic complete regressions were seen.

No reduction in recurrence was seen in patients with dMMR tumors. FOxTROT has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid KRAS testing before the panitumumab random assignment, and clinicians considering using NAC could implement rapid MMR assessment of diagnostic biopsies to exclude dMMR patients for whom neoadjuvant immunotherapy seems a more promising option. 33.

### Considerations in neoadjuvant therapy implementation in T3 and T4 colon cancer | JCO oncology advances… [^116MMaM6]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract Purpose Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is increasingly being considered over standard upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer. Studies have been underpowered to look at the effect of NAC on overall survival in individual clinical T stages. Discussion Our analysis demonstrated OS benefit of the NAC approach in T4 colon adenocarcinoma but not in T3. This study highlights the importance of evaluating the survival benefit of NAC separately for T3 and T4 colon adenocarcinoma in future studies. 6–8To further improve outcomes in colon cancer, the standard treatment of surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer has been challenged by the recently published FOxTROT trial, which demonstrated that 6 weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced, operable colon cancer provided better outcomes.

In addition to improved surgical excision with fewer incomplete resections, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers several benefits, including early systemic treatment to lessen the potential effect of metastases, marked histopathologic downstaging with shrinkage of the primary tumor to limit the scope of resection and increase the chances of achieving clear surgical margins, and the ability to gather prognostic data on the basis of the tumor's response to therapy. 8–10The FOxTROT trial confirmed that preoperative chemotherapy can be delivered safely without increasing perioperative morbidity and demonstrated fewer residual or recurrent disease within 2 years. 8However, studies have been underpowered to evaluate the effect of NAC on overall survival for locally advanced colon cancer.

21, 22The OPTICAL trial did not demonstrate a significant DFS benefit but reported a 7% pathologic complete response rate and substantial pathologic downstaging with the use of NAC versus upfront surgery. 21Notably, the authors in the OPTICAL trial mentioned that there was a trend toward favoring NAC but may not have reached significance due in part to overstaging along with other factors. 21The NeoCol trial also reported no significant difference in DFS and OS for NAC but did find that the NAC group had more favorable outcomes in rates of postoperative complications and downstaging. 22.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials… [^116K1491]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e15631 Background: The primary treatment for colon tumors is surgical resection, but the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in managing locally advanced cases remains a subject of ongoing debate. We conducted a thorough meta-analysis, including randomized clinical trials, to assess the oncological safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal tumor patients. Methods: We systematically searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Academic and Cochrane Library in January 2024 for studies that directly compared NAC versus surgery in patients with T3–4, N0–2, M0 colorectal cancer. We assessed overall survival and disease-free survival. We calculated odds ratios and hazard ratios using generic inverse variance in Review Manger 5.
4. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics. Results: We included seven RCTs, involving 4, 391 patients. Among them, 53. 5% underwent NAC, with a median age of
61. 41 years and an average follow-up of 62.

35 months. The comprehensive analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in 3-year OS, more than 2 years DFS and five-year DFS. Employing a time-to-effect modeling approach, there was no significant difference in OS or DFS;. Conclusions: Our systematic review and meta-analysis of seven RCTs showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy had similar overall survival and disease-free-survival in patients with locally advanced colon cancer.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX regimen for locally advanced operable colon cancer patients: a prospective phase II trial (NCT02415829) [^116L5Bjw]. ASCO (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract e15047 Background: Several studies showed that the neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an effective treatment of solid tumor malignancies. This study was a prospective, single-arm phase II trial to assess the efficacy and safety of XELOX regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer patients. Methods: Patients with CT-defined T4 or lymph node-positive colon cancer were enrolled. After radiological staging, patients were treated with 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of oxaliplatin, 130 mg/m² on day 1, with capecitabine, 1000 mg/m² twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks, followed by tumor resection, and then with another 5 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the XELOX regimen. Radiological response was evaluated after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The pathological tumor response in the primary tumor was evaluated according to tumor regression grade score.

The primary endpoints were tumor response rate. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT02415829. Results: 46 patients were enrolled and received treatment. 5 patients were only received 1 cycle of NAC and excluded. 41 patients received at least 2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and R0 resection. The total clinical response rate was 70. 7% including a complete response and partial response rate of
2. 4% and 68. 3%, respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment toxicities were hematological toxicities and developed in 4 patients. Emergency operation conditions were observed in 3 patients with perforation or obstruction. Operation complications rate was 4. 2% with wound infection and mortality rate was
0. Conclusions: The results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX is an effective, feasible and safe treatment for patients with locally advanced colon cancer. Clinical trial information:

### FOxTROT study results: some burning questions need answers… [^114ddhbg]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

The FOxTROT study is the first phase III study, to date, that evaluated the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced colon cancer and provided several clinically important information as follows: NAC effectively downstages tumors, allowing R0 resection in a significantly higher proportion of patients; NAC is safe and improves disease control rate compared with the current standard of care consisting of up-front surgery, followed by risk-adapted adjuvant chemotherapy; and the study provides prospective data demonstrating the lack of potent antitumor activity of chemotherapy against deficient mismatch repair tumors. However, we would request the authors to share some critical data that will further clarify the role of NAC in patients with operable colon cancer, as outlined below:

1.

The impact of NAC on the R0 resection rate is likely to be more conspicuous in patients with radiologic T4 tumors because this patient population is at increased risk of incomplete resection. 2We suspect that patients at moderate risk of incomplete resection, which constituted approximately 75% of patients in the experimental arm, may have minimized the true impact of NAC on the tumor downstaging. We request the authors to share the R0 resection rate in patients with rT4 tumors receiving NAC versus the control group. We believe, this information will help surgeons decide whether they want to refer patients with bulky tumors to receive NAC before surgery. Even if the improvement in the R0 resection rate in the high-risk population is not statistically significant or the numbers do not provide sufficient power to calculate significance, this information will help future investigators design neoadjuvant therapy trials.

We would especially like to know the distant recurrence rates in the high-risk population. This information is critical in many ways. If three cycles of chemotherapy did not significantly reduce the distant recurrence rate, future studies would consider incorporating a longer course of NAC or intensifying NAC, for example, with a triplet chemotherapy regimen. 5If NAC reduced the distant recurrence rate in the overall or the high-risk population, it would be an additional motivating factor to consider NAC in patients with early-stage colon cancer.
