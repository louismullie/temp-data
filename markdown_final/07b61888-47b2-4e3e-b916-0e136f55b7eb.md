## Question

Can chronicnpleural effusion cause pleural thickening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic pleural effusion can cause pleural thickening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of pleural inflammation and fibrosis. Then, I should verify direct evidence linking chronic effusions to pleural thickening across different etiologies. Next, I will examine temporal relationships and latency. After that, I should review imaging and guideline signals that clinicians use to infer causality. Finally, I will consider exceptions and confounders before synthesizing a conclusion and clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic plausibility. Chronic pleural effusions perpetuate pleural inflammation, mesothelial injury, and fibroblast activation, which drive collagen deposition and pleural fibrosis; this is precisely the pathway to pleural thickening, and it is well described in asbestos-related pleural disease and other fibroinflammatory pleural processes, supporting a causal chain from effusion to thickening over time [^111VbD4A] [^11133xMN].

> Now, I should verify direct evidence across etiologies. In asbestos-exposed cohorts, benign asbestos-related pleural effusions commonly precede diffuse pleural thickening, with 40% of patients with diffuse pleural fibrosis having had a prior effusion, indicating a direct temporal and causal relationship in a substantial subset [^11717vGi]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check non-asbestos contexts too. In parapneumonic effusions, delayed resolution beyond 15 days and the presence of pus independently predict residual pleural thickening, reinforcing that persistent effusions lead to fibrosis [^1176iiS5]. I should also confirm that chronic pleural infection with nonexpandable lung is characterized by thickened pleura, again linking chronic effusion/inflammation to pleural fibrosis [^1134TzxS]. Even outside classic asbestos disease, contemporary imaging reviews list pleural effusion itself as a cause of pleural thickening, which aligns with this pathophysiology [^11133xMN].

> Wait, let me verify the temporal dimension and latency. In asbestos cohorts, pleural effusions can occur decades after exposure, and diffuse pleural thickening often follows after a median latency of roughly 34 years, with effusions frequently preceding thickening; this long arc supports a chronic, progressive fibrotic response rather than an acute transient change [^11717vGi]. In parapneumonic disease, the risk of residual thickening rises with delayed effusion resolution, again emphasizing time-dependent fibrosis [^1176iiS5]. But wait, what if the effusion is short-lived? Pseudochylothorax cases show that minimal thickening can occur even with shorter symptom duration, suggesting that while chronicity increases risk, fibrotic change can begin earlier in some inflammatory contexts, albeit less commonly [^112YsJBo].

> Next, I should review imaging and guideline signals that clinicians interpret as evidence of causality. Ultrasound frequently detects pleural thickening alongside septations in chronic or complicated effusions, and thoracic ultrasound is recommended to guide interventions and to assess pleural abnormalities, reflecting routine recognition of thickening in chronic effusions [^115pe5Zi] [^117PZSRi]. Hold on, I should verify CT-based evidence as well. Quantitative imaging work and diagnostic studies repeatedly correlate pleural thickening with effusions and use pleural thickness thresholds to guide biopsy strategies, underscoring that thickening is a common, clinically meaningful sequela of pleural disease including chronic effusions [^114YtQZz] [^1129rJ4N]. Guidelines also advise follow-up CT in patients with pleural thickening and unexplained unilateral effusion to exclude occult malignancy, acknowledging that effusion and thickening co-occur and require evaluation for underlying drivers, including malignancy and infection [^112i9X2F] [^112yLvxo].

> I need to ensure I address exceptions and confounders. Pleural thickening can arise without effusion, and effusions can occur without subsequent thickening, so association does not equal universality; for example, some rheumatoid-associated pseudochylothorax cases show minimal thickening despite months of effusion, indicating variability in fibrotic propensity and possibly earlier-stage disease in those reports [^112YsJBo]. Let me reconsider the directionality concern: while effusions can cause thickening via inflammation and fibrosis, pre-existing pleural disease can also produce effusions, so temporal sequence and disease-specific context matter; nonetheless, multiple longitudinal datasets, especially in asbestos and parapneumonic cohorts, demonstrate effusions preceding and likely precipitating thickening in a meaningful proportion of cases [^11717vGi] [^1176iiS5].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, chronic pleural effusion can cause pleural thickening. The mechanism is chronic pleural inflammation with mesothelial injury and fibroblast activation leading to collagen deposition and pleural fibrosis; this is supported by mechanistic plausibility, direct evidence across asbestos-related disease, parapneumonic effusions, and chronic pleural infection, and by imaging and guideline recognition of thickening in the setting of chronic effusions, with risk modulated by duration and severity of the inflammatory process [^111VbD4A] [^11717vGi] [^1176iiS5] [^1134TzxS] [^11133xMN] [^112i9X2F].

> Clinically, I should confirm that persistent or recurrent effusions warrant proactive management to mitigate fibrosis risk and functional compromise; early, effective drainage and treatment of the underlying cause reduce the likelihood of residual pleural thickening and restrictive physiology, and this principle is reflected in contemporary pleural infection management literature and procedural guidance emphasizing timely intervention and follow-up imaging when malignancy is a concern [^114uMhMj] [^112i9X2F] [^113bEYo4].

Chronic pleural effusion causes pleural thickening through **persistent inflammation and fibrosis** of the pleura [^115pe5Zi]. The risk and severity of thickening rise with effusion duration, infection, malignancy, or asbestos exposure [^114ux5MM] [^1174fL1o]. Early, effective treatment of the effusion and underlying cause can **reduce fibrosis and preserve lung function** [^114uMhMj].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie pleural thickening in chronic effusions:

- **Inflammatory response**: Persistent effusions trigger chronic pleural inflammation, with cytokines (TGF-β, IL-1, IL-6) and growth factors that activate fibroblasts and promote collagen deposition [^116YnW15].

- **Fibroblast activation and collagen deposition**: Activated fibroblasts produce extracellular matrix, especially collagen, leading to fibrosis and thickening [^notfound].

- **Organization of fibrin and exudate**: Fibrin-rich effusions organize into fibrous tissue, further thickening the pleura.

- **Mesothelial cell injury and regeneration**: Chronic effusions injure mesothelial cells; abnormal regeneration and fibrosis contribute to thickening [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence linking chronic pleural effusion to pleural thickening

Multiple studies and reviews document the association between chronic pleural effusion and pleural thickening:

- **Asbestos-related pleural effusions**: Benign asbestos pleural effusions often precede diffuse pleural thickening, with effusions commonly preceding thickening [^114ux5MM] [^11717vGi].

- **Parapneumonic effusions and empyema**: Chronic parapneumonic effusions and empyema frequently cause pleural fibrosis and thickening [^114uMhMj].

- **Malignant pleural effusions**: Malignant effusions are often accompanied by pleural thickening due to tumor infiltration and chronic inflammation [^114YtQZz] [^116AgcbW].

- **Imaging studies**: CT and ultrasound commonly show pleural thickening in chronic effusions, especially when inflammatory or malignant [^114YtQZz] [^115pe5Zi].

---

## Factors influencing the severity of pleural thickening

The degree of pleural thickening varies with **effusion duration and volume**, with longer-standing and larger effusions causing more pronounced fibrosis. Underlying causes — infection, malignancy, asbestos exposure, and autoimmune disease — also drive thicker pleura [^1174fL1o] [^1127WUhD]. Individual susceptibility, including genetic predisposition and immune response, further modulates severity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and complications

Pleural thickening from chronic effusion can cause **significant morbidity**:

- **Restrictive lung dysfunction**: Thickened pleura limits lung expansion, causing restrictive physiology and dyspnea [^113kbnHK].

- **Reduced quality of life**: Dyspnea and chest discomfort impair daily activities and quality of life [^1173q7BV].

- **Permanent structural changes**: Established fibrosis may be irreversible, even after the effusion resolves [^11717vGi].

- **Increased risk of recurrence**: Thickening predisposes to recurrent effusions and pleural adhesions [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic methods for detecting pleural thickening

Several **imaging modalities** are used to detect and characterize pleural thickening:

| **Modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Chest radiography | - Initial screening <br/> - Widely available | Limited sensitivity for early or subtle thickening [^notfound] |
| Computed tomography (CT) | - Gold standard <br/> - Detailed assessment of pleural thickness and morphology [^114vgKBx] | Radiation exposure <br/> - Cost |
| Ultrasound | - Bedside <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Good for detecting pleural thickening and guiding procedures [^112LyYd7] | Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited penetration in obese patients [^114vgKBx] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - Useful for soft tissue characterization <br/> - No radiation | Limited availability <br/> - Cost <br/> - Longer scan times [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies to prevent or reduce pleural thickening

Effective management of chronic effusions is essential to **minimize pleural thickening**:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the cause (infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease) to reduce ongoing inflammation [^notfound].

- **Early and adequate drainage**: Prompt drainage of large or infected effusions reduces fibrosis risk [^114uMhMj].

- **Intrapleural therapies**: Fibrinolytics and other intrapleural agents can reduce fibrosis in complicated effusions [^114uMhMj].

- **Surgical interventions**: Decortication or pleurectomy may be needed for severe fibrosis with trapped lung [^1134TzxS].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and timeliness of intervention. Early, effective treatment can **prevent or limit fibrosis** and preserve lung function; delayed or inadequate management increases the risk of permanent thickening, restrictive dysfunction, and reduced quality of life [^114uMhMj] [^113kbnHK].

Chronic pleural effusion causes pleural thickening through persistent inflammation and fibrosis; **early, effective management** of the effusion and its cause can reduce fibrosis and preserve lung function.

### Pseudochylothorax without pleural thickening: time to reconsider pathogenesis? [^112YsJBo]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pseudochylothorax (cholesterol pleurisy or chyliform effusion) is a cholesterol-rich pleural effusion that is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory disorders such as tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Until now, there were only 15 published cases of arthritis-associated pseudochylothorax in the English language literature. Previous literature has suggested that pleural fluid cholesterol enrichment occurs in the context of grossly thickened (fibrotic) pleura over a prolonged period, usually > 5 years. We present six well-characterized cases of arthritis-associated pseudochylothorax, each notable due to their minimal pleural thickening. The median duration of symptoms (or arthritis, in the case of asymptomatic effusions) was 15 months. Such findings cast significant doubt on the conventional concepts of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid-associated pseudochylothorax. Clinicians should consider pseudochylothorax even in short-duration nonfibrotic pleural effusions.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^114ux5MM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Asbestos-related pleuritis — clinical features and diagnostic approach are summarized as follows: Asbestos may cause an acute pleural effusion, often lasting several months, that is exudative and often hemorrhagic. It may occur early (within 10 years) or later after the onset of asbestos exposure. Of 20 insulators with a past history of a pleural effusion, diffuse pleural thickening was detected on radiograph in 16. Chronic severe pleuritic pain is rare in patients with asbestos-related pleural disease. The diagnosis of acute asbestos-related pleural effusion is by exclusion of other causes of acute pleuritis, and most often is not arrived at until the pleural space is fully explored and biopsied, generally by thoracoscopy. If a malignancy has not manifested itself within 3 years, the effusion is generally considered benign.

### The presentation and natural history of asbestos-induced diffuse pleural thickening [^11717vGi]. Occupational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Three forms of asbestos-related benign pleural disease are recognized: discrete pleural plaques, pleural effusions and diffuse pleural fibrosis. Of these, diffuse pleural fibrosis is the most significant on account of its chronicity and associated morbidity.

Aims

The objectives of this study were to determine the latency of asbestos-induced diffuse pleural fibrosis, its presenting features and its clinical course once established.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of 75 patients with asbestos-induced diffuse pleural fibrosis referred for assessment at our institution from 1992 to 2007. Diffuse pleural fibrosis was considered to be present if there was obliteration of the costophrenic angle in continuity with at least 3-mm pleural thickening, in accordance with the International Labour Organization 2000 Classification.

Results

The median latency for development of diffuse pleural fibrosis from first asbestos exposure was 34 years. Seventy-three per cent of patients had unilateral disease at presentation and 24% of these were observed to develop contralateral disease after a median of 2 years. Unilateral pleural disease was commonest on the right. Forty per cent of patients presented with pleural effusions preceding the development of diffuse pleural thickening. The median latency for development of pleural effusions from onset of exposures was 38 years. Eighty per cent of the pleural effusions were unilateral. Once established, pleural thickening was reported to have remained stable in 91% on the ipsilateral side.

Conclusions

The findings of this study may help in providing further insight into the natural history of diffuse pleural fibrosis to guide the clinician in the management of this condition.

### Malignant pleural effusion: presentation, diagnosis, and management [^114XqEt3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Malignant pleural effusions are common in patients with cancer. Most malignant pleural effusions are secondary to metastases to the pleura, most often from lung or breast cancer. The presence of malignant effusion indicates advanced disease and poor survival; in lung cancer, the presence of malignant effusion upstages the cancer to stage 4. Usually presenting as a large, unilateral exudative effusion, most patients with malignant pleural effusion experience dyspnea. Prior to intervention, diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion and exclusion of infection should be made. Thoracic imaging is typically performed, with computed tomography considered by many to be the gold standard. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful, particularly if diaphragmatic or pleural thickening and nodularity can be identified. Cytology should then be obtained; this is typically done via pleural fluid aspiration or pleural biopsy. Treatment focuses on palliation and relief of symptoms. Numerous interventions are available, ranging from drainage with thoracentesis or indwelling pleural catheter to more definitive, invasive options such as pleurodesis. There is no clear best approach, and a patient-centered approach should be taken.

### Pictorial review of pleural disease: multimodality imaging and differential diagnosis [^1152BA8z]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The pleura is a thin, smooth, soft-tissue structure that lines the pleural cavity and separates the lungs from the chest wall, consisting of the visceral and parietal pleurae and physiologic pleural fluid. There is a broad spectrum of normal variations and abnormalities in the pleura, including pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening. Pneumothorax is associated with pulmonary diseases and is caused by iatrogenic or traumatic factors. Chest radiography and US help detect pneumothorax with various signs, and CT can also help assess the causes. Pleural effusion occurs in a wide spectrum of diseases, such as heart failure, cirrhosis, asbestos-related diseases, infections, chylothorax, and malignancies. Chest US allows detection of a small pleural effusion and evaluation of echogenicity or septa in pleural effusion. Pleural thickening may manifest as unilateral or bilateral and as focal, multifocal, or diffuse. Various diseases can demonstrate pleural thickening, such as asbestos-related diseases, neoplasms, and systemic diseases. CT, MRI, and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Knowledge of these features can aid radiologists in suggesting diagnoses and recommending further examinations with other imaging modalities. The authors provide a comprehensive review of the clinical and multimodality imaging findings of pleural diseases and their differential diagnoses. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Tunneled pleural catheters for patients with chronic pleural infection and nonexpandable lung [^1134TzxS]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic pleural infection is characterized by thickened pleura and nonexpandable lung often requiring definitive surgical intervention, such as decortication and/or pleural obliteration procedures. Such procedures are associated with significant morbidity and require proper patient selection for a successful outcome. We report a cohort of 11 patients with pleural space infection and a nonexpandable lung treated with tunneled pleural catheters (TPCs). Following placement, hospital discharge and TPC removal occurred after a median of 5 and 36 days, respectively. Three patients presented with residual loculated effusion that resolved with instillation of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. One patient eventually required open window thoracostomy for ongoing pleural infection due to poor medical compliance with TPC care and drainage instructions. TPCs represent an alternative option for drainage of an infected pleural space in nonsurgical candidates with a nonexpandable lung. Their use, as a compliment to traditional treatment, may facilitate prompt hospital discharge and ambulatory management in patients with limited life expectancy.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^1127WUhD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

IgG4-RELATED DISEASE

IgG4-RD is a chronic, systemic fibroinflammatory disorder characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis and often but not always elevated serum IgG4 levels. IgG4-RD was first described in the pancreas, formerly known as autoimmune pancreatitis, and subsequently salivary and lacrimal glands which has long been known as Mikulicz's disease. Currently, IgG4-RD is shown to affect essentially any organ system including biliary tree, kidneys, retroperitoneum, prostate, aorta, pericardium, lungs, thyroids, lymph nodes, meninges and skin.

Thoracic involvement can be seen in approximately 40% of IgG4-RD patients. In a Chinese IgG4-RD patient cohort the frequency of the thoracic involvement was reported to be 87 of 248 (35.1%) patients and pleural effusion and thickening were noted in 4.6 and 16.1%, respectively. Consistent with these results, 22 of 53 (41.5%) IgG4-RD patients had pulmonary manifestations, and three of 22 (13.6%) presented with pleural thickening/effusion in a UK-based cohort of IgG4-RD patients. The pleural manifestations of IgG4-RD include pleural mass, pleuritis with fibrosis (nodular or diffuse pleural thickening), and pleural effusion. Although thoracic involvement in IgG4-RD is frequently observed in association with other organ disease such as pancreatitis and sialadenitis, it should be emphasized that pleural effusions in IgG4-RD without other organ involvement are also increasingly recognized. Pleural effusions in IgG4-RD are exudative with cellular constituents rich in lymphocytes and plasma cells. Histopathological examination of biopsied pleura reveals fibrinous pleuritis with lymphoplasmacytic inflammation including numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells and active fibrosis. Plasma cell infiltration with more than 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells/high power field and an IgG4/IgG-positive plasma cell ratio of more than 40% are suggestive of IgG4-RD for biopsied specimens.

### Asbestos-associated pulmonary disease [^1174fL1o]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Exposure to asbestos can cause both benign and malignant, pulmonary and pleural diseases. In the current era of low asbestos exposure, it is critical to be aware of complications from asbestos exposure; as they often arise after decades of exposure, asbestos-related pulmonary complications include asbestosis, pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, benign asbestos-related pleural effusions and malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Recent Findings

Multiple recent studies are featured in this review, including a study evaluating imaging characteristics of asbestos with other fibrotic lung diseases, a study that quantified pleural plaques on computed tomography imaging and its impact on pulmonary function, a study that examined the risk of lung cancer with pleural plaques among two large cohorts and a review of nonasbestos causes of malignant mesothelioma.

Summary

Asbestos-related pulmonary and pleural diseases continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the current advances in this field and highlights areas that need additional research.

### IgG4-related eosinophilic pleural effusion: a case report [^115NhT1E]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

IgG4-RD is an uncommon immune-mediated disorder that can cause fibroinflammatory lesions in nearly any organ. The mean age at onset was 50.3 ± 14.9 years and the majority of patients were men (60.8%). Intrathoracic lesions in patients with IgG4-RD include bronchial thickening, nodules, ground glass shadow, pleural thickening/effusion, lymphadenectasis and retromediastinal fibrosis. Yunyun Fei et al. found that only 4/87(4.6%) patients present pleural effusion in IgG4-RD patients with intrathoracic involvement. However, Kasashima et al. has shown that pleural effusion may be the main manifestation of IgG4 related pleural lesions. They reported that 6/8 (75%) patients with IgG4-related pleural lesion had pleural effusion.

At present, the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD is not clear. Previous studies show immune-mediated mechanisms triggered by autoimmune and infectious factors may contribute to the fibroinflammatory process. Type 2 helper T cells and Tregs overexpress cytokines including interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) and transforming growth factor β, promoting eosinophilia and leading to increased serum IgG4 and IgE, and progression of fibrosis. Eosinophilia in IgG4-RD is generally viewed as an integral part of the clinical feature. One observational study found that IgG4-pleural effusion patients have potential allergic diseases. This patient also had a history of chronic urticaria and present elevated serum IgE level and eosinophil counts in pleural fluid and serum. However, Zhang et al. found that eosinophilia appeared independent of allergies in IgG4-RD. The causes of eosinophilia in IgG4-RD are not clear at present. Previous studies suggested that eosinophilia was probably induced by a process inherent to IgG4-RD immune response itself. There was homology between human carbonic anhydrase II and the α-carbonic anhydrase of Helicobacter pylori, and between the plasminogen-binding protein of H. pylori and the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 2 expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. These innate immune responses against microbial antigens may be associated with the eosinophilia in IgG4-RD.

### Recognizing the pleura in asbestos-related pleuropulmonary disease: known and new manifestations of pleural fibrosis [^113VwZfG]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pleural thickening (PT) is a major consequence of exposure to all fiber types of asbestos. In recent decades, it is more prevalent than parenchymal asbestosis. Its manifestations occupy a full clinical and radiographic spectrum. Six major manifestations can be identified: (a) acute pleuritis generally with effusion; (b) diffuse PT or fibrous pleuritis; (c) rounded atelectasis; (d) circumscribed PT or plaques; (e) chronic pleuritic pain; and (f) mesothelioma. Review of the experience of workers and community members in Libby, MT to asbestiform fibers in vermiculite has confirmed the appearance of these previously known benign and malignant asbestos-related diseases as well as a unique pleuropulmonary disease characterized as lamellar PT and associated with progressive decline in pulmonary function and pleuritic pain. Despite previous literature asserting that PT represents a marker for asbestos exposure without significant effect on pulmonary function and physiology, the experience of Libby amphibole (LA) disease, along with other studies, indicates that PT plays a role in declining vital capacity in those with prolonged or unusual exposures such as those arising from LA.

### State-of-the-art: radiological investigation of pleural disease [^114vgKBx]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural disease is common. Radiological investigation of pleural effusion, thickening, masses, and pneumothorax is key in diagnosing and determining management. Conventional chest radiograph (CXR) remains as the initial investigation of choice for patients with suspected pleural disease. When abnormalities are detected, thoracic ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) can each play important roles in further investigation, but appropriate modality selection is critical. US adds significant value in the identification of pleural fluid and pleural nodularity, guiding pleural procedures and, increasingly, as "point of care" assessment for pneumothorax, but is highly operator dependent. CT scan is the modality of choice for further assessment of pleural disease: Characterising pleural thickening, some pleural effusions and demonstration of homogeneity of pleural masses and areas of fatty attenuation or calcification. MRI has specific utility for soft tissue abnormalities and may have a role for younger patients requiring follow-up serial imaging. MRI and PET/CT may provide additional information in malignant pleural disease regarding prognosis and response to therapy. This article summarises existing techniques, highlighting the benefits and applications of these different imaging modalities and provides an up to date review of the evidence.

Pleural effusion

Pleural effusion (Fig. 18) will most often be visualised as a dark, anechoic area lying in between the visceral and parietal pleura on ultrasonography. LUS cannot accurately estimate whether an effusion is a transudate or an exudate. Neither can LUS rule out a parapneumonic effusion or empyema. Hence in a pleural effusion of unknown origin, LUS cannot replace a diagnostic thoracocentesis. However, some characteristic US findings can be used as a guide until the results of the diagnostic thoracocentesis become available. Transudates often appear homogenic and anechoic. Exudates are also often anechoic, but if the density of the pleural fluid increases, like in coagulated blood, pus or chylothorax, then a more hypoechoic appearance is evident. Hyperechoic particles (also known as "plankton" or "the swirling sign") can sometimes be seen floating around in the effusion. This finding is almost exclusively seen in exudates and in one study was shown to be a marker of a malignant pleural effusion. In the case of empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion, septa within the fluid and possible pleural thickening can often be seen using LUS. Both septations and thickening of the pleura can however also be seen in malignancy and chronic pleural effusions. The presence of septations within a pleural effusion can have a high degree of impact in the choice of treatment and drainage. LUS is superior to CT for the detection of septations and hence is a key imaging modality in the assessment and subsequent treatment of patients with pleural effusion

Underlying compression atelectasis (Atl) of the lung is also often present

Obstructive pulmonary disease

In the vast majorities of cases, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma both have normal LUS findings during exacerbations. Even though LUS cannot diagnose obstructive pulmonary diseases, it has a key role in assessing these patients since LUS can rule-out both complications and associated diseases.

### Case definition of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis in resource-constrained settings [^115HYRQT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Cavitation

The cardinal feature of CPA is the presence of > 1 cavities. The cavities may be small or large; may have thick or, less commonly, thin walls; and usually abut the pleura. The cavities expand and may coalesce during progression of infection. In patients with extensive bullous emphysema, inflammation around a bulla may resemble cavitation. The differential diagnosis of chronic cavitary lesions includes mycobacterial infection, endemic fungal infection, and malignancy. The cavities seen with CPA are often located in the upper lung zone and may mimic TB; in patients with NTM infection and endemic fungal diseases, the cavities may be located in any lung zone. A distinguishing feature of CPA is slow progression of findings over months or years, whereas active pulmonary TB infection progresses faster (Figure 2). Patients with NTM infection may also have cavitary lesions; however, lesions are more common among older white men with underlying lung disease. Patients with residual coccidioidal or other infectious cavities are usually asymptomatic unless these conditions are complicated by aspergilloma or superinfected. Cavitary bronchogenic carcinoma is usually associated with adenopathy and often pleural effusion.

Figure 2
Computed tomography images of a patient with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. A) Left upper lung lobe thick-walled cavity, showing associated pleural thickening. B) Same patient several months later, demonstrating progression of cavitation with increased pericavitary consolidation and formation of a fungal ball within the cavity. Aspergilloma formation is a late feature of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.

Pleural Thickening

In the pre-CT era, pleural thickening was regarded as a sign of aspergilloma; indeed, pleural thickening is common in patients with CPA. For many patients, pleural thickening seen on CT images usually consists of 2 components: fibrosis of the pleura overlying a cavity or area of consolidation and indrawing of extrapleural fat (typically seen in chronic inflammatory processes of the lung). This subtle distinction cannot be made readily from a chest radiograph. Pleural thickening should be regarded as a common feature of CPA and useful for diagnosis. Furthermore, pleural thickening is a specific feature of CPA, rarely seen in patients with TB or chronic coccidioidal or other fungal cavities. Tuberculous empyema is usually exhibited as a large pleural effusion and is commonly accompanied by interlobular septal thickening and micronodules. Cavitating bronchogenic carcinoma may invade the chest wall causing bone destruction or may cause diffuse pleural involvement; however, these manifestations are distinct from the focal pleural thickening associated with CPA.

### Application of ultrasound-guided medical thoracoscopy in patients with small amounts or without pleural effusion [^114Aqm8B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pleural disease, as a common disease, can be either primary, secondary to other diseases or a part of systemic disease. The incidence of pleural disease and its associated diseases (e.g. chronic lung disease, tumors, heart failure, cirrhosis, etc.) has increased significantly worldwide. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, medical thoracoscopy demonstrates high diagnostic efficacy, with the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97. In addition, thoracoscopy is a safe method of examination, and the incidence of operation-related complications is 4%. Therefore, medical thoracoscopy is a more ideal examination to diagnose pleural disease.

Some patients with pleural disease have little or no pleural effusion. Confirming the diagnosis of these patients is very difficult. Guidelines recommend that pneumothorax should be induced in such patients before medical thoracoscopy examination, which is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pleural effusion with unknown origin. However, the process of inducing pneumothorax is tedious and has many complications. In recent years, the introduction and widespread use of thoracic ultrasound have revolutionised the management of pleural diseases. An observational study showed that ultrasound-guided thoracentesis can reduce the risk of pneumothorax by 19%. In addition, thoracic ultrasound is more sensitive than X-ray chest radiographs in detecting pleural effusions and can simultaneously identify isolated pleural effusions and distinguish pleural effusions from pleural thickening. Andrew RL et al. found that thoracic ultrasound prior to medical thoracoscopy improves pleural access and predicts fibrous septation, and thoracic ultrasound can be used to reduce extra procedures and the need for artificial pneumothoraces in patients with pleural effusion (at least 3 cm depth). However, whether artificial pneumothorax can be replaced by preoperative thoracic ultrasound guidance in patients with small amounts (less than 3 cm depth) or without pleural effusion remains uncertain. In addition, thoracentesis and pleural biopsy are difficult in these patients and the risk of complications (pneumothorax, lung injury) is extremely high. Therefore, this study intends to clarify the application of thoracic ultrasound to locate the access site before medical thoracoscopy operation in patients with small amounts (less than 3 cm depth) or without pleural effusion.

### Does previous asbestos exposure increase the risk of a post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) pleural effusion-a routine data study? [^116YnW15]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well recognised that patients may develop pleural effusions following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Between 65 and 89% of CABG procedures result in the development of a pleural effusion, however most resolve spontaneously or with medical management [4}. The underlying aetiology of these effusions may be independent of the surgery or related to it. Pleural effusions occurring after CABG are divided into early (< 30 days post-surgery) or late (> 30 days post-surgery). Late effusions can be subdivided into those with a clear medical cause, such as cardiac failure or infection, and those without, and are much less studied than early effusions. The pleural fluid in late occurring effusions, characterised in a 26 patient series, tends to be a lymphocytic exudate with normal glucose levels and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels similar to the upper level of normal serum value.

The pathophysiology of the post-CABG pleural effusion is not well understood. It is postulated that the physiological insult of surgery may result in an inflammatory state. This theory is supported by the finding of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (Il-6) in pleural fluid in the post-operative phase. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been found to rise sequentially in pleural fluid in the perioperative period, suggesting an inflammatory cascade leading to altered pleural permeability, in turn resulting in pleural effusion formation. The influence and persistence in pleural fluid of VEGF is pertinent given its role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Persistent post-CABG effusions have been observed to lead to diffuse pleural thickening (DPT), with corresponding histological evidence of chronic inflammation.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^115qgTr2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

Recent Findings

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, have been suggested as a way of identifying contributing disease process.

Summary

Understanding that there are potentially concurrent causes to a pleural effusion is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether the targeting of separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.

### Asbestos-related pleural disease [^113SGbWn]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asbestos exposure is the cause of significant pleural disease - both benign and malignant. Although there is increased awareness, individuals continue to be exposed, and we will continue to see its sequelae for years to come because of the delay between exposure and disease manifestation. Asbestos-related pleural disease includes pleural plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, benign asbestos-related pleural effusions (BAPEs), and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

Recent Findings

Several recent studies are highlighted throughout this review, including a comparative analysis of diagnostic imaging modalities for identifying and characterizing pleural plaques, the effect of pleural plaques on lung volumes and flows, and how pain is a relatively common feature in patients with pleural plaques. Advances in the treatment of MPM are limited, but a recent publication highlights the increased morbidity associated with surgical debulking procedures and questions the benefit of these procedures.

Summary

Asbestos-related pleural disease will continue to present a significant burden of illness. Recent publications have suggested potential treatment benefit and point to areas that would require further investigation.

### Descriptors of breathlessness in patients with cancer and other cardiorespiratory diseases [^1169RSvv]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between descriptors of breathlessness and its underlying cause in patients with lung cancer and cardiopulmonary diseases to see whether descriptors might be used to help determine the cause of breathlessness, particularly in patients with lung cancer. We studied 131 patients with primary or secondary lung cancer, whose breathlessness was attributed to tumor mass, pleural effusion, lung collapse, metastases, pleural thickening or lymphangitis carcinomatosis, and 130 patients with breathlessness attributed to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease or cardiac failure. Patients selected statements (descriptors) that described the quality of their breathlessness from a 15-item questionnaire and the relationship between the descriptors and the attributed cause of breathlessness was evaluated by cluster analysis. All patient groups were characterized by more than one cluster and several clusters were shared between groups. Specific sets of clusters were associated with breathlessness due to asthma, COPD and cardiac failure, and to cancer causing collapse, metastases or pleural thickening. The association of different sets of clusters with the different diagnostic groups suggests that patients are describing qualitatively different experiences of breathlessness, but the relationship does not appear to be sufficiently robust for the questionnaire to aid differential diagnosis.

### A pleural effusion of multiple causes [^112c9s79]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple medical disorders can lead to the development of pleural effusions. Most effusions are given a single diagnosis in clinical practice. However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of recurrent pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that recurrent pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### Efficacy of medical thoracoscopy combined with fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema [^114uMhMj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings underscore the pivotal role of medical thoracoscopy in mitigating inflammatory responses. By improving the pleural environment, thoracoscopy enhances the therapeutic efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy. Consistent with previous research, this study reinforces the clinical value of medical thoracoscopy in reducing inflammation.

This study demonstrated significant imaging recovery in both treatment groups. Postoperatively, pleural effusion and pulmonary inflammation were effectively resolved, accompanied by full re-expansion of collapsed lung tissue. Follow-up chest CT scans at three months revealed a low incidence of pleural thickening in both groups, with no significant differences observed.

These findings indicate that both traditional closed pleural drainage with urokinase and medical thoracoscopy with urokinase are effective in promoting pleural effusion absorption and lung re-expansion, thereby facilitating the resolution of pulmonary inflammation. Early and thorough drainage of pleural effusion is essential for preventing chronic pleural inflammation and reducing the risk of pleural thickening.

In clinical practice, chronic pleural infections often result in pleural thickening, leading to ipsilateral chest wall collapse, reduced compliance, and restrictive pulmonary dysfunction. Early intervention for complicated pleural effusion is essential to prevent pleural thickening, enhance patients' long-term quality of life, and restore their work capacity.

This study demonstrated improvements in postoperative pulmonary function in both treatment groups, underscoring the importance of early and proactive intervention. Such interventions facilitate pleural effusion drainage, promote lung re-expansion, restore pulmonary function, alleviate dyspnea, and improve overall quality of life. These findings are consistent with previous research. Notably, patients in the medical thoracoscopy group showed significantly greater postoperative improvement in FVC compared to those in the traditional treatment group (P < 0.05).

Follow-up assessments further validated the long-term efficacy of medical thoracoscopy combined with urokinase therapy. Pulmonary function recovery at 3 and 6 months was significantly better in the medical thoracoscopy group compared to the traditional treatment group. This improvement is likely due to the thoracoscopic procedure's ability to remodel pleural structures and promote lung re-expansion.

### Pleural effusion in pulmonary embolism [^111KKKon]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially lethal disease that recurs frequently and is associated with long-term impairment and suffering. Patients with pulmonary embolism are at risk of death, recurrence of embolism, or chronic morbidity. Appropriate therapy can reduce the incidence of all. Pulmonary embolism is the most commonly overlooked disorder in patients with pleural effusion. Recent findings of pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism are discussed in this review.

Recent Findings

The presence of pleuritic chest pain in a patient with a pleural effusion is highly suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Nearly all pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism are exudates, frequently hemorrhagic, and with a marked mesothelial hyperplasia. Patients with a pleural effusion are likely to have an embolus in the central, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental pulmonary arteries and these are the regions in which spiral computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) can detect an embolus. No specific treatment is required for pleural effusion. The presence of bloody pleural fluid is not a contraindication for the administration of anticoagulant therapy.

Summary

Pulmonary embolism is probably responsible for a significant percentage of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions. Spiral CTPA is the best way to evaluate the possibility of pulmonary embolism in a patient with a pleural effusion. The treatment protocol of the patient with pleural effusion secondary to pulmonary embolism is the same as that for any patient with pulmonary embolism.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^1173q7BV]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over 1 million patients develop a pleural effusion annually in the United States alone. Pleural effusions have more than 60 different causes, and vary in size and risk (and rates) of recurrence. Congestive heart failure (CHF), malignancy, pulmonary infection and embolism account for over 90% of pleural effusions.

Pleural effusions can impact profoundly on the cardiorespiratory system. Breathlessness, the commonest presentation, is often debilitating and significantly impairs quality of life. Relief of breathlessness often necessitates therapeutic pleural interventions with associated discomfort, risks of infection, bleeding, pneumothorax and even death. Management of pleural effusions represents a significant healthcare burden worldwide.

To date, research on, and hence our understanding of, the effects of pleural effusions on respiratory physiology and breathlessness has been limited. The conventional belief that pleural effusions cause breathlessness through compression of the lung is overly simplistic. The severity of breathlessness often correlates poorly with the size of the effusion Conversely, symptom reduction from fluid drainage varies significantly between patients, and no reliable predictors exist to identify those who will benefit. Most previous studies have involved small cohorts and examined specific etiological factors in isolation; few have compared physiological changes with symptom benefits in patients.

This article reviews published literature on the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions (and their therapeutic evacuation). Key knowledge gaps are highlighted which may guide future research.

Primary pleural malignancies

Lymphoproliferative disorders

Pleural lymphomas are mainly seen as secondary when in association with other thoracic abnormalities or in cases of aggressive subtypes. They arise from the direct extension from a pulmonary or nodal disease, or through hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination. Patients present with aspecific complaints, including chest pain, dyspnea, or cough. Pleural effusion is one of the main manifestations on imaging. Pleural thickening or solid pleural lesions are less commonly seen with frequently missed pleural lesions due to small size or fluid superposition. Both unilateral and bilateral pleural involvements are possible.

Primary pleural lymphomas are rarely diagnosed and consist of two distinct subtypes. The first subtype is the primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), which is a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) caused by the human herpes virus type 8 or Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus. A unilateral effusion with a homogeneous near-water attenuation is seen on imaging without evidence of solid disease. Therefore, an isolated pleural effusion in a patient with an AIDS-related immune deficiency should alert radiologists and clinicians to the possible diagnosis of PEL (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Diagnosis: primary effusion lymphoma. Technique: contrast-enhanced chest CT. Description: A 41-year-old man with a history of HIV, HHV8, and EBV presented with dyspnea and chest pain. The initial CT examination (a, b) shows a prominent unilateral pleural effusion posterior to the right lung. A combination of imaging and clinical findings was suggestive of primary effusion lymphoma, which was histopathologically confirmed. Follow-up CT after treatment (c, d) shows a small residual right-sided pleural effusion

The second subtype is the pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL). This Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL is exclusively seen in patients with chronic pyothorax, usually due to iatrogenic-induced pneumothorax from tuberculosis treatment. The highest incidence of PAL is seen in Japan, as more than 90% of the population is infected with EBV, and lung collapse therapy is widely performed there. Imaging characteristically shows an inhomogeneous solid pleural mass that may extend directly into the lung; locoregional rib destruction has been described in the literature. In contrast to PEL, pleural effusion is not always present. Both PEL and PAL are associated with a poor prognosis.

Mesenchymal tumors

The term mesenchymal tumors includes a broad spectrum of various pathologies originating from transformed cells of connective tissue origin. One of the characteristics of these primary malignancies is that most of them are focal.

### Pleural effusions in acute and chronic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome [^114Svd9X]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary manifestations have been well described in leukemia, but pleural disease is less common. This review highlights pleural effusions in acute and chronic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) based on the evidence to date. Diagnostic workup and recommendations for the management of these effusions are also outlined.

Recent Findings

Pleural effusions in patients with leukemia are most often due to infection and to a lesser extent leukemic infiltration of the pleura. The prognostic implications of these effusions are unclear, but survival is most likely determined by the underlying malignancy and its response to treatment. New therapies have changed survival in these patients, and some of these treatments, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have emerged as important causes for these effusions. Pleural interventions may be accomplished with few complications.

Summary

Pleural effusions may occur with acute and chronic leukemia and MDS. Infection remains the most common cause. Malignant pleural effusions tend to occur in advanced disease in chronic leukemia, but they can be seen at any time with acute leukemia and MDS. With standard precautions, pleural procedures may be performed safely in this population. In cases of unclear cause, pleural and bone marrow biopsy should be considered.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^113kbnHK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Diffuse pleural thickening — prevalence, course, functional impact, and imaging criteria are described as follows: In large surveys of asbestos-exposed workers, diffuse pleural thickening has ranged from 9 to 22% of those with pleural disease, and diffuse pleural thickening superimposed on circumscribed plaques has been observed, often after pleural effusion; the frequency of diffuse pleural thickening increases with time from first exposure and is thought to be dose related. A reduction of 20% of forced vital capacity (FVC) has been associated with diffuse pleural thickening and workers with diffuse pleural thickening have a significantly greater decrement in FVC (by a factor of two or more) than those with circumscribed pleural thickening, while restrictive impairment is characteristic, with relative preservation of diffusing capacity. Morphologically, it may have a thickness from less than 1 mm up to 1 cm or more, and the newly revised ILO classification (2003) recognizes pleural thickening as "diffuse" only in the presence of an intact continuity with an obliterated costophrenic angle.

### Pleural tuberculosis: a key differential diagnosis for pleural thickening, even without obvious risk factors for tuberculosis in a low incidence setting [^111yc14f]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a 64-year-old woman, presenting with pleuritic chest pain and weight loss. She had a previous history of breast malignancy and no clear risk factors for tuberculosis (TB). Initial investigations showed a right-sided pleural effusion and pleural thickening suggestive of malignancy, which would have been in keeping with the clinical presentation. Initial pleural biopsy showed features suggestive of possible TB infection, though no growth on cultures. A repeat biopsy was negative on initial microscopy, but was culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also identifying isoniazid resistance. This case highlights that TB remains an important differential even in the absence of classical risk factors, and illustrates the diagnostic challenges it poses. It also highlights the value of culture positivity in identification of drug resistance and facilitation of appropriate treatment.

### Tolcapone [^114BW4tL]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Fibrotic Complications:

Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot derived drugs (e.g., tolcapone) that increase dopaminergic activity can cause them is unknown.

Three cases of pleural effusion, one with pulmonary fibrosis, occurred during clinical trials. These patients were also on concomitant dopamine agonists (pergolide or bromocriptine) and had a prior history of cardiac disease or pulmonary pathology (nonmalignant lung lesion).

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^115R4tQB]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Great progress has been made in building what is now a robust evidence base to inform a number of management strategies in MPE but nonetheless these still primarily focus on optimal drainage strategies. Over the next decade, more upstream research is needed to advance our understanding of the mechanistic drivers of MPE formation on a cellular level. Advances in immunological and intrapleural therapies pose exciting therapeutic directions that may offer targeted pharmacological treatment of MPE and it remains to be seen what effect the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies will have on the incidence of MPE. Early translational work has suggested that pleural fluid may not be an innocent bystander and may have pro-growth properties promoting cancer cell proliferation thus requiring pro-active drainage beyond palliative symptom control. As we increasingly define treatment pathways based on patient preference, there is a need for high quality qualitative data exploring the patient experience along the varied treatment strategies to inform discussions and to empower patients to make informed decisions.

### Lung abnormalities after dasatinib treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia: a case series [^111VquAD]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and are increasingly used for other indications. Fluid retention, however, including pleural effusions, are a significant side effect of imatinib, the first-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. We investigated pleural and pulmonary complications in patients treated with dasatinib, a novel multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as part of clinical trial protocols. Of 40 patients who received dasatinib (70 mg twice daily) for imatinib resistance or intolerance, 9 (22.5%) developed dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. Of these nine patients, six had pleural effusions (all were exudates) and seven had lung parenchyma changes with either ground-glass or alveolar opacities and septal thickening (four patients had both pleural effusions and lung parenchyma changes). Lymphocytic accumulations were detected in pleural and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in all patients except for one who presented with neutrophilic alveolitis. Pleural biopsies revealed lymphocytic infiltration in one patient and myeloid infiltration in another. After dasatinib interruption, lung manifestations resolved in all cases and did not recur in three of four patients when dasatinib was reintroduced at a lower dose (40 mg twice daily). Thus, lung physicians should be aware that lung manifestations, presumably related to an immune-mediated mechanism rather than fluid retention, may occur with dasatinib treatment.

### Cardiovascular disease prediction: do pulmonary disease-related chest CT features have added value? [^113i76pG]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this case-cohort study of 10,410 subjects who underwent routine clinical chest CT scanning, the incremental value of pulmonary, mediastinal and pleural findings over certain cardiovascular characteristics in CVD event risk prediction was evaluated. Ground glass, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were associated with an increased risk of CVD events, independent of age, gender, CT indication, cardiac diameter, LAD coronary artery calcifications, mitral valve calcifications and descending aorta calcifications. However, improvement of CVD event risk prediction beyond cardiovascular imaging findings with addition of these three pulmonary, mediastinal and pleural imaging features was only marginal. Thus, incidental vascular calcifications alone offer an important opportunity to identify patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore we recommend to routinely report these findings to allow further work-up and/or preventative treatment. This can be an efficient strategy to effectuate a further decline of the global cardiovascular disease burden without providing additional radiation to the patient or increasing health-care costs. However, in many institutions, there still is a controversy among radiologists whether incidental findings should be reported. Correspondingly, a professional consensus about standardized and universal reporting of incidental vascular calcification in routine radiological practice should be discussed and further developed.

Our data provide evidence for the established direct association between certain pulmonary diseases and CVD, as airway thickening, ground glass, consolidation, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were demonstrated to be associated with CVD risk. This positive relation can be explained because an important mutual cause for these imaging findings, inflammation, has a central role in the atherosclerotic process precipitating CVD events. Consistent with our findings, markers of inflammation measurable in serum or plasma (e.g. high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, fibrinogen) have also been associated with CVD risk. Additionally, some abnormalities reflect (subclinical) heart failure. The most common cause of bilateral pleural effusion is heart failure. Bilateral effusion can be a direct marker of CVD, explaining the significant association between pleural effusion and CVD risk even after adjustment for cardiovascular imaging features.

### Malignant pleural effusions [^114RVyGF]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The management of pleural effusions and, in particular, recurrent MPE require an accurate assessment of the characteristics of the pleural fluid and the relief of the patient's symptoms. Although a common problem, treatment of pleural effusions and MPE is highly variable. Selection of optimal treatment for the individual patient (or population of patients) requires a careful assessment of the benefits and associated risks of the therapy. Pleurodesis is an artificial measure of success that is hospital centered, not patient centered. Because patients with MPE have limited life expectancy, efforts to palliate or eliminate dyspnea, optimize function, eliminate hospitalization, and reduce excessive end-of-life medical care costs may be best achieved with a chronic indwelling pleural catheter. The need for expensive supplies may temper the use of such outpatient management. Alternative techniques of tube thoracostomy, drainage, and sclerosis or thoracoscopy with drainage and talc poudrage also have benefits but are associated with variable hospitalization and increased medical costs.

### Asbestos-related lung disease: a pictorial review [^113PysLw]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Asbestos exposure can lead to a variety of adverse effects in the thorax. Although currently in the western world, levels of exposure are kept in check by strict regulations, history of previous asbestos exposure continues to have an effect on many, owing to the latent nature of the pathophysiological response of the body to the inhaled fibers. The adverse effects of asbestos generally fall under 3 categories: pleural disease, lung parenchymal disease, and neoplastic disease. Effects on the pleura include pleural effusions, plaques, and diffuse pleural thickening. In the parenchyma, rounded atelectasis, fibrotic bands, and asbestosis are observed. Differentiating asbestosis from other forms of interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usual interstitial pneumonia, smoking-related lung disease, and mixed interstitial lung diseases, is important because the prognosis, course of disease, and management of the patient should be tailored based on the specific etiology of the disease. In this review, imaging findings specific to asbestosis are discussed. Finally, exposure to asbestos can lead to neoplastic disease such as pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal mesothelioma, and bronchogenic carcinoma. The purpose of this article is to review the effects of asbestos exposure in the thorax, pathophysiology of these responses, and disease course. Particular emphasis is placed on the radiographic appearance of the disease, discussion of various imaging modalities and their utility, and the role of imaging in the management of patients with previous asbestos exposure and asbestos-related pulmonary disease.

### Development and validation of the PET-CT score for diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion [^114YtQZz]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Compared with other imaging examinations, one distinct advantage of PET-CT is that it may simultaneously detect malignancies occurring in any organs. If PET-CT suggests primary or metastatic tumors outside the lung, then the possibility of MPE is greatly increased. Therefore, the finding of extrapulmonary malignancies indicates the malignant nature of pleural effusion and can also be offered 3 points.

The majority (84.5%) of our patients with MPE had pleural thickening coupled with increased 18 F-FDG uptake; whereas 73.0% of our patients with benign effusion also exhibited pleural thickening. However, only 35.7% of these patients had increased 18 F-FDG uptake in the thickened pleura. Pleural thickening (≥ 3 mm) with increased 18 F-FDG uptake enters the PET-CT score with 2 points.

Multiple pulmonary nodules or masses with increased 18 F-FDG uptake are frequently seen in lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis, and sometimes can also be observed in benign diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis. Both malignant cells and inflammatory cells are associated with increased 18 F-FDG uptake, and in general the former is higher than the latter. In the present study, multiple nodules or masses (uni- or bilateral lungs) with increased 18 F-FDG uptake or increased pleural effusion 18 F-FDG uptake are meaningful in differentiating MPE from benign effusion, although the coefficient is not very high (1 point each).

The most important strength of this study is its large sample size and the prospective nature of the consecutive cases in the derivation and validation cohorts. Another strength is that we conducted a comprehensive follow-up to ascertain definite etiological diagnosis of pleural effusion. However, our study had several limitations. First, in the derivation cohort, all consecutive patients with pleural effusions admitted to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of our hospital were recruited in the present study. All patients were persuaded to undergo PET-CT, and only those with a definite cause of pleural effusion were included in the final statistical analysis. It should be noted that some patients with a relatively easy clinical diagnosis, including 46 patients with parapneumonic effusion and three empyema, underwent PET-CT. Therefore, there might be a selection bias in the present study.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® workup of pleural effusion or pleural disease [^116VhVvQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusions are categorized as transudative or exudative, with transudative effusions usually reflecting the sequala of a systemic etiology and exudative effusions usually resulting from a process localized to the pleura. Common causes of transudative pleural effusions include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure, whereas exudative effusions are typically due to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. This document summarizes appropriateness guidelines for imaging in four common clinical scenarios in patients with known or suspected pleural effusion or pleural disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^115v2FMa]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Together with patient symptoms, early radiological detection of a predominantly unilateral pleural effusion represents another fundamental step when MPE is suspected. In this context, the chest radiograph remains useful, being the most rapidly available diagnostic tool. However, it is known that no single test can provide the complete answer, but a combination of a clinical assessment, evaluation of pre-test probabilities, and a careful selection of diagnostic tests allows physicians to be more confident in their diagnosis. Over the last decade significant advances have been achieved in diagnosing of pleural disease, particularly due to the use of thoracic ultrasound (TUS), which now plays a crucial role in diagnostic work-up of pleural conditions, including MPE. Since the initial pleural aspiration may have limited utility in the diagnosis of MPE, due to its low sensitivity, histological analysis of pleural tissue obtained via biopsy is usually required to get a definitive diagnosis and guide oncological treatment, although not in all cases where sometimes fluid alone is sufficient for both diagnosis and molecular testing of malignancy. However, data suggests this occurs in the minority of cases (around 30% in one analysis).

Non-invasive

Ultrasonography

Thoracic ultrasound has revolutionised the diagnosis and delivery of care in pleural disease including MPE.

Qureshi et al. reported a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 100% of TUS in distinguishing between malignant and benign pleural diseases, being pleural thickening exceeding 1 cm, pleural nodularity, and diaphragmatic thickening greater than 7 mm suggestive of malignancy.

Notably, discrete metastatic pleural nodules (greater than 5 mm) are readily detectable on TUS when MPE is present, due to the excellent acoustic window created by the anechoic appearance of the pleural fluid. Additionally, TUS can be useful and accurate also to detect chest wall involvement in patients with lung cancer and suspected tumour growth beyond parietal pleura.

Although TUS does not allow to achieve a definite MPE diagnosis, it can show suggestive signs requiring further invasive investigations. Furthermore, TUS is currently recommended to guide most of pleural interventions procedures minimizing the risk of adverse events, such as accidental organ puncture, pneumothorax, and bleeding from intercostal and internal mammary arteries.

Moreover, a pre-thoracoscopy TUS assessment can aid the operator in selecting the optimal entry site, allow for the recognition of the sliding sign as an indicator of lung collapsibility and predict non-expandible lung.

### Associated pleural and pericardial effusions: an extensive differential explored [^111URRzh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Concurrent pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study had addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

### Impact of pleural thickness on the sensitivity of computed tomography scan-guided cutting-needle pleural biopsy in diagnosing unexplained exudative pleural effusion [^1129rJ4N]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study suggests that CT-CNPB may serve as a preferred diagnostic approach in suspected TPE cases with pleural thickening ≥ 3 mm and suspected MPE cases with pleural thickening ≥ 5 mm, as identified on CT imaging. In settings where MT is unavailable, CT-CNPB can be considered for patients with suspected MPE or TPE, provided that pleural thickening, nodularity, or mass lesions are observed. However, in patients with suspected BPE, CT-CNPB alone appears insufficient for definitive diagnosis; comprehensive clinical, laboratory and radiological correlation is essential in such cases.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for pleural effusion, more specifically with respect to diagnostic thoracentesis, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to perform diagnostic thoracentesis for new-onset, unilateral, and larger than minimal pleural effusions in the absence of clinically evident HF, cirrhosis, or kidney failure appropriately responsive to therapy. Perform therapeutic thoracentesis to relieve symptoms.

### Mesothelioma with non-pleural malignancy: a red herring or just an uncommon pairing? [^113nb5E4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumour derived from the lining of the pleural cavity. It frequently presents with dyspnoea and chest pain, and uncommonly with cough, fatigue and weight loss. Occasionally the diagnosis is suspected following a routine chest radiograph, with pleural thickening or a pleural effusion.

The incidence of MPM is 10–30 per million per year in unselected male populations, and approximately 2 per million per year in female subjects. More than 80 per cent of MPMs develop in individuals with higher than background exposure to asbestos, with an incidence as high as 366/100,000 person-years in heavily exposed workers. The latent interval between first exposure to asbestos and death is very long, with a mean of 41 years and a range of 15–67 years in one series. The use of 'asbestos exposure' as predictor of mesothelioma is however unreliable as many patients are unaware of such exposure or when it occurred. Other potential causative factors of MPMs include the simian virus 40 (SV40), other environmental carcinogens such as erionite, ionising radiation and genetic factors. The role of radiotherapy in inducing malignancy is well described but as yet the link with mesothelioma is unclear.

MPMs have infrequently been reported in patients who had received radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) for previous non-pleural malignancy. Examples include the development of MPMs after radiation therapy for breast cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the lung and Wilm's tumour with pulmonary metastasis. MPM following chemotherapy alone for breast cancer has also been reported. Isolated cases of concurrence of MPM with breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma are described.

These cases highlight the importance of the systematic consideration of a diagnosis of MPM in all patients with the typical presentation of a pleural effusion, irrespective of any history of a previous malignancy (patients 1–3) and regardless of previous asbestos exposure. The incorrect assumption that a pleural effusion is caused by the known non-pleural malignancy can be a source of significant delay between presentation and referral. This delay (between 2 and 8 months in the present series) is important in view of the fact that survival after diagnosis of MPMs may be significantly improved as treatment strategies are developed (17,18,19).

### Mimics in chest disease: interstitial opacities [^1158NDaZ]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Fig. 8
Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. HRCT at the level of the lower lobes demonstrates a coarse "reticular pattern" with traction bronchiolectasis and bronchiectasis, thickening of the intralobular and peribronchovascular interstitium and ground-glass opacity. The presence of lobular areas of decreased attenuation offers a "key" for the diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis

The most common histological types of interstitial lung disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are UIP and NSIP and therefore RA may present with a reticular pattern mimicking entirely IPF or NSIP. The HRCT appearance is subpleural and basal reticulation with mild honeycombing. Differentiating findings may be the associated centrilobular nodules and frank bronchiectases reflecting coexistence of airways disease, as well as pleural thickening and pleural effusion (Fig. 9).

Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) may rarely mimic IPF, as it may present with subpleural basal minor reticulation. Honeycombing is usually absent, although in late stages minimal honeycombing may be seen. Ground-glass opacity is a common finding and the presence of emphysema and lung cysts may help in the differential diagnosis (Fig. 10).

### Unusual pediatric lung infections: imaging findings [^113wGXqk]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia

Eosinophilic pneumonias are a large group of interstitial lung diseases characterized by a substantial infiltration of the alveolar spaces and lung interstitium by eosinophils, with conservation of the lung structure. Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias are rare entities and pediatric case descriptions are scarce. Diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia relies on the demonstration of alveolar eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage and elimination of a secondary cause (parasitic or fungal infection, asthma, cystic fibrosis, drug effect). Idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias can have acute and chronic presentations. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia clinically presents as a hypoxic and febrile acute respiratory distress syndrome, accompanied by myalgia. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia has a slower progressive clinical presentation beginning with prolonged dry cough.

The radiographic pattern of acute eosinophilic pneumonia is nonspecific. Diffuse interstitial and air-space opacities without peripheral predominance, interlobular septal thickening, and pleural effusions can be observed. The random distribution of abnormalities and pleural effusion are important diagnostic features. The radiographic pattern in the chronic form is more specific with non-segmental peripheral airspace consolidation (i.e. reverse batwing appearance) involving mainly the middle and upper lobes. In the later stages of eosinophilic pneumonia, ground-glass opacities, pulmonary nodules, and reticulation can be demonstrated on chest CT (Fig. 11). Pleural effusion is not a common finding.

The image shows diffuse air-space opacities in both lungs in keeping with eosinophilic pneumonia. The patient responded well to corticosteroid treatment

### Medical thoracoscopy combined with intrapleural injection of urokinase for treatment of pleural infection-a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study: study protocol [^111cJ2vi]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical thoracoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pleural diseases and can also be used in their treatment. Retrospective studies have found that patients with pleural empyema who received early medical thoracoscopy treatment had significantly better outcomes than those who received late treatment. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by Adnan Majid et al. in 2020, which included 32 patients, demonstrated that for patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyema, MT treatment is safer compared to intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, and can also reduce hospitalization duration. However, prospective, multicenter studies comparing the efficacy and safety of medical thoracoscopy combined with intrapleural fibrinolytics versus intrapleural fibrinolytics alone are still lacking.

The primary approaches for the local treatment of patients with pleural infections include pleural drainage, with the main techniques being medical thoracoscopy, pleural catheter drainage, and intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. The change in pleural effusion volume is the primary indicator of the effectiveness of local treatment. Therefore, the main outcome measure in this study is the rate of change in pleural effusion. Effective local drainage may reduce the duration of illness, so it is also necessary to observe the total hospitalization time and the hospitalization time after randomization. In patients with significant residual pleural effusion, there is a risk of developing chronic pleural inflammation, pleural thickening, and restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the chest wall collapse rate, pleural thickening, and changes in lung function at three months post-randomization. Additionally, the failure rate of treatment serves as a key indicator for assessing the effectiveness of the treatment plan. Safety indicators include thoracic bleeding volume, pleural reactions, pain, 30-day mortality, prolonged air leak, subcutaneous emphysema, and wound infection, all of which are common complications in the local treatment of patients with pleural infections.

This study is the first prospective, multicenter clinical trial on the efficacy and safety of medical thoracoscopy combined with intrapleural injection of urokinase for the treatment of pleural infection. It is also the first to evaluate various treatment plans for patients with pleural infections from a health economics perspective, providing evidence for medical decisions that align with socio-economic benefits.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^116AgcbW]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

CT-scan

Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) remains an essential step in diagnosing MPE, providing pleural features indicative for malignancy such as nodular pleural thickening, mediastinal pleural thickening, parietal pleural thickening (> 1 cm) and circumferential pleural thickening, showing a high specificity but low sensitivity.

Porcel et al. designed a single-centre study to validate a scoring system for identifying malignancy based on chest CT findings that included three elements: (1) Pleural lesion greater than or equal to 1 cm (5 points); (2) Presence of liver metastasis, abdominal mass, or lung mass/nodule (3 points each); (3) Absence of pleural loculations, pericardial effusion, or cardiomegaly (2 points each) A total score of 7 points or higher predicted MPE with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 94% in the validation cohort.

Whether or not pleural fluid drainage before CT scan is required, is debatable, as scanning prior to pleural tap allows a better visualisation of the pleural layer but doesn't provide accurate information on potential lung parenchymal lesions. In addition, the presence of pleural fluid may facilitate additional interventional procedures, such as thoracoscopy. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of a clear advantage of either of the two approaches, as demonstrated by Corcoran et al. Therefore, the choice of further invasive procedure to obtain a pleural biopsy should be guided by the clinical scenario and local resources.

### Benign asbestos pleural diseases [^111VbD4A]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The global incidence of asbestos-related lung diseases is expected to continue to rise. Although much attention is devoted to malignant diseases induced by asbestos, benign asbestos pleural diseases (pleural plaques, benign asbestos-related pleural effusion, diffuse pleural thickening, and rounded atelectasis) are common in clinical practice and often produce diagnostic difficulties. The authors describe the clinical features of benign asbestos-related pleural disease, before focusing on recent advances in radiology and on controversies surrounding the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced pleural injury. Advances in computed tomography have assisted the understanding and diagnosis of these diseases, and increasing evidence suggests radiologic appearances on computed tomography can predict impairment in pulmonary function tests. The pathogenesis of asbestos-induced pleural diseases has also been subject to extensive investigation. Asbestos fibers can provoke pleural inflammation from direct toxicity to mesothelial cells. Inhaled asbestos fibers can also elicit pleural injury indirectly via the release of growth factors and inflammatory cytokines from within the lung. Although progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms of asbestos pleural injury, many important questions remain unanswered. The role of genetic factors and possible environmental cofactors (eg, simian virus 40) in the pathogenesis of benign asbestos pleural diseases requires further research.

### Ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of pleural disease [^112LyYd7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The authors summarize the current applications of chest ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of various pleural diseases. Ultrasound has been proved to be valuable for the evaluation of a wide variety of chest diseases, particularly when the pleural cavity is involved. Chest ultrasound can supplement other imaging modalities of the chest and guides a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pleural tumors, tumor extension into the pleura and even the chest wall, pleuritis, and pneumothorax can be detected easily and accurately with chest ultrasound. Many ultrasound features and signs of these diseases have been well characterized and widely applied in clinical practice. Under real-time ultrasound guidance the success rates of invasive procedures on pleural diseases increase significantly whereas the risks are greatly reduced. The advantages of low-cost, bedside availability and no radiation exposure have made ultrasound an indispensable diagnostic tool in modern pulmonary medicine.

### Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. An official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^112Zm1eL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning patterns — classification of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) patterns is defined as follows: UIP and probable UIP are subpleural and basal predominant with distribution often heterogeneous, with UIP characterized by honeycombing with or without peripheral traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis. Probable UIP shows a reticular pattern with peripheral traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis and may have mild ground-glass opacities (GGO). Indeterminate for UIP includes subpleural and basal predominant disease with subtle reticulation that may have mild GGO or distortion ("early UIP pattern") and CT features and/or distribution of lung fibrosis that do not suggest any specific etiology ("truly indeterminate for UIP"). Findings suggesting an alternative diagnosis include CT features such as cysts, marked mosaic attenuation, predominant GGO, profuse micronodules, centrilobular nodules, nodules, or consolidation; predominant distributions including peribronchovascular, perilymphatic, or upper or mid-lung; and other signs such as pleural plaques (consider asbestosis), dilated esophagus (consider CTD), distal clavicular erosions (consider RA), extensive lymph node enlargement (consider other etiologies), or pleural effusions/pleural thickening (consider CTD/drugs).

### Contralateral reexpansion pulmonary edema with ipsilateral collapsed lung after pleural effusion drainage: a case report [^115tU2hX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Reexpansion pulmonary edema is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that usually occurs through rapid reexpansion of a chronically collapsed lung. It can occur in every type of chronically collapsed lung, including pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or a huge mediastinal mass. The present case describes a 57-year-old Korean man who developed contralateral reexpansion pulmonary edema with the ipsilateral collapsed lung after tube thoracostomy drainage of a malignant pleural effusion.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old Korean man with no underlying disease visited our hospital emergency department for progressive dyspnea over the course of several days. The initial history revealed he was conscious, alert, and oriented. Vital signs showed that the patient was tachypneic (39/min), tachycardic (115/min) and normotensive (130/90 mm Hg). However, he was not hypoxic (O 2 saturation 98% on room air). Laboratory findings were non- specific. Initial chest x-ray and CT showed massive pleural effusion in the right hemithorax, diffuse pleural thickening, and several small nodules in the left lung, suggesting malignant pleural effusion (Fig. 1). At first, an 8.3- French pig tail catheter drainage for the pleural effusion was performed. The pleural effusion study showed sanguineous and lympho-dominant exudate. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was 367.6 μg/L and adenosine deaminase was measured at 41 IU/L. However, the cytology findings of the effusion were negative for malignancy. Because the pleural effusion was not effectively drained, a 24-French tube thoracostomy without any negative pressure suction was performed in the right pleural cavity. The initial amount of drainage was 1500 ml. The patient tolerated the procedure well and his symptoms improved. However, the patient's dyspnea worsened, and his oxygen saturation dropped to 66% on room air the next morning. The patient required a 100% FiO 2 via mask with a reservoir bag to maintain and stabilize his oxygen saturation. A chest radiograph and chest CT taken at that time showed a right half- collapsed lung, and diffuse and severe infiltrative patterns, suggesting reexpansion pulmonary edema in the left whole lung field (Fig. 2).

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^113qJtcE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pleural effusion is a common presentation, originating from a wide range of disorders, including congestive cardiac failure, pneumonia and cancer. The cause of a pleural effusion frequently remains unclear after thoracentesis. Light's criteria are used to help differentiate exudates from transudates by measuring the protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in the pleural fluid and the serum, and algorithms for the investigation of exudative pleural effusion have been developed. Nonetheless, the cause of exudative effusion remains uncertain in a substantial percentage of patients with lymphocytic pleural effusion after extensive examinations including thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Approximately 30% of cases of exudative pleural effusion are reported to be diagnosed with nonspecific pleuritis, that is no specific diagnosis, even after a complete investigation including thoracoscopy, and 12–15% of nonspecific pleuritis are ultimately diagnosed with pleural malignancy after a mean interval between thoracoscopy and the final diagnosis of 4.4–9.8 months. Therefore, 12–16 months of follow-up is suggested following thoracoscopy for patients with nonspecific pleuritis to exclude malignancy; however, unexplained pleural effusions often present a management dilemma for clinicians because of ongoing uncertainty about the possibility of a false-negative result from sampling error. In addition, the clinical course of such pleural effusions varies, for example resolving, persistent and progressive. Hence, new approaches are needed to detect their causes. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a fibroinflammatory disorder of uncertain cause that affects various organs including the pleura. Several lines of evidence indicate that IgG4-RD accounts for a proportion of patients with pleural effusions of idiopathic cause.

### Entacapone (Comtan) [^11667e64]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibrotic Complications: Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents. These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, but complete resolution does not always occur. Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot derived drugs (e.g., entacapone) that increase dopaminergic activity can cause them is unknown. It should be noted that the expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone. Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis were reported during clinical development of entacapone; three of these patients were also treated with pergolide and one with bromocriptine. The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months.

Melanoma: Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.

For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using Comtan for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).

Renal Toxicity

In a 1-year toxicity study, entacapone (plasma exposure 20 times that in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 1,600 mg) caused an increased incidence of nephrotoxicity in male rats that was characterized by regenerative tubules, thickening of basement membranes, infiltration of mononuclear cells, and tubular protein casts. These effects were not associated with changes in clinical chemistry parameters, and there is no established method for monitoring for the possible occurrence of these lesions in humans. Although this toxicity could represent a species-specific effect, there is not yet evidence that this is so.

Hepatic Impairment

Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution. The AUC and Cmaxof entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease compared to controls (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics of Entacapone and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Frequency of abnormalities detected by point-of-care lung ultrasound in symptomatic COVID-19 patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112E339y]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The proportion of pleural thickening.

Five studies reported the frequency of pleural thickening. The PP of pleural thickening is 0.54 (95% 0.11–0.95 I 2 93%, Q 61.1). This was less than the PP of pleural line abnormalities because of one study that reported a 35% frequency of pleural thickening while reporting a 100% frequency of pleural line irregularities. There was marked heterogeneity evident by the high I 2 (Figure 2). As explained earlier, the study by Peng et al.reported that pleural thickening has occurred in most patients without specifying the frequency, hence excluded from the computation of this PP.

The proportion of consolidations.

Six studies reported on the frequency of subpleural or pulmonary consolidations detected by lung US. The frequency ranged from 20% to 75%. The PP is 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21–0.58 I 2 72%, Q 17.8) (Figure 2). I 2 indicated a marked heterogeneity.

The proportion of pleural effusion.

Five studies reported the frequency of pleural effusion detected by lung US. It ranged from 0% to 12.5% in four studies, whereas in one study, 60% of the patients had pleural effusion. The PP of this finding was the lowest at 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00–0.37 I 2 93%, Q 27.3). The results of these studies were significantly heterogeneous (Figure 3).

Risk of bias assessment.

The funnel plot depicted moderate to marked asymmetry, suggesting potential publication bias. For comparison, we populated DOI plots with LFK indices to ascertain the publication bias. Using these additional measures, only pleural line abnormalities, finding remained at high risk of publication bias. We used the QUADAS2 tool to assess the study quality and risk of bias; the included studies mostly revealed an unclear or moderate risk of bias. There was marked heterogeneity with regard to pooling the proportion of pleural thickening, consolidation, or pleural effusion.

### Pleural effusions as markers of mortality and disease severity: a state-of-the-art review [^115W9y8F]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are common and are the result of various etiologies. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) has a known high mortality, but there is also increasing evidence that patients with benign pleural effusions also have a poor prognosis. This review will discuss the most recent literature on mortality and prognostication in patients with pleural effusion.

Recent Findings

Survival in patients with MPE is influenced by many factors, the most significant of which are underlying tumor type, performance score, and markers of systemic inflammation. Prognostic models have been developed for patients with both MPE and those with pleural infection to aid with treatment decision-making and patient counseling. Patients with benign pleural effusions may benefit from more definitive treatment of their pleural effusion as opposed to repeated thoracentesis.

Summary

Both benign and MPEs are associated with high mortality. Prognostic models and studies comparing treatment modality effect on survival will continue to guide management of these complex problems.

### Malignant pleural mesothelioma [^115btbcq]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive tumour of the pleura, commonly linked to asbestos exposure. However, its diagnosis is challenging, especially without known exposure. We present the case of a woman in her early 70s with no history of asbestos exposure, who presented with progressive breathlessness and left-sided chest pain. Radiological assessment revealed a large pleural effusion and nodular pleural thickening. Malignant pleural mesothelioma was confirmed through histopathological analysis of biopsies obtained via medical thoracoscopy. The patient was initiated on a palliative chemotherapy regimen, underwent talc slurry pleurodesis for recurrent effusion, and is currently under follow-up. This case emphasises the importance of a high index of suspicion for malignant pleural mesothelioma in patients with unexplained pleural effusion, even in the absence of typical risk factors, and the need for a timely diagnosis due to the disease's dismal prognosis.

### Eosinophilic pleural effusions [^111mUx6T]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic pleural effusions, defined as a pleural effusion that contains at least 10% eosinophils, may be caused by almost every condition that can cause pleural disease. Eosinophilic pleural effusion occurs most commonly during conditions associated with the presence of blood or air in the pleural space, infections, and malignancy. Drug-induced pleural effusions, pleural effusions accompanying pulmonary embolism, and benign asbestos pleural effusions are also among the common causes of eosinophilic pleural effusion. No etiology is found in as many as one third of patients. Because studies evaluating different diagnostic approaches with eosinophilic pleural effusions are lacking, the authors suggest that certain noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tools must be used based on the patient's clinical characteristics.

### Medical thoracoscopy vs CT scan-guided abrams pleural needle biopsy for diagnosis of patients with pleural effusions: a randomized, controlled trial [^111ibo6R]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In cases of pleural effusion, tissue samples can be obtained through Abrams needle pleural biopsy (ANPB), thoracoscopy, or cutting-needle pleural biopsy under the guidance of CT scan (CT-CNPB) for histopathologic analysis. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic efficiency and reliability of ANPB under CT scan guidance (CT-ANPB) with that of medical thoracoscopy in patients with pleural effusion.

Methods

Between January 2006 and January 2008, 124 patients with exudative pleural effusion that could not be diagnosed by cytologic analysis were included in the study. All patients were randomized after the CT scan was performed. Patients either underwent CT-ANPB or thoracoscopy. The two groups were compared in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and complications associated with the methods used.

Results

Of the 124 patients, malignant mesothelioma was diagnosed in 33, metastatic pleural disease in 47, benign pleural disease in 42, and two were of indeterminate origin. In the CT-ANPB group, the diagnostic sensitivity was 87.5%, as compared with 94.1% in the thoracoscopy group; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.252). No difference was identified between the sensitivities of the two methods based on the cause, the CT scan findings, and the degree of pleural thickening. Complication rates were low and acceptable.

Conclusion

We recommend the use of CT-ANPB as the primary method of diagnosis in patients with pleural thickening or lesions observed by CT scan. In patients with only pleural fluid appearance on CT scan and in those who may have benign pleural pathologies other than TB, the primary method of diagnosis should be medical thoracoscopy.

### Asbestos: when the dust settles an imaging review of asbestos-related disease [^113Kxirb]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Asbestos-related neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases of the lungs and pleura range from pleural effusion and pleural plaques to lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. Pleural effusions are typically hemorrhagic exudates of mixed cellularity but do not typically contain asbestos bodies. The classic distribution of pleural plaques seen on chest radiographs is the posterolateral chest wall between the seventh and tenth ribs, lateral chest wall between the sixth and ninth ribs, the dome of the diaphragm, and the mediastinal pleura. Computed tomographic (CT) findings support this distribution but also show anterior and paravertebral plaques not well shown at chest radiography. Imaging features of diffuse pleural thickening include a continuous sheet, often involving the costophrenic angles and apices, that rarely calcifies. The typical CT features of round atelectasis are of a round or oval mass that abuts the pleura, a "comet tail" of bronchovascular structures going into the mass, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. Features of asbestosis on chest radiographs include ground-glass opacification, small nodular opacities, "shaggy" cardiac silhouette, and ill-defined diaphragmatic contours. CT, however, is more sensitive in their detection. Chest radiography in patients with malignant mesothelioma may show an effusion, pleural thickening, and as the tumor progresses, a more lobulated outline. CT can help identify the disease in its early stages. Asbestos-related cancers can occur anywhere in the lungs. Recognition of the clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of these diseases will be important for some years to come.

### Sarcoidosis associated pleural effusion: clinical aspects [^115iwNFT]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A sarcoidosis associated pleural effusion (SAPE) is a pleural effusion caused by active granulomatous inflammation from sarcoidosis. We describe the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic approach, treatment strategies and outcome of this condition. SAPE occurs in approximately 1% of sarcoidosis patients. The condition most commonly occurs at the initial presentation of sarcoidosis or within the first year. Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom. Although a definitive diagnosis of SAPE requires a pleural biopsy, the diagnosis may be established on the basis of clinical features alone provided that alternative conditions can be reliably excluded. Pleural fluid analysis is essential in establishing the clinical diagnosis of SAPE. Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice for SAPE, and they are usually rapidly effective with courses of therapy often lasting less than two months. SAPE tends to have a low rate of recurrence that appears be to lower than for many other forms of sarcoidosis.

### What is the minimal radiation dose that can be used for detecting pleural effusion? [^116VJQwU]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to assess the effect of radiation dose reduction on the detection of pleural effusions, thickening, and calcifications.

Materials and Methods

Forty-five human cadavers (mean age at death, 60 ± 17 [SD] years; male-female ratio, 29:16; mean body mass index, 29 ± 5.7 [SD] kg/m(2)) were scanned at seven different dose levels (CT Dose Index volume [CTDIvol] = 20, 12, 10, 6, 4, 2, and 0.8 mGy) on a 128-MDCT unit (Definition FLASH). Images were reconstructed at a 3-mm slice thickness and 2-mm increment with filtered back projection (FBP) technique. Two chest radiologists independently reviewed all image series for the detection of pleural effusion, pleural calcification, and adjacent parenchymal opacification from atelectasis or consolidation. Objective image noise was measured at each dose level on the pleural effusion using ImageJ software. Data analysis was performed with the Student t test and kappa test.

Results

Pleural effusions were seen in 39 of 45 cadavers on image series acquired at 2–20 mGy. Only 14 of 39 pleural effusions were identified at 0.8 mGy. Pleural effusions were not detected in 25 of 39 cadavers at 0.8 mGy because of photon starvation and increased image noise. Patient size was significantly larger in subjects with undetected pleural effusion than in those with detectable pleural effusion at 0.8 mGy (p < 0.01). Pleural calcifications and thickening (seen at 2–10 mGy images in three of three cadavers) were not identified on 0.8-mGy FBP images. On the other hand, adjacent parenchymal opacification could be assessed at all dose levels. The mean CT numbers of the pleural effusion were significantly lower on 0.8-mGy images than on images obtained at all other dose levels (-21 ± 55 [SD] vs 17.6 ± 19 HU, respectively) (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Pleural effusions, thickening, and calcifications can be seen on FBP images reconstructed at a CTDIvol as low as 2 mGy (32-cm body phantom). CT at 0.8 mGy may provide suboptimal information on very small pleural effusions, pleural thickening, and calcifications.

5.16 Fibrotic Complications

Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pericarditis, and cardiac valvulopathy have been reported in some patients treated with ergot-derived dopaminergic agents. While these complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, complete resolution does not always occur.

Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot-derived dopamine agonists can cause them is unknown.

5.17 Binding to Melanin

As has been reported with other dopamine agonists, binding to melanin-containing tissues (i.e., eyes) in the pigmented rat and monkey was evident after a single dose of rotigotine, but was slowly cleared over the 14-day observation period.

American Thoracic Society — Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) management — we suggest that therapeutic pleural interventions not be performed in patients with known or suspected MPE who are asymptomatic (conditional recommendation, very low confidence in estimate of effects; Tables E4B and E5B). Data are insufficient to recommend sampling or draining these asymptomatic effusions, and drainage would only subject the patient to the risks of the procedure without providing clinical benefit; however, if pleural fluid is required for diagnostic purposes, fluid and/or tissue sampling would be appropriate.

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^114PvECQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — Treatment of underlying causes of dyspnea in advanced cancer states that Patients with potentially reversible, common etiologies of dyspnea such as pleural effusion, pneumonia, airway obstruction, anemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, or treatment-induced pneumonitis should be given goal-concordant treatment(s) consistent with their wishes, prognosis, and overall health status (good practice statement). Patients with dyspnea because of underlying malignancy (eg, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, atelectasis because of large pulmonary mass, malignant pleural effusion) may benefit from cancer-directed treatment if consistent with their wishes, prognosis, and overall health status (good practice statement). Patients with underlying comorbidities such as COPD or heart failure should have the management of these conditions optimized (good practice statement).

### Impact of pleural thickness on the sensitivity of computed tomography scan-guided cutting-needle pleural biopsy in diagnosing unexplained exudative pleural effusion [^111T4NXb]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In most cases, patients with pleural effusion require a pleural biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, due to the low diagnostic sensitivity of thoracentesis. Among the different biopsy modalities, real time computed tomography scan-guided cutting-needle pleural biopsy (CT-CNPB) ensures high sensitivity and accessibility. However, there is no study investigating the difference in the diagnostic sensitivity of CT-CNPB for lesions with variable pleural thickness in effusions of different types.

Methods

Of the 303 patients who underwent CT-CNPB, 218 met the eligibility criteria and were retrospectively analyzed from November 2021 to June 2024. Patients were divided into malignant pleural effusion (MPE), tuberculosis pleural effusion (TPE), and non-tuberculous benign pleural effusion (BPE) groups according to the diagnosis with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Pleural thickness was defined as the length of the portion of the puncture needle that passes through the thickened parietal pleura or the pleural lesion (nodule/mass). In further analysis, we compare the differences in sensitivity between subgroups with different pleural thicknesses in each group.

Results

The overall diagnostic sensitivity is 74.3%. The sensitivity in MPE, TPE, and BPE is 75.7%, 78.6%, and 67.8%, respectively. There was a significant difference in sensitivity between the < 5 mm and ≥ 5 mm groups in MPE and BPE groups but was not observed in the TPE group. In the further analysis, there was a significant difference in sensitivity between < 3 mm and 3–5 mm groups in TPE (p = 0.046) and a significant difference in sensitivity between 3 and 5 mm and 5–10 mm groups in MPE (p = 0.017), but a significant difference was not observed in BPE group.

Conclusion

CT-CNPB may serve as a preferred diagnostic approach in suspected TPE with pleural thickening ≥ 3 mm and suspected MPE with thickening ≥ 5 mm on chest CT. Where MT is unavailable, CT-CNPB is a viable alternative for suspected MPE or TPE patients with pleural thickening, nodularity, or mass lesions observed on CT. However, in suspected BPE, CT-CNPB alone is often insufficient; integrated clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluation remains essential.

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^11571vM9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Pleural effusions have major effects on the cardiorespiratory system and cause abnormalities in gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and muscle function and hemodynamics. The association between these abnormalities and effusion-related breathlessness, and the response following thoracentesis, remains uncertain. Future research should aim to identify the key mechanisms driving breathlessness in patients with a pleural effusion and the important predictors of improvement following pleural drainage.

Pleural Effusion Classification

We defined effusions with additional pleural complexity features as complex and effusions without complexity features as simple. In the 335 cases for effusion classification, the additional pleural complexity features "hyperdense fluid", "pleural thickening", "gas", and "loculation" were visually determined by reader 1 in consensus with reader 4 (J.B. 29 PGY) and radiologically defined as:

- **Hyperdense fluid**: Density values greater than 15.6 HU in the pleural cavity, not otherwise explained, for example, by artifacts. Additional potential indicators such as rib fractures, postoperative changes, pleural fluid sedimentation, or pleural contrast extravasation confirmed the diagnosis, if present.
- **Pleural thickening**: Nodular or smooth pleural line as seen in the soft tissue kernel.
- **Gas**: Density values less than −850 within the pleural cavity resembling microbubbles (gas surrounded by pleural fluid) and/or pneumothorax.
- **Loculation**: Pleural effusion with an obtuse angle to the lung parenchyma (90 degrees < α < 180 degrees).

In addition, the classification dataset was dichotomized based on the resulting diagnosis of serous effusion from biopsy or thoracocentesis in the test dataset. However, microscopic evidence of erythrocytes in an otherwise serous effusion was not rated as a complex effusion, as this can be periprocedural.

The sample was randomly split into training/validation and testing datasets (n = 234 and n = 101, 70% and 30%, respectively).

Pleural biopsy — test performance data in known or suspected lung cancer indicate that a biopsy specimen of the pleura can be obtained via blind or closed percutaneous needle biopsy, image-guided needle biopsy, medical thoracoscopy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy; a review of 2,893 closed pleural biopsies using the Abrams needle reported a diagnostic yield for malignancy of 57%, with the diagnostic yield for malignancy increasing by 7% to 27% over pleural fluid cytology. Computed tomography (CT) patterns in 74 consecutive patients (39 malignant and 35 benign) distinguished malignant from benign disease through circumferential pleural thickening (sensitivity 41%, specificity 100%), nodular pleural thickening (sensitivity 51%, specificity 94%), parietal pleural thickening > 1 cm (sensitivity 36%, specificity 94%), and mediastinal pleural involvement (sensitivity 56%, specificity 88%), and Twenty-eight of the 39 malignant cases (sensitivity 72%, specificity, 83%) were identified correctly by one or more of these criteria. In four studies involving 215 patients with pleural effusions and diffuse pleural thickening, percutaneous image-guided pleural biopsy had a sensitivity of 84% (76%-88%) and a negative predictive value of 75% to 80%; in randomized comparisons, Abrams needle biopsy showed sensitivity 47% and negative predictive value 44%, with the rate of pneumothorax following image-guided pleural biopsy reported to be about 5%. Thoracoscopic biopsy performance ranges reported include sensitivity 80% to 99%, specificity 93% to 100%, and negative predictive value 93% to 96%.

Eosinophilic pneumonia

Eosinophilic pneumonia represents a various group of pulmonary disorders associated with peripheral or tissue eosinophilia. Laboratory tests and anamnesis are crucial for a correct differential diagnosis. HRTC is important to raise suspicion and avoid misdiagnoses.

Radiological features for differential diagnosis are (Fig. 4 c, d):
migrant lesions with absence of crazy paving pattern in SPE (simple pulmonary eosinophilia, also known as Loeffler syndrome);
pleural effusions, centrilobular nodules and thickening of bronchovascular bundles in AEP (acute eosinophilic pneumonia);
centrilobular consolidations with rarity of ground-glass opacities and crazy paving pattern in CEP (chronic eosinophilic pneumonia);
presence of additional findings in CEP as nodules, atelectasis, band-like opacities and pleural effusions.

### Prognostic features of residual pleural thickening in parapneumonic pleural effusions [^1176iiS5]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was the identification of predictive factors for the development of residual pleural thickening (RPT) in patients with parapneumonic effusion. The design of the prospective study involved investigating patients with parapneumonic pleural effusions diagnosed between March 1991 and December 2000 in the respiratory department of Hospital Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain) which is a 1,500 tertiary-care hospital. The clinical and radiological characteristics and measurements of microbiological and biochemical variables in the pleural fluid taken from the patients were studied. RPT was defined in a posteroanterior chest radiograph as pleural thickening of ≥ 10 mm measured at the lateral chest wall at the level of an imaginary line, tangent to the diaphragmatic dome. A total of 48 of the 348 patients studied (13.79%) were found to have RPT. Among the factors studied, only presence of pus in the pleural space, Fine classes IV and V, temperature ≥ 38 degrees C and delayed resolution of pleural effusions after diagnosis (> 15 days) were independently associated with the risk of RPT. This study showed that significant residual pleural thickening was not a common complication of parapneumonic pleural effusions. There are certain risk factors for the development of residual pleural thickening. However, this complication was not associated with long-term functional repercussions in the series of patients involved in this study.

Methods

Literature search strategy

The search was conducted on 25 September 2013 using the PubMed and Web of Science databases with no publication date limitations; the search strategy (including search strings) is summarised in online supplementary figure 1, with additional details of the process described below.

Standardised guidelines for defining plaques using radiographic evaluation are provided by the International Labour Organization (ILO), and have changed over time. The 1980 ILO guidelinesdefined circumscribed pleural thickening (ie, pleural plaques). The 2000 ILO revisiondefined a new category of localised pleural thickening (LPT) comprising only those plaques with width of at least 3 mm (intended to reduce the number of false-positive findings), and including plaques found on sites other than the chest wall (eg, diaphragm). Both pleural plaques as defined by the earlier ILO guidelines, and LPT as defined by the 2000 guidelines, were included in our literature search. There are no standardised guidelines similar to the ILO for defining pleural plaques using HRCT; thus, we used the authors' descriptions of the definition for pleural plaques.

2.3 Recommendations — initial diagnostic approach in suspected lung cancer: In patients suspected of having SCLC based on the radiographic and clinical findings, it is recommended that the diagnosis be confirmed by the least invasive method (sputum cytology, thoracentesis, FNA, bronchoscopy including TBNA), as dictated by the patient's presentation (Grade 1C). In patients suspected of having lung cancer, who have extensive infiltration of the mediastinum based on radiographic studies and no evidence of extrathoracic metastatic disease (negative PET scan), it is recommended that the diagnosis of lung cancer be established by the least invasive and safest method (bronchoscopy with TBNA, EBUS-NA, EUS-NA, TTNA, or mediastinoscopy) (Grade 1C). In patients suspected of having lung cancer who have a solitary extrathoracic site suspicious of a metastasis, it is recommended that tissue confirmation of the metastatic site be obtained if a FNA or biopsy of the site is feasible (Grade 1C). In patients suspected of having lung cancer, who have lesions in multiple distant sites suspected of metastases but in whom biopsy of a metastatic site would be technically difficult, it is recommended that diagnosis of the primary lung lesion be obtained by the least invasive method (Grade 1C). In patients suspected of having lung cancer who have an accessible pleural effusion, thoracentesis is recommended to diagnose the cause of the pleural effusion (Grade 1C). Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis improves the success rate and decreases the rate of pneumothorax and therefore ultrasound is recommended for performing diagnostic thoracentesis. In patients suspected of having lung cancer who have an accessible pleural effusion, if pleural fluid cytology is negative, pleural biopsy (via image-guided pleural biopsy, medical or surgical thoracoscopy) is recommended as the next step (Grade 1C). If the CT scan of the chest shows pleural thickening or pleural nodules/masses, image-guided needle biopsy may be considered as the first step to obtain a biopsy of the pleura. If pleural cytology is negative after the first thoracentesis, a second thoracentesis has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield of pleural fluid cytology, and depending on preferences and values a second thoracentesis may be considered before proceeding to biopsy of the pleura.

Nineteen patients had pathological biopsies suggestive of tuberculous pleurisy. Eleven patients had pleural infections. Nine patients had other pleural diseases, such as pleural plaque and pleural sarcoidosis. Six patients had nonspecific chronic inflammation on pleural biopsy. There were two patients with pleural disease with a small amount of pleural effusion and no pleural effusion who received medical thoracoscopy.

Pathogenesis of malignant pleural effusion

Pleural invasion of malignancy

Although the pleura may be invaded through lymphangitic spread or by the infiltration from adjacent structures (i.e. diaphragm, pericardium, chest wall), data from autopsy studies showed that tumor cells spread to the pleura mainly by the bloodstream, initially invading the visceral pleura. Therefore, secondary diffusion to the parietal pleural occurs by tumor seeding along adhesions or by exfoliated malignant cells floating in the fluid. Once arrived at the parietal pleura, tumor cells adhere to the mesothelium, evading pleural immune defense mechanisms, invading pleural tissue, and gaining access to nutrients and growth factors. In MPE patients, a complex interaction between tumor and host cells results in a pleural immunosuppressive environment, mainly due to impaired macrophages and lymphocyte cytotoxic function as well as a massive production of pro-inflammatory and tumor-stimulating mediators. Despite their detachment from pleural tissue, tumor cells floating in pleural space are still able to form secondary foci in other sites of the cavity, which suggests their capacity to use alternative sources of energy and growth factors. Recent data from early translational work showed that cancer cell cultures proliferation is promoted by seeding the cells in pleural effusion regardless of the source, suggesting a pro-growth property of pleural fluid. Therefore, it is arguable that pleural fluid may not be a bystander of malignancy, but may be an active promoter of cancer progression, thus leading to a potential change in MPE treatment approach, no longer symptoms relief-focused but aiming to achieve an early pleural fluid control.

Pleural evaluation — medical thoracoscopy vs CT-guided Abrams needle pleural biopsy (CT-ANPB): A systematic review reported medical thoracoscopy had a pooled sensitivity of 97% (95% CI, 92% to 99%) and pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI, 69%-100%). In a prospective randomized study of 124 cytology-negative exudative pleural effusions with CT evidence of pleural thickening or nodules, no statistically significant difference in diagnostic yield between CT-ANPB and medical thoracoscopy was identified, with overall diagnostic yield and yield for malignant pleural effusion due to lung cancer of 85% and 93% for CT-ANPB vs 94% and 100% for medical thoracoscopy. The authors concluded that CT-ANPB should be used as the primary method of diagnosis in patients with pleural thickening on CT, whereas thoracoscopy should be the primary diagnostic method in patients with pleural fluid only on CT.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults… [^111XSeNV]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion develops when more fluid enters the pleural space than is removed. Potential mechanisms of fluid increased interstitial fluid in the lungs secondary to increased pulmonary capillary pressure or permeability; decreased intrapleural pressure; decreased plasma oncotic pressure; increased pleural membrane permeability and obstructed lymphatic flow; diaphragmatic defects; and thoracic duct rupture. Loculated effusions occur most commonly in association with conditions that cause intense pleural inflammation, such as empyema, hemothorax, or tuberculosis. Occasionally, a focal intrafissural fluid collection may look like a lung mass. This situation most commonly is seen in patients with heart failure.

The disappearance of the apparent mass when the heart failure is treated definitively establishes the diagnosis of pseudotumor. Heart failure is by far the most common cause of bilateral pleural effusion, but if cardiomegaly is not present, other causes such as malignancy should be investigated. Large effusions may opacify the entire hemithorax and displace mediastinal structures toward the opposite side. More than one half of these massive pleural effusions are caused by malignancy; other causes are complicated parapneumonic effusion, empyema, and tuberculosis. 4 If the mediastinum is shifted toward the side of the effusion or is midline in a patient with a massive pleural effusion, either an endobronchial obstruction or a mediastinum encasement by tumor should be considered.

TRANSUDATIVE EFFUSIONS Transudates result from imbalances in hydrostatic and oncotic forces and are caused by a limited number of recognized clinical conditions such as heart failure and cirrhosis. Less common causes include nephrotic syndrome, atelectasis, peritoneal dialysis, constrictive pericarditis, superior vena caval obstruction, and urinothorax. Transudative effusions usually respond to treatment of the underlying condition.
