## Question

How does FMT restore the gut microbiome in patients with recurrent CDI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores the gut microbiome in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), including mechanisms, evidence, and limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of rCDI and why antibiotics often fail. Then, I should verify the core principle of colonization resistance and how FMT reconstitutes it. Next, I will examine the specific mechanisms that likely mediate efficacy, including microbial competition, bile acid metabolism, bacteriocins, and immune modulation. After that, I should review clinical efficacy data and guideline positions. Finally, I need to consider limitations, safety, and how next-generation microbiome therapeutics build on these mechanisms.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and why recurrence happens. rCDI typically follows antibiotic exposure that depletes commensal diversity, undermining colonization resistance and allowing C. difficile spores to germinate and proliferate; standard antibiotics target vegetative forms but not spores and can further damage the microbiome, perpetuating recurrence risk, which rises with each episode and can approach 60% after multiple recurrences [^1159HYfD] [^113VqAoZ] [^114iJuPb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the core therapeutic principle. FMT's primary goal is to restore colonization resistance by reintroducing a diverse, healthy microbial community that competes with C. difficile for nutrients and niches, produces inhibitory metabolites, and restores barrier and immune homeostasis; this ecological restoration is the central rationale repeatedly supported by clinical and mechanistic literature [^11267aqk] [^113oTwU5] [^114iJuPb].

> I will now examine microbial competition and niche exclusion. Healthy donor communities rapidly engraft and outcompete C. difficile for carbon sources and adhesion sites, lowering pathogen biomass and toxin production; this competitive exclusion is a foundational mechanism of colonization resistance and is consistently observed after successful FMT [^113oTwU5] [^116Q3o5G].

> Wait, let me verify the role of bile acids because this is often pivotal. C. difficile spore germination and vegetative growth are bile acid–sensitive; loss of bacteria that convert primary to secondary bile acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid) in dysbiosis favors pathogen proliferation. FMT restores these bile acid–metabolizing taxa and secondary bile acid pools, creating an inhospitable environment for C. difficile and strengthening colonization resistance; this mechanism is supported by both human and animal data and aligns with ecological models of FMT efficacy [^115A2ZWo] [^112MErt3] [^113oTwU5].

> Let me consider antimicrobial effectors next. Commensals introduced by FMT can produce bacteriocins and other inhibitory compounds that suppress C. difficile, while also lowering luminal pH and generating short-chain fatty acids that further constrain pathogen growth; these metabolic and antimicrobial effects contribute to a hostile niche for C. difficile after microbiome restoration [^1159HYfD] [^113oTwU5].

> But wait, what if the host immune milieu thwarts engraftment? I should confirm immune modulation as a mechanism. FMT reduces toxin-driven inflammation and promotes regulatory pathways; critically, adaptive immunity — particularly CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells — supports engraftment and metabolome restoration, and in their absence, FMT fails despite microbial transfer, underscoring that host immune status modulates outcomes and that FMT both depends on and helps reconstitute immune homeostasis [^115A2ZWo] [^111a5UBv] [^11593NNZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — do we need intact bacteria, or can soluble factors suffice? Initially, I thought live bacteria were strictly required, but I should double-check that assumption. Sterile fecal filtrates have shown efficacy in small studies, suggesting that bacteriophages, enzymes, or metabolites may mediate some effects; however, broader clinical success and durability still predominantly track with engraftment of donor taxa and restoration of community structure, so I should be cautious not to overstate a filtrate-only mechanism as universally sufficient [^116Q3o5G] [^112MErt3] [^114i91d6].

> Next, I should review clinical efficacy to ensure these mechanisms translate into outcomes. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show FMT roughly doubles resolution rates versus antibiotics in rCDI, with pooled risk ratios around 1.9 and high absolute cure rates, and contemporary guidelines endorse FMT after multiple recurrences or failure of appropriate antibiotics; long-term observational cohorts also demonstrate durable cure in most patients, supporting sustained microbiome restoration [^1146JxGY] [^113M11WS] [^112wXqk1].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and safety so we don't overgeneralize. About 5–20% of patients fail FMT, often due to inadequate engraftment, persistent dysbiosis, or host immune constraints; risks include transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms, so rigorous donor screening is essential, and FMT is generally avoided in severely immunocompromised hosts in current guidance; moreover, we still lack precise strain-level engraftment maps and standardized protocols, highlighting knowledge gaps that next-generation products aim to address [^111WsHGq] [^111ZByS6] [^111kLfgk] [^114i91d6].

> Let me reconsider how defined microbiome therapeutics fit into this mechanistic framework. FDA-approved live biotherapeutics such as RBX2660 and SER-109 operationalize these principles by delivering standardized consortia that restore diversity and secondary bile acid metabolism, achieving significant reductions in recurrence compared with placebo; their development and regulatory approval validate the centrality of colonization resistance and metabolome normalization in rCDI prevention [^113MhE4R] [^112nwK4F] [^116jBRGS].

> In summary, I need to ensure the causal chain is coherent: antibiotics disrupt the microbiome and impair colonization resistance, enabling C. difficile; FMT reintroduces a diverse microbial community that competitively excludes the pathogen, restores bile acid–mediated suppression, produces inhibitory metabolites, and modulates immunity to support engraftment and durable eubiosis; this mechanistic restoration explains the high and sustained clinical efficacy seen in trials and real-world cohorts, while also clarifying why failures occur when engraftment or host factors are suboptimal [^11267aqk] [^113oTwU5] [^114iJuPb].

FMT restores the gut microbiome in recurrent C. difficile infection by **replenishing microbial diversity** [^114iJuPb] and **restoring colonization resistance** [^11267aqk], which antibiotics alone cannot achieve [^1159HYfD]. Key mechanisms include **competitive exclusion** of C. difficile [^113oTwU5], restoration of secondary bile acids that inhibit C. difficile growth [^116jBRGS], and modulation of the immune system to reduce inflammation and support engraftment [^1146JxGY]. These changes durably suppress C. difficile, with **clinical cure rates of 80–90%** [^113BHu4j] and sustained microbiome stability over time [^1171DC1T] [^116MYR4m].

---

## Microbial diversity restoration

- **Loss of diversity**: rCDI is marked by reduced microbial diversity and altered composition, especially loss of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes [^112E56Kb] [^1159HYfD].

- **Donor engraftment**: FMT introduces diverse donor taxa, restoring richness and evenness and shifting the recipient microbiome toward a healthy donor-like state [^114i91d6] [^114vxJXQ].

- **Persistence**: Engrafted taxa often persist for months to years, supporting durable microbiome restoration and colonization resistance [^114i91d6] [^1171DC1T].

---

## Colonization resistance

- **Competitive exclusion**: Restored commensals compete with C. difficile for nutrients and niches, limiting pathogen growth [^113oTwU5].

- **Metabolic competition**: Commensals consume substrates (e.g. primary bile acids, carbohydrates) that C. difficile needs, suppressing germination and proliferation [^116jBRGS].

- **Bacteriocins**: Some commensals produce antimicrobial peptides that directly inhibit C. difficile [^1159HYfD].

---

## Restoration of bile acid metabolism

- **Secondary bile acids**: Healthy microbiota convert primary to secondary bile acids (e.g. deoxycholic acid) that inhibit C. difficile germination and growth [^115A2ZWo].

- **FMT restoration**: FMT restores secondary bile acid–producing bacteria and increases secondary bile acids, enhancing colonization resistance [^115A2ZWo] [^113oTwU5].

- **Clinical correlation**: Higher secondary bile acids post-FMT are associated with successful cure and lower recurrence [^115A2ZWo].

---

## Immune modulation

- **Inflammation resolution**: FMT reduces intestinal inflammation, improving barrier function and limiting C. difficile colonization [^11593NNZ].

- **Regulatory T cells**: FMT promotes Treg expansion, which restrains excessive inflammation and supports microbial engraftment [^111a5UBv].

- **Immune competence**: Host immunity influences FMT success; immunodeficient hosts have impaired engraftment and higher failure risk [^115A2ZWo].

---

## Clinical outcomes and durability

Clinical cure rates of **80–90%** are achieved after a single FMT, surpassing antibiotics [^113BHu4j] [^114vxJXQ]. Microbiome stability with restored diversity and colonization resistance typically persists for months to years [^112E56Kb] [^116MYR4m]. Recurrence is reduced because restored microbiota and metabolites suppress C. difficile over the long term [^115A2ZWo].

---

FMT restores the gut microbiome in rCDI by **re-establishing microbial diversity**, **colonization resistance**, bile acid metabolism, and immune modulation, yielding high and durable cure rates [^113oTwU5].

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile: mechanisms and pharmacology [^11267aqk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a remarkably successful treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection that cannot be cured with antibiotics alone. Understanding the complex biology and pathogenesis of C. difficile infection, which we discuss in this Perspective, is essential for understanding the potential mechanisms by which FMT cures this disease. Although FMT has already entered clinical practice, different microbiota-based products are currently in clinical trials and are vying for regulatory approval. However, all these therapeutics belong to an entirely new class of agents that require the development of a new branch of pharmacology. Characterization of microbiota therapeutics uses novel and rapidly evolving technologies and requires incorporation of microbial ecology concepts. Here, we consider FMT within a pharmacological framework, including its essential elements: formulation, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. From this viewpoint, multiple gaps in knowledge become apparent, identifying areas that require systematic research. This knowledge is needed to help clinical providers use microbiota therapeutics appropriately and to facilitate development of next-generation microbiota products with improved safety and efficacy. The discussion here is limited to FMT as a representative of microbiota therapeutics and recurrent C. difficile as the indication; however, consideration of the intrinsic basic principles is relevant to this entire class of microbiota-based therapeutics.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders. The mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT are not fully understood. Importantly, FMT remains a crucial treatment in managing CDI and understanding the mechanisms that underpin its success will be critical to improve its clinical efficacy, safety and usability. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of this may allow us to expose FMT's full potential as a therapeutic tool for other disease states. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

Introduction: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a procedure involving transfer of stool from a healthy donor into the intestinal tract of a diseased recipient to restore intestinal microbial composition and functionality. FMT's tremendous success in recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) catalyzed gut microbiota research and opened the door to microbiome-based therapy for various gastrointestinal and other disorders. Areas covered: We used PubMed search engine to identify significant publications in the field of CDI and FMT. Here we present an overview of the current literature on FMT's use for recurrent, non-severe, severe, and fulminant CDI and on promising future application. Expert opinion: FMT as the best tool for treatment of antibiotic-refractory CDI has gained immense popularity over the last decade. The future of gut microbiota-based therapy should include oral formulations that contain well-described ingredients in effective doses, clear mechanism of action, and excellent safety profile.

### Update on fecal microbiota transplantation 2015: indications, methodologies, mechanisms, and outlook [^113692P5]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The community of microorganisms within the human gut (or microbiota) is critical to health and functions with a level of complexity comparable to that of an organ system. Alterations of this ecology (or dysbiosis) have been implicated in a number of disease states, and the prototypical example is Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been demonstrated to durably alter the gut microbiota of the recipient and has shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI. There is hope that FMT may eventually prove beneficial for the treatment of other diseases associated with alterations in gut microbiota, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic syndrome, to name a few. Although the basic principles that underlie the mechanisms by which FMT shows therapeutic efficacy in CDI are becoming apparent, further research is needed to understand the possible role of FMT in these other conditions. Although relatively simple to perform, questions regarding both short-term and long-term safety as well as the complex and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape has limited widespread use. Future work will focus on establishing best practices and more robust safety data than exist currently, as well as refining FMT beyond current "whole-stool" transplants to increase safety and tolerability. Encapsulated formulations, full-spectrum stool-based products, and defined microbial consortia are all in the immediate future.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in relapsing Clostridium difficile infection [^116Ua9Mc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection rates are Climbing in frequency and severity, and the spectrum of susceptible patients is expanding beyond the traditional scope of hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. Fecal microbiota transplantation is becoming increasingly accepted as an effective and safe intervention in patients with recurrent disease, likely due to the restoration of a disrupted microbiome. Cure rates of > 90% are being consistently reported from multiple centers. Transplantation can be provided through a variety of methodologies, either to the lower proximal, lower distal, or upper gastrointestinal tract. This review summarizes reported results, factors in donor selection, appropriate patient criteria, and the various preparations and mechanisms of fecal microbiota transplant delivery available to clinicians and patients.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: benefits and barriers [^113i9DLc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) have increased worldwide in the past two decades. A principal function of the gut microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens. Increasingly, the gut microbiota have been shown to influence susceptibility to other genetic and environmentally acquired conditions. Transplantation of healthy donor fecal material in patients with CDI may re-establish the normal composition of the gut microbiota and has been shown to be effective in recurrent CDI. We intend to review the most recent data on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and critically discuss potential advantages and handicaps of this new therapeutic approach.

Recent Findings

Evidence from case series and only one randomized clinical trial suggests that FMT is able to restore the wide diversity of microflora, improve C. difficile-related symptoms and prevent CDI recurrence.

Summary

FMT is a promising treatment option for serious and recurrent CDI, and current evidence (although weak) demonstrates consistent and excellent efficacy in clinical outcomes. However, many questions should be answered before it may be recommended as routine standard treatment. Mechanisms of action need to be better understood. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to determine long-lasting effects (including the association with autoimmune diseases).

### The role of the gut microbiome in colonization resistance and recurrentinfection [^1159HYfD]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The species composition of the human gut microbiota is related to overall health, and a healthy gut microbiome is crucial in maintaining colonization resistance against pathogens. Disruption of gut microbiome composition and functionality reduces colonization resistance and has been associated with several gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases. One prime example is Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and subsequent recurrent infections that occur after the development of systemic antibiotic-related dysbiosis. Standard-of-care antibiotics used for both acute and recurrent infections do not address dysbiosis and often worsen the condition. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies, recommended in conjunction with standard-of-care antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent CDI in patients at high risk of recurrence, reduce recurrences but do not address the underlying dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an evolving therapeutic strategy in which microbes are harvested from healthy donor stool and transplanted into the gut of a recipient to restore the gut microbiome. Although effective in the prevention of recurrent CDI, some existing challenges include screening and the standardization of stool acquisition and processing. Recent safety alerts by the US Food and Drug Administration raised concern about the possibility of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via FMT. Increased knowledge that microbes are beneficial in restoring the gut microbiome has led to the clinical development of several newer biotherapeutic formulations that are more regulated than FMT, which may allow for improved restoration of the gut microbiome and prevention of CDI recurrence. This review focuses on mechanisms by which gut microbiome restoration could influence colonization resistance against the pathogen C. difficile.

Plain Language Summary

The Role of the Gut Microbiome inClostridioides difficileInfection Introduction: A rich and diverse gut microbiome is key to immune system regulation and colonization resistance against pathogens. A disruption in the gut microbiome composition can make the gut more vulnerable to diseases such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), caused by the bacterium C. difficile .CDI management presents a therapeutic dilemma, as it is usually treated with antibiotics that can treat the infection but also can damage the microbiome. Treatment of CDI using antibiotics can further reduce microbial diversity and deplete beneficial bacteria from the gut leading to a condition called dysbiosis. Antibiotic treatment can be followed by therapies that restore the gut microbiota, boost colonization resistance, and prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance. It is important to evaluate treatment options to determine their safety and effectiveness. Methods: The researchers provided an overview of the mechanisms that the gut microbiome uses to prevent colonization of the gut by pathogens. They subsequently reviewed the efficacy and shortcomings of the following treatments for CDI: -Antibiotics-Monoclonal antibodies-Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) Results: Commensal intestinal bacteria prevent colonization of the gut by pathogens using mechanisms such as: -Competition for key nutrients-Production of inhibitory bile acids-Short-chain fatty acid production-Lowering the luminal pH-Production of bacteriocinsAntibiotic therapy is recommended as a standard treatment for CDI. However, patients are vulnerable to recurrent CDI after discontinuation of the therapy. Monoclonal antibodies that inactivate C. difficile toxins may be recommended along with antibiotics to prevent recurrent CDI. However, this approach does not restore the microbiome.FMT is one method of microbial restoration, where stool is harvested from a healthy donor and transplanted into a patient's colon. Although FMT has shown some efficacy in the treatment of recurrent CDI, the procedure is not standardized. Safety concerns have been raised about the possibility of transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens via FMT. Conclusion: Treatment methods that can efficiently restore the diversity of the gut microbiome are crucial in preventing recurrence of CDI.

### Microbiome therapeutics for the treatment of recurrentinfection [^115gwYNE]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The gut microbiome is implicated in Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and recurrent CDI (rCDI).

Areas Covered

This review covers the mechanisms by which microbiome therapeutics treat rCDI, their efficacy and safety, and clinical trial design considerations for future research.

Expert Opinion

Altering the chemical environment of the gut and reconstituting colonization resistance is a promising strategy for preventing and treating rCDI. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is safe and effective for the treatment of rCDI. However, limitations of FMT have prompted investigation into alternative microbiome therapeutics. These alternative microbiome therapies require further evaluation, and adaptive trial designs should be strongly considered to more rapidly discern variables including the need for bowel preparation, timing and selection of pre-treatment antibiotics, and dose and duration of microbiome therapeutics. A broad range of adverse events must be prospectively evaluated in these controlled trials, as microbiome therapeutics have the potential for numerous effects. Future studies will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which microbiome therapies can break the cycle of rCDI, which should ultimately yield a personalized approach to rCDI treatment that restores an individual's specific deficit(s) in colonization resistance to C. difficile.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (Clostridium difficile) [^113BHu4j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile) is a bacterium that can cause potentially life-threatening diarrheal illness in individuals with an unhealthy mixture of gut bacteria, known as dysbiosis, and can cause recurrent infections in nearly a third of infected individuals. The traditional treatment of recurrent C difficile infection (rCDI) includes antibiotics, which may further exacerbate dysbiosis. There is growing interest in correcting the underlying dysbiosis in rCDI using of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT); and there is a need to establish the benefits and harms of FMT for the treatment of rCDI based on data from randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of donor-based fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in immunocompetent people.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 31 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials of adults or children with rCDI for inclusion. Eligible interventions must have met the definition of FMT, which is the administration of fecal material containing distal gut microbiota from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of a person with rCDI. The comparison group included participants who did not receive FMT and were given placebo, autologous FMT, no intervention, or antibiotics with activity against C difficile.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. proportion of participants with resolution of rCDI and 2. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 3. treatment failure, 4. all-cause mortality, 5. withdrawal from study, 6. rate of new CDI infection after a successful FMT, 7. any adverse event, 8. quality of life, and 9. colectomy. We used the GRADE criteria to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included six studies with 320 participants. Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single-center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I² = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation probably results in a slight reduction in serious adverse events; however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.41; P = 0.24, I² = 26%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 12; moderate-certainty evidence). Fecal microbiota transplantation may result in a reduction in all-cause mortality; however, the number of events was small, and the CIs of the summary estimate were wide (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.45; P = 0.48, I² = 0%; 6 studies, 320 participants; NNTB 20; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported colectomy rates.

Authors' Conclusions

In immunocompetent adults with rCDI, FMT likely leads to a large increase in the resolution of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection compared to alternative treatments such as antibiotics. There was no conclusive evidence regarding the safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI as the number of events was small for serious adverse events and all-cause mortality. Additional data from large national registry databases might be required to assess any short-term or long-term risks with using FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Elimination of the single study that included some immunocompromised people did not alter these conclusions. Due to the low number of immunocompromised participants enrolled, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risks or benefits of FMT for rCDI in the immunocompromised population.

### Factors associated with failure of fecal microbiota transplant for recurrentinfection [^111WsHGq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a common antibiotic-associated infection in the United States. With nearly 500,000 American patients diagnosed with CDI annually, implications extend beyond individual health, significantly impacting infection control and healthcare expenditures. – 5%–45% of patients with CDI experience recurrence, and in patients with recurrence, the risk of future recurrent CDIs (rCDI) increases to 60%. – The main mechanism of rCDI is thought to be through decreased microbiome diversity leading to increased susceptibility to relapse or reinfection with C. difficile. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which aims to restore the physiologic diversity of intestinal microbiota and resist colonization, has emerged as the most effective therapy for rCDI. With success rates of 80%–95%, FMT has revolutionized rCDI treatment; guidelines recommend offering FMT to patients with rCDI who have failed antibiotic treatment.– We have utilized FMT in our dedicated C. difficile clinic, which has outperformed antibiotic treatment, especially in patients who had three or more recurrent episodes.

Despite FMT's high efficacy, FMT remains ineffective in 5%–20% of cases. Prior studies have highlighted potential associations between antidepressant use, cholecystectomy, inpatient status, pseudomembranes, immunocompromised status, and FMT failure, but definitive risk factors for FMT failure remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of rCDI and identify factors that may contribute to FMT failure.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: facts and controversies [^116NAp3D]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current evidence on fecal microbiota transplantations (FMTs) for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs), metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

Recent Findings

Recently, a randomized trial confirmed the efficacy of this treatment strategy in patients with recurrent CDI. For other disorders, evidence is still limited. To date, studies have been performed to try and influence the course of metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.

Summary

There is increasing interest in the role of altered microbiota in the development of a myriad of diseases. Together with new insights comes an interest in influencing this altered microbiota as a potential target for therapy. FMTs are effective against recurrent CDI, a disorder caused by disruption of the normal microbiota. Restoration of intestinal flora and thereby restoration of colonization resistance is thought to be the mechanism responsible for cure. With the developments in FMT and the extension of this treatment modality to both intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, a new field of targeted therapy awaits. The ultimate goal is the development of powerful probiotic regimens that can replace FMT. Currently, FMT should only be given in a strict experimental setting for other conditions than CDI.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection [^117Gt23Q]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile, a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea due to perturbation of the normal gastrointestinal microbiome, is responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures. The incidence and severity of C difficile infection (CDI) is increasing, and recurrent disease is common. Recurrent infection can be difficult to manage with conventional antibiotic therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which involves instillation of stool from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of the patient, restores the gut microbiome to a healthy state. FMT has emerged as a promising new treatment for CDI. There are limited data on FMT for treatment of primary CDI, but FMT appears safe and effective for recurrent CDI. The safety and efficacy of FMT in patients with severe primary or severe recurrent CDI has not been established. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who undergo FMT for CDI may be at increased risk of IBD flare, and caution should be exercised with use of FMT in that population. The long-term safety of FMT is unknown; thus, rigorously conducted prospective studies are needed.

### Prevention and treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112EWRdz]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a significant burden on the health system, especially due to high recurrence rates. Since the beginning of the CDI epidemic in early 2000s, many strategies for combatting recurrence have been explored, with moderate success so far. This review will focus on the most recent developments in recurrent CDI prevention and treatment.

Recent Findings

There are two main mechanisms of CDI recurrence: alteration in microbiome and poor antibody response. Development of new antibiotics aims to minimize damage to the microbiome. Fecal transplant or other microbiome replacement therapies seek to replenish the missing elements in the microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplant is the most effective treatment for prevention of CDI recurrenceso far, but is difficult to standardize and regulate, leading to efforts to develop microbiome-derived therapeutics. A deficiency in developing antibodies to C. difficile toxins is another mechanism of recurrence. Active immunization using toxoid vaccines or passive immunization using mAbs address this aspect.

Summary

There are promising new treatments for recurrent CDI in development. Fecal microbiota transplant remains the most effective therapy for multiply recurrent CDI. New antibiotics, microbiome-derived therapeutics, and immunologic therapies are in development.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections [^111LxVTS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In recent years, Clostridium difficile infections have become more frequent, more severe, more refractory to standard treatment, and more likely to recur. Current antibiotic treatment regimens for Clostridium difficile infection alter the normal gut flora, which provide colonization resistance against Clostridium difficile. Over the past few years, there has been a marked increase in the knowledge of the gut microbiota and its role in health maintenance and disease causation. This has, fortuitously, coincided with the use of a unique microbial replacement therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, in the treatment of patients with multiple recurrent Clostridium difficile infections. We briefly review current knowledge of the gut microbiota's functions. We then review the indications for use of fecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridium difficile infection, the techniques employed, and results of treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be efficacious for patients with multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infections (reported cure rates of 90%), with an excellent short-term safety profile, and has been included in the American College of Gastroenterology treatment guidelines for this troublesome disease.

### Fecal microbiota transplant in patients with Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review [^1146G7tX]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores a diverse bacterial profile to the gastrointestinal tract and may effectively treat patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of FMT in the treatment of CDI.

Methods

Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane database were used. The authors searched studies with 10 or more patients examining the resolution of symptoms after FMT in patients with CDI. Reviews, letters to the editors, and abstracts were excluded. Participants were patients with CDI. Intervention used was FMT. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Results were synthesized using a narrative approach.

Results

Retrospective and uncontrolled prospective cohort studies suggest that FMT is a highly effective therapy for recurrent/refractory CDI, with clinical success rates ranging from 83% to 100%, which is similar to rates published by two randomized controlled trials. Fecal microbiota transplantation may be effectively administered via antegrade (upper gastrointestinal) or retrograde (lower gastrointestinal) routes of delivery. Fecal microbiota transplantation rarely results in major adverse events. However, diarrhea, cramping, and bloating commonly occur and are typically self-limited. Most studies were uncontrolled retrospective studies.

Conclusion

Fecal microbiota transplantation should be considered in patients with recurrent episodes of mild to moderate CDI who have failed conventional antimicrobial therapy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend FMT for the treatment of severe CDI.

Level Of Evidence

### The evolving landscape of fecal microbial transplantation [^11399Shg]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

The human gastrointestinal tract houses an enormous microbial ecosystem. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota plays significant physiological roles and maintains immune homeostasis in the human body. Dysbiosis, an imbalanced gut microbiome, can be associated with various disease states, as observed in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Modulation of the gut microbiome has become a therapeutic target in treating these disorders. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from a healthy donor restores the normal gut microbiota homeostasis in the diseased host. Ample evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). The application of FMT in other human diseases is gaining attention. This review aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of FMT and its efficacies in human diseases. We discuss the application, route of administration, limitations, safety, efficacies, and suggested mechanisms of FMT in rCDI, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Finally, we address the future perspectives of FMT in human medicine.

### Therapeutic manipulation of the microbiota: past, present, and considerations for the future [^111a2wsm]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The growing appreciation of the potential role of indigenous microbiota in disease has resulted in a concomitant interest in manipulating the microbiome for therapeutic effect. The most successful example of microbiota manipulation for treatment of a disease is in recurrent infection with the bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile.

Aims

This review provides historic perspectives on development of microbiota transplantation and reviews evidence for its use in recurrent C. difficile infection.

Sources

A PubMed search of the terms ([fecal transplant OR fecal transplantation] AND difficile) to 9 June 2016 yielded 415 articles.

Content

Recent work has pointed to potential mechanisms by which microbiota restoration in the form of faecal transplantation has been efficacious. This includes studies of microorganisms associated with successful faecal transplantation in human and animal studies and a focus on bacterial bile acid metabolism as a mechanism that mediates colonization resistance against the pathogen. The potential use of microbiota manipulation for other diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases and metabolic disorders will be discussed. The case will be made that the lessons learned from treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection may not necessarily translate to use of faecal transplantation or other methods to alter the microbiome for the treatment of other diseases.

Implications

A key conclusion that can be drawn is that understanding of the precise role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of a specific disease is necessary prior to determining if microbiota manipulation represents a novel treatment therapy.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^111F7o96]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has now been established into clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Its therapeutic application in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently at an early stage. To date, there have been four randomized controlled trials for FMT in IBD and a multitude of observational studies. However, significant gaps in our knowledge regarding optimum methods for FMT preparation, technical aspects and logistics of its administration, as well as mechanistic underpinnings, still remain. In this article, we aim to highlight these gaps by reviewing evidence and making key recommendations on the direction of future studies in this field. In addition, we provide an overview of the current evidence of potential mechanisms of FMT in treating IBD.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: current promise and future needs [^112E56Kb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The use of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased rapidly over the past few years. In this review, we highlight clinical studies of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI and discuss the safety, standardization and future of this treatment option. The major risk factor for CDI is prior antibiotic use, which results in an altered state of the gut microbiota characterized by decreased microbial diversity. This altered gut microbiota increases the patient's susceptibility to CDI. In patients with recurrent CDI, the microbiota remains in a state with decreased diversity, and FMT from a healthy individual restores the gut microbiota and subsequently colonization resistance against the pathogen.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have shown the success rate for FMT as treatment for recurrent CDI being greater than 90%. Standardized, frozen preparations of faeces can be used, which increases the availability of faeces for FMT and decreases the cost of screening individual donors. In addition, there have been recent advances in identifying a defined microbial community isolated from faeces that can restore colonization resistance against C. difficile.

Summary

The use of FMT is a successful treatment for recurrent CDI when primary treatment options have failed. However, more work needs to define potential long-term consequences of this treatment and understand how specific members of the gut microbiota can restore colonization resistance against C. difficile.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^111tksBd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently a recommended therapy for recurrent/refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – It is also being explored in the research setting for many other indications. However, there are a number of associated concerns regarding its use, including the unpleasant prospect of the procedure, the potential need for invasive administration, the small, but recognised risk of transmission of infection, and the complex regulation associated with its use. The COVID-19 pandemic and potential risk of viral transmission through donor stool samples has brought its limitations to the fore. As such, from a therapeutic perspective, understanding the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT may enable us to refine FMT from its current relatively crude state to a more refined 'microbiome therapeutic', which is no longer FMT, but could have a greater overall safety profile. This review will explore the current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of FMT across a variety of diseases.

Current indications for FMT

There has been a wealth of evidence demonstrating that FMT for CDI is effective for recurrent and refractory CDI, and the treatment has therefore been adopted in national and international guidelines. – A meta-analysis of all these studies highlights clinical resolution in 92% (95% CI 89–94%) of cases. The success of FMT for CDI has led to interest in its therapeutic potential in many other disorders, but a report on these is beyond the scope of this review.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^116jBRGS]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION

Primary insights into the efficacy of gut microbiota restoration came from faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, where the delivery of minimally manipulated faeces from a healthy donor to a recipient with recurrent CDI can restore colonization resistance leading to clinical cure rates of 76.1%. The mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of FMT are largely unknown but likely to be multifactorial, combining the restoration of microbial diversity and the metabolic landscape. Bile acids have been shown to affect C. difficile germination and vegetative cell growth; therefore, restoration of bile acid metabolism through the reconstitution of bile salt hydrolases has been implicated in FMT efficacy. FMT has been recommended to treat multiply recurrent CDI (second or subsequent recurrence) after treatment with either fidaxomicin or vancomycin. More recent studies have demonstrated a potential role for FMT in treating a first or second CDI episode, severe and severe-complicated CDI. Despite the efficacy of FMT against recurrent CDI, safety concerns have been raised over the potential transmission of pathogens after the transfer of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli resulted in recipient fatalities. With the gut microbiota being linked to other extra-intestinal diseases, the application of an undefined microbiota could have unknown long-term health implications, highlighting the need for standardized procedures for screening and processing and a move towards a more defined and characterized intervention. In 2022–2023, the US Food and Drug Administration authorized two first-in-class live biotherapeutics for the treatment of recurrent CDI.

### An ecological framework to understand the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation [^114iJuPb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) aims to restore a healthy gut microbiota.

a In an initial healthy gut, the microbial community typically contains many different taxa and displays very high taxonomic and functional diversity. Most of those taxa are benign. Some of them can even keep out opportunistic pathogens such as C. difficile. b Antibiotic administration leads to low taxonomic diversity and to a disrupted gut microbiota, which allows colonization by C. difficile. c C. difficile spores are typically ingested following contact with contaminated biotic or abiotic surfaces, then germinate in the gut to a vegetative cell-type and produce potent gut-damaging toxins during a late growth stage. This leads the development of C. difficile infection (CDI). Ironically, standard treatment of CDI generally involves prescription of antibiotics such as metronidazole or vancomycin. Those antibiotics kill C. difficile but spores can remain in the gut, rendering recurrent CDI (rCDI). d Transplanting the fecal material from a healthy donor to the patient's gut can restore the healthy gut microbiota.

We have only recently started to understand the molecular mechanisms of FMT in treating rCDI –. We still do not quite understand why ~20% of rCDI patients relapse after FMT. Very little is known about the long-term effects of FMT from the ecological perspective. There are many puzzles in this field that need systems-level understanding and ecological explanations. For example, what are the key ecological factors that determine the success of FMT in treating rCDI? Does FMT work equally well in treating primary and recurrent CDI? Does donor−recipient compatibility matter at all for FMT success? If yes, how can we choose the best donor for a given recipient? How can we design probiotic cocktails containing only the effective components of FMT? Will there be a generic probiotic cocktail (i.e. a magic bullet) that works for every patient? If not, how can we design personalized probiotic cocktails? Systematically addressing these issues requires ecological thinking. Given that the human gut microbiota operates as a complex ecosystem, community ecology provides powerful tools to understand the driving factors shaping microbial diversity, interspecies interactions, and community structure –.

### Resolution rates in clinical trials for microbiota restoration for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113jonvA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common healthcare-associated infection in the United States with over 50% of patients developing recurrences after two or more episodes. Microbiota replacement therapy (MRT) is used to treat recurrent CDI by restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend MRT after appropriate antibiotic treatment after two or more CDI recurrences in patients who have failed appropriate antibiotic treatments.

The efficacy of MRT for recurrent CDI in observational studies is more than 85% but efficacy in controlled clinical trials appears to be lower. Our 2017 meta-analysis showed an overall cure rate of 76% in clinical trial settings with efficacy being lower (67%) in trials with a comparator group compared to open-label trials. Most trials included in that meta-analysis had different methodologies including recurrent CDI diagnostic and inclusion criteria, MRT preparations, and comparator group leading to a significant heterogeneity. These inconsistencies have resulted in limiting the generalizability of these results and pose a caution in positioning MRT as a therapy for CDI.

Since the earlier systematic review and meta-analysis, more evidence from trials regarding use of MRT has emerged. These have included phase III trials of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and standardized live biotherapeutics for recurrent CDI. We performed an updated meta-analysis with the latest evidence to reassess the efficacy of microbiota restoration in clinical trials.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^1146JxGY]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The microbiota, consisting of the community of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoa organisms that inhabit a mammalian host, can impact susceptibility to a range of diseases including cancer, diabetes, allergy, obesity, and infection –. An altered or dysbiotic intestinal microbiota is observed in all of these disease states suggesting that resetting the intestinal microbiota with a composition of bacteria from healthy individuals could treat disease. This theory is supported by animal studies demonstrating alleviation of disease through transplantation of bacteria into the diseased host's intestinal tract –. Significant advancements have been made in defining the community of microbial species that are important in supporting human health –. Translating these findings into viable microbiota-based therapies has had limited success in the clinic, however, and is not yet considered a treatment option for most diseases impacted by microbial dysbiosis. One notable exception is the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to treat recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. FMT treatment of C. difficile infection is the first microbiota-based therapy clinically proven to ameliorate disease. Before such treatment strategies can be broadly implemented, the underlying principles determining success for microbiota-based therapy need to be elucidated.

C. difficile, a gram positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobe is currently the most common nosocomial infection encountered by hospitalized patients, with nearly a half million patients infected and an estimated 13,000–30,000 deaths annually in the United States alone –. This opportunistic pathogen infects the large intestine following perturbation of the intestinal microbiota. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin are first line treatment options that effectively target the vegetative form of C. difficile, but fail to resolve the underlying condition that promotes infection, a dysbiotic microbiota. Recurrence of C. difficile infection due to repeated failed antibiotic treatments is estimated as high as 25–35% and can cause potentially lethal fulminant colitis. The high recurrence rate following standard antibiotic treatment has spurred the development of new treatment modalities such as FMT. In 2013, the first controlled, double-blinded study reported the superior efficacy of FMT compared to antibiotics in treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection. Subsequent studies demonstrate FMT has an 80–90% cure rate in individuals and this treatment option is now incorporated as standard care for recurrent disease in both Europe and the United States –.

### Fecal microbial transplantation for diseases beyond recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^116hpVoQ]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

As microbiome research has moved from associative to mechanistic studies, the activities of specific microbes and their products have been investigated in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Findings from microbiome research have already been applied to the clinic, such as in fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. We review the evidence for associations between alterations in the intestinal microbiome and gastrointestinal diseases and findings from clinical trials of fecal microbiota transplantation. We discuss opportunities for treatment of other diseases with fecal microbiota transplantation, based on findings from small clinical and preclinical studies.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^111a5UBv]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a successful therapeutic strategy for treating recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Despite remarkable efficacy, implementation of FMT therapy is limited and the mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for the immune system in supporting FMT using a murine C. difficile infection system. Following FMT, Rag1 heterozygote mice resolve C. difficile while littermate Rag1 −/− mice fail to clear the infection. Targeted ablation of adaptive immune cell subsets reveal a necessary role for CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells, but not B cells or CD8 + T cells, in FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile infection. FMT non-responsive mice exhibit exacerbated inflammation, impaired engraftment of the FMT bacterial community and failed restoration of commensal bacteria-derived secondary bile acid metabolites in the large intestine. These data demonstrate that the host's inflammatory immune status can limit the efficacy of microbiota-based therapeutics to treat C. difficile infection.

### Current and future microbiome-based therapies in inflammatory bowel disease [^113JsV8k]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of the microbiome and dysbiosis is increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal microbiota transplant (IMT), previously termed fecal microbiota transplant has demonstrated efficacy in restoring a healthy microbiome and promoting gut health in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Several randomized trials (RCTs) highlighted IMT's potential in treating ulcerative colitis, while smaller studies reported on its application in managing Crohn's disease and pouchitis.

Recent Findings

This review delves into the current understanding of dysbiosis in IBD, highlighting the distinctions in the microbiota of patients with IBD compared to healthy controls. It explores the mechanisms by which IMT can restore a healthy microbiome and provides a focused analysis of recent RCTs using IMT for inducing and maintaining remission in IBD. Lastly, we discuss the current knowledge gaps that limit its widespread use.

Summary

The body of evidence supporting the use of IMT in IBD is growing. The lack of a standardized protocol impedes its application beyond clinical trials. Further research is needed to identify patient profile and disease phenotypes that benefit from IMT, to delineate key donor characteristics, optimize the delivery route, dosage, and frequency.

### Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on recurrence in multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a randomized trial [^114vxJXQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

To date, evidence for the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been limited to case series and open-label clinical trials.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI.

Design

Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494).

Setting

Two academic medical centers.

Patients

46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of CDI and received a full course of vancomycin for their most recent acute episode.

Intervention

Fecal microbiota transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient's own stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy.

Measurements

The primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for further anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data were compared between treatment groups via review of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for 6 months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on patients' stool before and after FMT and also on donors' stool.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients (90.9%) in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared with 15 of 24 (62.5%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042). Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6 of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients who developed recurrent CDI after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored gut bacterial community diversity and composition to resemble that of healthy donors.

Limitation

The study included only patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those who were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older.

Conclusion

Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more efficacious than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI episodes.

### Gut microbiome andinfection: a closer look at the microscopic interface [^114WDAE7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) was recognized with its link to the use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobials significantly alter gut microbiota structure and composition, which led to the discovery of the association of this gut perturbation with the development of CDI. A number of factors implicated in its pathogenesis, such as advancing age, proton-pump inhibitors, and gastrointestinal diseases, are linked to gut microbiota perturbations. In an effort to better understand CDI, a multitude of studies have tried to ascertain protective and predictive microbial footprints linked with CDI. It has further been realized that CDI in itself can alter the gut microbiome. Its spore-forming capability poses as an impediment in the management of the infection and contributes to its recurrence. Antibiotic therapies used for its management have also been linked to gut microbiota changes, making its treatment a little more challenging. In an effort to exploit and utilize this association, gut microbial restoration therapies, particularly in the form of fecal microbial transplant, are increasingly being put to use and are proving to be beneficial. In this review, we summarize the association of the gut microbiome and microbial perturbation with initial and recurrent CDI.

### Body mass index changes after fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection [^115vW9bg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human microbiome plays a crucial role in gut health, immune function, and metabolic regulation. Disruptions in microbiota balance can contribute to various diseases, including obesity and gastrointestinal infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI often results in severe abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, significant weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia due to impaired nutrient absorption and inflammation. Recurrence of infection is common and remains a major challenge in reducing overall incidence. – Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an effective treatment for recurrent CDI, demonstrating high success rates in restoring gut microbial diversity and preventing infection recurrence. However, the impact of FMT extends beyond infection control and may influence the recipient's metabolic profile.

Patients recovering from CDI frequently undergo significant weight fluctuations. During the acute phase of CDI, patients typically suffer from diarrhea and colitis, leading to substantial weight loss due to dehydration, malabsorption, and reduced oral intake secondary to gastrointestinal symptoms. In the recovery phase, weight gain is generally observed as patients' gastrointestinal function begins to normalize. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are significant considerations in donor selection for FMT, with the best practice of excluding donors with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m² or those with metabolic syndrome. This recommendation stems from concerns raised by case reports of weight gain in recipients after receiving FMT from overweight donors and animal studies.

More extensive research is needed to substantiate donor selection guidelines and understand the mechanisms underlying microbiota-driven weight changes. To better understand the impact of donor BMI on weight changes post-FMT for recurrent CDI, our study examined the relationship between the donor BMI and the change in the recipient's BMI after FMT. Our primary objective was to determine whether stool donor BMI affects recipient BMI changes following FMT for recurrent CDI. The secondary objective was to evaluate changes in BMI in patients undergoing FMT for recurrent CDI over a 1-year follow-up period. We hypothesized that donor BMI would have no significant effect on recipient BMI changes (H0), with an alternative hypothesis (H1) suggesting that higher donor BMI may contribute to increased recipient BMI. Understanding these dynamics could inform donor selection guidelines and clarify the role of microbiota in weight changes.

### Gaps in knowledge and future directions for the use of faecal microbiota transplant in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^112jegQK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The potential role of faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has been explored in the treatment of a multitude of diseases, both gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI, structural and functional in nature. A significant proportion of the initial evidence for its efficacy was derived from observational studies, primarily in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). – Despite the small size and heterogeneity of early studies, the consistently positive findings led to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which confirmed the therapeutic role of FMT for this indication. It is recognized that distinctive alterations of both the composition and function of the gut microbiota characterize other GI diseases as well as other non-GI conditions. In particular, some of the initial evidence for its utility in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) came from subgroup analysis of RCTs of CDI and a handful of observational studies. – Although we may be able to translate our knowledge around principles and methodology from FMT studies in CDI, there are specific uncertainties and challenges for the therapeutic use of FMT for IBD that need to be addressed. In this review, we aim to summarize the current gaps in our knowledge regarding FMT in IBD from a clinical and mechanistic perspective, and to highlight potential areas to target and optimize in future studies.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: a review on current formulations ininfection and future outlooks [^114vdorm]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The role of the gut microbiota in health and the pathogenesis of several diseases has been highlighted in recent years. Even though the precise mechanisms involving the microbiome in these ailments are still unclear, microbiota-modulating therapies have been developed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown significant results against Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and its potential has been investigated for other diseases. Unfortunately, the technical aspects of the treatment make it difficult to implement. Pharmaceutical technology approaches to encapsulate microorganisms could play an important role in providing this treatment and render the treatment modalities easier to handle.

Areas Covered

After an overview of CDI, this narrative review aims to discuss the current formulations for FMT and specifically addresses the technical aspects of the treatment. This review also distinguishes itself by focusing on the hurdles and emphasizing the possible improvements using pharmaceutical technologies.

Expert Opinion

FMT is an efficient treatment for recurrent CDI. However, its standardization is overlooked. The approach of industrial and hospital preparations of FMT are different, but both show promise in their respective methodologies. Novel FMT formulations could enable further research on dysbiotic diseases in the future.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^116Q3o5G]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Constituents in FMT that are associated with response

Microbial alterations

In CDI, the suppression of the native gut microbiome, often by antibiotic treatment, enables C. difficile spores to germinate into vegetative cells, which produce enterotoxins that cause inflammation and result in debilitating diarrhoeal symptoms.

The key rationale for using FMT as treatment for CDI is that this therapy restores the gut microbial communities. Indeed, the 'healthy commensals' reintroduced through FMT will compete for the ecological niches and prevent colonisation by pathogens, a well-described phenomenon known as 'colonisation resistance'. The role of the gut microbiota as a factor in the pathogenesis of many conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic syndrome and subgroups of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)is accepted. However, the relative importance of the gut microbiota in the overall pathogenesis is different from one disease to another and we cannot yet quantify it for many diseases. For example, it has been noted that in CDI, changes in the composition of the gut microbiota represents the predominant factor in CDI pathogenesisand, in IBD, it plays a very important role. For many other conditions, its role might be more limited compared with other factors.

Furthermore, other than for CDI, mechanistic studies are largely lacking, and it remains overall unclear whether these microbiota changes play a role significant enough to be efficiently targeted by FMT or other microbiome-based intervention.

More recent data have shown that the efficacy of FMT in the treatment of recurrent CDI (rCDI) may not be explained by purely restoration of gut bacteria per se, but also by a number of additional factors. For instance, in one pilot study, researchers prepared a sterile faecal filtrate by passing FMT slurry through progressively narrower pore filters, culminating in a 0.2 µm pore filter. The administration of the sterile faecal filtrate via a nasojejunal tube was effective in treating five patients with rCDI (> 6 months), comparable with that degree of efficacy seen after administration of conventional FMT. The authors concluded that, rather than FMT directly requiring live, intact bacteria for its efficacy, it was instead likely that one or more soluble factors associated with bacteria within the filtrate potentially mediated its mechanism of action. Within the following sections, the potential contributions of such factors are discussed.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrentinfection: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ZGbQr]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and 22–32% experience prolonged or recurrent infections unresponsive to standard antibiotics. Recurrent CDI is associated with a high mortality, and preventing the infection poses a substantial therapeutic challenge with limited treatment options. During the last decade, FMT has emerged as a viable treatment for recurrent CDI. With effect rates of up to 94% in clinical trials, FMT is now recommended by scientific societies and National Health agencies for patients with 2 or more recurrences of CDI.

Previous systematic reviews have confirmed the high clinical effect of FMT for recurrent CDI and indicated that the treatment effect may depend on the method of delivery and treatment regimens. Still, no clear clinical evidence exists for the cumulative effect of FMT following single or repeated treatment regimens, and the quality of evidence for FMT compared with standard antibiotics has been rated as moderate in previous systematic reviews and guidelines due to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have resulted in caution and questioned the position of FMT in the CDI treatment algorithm until the evidence for FMT has been evaluated in more detail. Now, further to these earlier systematic reviews, more evidence has accumulated, and new methods of delivery have emerged; as such, an update of the evidence with the latest data is pivotal to guide clinical decisions and improve the future recommendations for FMT in managing patients with recurrent CDI.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to establish the evidence for using FMT in recurrent CDI, to provide updated effect estimates specific to different delivery methods and treatment regimens, and to compare the effect of FMT with that of standard antibiotics.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LwFve]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A wealth of randomized clinical trials supports the effectiveness of FMT for recurrent CDI. This progress is vital, given the heavy disease burden CDI carries and the major risks associated with uncontrolled CDI. Antimicrobial success rate in recurrent CDI is low, only about 35%, and surgery has very poor outcomes, with mortality up to 50%. FMT involves the infusion of stool from a healthy donor to an infected patient with the goal of restoring a healthy microbiome, and exists as an exciting alternate approach for treatment that utilizes a novel and exciting mechanism. However, there is still hesitancy regarding the implementation of FMT in the standard of care. Our analysis seeks to further explore the safety of FMT, to ensure patients and physicians have an optimal data-driven approach to considering FMT.

To our knowledge, this is the largest published systematic review with a meta-analysis of adverse events for FMT in CDI, and it offers several advantages compared to the previously published literature. This meta-analysis establishes that FMT is safe when used for CDI, with significant adverse events noted in less than 1% of the patients. This knowledge is invaluable in aiding decision making for patients and physicians and supports FMT as an excellent alternative option to standard therapy with antibiotics — especially for recurrent CDI. The majority of the significant adverse events noted in our review were unrelated to the FMT itself, which is unsurprising given that FMT is often administered in patients with severe, treatment-refractory CDI with multiple baseline medical comorbidities. Additionally, a relatively high percentage of the included patients were immunosuppressed, which could account for exaggeration of negative sequelae. Finally, minor adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and constipation, were also noted very rarely, with an individual pooled rate of less than 2%, lower than previously reported.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^114gXJCH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centres for Disease Control and prevention as one of the top 5 urgent threats in the United States. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in recurrent infections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

Recent findings

Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic Fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of faecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alterative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

Summary

With current first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of recurrent CDI, the availability of new generation targeted therapeutics can really impact treatment success. There are still unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease to reduce patient suffering.

### The molecular basis of Clostridium difficile disease and host response [^115U3sV1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) ranges from asymptomatic colonization to severe colitis and death. The physiologic and molecular mechanisms determining disease outcome are thus far poorly understood. Here, we review recent advances in the relationship between host response to infection and disease outcome. Furthermore, we review recent studies on the relationship between intestinal microbial ecology and pathogenesis of CDI.

Recent Findings

Severe CDI is characterized by toxin-induced epithelial injury and marked intestinal inflammation. Recent studies demonstrate that systemic markers of inflammation correlate with disease outcome. Peripheral neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, and proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in patients with severe disease as compared with asymptomatic controls. Furthermore, fecal inflammatory biomarkers are better predictors of disease severity and diarrhea persistence than C. difficile abundance. A landmark study reported higher than 80% success rate of fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent CDI. The commensal microbes responsible for C. difficile protection, and the molecular basis by which microbial ecology impacts disease outcome, are under active investigation.

Summary

Under conditions of altered microbial ecology, C. difficile incites epithelial injury and marked intestinal inflammation, the primary determinant of disease outcome. Restoration of a diverse intestinal microbial population by fecal microbiota transplantation attenuates disease and prevents recurrence by mechanisms that are yet to be fully elucidated.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for gastrointestinal disorders [^1135eviN]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The importance of the gut microbiome in human health is being increasingly recognized. The purpose of this review is to examine the existing literature pertaining to alterations in the gut microbiome and the utility of microbiome restoration therapies in gastrointestinal disorders.

Recent Findings

Imbalance and maladaptation of the microbiome, termed dysbiosis, has been associated with several disease states such as irritable bowel syndrome, Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity among others. The possibility of restoration of normal microbiota has become an attractive concept for diseases in which the normal microbiome is perturbed. The rationale of using fecal microbiota transplantation to treat disease has been validated by its successful use in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, which occurs as a result of decreased microbial diversity in the gut, most often in the setting of recent antibiotic treatment. Similar strategies may be applicable to other disorders.

Summary

Alterations in the gut microbiome are associated with several disorders, and microbiome restoration based therapies such as fecal microbiota transplantation may be an adjunct to conventional treatments but more investigation is needed.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^117VWGiV]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality, Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) are listed by the Centres for Disease Control and prevention as one of the top 5 urgent threats in the United States. CDI occurs from gut microbiome dysbiosis, typically through antibiotic-mediated disruption; however, antibiotics are the treatment of choice, which can result in recurrent infections. Here, we highlight new treatments available and provide a perspective on different classes of future treatments.

Recent Findings

Due to the reduced risk of disease recurrence, the microbiome-sparing antibiotic Fidaxomicin has been recommended as the first-line treatment for C. difficile infection. Based on the success of faecal microbiota transplantations (FMT) in treating CDI recurrence, defined microbiome biotherapeutics offer a safer and more tightly controlled alterative as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy. Given the association between antibiotic-mediated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and the recurrence of CDI, future prospective therapies aim to reduce the dependence on antibiotics for the treatment of CDI.

Summary

With current first-in-line antibiotic therapy options associated with high levels of recurrent CDI, the availability of new generation targeted therapeutics can really impact treatment success. There are still unknowns about the long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics, but efforts to expand the CDI treatment toolbox can offer multiple solutions for clinicians to treat this multifaceted infectious disease to reduce patient suffering.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^115A2ZWo]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Intestinal dysbiosis in C. difficile -infected patients is characterized by a loss of bacterial diversity and altered production of microbiota-derived intestinal metabolites. Successful FMT restores homeostasis both in the intestinal microbial community and metabolome. For example, following FMT, commensal bacteria that convert host-derived primary (1°) bile acids into secondary (2°) bile acids repopulate the large intestine and 2° bile acid pools are restored to levels observed in healthy individuals. The presence of 2° bile acid converting bacteria promotes colonization resistance against C. difficile and restoration of the 2° bile acid pools is associated with successful FMT in recurrent C. difficile -infected patients –. These reports provide evidence that efficacy of the FMT is dependent on the bacterial consortium successfully engrafting in the intestine of the infected host to restore the intestinal microenvironment to pre-infection conditions and create an inhospitable environment for C. difficile. The role of host immune factors in supporting FMT engraftment and subsequent clearance of C. difficile has not been explored and is the focus of this report.

In this study, we demonstrate that multiple strains of immunodeficient mice, all of which lack CD4 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory (T reg) cells, exhibit increased intestinal inflammation compared to immunocompetent mice when persistently infected with C. difficile and fail to resolve infection following FMT. The transplanted bacteria from the FMT inoculum do not completely engraft in the large intestine of FMT non-responsive mice and the intestinal metabolite profile is not restored to pre-infection levels. These data reveal an important role for the host immune system in supporting bacterial engraftment and subsequent resolution of C. difficile infection.

### Insights into the role of fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease [^1121soHS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

FMT is the inoculation of minimally manipulated microbiota from healthy donors to affected patients, with the goal of correcting dysbiosis and restoring gut flora homeostasis. This therapeutic approach has been shown to be incredibly successful in treating recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI), another disease in which dysbiosis is thought to play a dominant pathogenic role. In the general population, multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown the efficacy of FMT for recurrent CDI to approach 90%. The efficacy and safety of FMT in IBD is less established, but emerging data support a potential increased role in these diseases.

Here, we review the current evidence on the use of FMT in IBD, focusing on efficacy and safety of this novel therapy, and continuing areas of study in this evolving field.

### Post-infectious ibs following Clostridioides difficile infection; role of microbiota and implications for treatment [^115nwXdP]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Up to 25% of patients recovering from antibiotic-treated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) develop functional symptoms reminiscent of Post-Infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome (PI-IBS). For patients with persistent symptoms following infection, a clinical dilemma arises as to whether to provide additional antibiotic treatment or to adopt a conservative symptom-based approach. Here, we review the literature on CDI-related PI-IBS and compare the findings with PI-IBS. We review proposed mechanisms, including the role of C. difficile toxins and the microbiota, and discuss implications for therapy. We suggest that gut dysfunction post-CDI may be initiated by toxin-induced damage to enteroglial cells and that a dysbiotic gut microbitota maintains the clinical phenotype over time, prompting consideration of microbiota-directed therapies. While Fecal Microbial Transplant (FMT) is currently reserved for recurrent CDI (rCDI), we propose that microbiota-directed therapies may have a role in primary CDI in order to avoid or mitigate futher antibiotic treatment that further disrupts the microbiota and thus prevent PI-IBS. We discuss novel microbial transfer therapies and as they emerge, we recommend clinical trials to determine whether microbial transfer therapy of the primary infection prevents both rCDI and CDI-related PI- IBS.

### Faecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridioides difficile infection: real-life experience from an academic Italian hospital [^116MYR4m]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a reasonable therapeutic option for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) recurrent and refractory (RCDI) to therapy, but little evidence on the long-term impact of this therapy is currently available in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMT in recurrent and refractory CDI and the modifications of the recipient's gut microbiota in the medium-long term.

Methods

This prospective study collects the clinical and laboratory data of RCDI patients treated with FMT by colonoscopy from February 2016 to October 2019. Stool samples for metagenomic analysis were collected pre-FMT at 1week and at 6 and 12–24months post-FMT.

Results

In the study period, 20 FMT procedures were performed on 19 patients. Overall, FMT was effective in 85% of treated patients. No serious adverse event was recorded. In the medium- to long-term follow up, a newly diagnosed case of collagenous colitis was observed. Post-FMT, significant changes in microbiota were observed, characterised by the transition from a low- to a greater-diversity profile. Therefore, FMT restores eubiosis and maintains it over time.

Conclusion

FMT is a safe and effective treatment option in RCDI patients. This procedure induces profound microbiota changes that explain its high clinical efficacy.

### An ecological framework to understand the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation [^113wEaKU]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Human gut microbiota plays critical roles in physiology and disease. Our understanding of ecological principles that govern the dynamics and resilience of this highly complex ecosystem remains rudimentary. This knowledge gap becomes more problematic as new approaches to modifying this ecosystem, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are being developed as therapeutic interventions. Here we present an ecological framework to understand the efficacy of FMT in treating conditions associated with a disrupted gut microbiota, using the recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection as a prototype disease. This framework predicts several key factors that determine the efficacy of FMT. Moreover, it offers an efficient algorithm for the rational design of personalized probiotic cocktails to decolonize pathogens. We analyze data from both preclinical mouse experiments and a clinical trial of FMT to validate our theoretical framework. The presented results significantly improve our understanding of the ecological principles of FMT and have a positive translational impact on the rational design of general microbiota-based therapeutics.

### The impact of diet on Clostridioides difficile infection: a review [^113VqAoZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is responsible for more than 200 000 hospitalizations and $1 billion in healthcare costs yearly and contributed to 12 800 deaths in the United States in 2017. CDI also tends to recur, with 15%–30% of patients experiencing a recurrence after an initial infection despite treatment with standard-of-care antibiotics. The recurrence rate continues to increase after the first recurrence, with each episode contributing to increased healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. Overall, the recurrence rate may be as high as 60% in patients who have had > 2 episodes of CDI.

CDI occurs in the setting of an altered intestinal microbiota, most often from broad-spectrum antibiotic use, which favors germination of C difficile spores into vegetative cells. Although antibiotics are a major risk factor for CDI, the standard treatment involves additional antibiotics, which further alter the already disrupted microbiota and are likely one of the predisposing factors for disease recurrence. Accordingly, efforts have been directed toward prevention and treatment strategies that restore the gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is used in patients with multiple recurrences or failure to respond to standard therapy. FMT aims to reconstitute microbial diversity, with multiple studies confirming its efficacy. Indeed, FMT is now included in many treatment guidelines as studies show it effectively treats recurrent CDI in immunocompetent patients. Nonetheless, there is hesitancy regarding the safety of FMT administration as cases of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms have been reported, as well as mortality.

As of 2025, 2 US Food and Drug Administration–approved microbial therapeutics have been developed to restore the intestinal microbiome in patients with recurrent CDI. RBX2660 (REBYOTA) is a human-derived microbiome suspension administered via enema, and SER-109 (VOWST) is an orally administered purified bacterial spore product rich in Firmicutes from healthy donors. Although the published evidence shows promising results in preventing disease recurrence, accessibility remains limited due to high costs and limited routes of administration. In addition, although these treatments improve recurrence compared to placebo, recurrent CDI is still common — for example, REYBOTA has a recurrence rate of 29.4% versus 42.5% with placebo and VOWST has a 12% recurrence rate versus 40% with placebo. These therapies have also been unable to replace antibiotics, as they were designed as adjuvant therapies.

### A randomized controlled trial of efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant for preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^113Rsie1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of healthcare-associated infections in US hospitals, with 15%-30% of patients experiencing recurrence. The aim of our randomized, double-blind clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of capsule-delivered fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) versus placebo in reducing recurrent diarrhea and CDI recurrence. The secondary aim was FMT safety assessment.

Methods

Between 2018 and 2022, Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration system with recurrent CDI who responded to antibiotic treatment were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oral FMT or placebo capsules. Randomization was stratified by number of prior CDI recurrences (1 or ≥ 2). The primary endpoint was clinical recurrence by day 56, defined as > 3 unformed stools daily for ≥ 2 days with or without laboratory confirmation of C. difficile, or death within 56 days.

Results

The study was stopped due to futility after meeting prespecified criteria. Of 153 participants (76 FMT, 77 placebo) with an average age of 66.5 years, 25 participants (32.9%) in the FMT arm and 23 (29.9%) in the placebo arm experienced the primary endpoint of diarrhea and possible or definite CDI recurrence or death within 56 days of capsule administration (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% confidence interval, -11.7% to 17.7%]). Stratification by number of recurrences revealed no statistically significant differences. There were no clinically important differences in adverse events.

Conclusions

FMT therapy versus placebo did not reduce CDI recurrence or death at 56 days. There were no meaningful differences in adverse events between treatment groups.

### Fecal microbial therapy: promises and pitfalls [^112Y4sYA]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

A rapidly expanding range of diverse human diseases is now associated with perturbations to the gastrointestinal microbiome. Fecal microbial transplant (FMT) has been used with high rates of efficacy to treat gastrointestinal microbiome perturbation associated with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, and is now being considered for other indications.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent, safety, and pitfalls [^115FxaX3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is recognized as an urgent public health threat by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contributing to 223,900 hospitalizations, 12,800 associated deaths in the United States, and approximately US$1 billion in attributable health care cost in 2017. A population-based surveillance study conducted by CDC emerging infection program in 10 sites within United States from 2011 to 2017 reported a 24% decrease in hospital onset C. difficile but found no decrease in community onset or first recurrence of C. difficile.

Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is defined as CDI that relapses after initial successful treatment; rCDI is associated with an annual cost of approximately US$2.8billion. Nearly, one in six patients with CDI will experience recurrent infection in the following 2 to 8 weeks. Patients with rCDI often experience additional recurrences, with reports estimating that 50–65% of patients have at least two or more incidence of rCDI. Increased incidence of rCDI was noted from 2001 to 2012; 1.07 to 3.09 cases per 100,000 person-years. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) poses a significant treatment challenge, given it is difficult to eradicate and often require escalation in treatment.

### Long-term effects on luminal and mucosal microbiota and commonly acquired taxa in faecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^1171DC1T]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) has increased, with up to 50% of patients developing recurrent infections. The bacterium is the main etiological agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, causing a major burden to the healthcare system. Diverse intestinal microbiota provides colonisation resistance against pathogens and perturbations to the normal microbiota introduced by an antibiotic treatment is a key step in CDI pathogenesis. Traditionally, CDI is treated with metronidazole or vancomycin and, more recently, with fidaxomicin and rifaximin. These antimicrobials devastate the intestinal microbiota even further. If C. difficile spores persist after antibiotic treatment they can germinate and proliferate in the absence of suppressing microbiota and, as a consequence, the patient may enter a vicious cycle of recurrent CDI (rCDI) infections. Further, the emerging antibiotic-resistant variants of C. difficile call for alternative treatment options.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is highly effective in treating rCDI. FMT from a healthy, pre-screened donor is placed into the patient's duodenum, cecum or rectum where it restores the diversity and composition of the disrupted microbiota and subsequently suppresses C. difficile. Emerging evidence suggests that FMT also restores secondary bile acid metabolism, which is impaired in rCDI and possibly has a role in disease development. Several studies have followed the short-term stability of the transplanted microbiota and constituted that, overall, FMT-induced changes tend to persist over time. Further, FMT's long-term clinical efficacy and safety have been demonstrated. However, the long-term effects of FMT on microbiota have not been previously addressed, with prior work focusing on the effects on faecal microbiota rather than on the distinct ecosystem of mucosa.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^112TrFGU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

CDI is mediated through antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis that is exacerbated by current recommended first-in-line antibiotic therapy options, leading to high rates of CDI recurrence. The success of FMT therapy for multiply recurrent CDI has paved the way for next generation live biotherapeutics. Therapies targeted at microbiome restoration as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy can significantly improve treatment success and reduce the risk of disease recurrence. However, evidence suggests survival of C. difficile spores within mucosal biofilm populations, which could have implications for extended treatment success, emphasizing the need for biofilm targeted therapies. The long-term implications of these new CDI therapeutics are still mostly unknown, but efforts to expand the options for CDI treatment can offer multiple alternative solutions to treat this multifaceted infectious disease.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection [^114jn6xa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of recurrent/refractory Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), alternative treatments to the standard antibiotic therapies are being sought. One of the more controversial of such alternative treatments is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Although the notion of FMT is foreign-even startling-and not esthetic to most people, the concept has been around for many decades. Its benefit and efficacy dates back > 50 years to its use for staphylococcal pseudomembranous colitis, and now FMT is showing a great promise as an inexpensive, safe, and highly efficient treatment for recurrent and refractory CDI. Moreover, with a better understanding of the intricacies of the colonic microbiome and its role in colonic pathophysiology, FMT has the potential to become the standard of care for CDI treatment, and a potential answer to other intestinal disorders in years to come.

### Advancements in novel live biotherapeutic products for Clostridioides difficile infection prevention [^113CdVTK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The profound impact of the human microbiome on health and disease has captivated the interest of clinical and scientific communities. The human body hosts a vast array of microorganisms collectively forming the human microbiome, which significantly influences various physiological processes and profoundly shapes overall well-being. Notably, the gut stands out as an exceptional reservoir, harboring the most significant concentration of microorganisms, akin to an organ in itself. The gut microbiome's composition and function are influenced by genetics, environment, age, underlying conditions, and antibiotic usage, leading to dysbiosis and pathogenesis, such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Conventional CDI treatment, involving antibiotics like oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, fails to address dysbiosis and may further disrupt gut microbial communities. Consequently, emerging therapeutic strategies are focused on targeting dysbiosis and restoring gut microbiota to advance CDI therapeutics. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating recurrent CDI by transferring processed stool from a healthy donor to a recipient, restoring gut dysbiosis and enhancing bacterial diversity. Moreover, 2 newer Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved live biotherapeutic products (LBP), namely, Fecal Microbiota Live-JSLM and Fecal Microbiota Spores Live-BRPK, have shown promise in preventing CDI recurrence. This review explores the role of the gut microbiota in preventing and treating CDI, with an emphasis on gut-based interventions like FMT and fecal microbiota-based products that hold potential for gut restoration and prevention of CDI recurrence. Understanding the microbiome's impact on CDI prevention and treatment offers valuable insights for advancing future CDI therapeutics.

### Precise quantification of bacterial strains after fecal microbiota transplantation delineates long-term engraftment and explains outcomes [^114i91d6]. Nature Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

Main

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)has been widely used to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) since its superiority to vancomycin was demonstrated. Several studies have shown that the recipient's gut microbiota post-FMT resembles that of a healthy donor, suggesting gut microbiota restoration. However, these studies have failed to capture the most basic principle of commensal Koch's postulates, which is the identification of discrete bacterial strains from the donor that are isolated as a pure culture from the cured recipient only post-FMT and not before. Eight years and tens of thousands of successful FMTsafter the first successful clinical trial, there are basic but unanswered questions about how FMT alters the recipient human gut microbiota. Which strains in the FMT donor stool do or do not engraft is not clear. Which strains that colonized before FMT in recipients persist after the transplant and whether engrafting and persisting strains are durable members of the resulting microbiota is unresolved. The proportion of the recipient microbiota from the donor, recipient or environment has not been clarified. Whether any of these properties of strain engraftment and persistence predict relapse post-FMT has also not been reported.

### Microbiome and metabolome restoration after administration of fecal microbiota, live-jslm (REBYOTA) for preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112nwK4F]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a global health challenge responsible for thousands of deaths, significant quality-of-life impairment, and billions of dollars in health care costs annually. In the United States, > 450 000 people are affected by CDI at an economic cost of $5.4 billion. Up to 35% of patients treated for an initial episode and up to 65% of patients with 1 or more prior episodes experience recurrent CDI (rCDI). Colonic microbiome and metabolome disruption, termed dysbiosis, contributes to primary and rCDI. Antibiotics are the standard-of-care treatment for rCDI but contribute to further dysbiosis and increased risk of recurrence. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel treatment strategies that can restore eubiosis after rCDI antibiotic treatment, such as the administration of live gut microbiota.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) — the transfer of healthy donor stool to a patient — has been extensively explored as a strategy for restoring eubiosis, with substantial promise. However, the production and administration of FMT are not standardized processes, and clear demonstration of FMT safety and efficacy in prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials is lacking. These challenges have prompted development of standardized microbiota-based live biotherapeutics, including fecal microbiota, live-jslm (REBYOTA; RBL, previously known as RBX2660): the first single-dose, rectally administered, microbiota-based biotherapeutic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent CDI recurrence in individuals aged ≥ 18 years following antibiotic treatment for rCDI. RBL has been evaluated in 978 participants across 5 clinical trials to date. In a pivotal phase 3 trial (PUNCH CD3), RBL showed 70.6% treatment success, defined as the absence of CDI diarrhea through 8 weeks after the completion of study treatment, as compared with 57.5% treatment success for placebo; RBL met the prespecified threshold of success, with a 0.991 posterior probability of superiority as compared with placebo.

### Clostridioides difficile infections; new treatments and future perspectives [^115DzA9v]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA RESTORATION

The microbiota plays a significant role in protecting the host from pathogen invasion through colonization resistance. The loss of colonization resistance, typically with antibiotic use, can create an environment susceptible to CDI. The use of antibiotics to treat CDI further exacerbates intestinal dysbiosis, leading to higher recurrence risk after each subsequent episode of recurrence. The microbiota of patients with recurrent CDI is characterized by reduced community diversity and altered metabolomes, with delayed and incomplete recoveries when compared to nonrecurring patients. The restoration of the gut microbiome to a healthy state is essential for the prevention of recurrent CDI. This has led to the shift in treatment approaches with antibiotics used to target C. difficile directly followed by microbiota restoration therapy to replenish the microbiota and re-establish a metabolomic state consistent with a healthy gut (Fig. 1).

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent, safety, and pitfalls [^1128eK7f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infection attributing to substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is common and occurs after effective treatment of first episode. Treatment of rCDI is based on accurate diagnoses, due to difficulty in distinguishing between colonization of C. difficile spores or CDI; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) added to the complexity of diagnoses as both entities can co-occur. It is difficult to eradicate rCDI, and there remains a critical gap regarding treatment of rCDI. The treatment goal of rCDI is to reestablish normal microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is suggested as a treatment for second episode of rCDI. Based on the collective evidence of all randomized controlled trials, FMT was reported more efficacious compared with vancomycin or fidaxomicin; however, these trials had limited number of patients and all patients were pre-treated with vancomycin prior to FMT. Furthermore, when comparing various routes of instillation and types of preparation of fecal microbiota, no difference was observed in cure rate. Despite the success rate of FMT, there remains a concern for transmission of infectious agents, such as Gram negative bacteremia or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal pain), and reports of new diagnoses (inflammatory bowel disease, weight gain and irritable bowel syndrome). To lessen the risk of transmissible infections, donor screening should be performed, which includes screening for medical comorbidities and infectious pathogens in blood and feces. Scheduling complexities and reimbursement places an additional roadblock for using FMT. Microbiome-based therapies are being developed to eliminate the logistical challenges related to FMT. Large prospective and placebo-controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of FMT, so its use can be justified in clinical practice.

### Microbiota restoration therapies for recurrentinfection reach an important new milestone [^113MhE4R]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbiota restoration therapy has become a standard treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). In this article, we review the studies supporting the licensure of two live biotherapeutic products (LBPs) designed to prevent rCDI and to provide clinicians with a perspective on their differences. PubMed was reviewed on 1 October 2023, for all papers published concerning the current Food and Drug Administration allowance of the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and the studies that led to the licensure of RBX2660 (REBYOTA™), generic name, fecal microbiota, live-jslm, and SER-109 (VOWST™), generic name, fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk. OpenBiome continues to produce fecal products for patients with rCDI at their treatment sites, and the American Gastroenterology Association has a National Registry focused on long-term safety of administering fecal microbiota products. The science behind the licensing of fecal microbiota, live-jslm, a consortium of fecal anaerobes found in stool augmented with strains of Bacteroidetes and fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk, a mixture of 50 species of purified Firmicutes spores is reviewed. Both products appear to be safe in clinical trials and effective in reducing rCDI episodes by mechanisms established for FMT, including normalization of α- and β-diversity of the microbiome and by increasing fecal secondary bile acids. The different makeup of the two LBPs suggests that rCDI responds to a variety of engrafting microbiota which explains why nearly all donors in FMT of rCDI are generally effective. Fecal microbiota, live-jslm has also been shown to successfully treat rCDI in elderly patients with advanced comorbidities. With the licensure of two novel LBPs, we are entering a new phase of microbiota replacement therapy. Having standardized manufacturing and proper monitoring of products, harnessing the microbiome to control and prevent disease has a new beginning.

### Understanding the mechanisms of faecal microbiota transplantation [^113oTwU5]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

This Review summarizes mechanistic investigations in faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which has increasingly been adapted into clinical practice as treatment for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that cannot be eliminated with antibiotics alone. Administration of healthy donor faecal microbiota in this clinical situation results in its engraftment and restoration of normal gut microbial community structure and functionality. In this Review, we consider several main mechanisms for FMT effectiveness in treatment of CDI, including direct competition of C. difficile with commensal microbiota delivered by FMT, restoration of secondary bile acid metabolism in the colon and repair of the gut barrier by stimulation of the mucosal immune system. Some of these mechanistic insights suggest possibilities for developing novel, next-generation CDI therapeutics. FMT might also have potential applications for non-CDI indications. The gut can become a reservoir of other potential antibiotic-resistant pathogens under pressure of antibiotic treatments, and restoration of normal microbial community structure by FMT might be a promising approach to protect against infections with these pathogens as well. Finally, FMT could be considered for multiple chronic diseases that are associated with some form of dysbiosis. However, considerable research is needed to optimize the FMT protocols for such applications before their therapeutic promise can be evaluated.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114GZGgV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The clinical and economic burden of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is significant. Recurrent CDI management has emerged as a major challenge with suboptimal response to standard therapy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used as a treatment to reconstitute the normal microbial homeostasis and break the cycle of antibiotic agents that may further disrupt the microbiome. Given the lack of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and limitations in previous systematic reviews, we aimed to conduct a systematic review with robust methods to determine the efficacy and safety profile of FMT in CDI.

Methods

An electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946-March 2012), EMBASE (1974-March 2012) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012). The search strategy was not limited by language. Abstract data were excluded and only completed studies that underwent the full, rigorous peer-review process were included. Studies that used FMT via any delivery modality for laboratory or endoscopically proven CDI with clinical resolution as primary outcome were included. A sample size of 10 or more patients was a further criterion. Elements of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination checklist and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence quality assessment for case series checklist were employed to determine study quality. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers. Both unweighted pooled resolution rates (UPR) and weighted pooled resolution rates (WPR) were calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall studies, as well as predefined subgroups.

Results

Eleven studies with a total of 273 CDI patients treated with FMT were identified; no RCTs were found as none have been published. Two-hundred and forty-five out of 273 patients experienced clinical resolution (UPR 89.7%; WPR 89.1% (95% CI 84 to 93%)). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies (Cochran Q test P = 0.13, I(2) = 33.7%). A priori subgroup analysis suggested that lower gastrointestinal FMT delivery (UPR 91.4%; WPR 91.2% (95% CI 86 to 95%)) led to a trend towards higher clinical resolution rates than the upper gastrointestinal route (UPR 82.3%; WPR 80.6% (95% CI 69–90%)) (proportion difference of WPR was 10.6% (95% CI -0.6 to 22%)). No difference in clinical outcomes was detected between anonymous vs. patient selected donors. There were no reported adverse events associated with FMT and follow-up was variable from weeks to years.

Conclusions

FMT holds considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent CDI but well-designed, RCTs and long-term follow-up registries are still required. These are needed to identify the right patient, efficacy and safety profile of FMT before this approach can be widely advocated.

### Clinical practice and infrastructure review of fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection [^1157Bzfi]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) cases recur after completion of antibiotic therapy, and antibiotic cure rates diminish with each recurrence of CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for recurrent FMT, which otherwise requires prolonged or indefinite antibiotic treatment. FMT is performed by introducing the fecal microbial community obtained from a healthy donor or pool of donors into the stomach, small intestine, or colon of a patient with CDI. Multiple clinical trials support the usefulness of FMT in treating recurrent CDI, and CDI treatment guidelines now include consideration of FMT at the third CDI recurrence. However, there remain challenges to incorporating FMT into clinical practice. First, methods of fecal bacterial community processing vary, as do methods of FMT administration. Second, the optimal dosing strategy and expected benefit of FMT for refractory CDI, particularly for severe and severe complicated cases, are uncertain. Third, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers FMT an investigational treatment. Fourth, insurance reimbursement for FMT usually falls short of FMT administration costs. In the setting of rising C difficile incidence and growing evidence for FMT efficacy, the demand for FMT has increased. However, uncertainty surrounding optimal FMT preparation and administration methods, FDA oversight, and insurance reimbursement presently limits the clinical practice of FMT.

### The role of the gut microbiome in colonization resistance and recurrentinfection [^113GsHZv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A healthy gut microbiome consists of a broad consortium of microorganisms that compete against potential pathogens and each other for resources such as nutrients and adhesion receptors on gut epithelium, and are able to produce antibacterial substances.– Disruption of the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiota lead to dysbiosis and a lack of colonization resistance, that make the gut more susceptible to colonization by pathogenic organisms such as C. difficile. Treatment of acute and recurrent CDI often presents a clinical dilemma, as standard-of-care antibiotics do not restore the intestinal microbiota or colonization resistance and may select for development of antimicrobial resistance. Restoration of a healthy microbiome is critical to break the vicious cycle of recurrent CDI. Although effective as a treatment option to prevent recurrent CDI, current FMT processes for donor recruitment, stool selection, and processing are not standardized. Newer biotherapeutic formulations currently in development have more standardized manufacturing processes, and have shown promising results in phase III clinical studies in preventing C. difficile recurrence and restoring the gut microbiome, paving the way forward for the reduction of recurrent CDI.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridium difficile infection: back to the future [^111sbbXu]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of diarrhea in the industrialized world. The estimated costs of this infection are impressive: over 3.2 billion dollars annually in the US. The introduction of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to clinical practice can be considered a Copernican Revolution. The rationale of this approach consists of correcting the imbalance of the organisms dwelling in the gut by reintroducing a normal flora.

Areas Covered

This review focuses on the indication for FMT in CDI; it examines in-depth the most relevant aspects of the techniques used, and the safety and efficacy of this new 'old' therapy.

Expert Opinion

Authoritative guidelines about the management of CDI strongly recommend FMT for multiple recurrent episodes of infection by C. difficile unresponsive to repeated antibiotic treatment. The cure rates are about 90%, with no serious adverse events having been reported. The main concerns are the long-term outcomes, lack of a standardized procedure for the delivery of donor material, and a cultural barrier to the transplantation of fecal microbiota. A promising solution to some of these problems could be the use of a more acceptable administration route of fecal material, namely, oral capsules.

### An infectious diseases perspective on fecal microbiota transplantation for Clostridioides difficile infection in children [^115jjmf4]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is efficacious for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections (rCDIs). Pediatric experience with FMT for rCDIs is increasing, particularly at large centers. While retrospective studies suggest that FMT is generally safe in the short term, particularly in immunocompetent patients and with rigorous donor screening, additional large prospective studies are needed. This particularly includes those at high risk for infectious complications, such as immunocompromised hosts. Further, long-term implications of altering the intestinal microbiome with FMT are not well understood. The role of FMT in children, particularly in high-risk patients, will require continual reexamination with future availability of pediatric safety and efficacy data. This review summarizes key points for infectious diseases physicians to consider when evaluating a child for FMT.

### Adverse events in fecal microbiota transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129p6Xw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) has emerged as a significant cause of human morbidity and mortality. It is now estimated that CDI has an incidence up to 32.6 per 100,000 person-years, with a direct care cost of $4.8 billion per year in the United States alone. This gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe is the most common cause of pseudomembranous colitis — a condition characterized by intractable diarrhea with the formation of intestinal pseudomembranes of cellular material in the colon. As a result of these physical characteristics, as well as the development of multidrug resistance, the challenge of effectively treating CDI continues to grow.

Given the prevalence and increasing antibiotic resistance of CDI, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is emerging as an exciting alternative to antibiotic therapies in preventing recurrent and complicated CDI. Since its initial implementation, the frequency of use has grown significantly. Current guidelines recommend FMT for patients with multiple recurrences of antibiotic-treated CDI. Accurate study of FMT is challenging, given the heterogeneity of administration protocols. One issue that arises is the variation in stool preparation — studies have described usage of both fresh and frozen stool, various sources of stool (family, pooled, or standardized preparation), and inconsistent donor and stool screening protocols. An additional challenge has been the quality of these studies; many of the randomized controlled trials that have compared FMT to antibiotic therapy have limited follow up as well as antibiotic protocols not within the standard of care. Regardless, FMT has been shown to be of comparable efficacy to standard medical management. Evidence regarding its efficacy with various routes of administration shows inconsistent results, but has widely demonstrated significant efficacy.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation for treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^112wXqk1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Goals

We investigated the long-term efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI).

Background

FMT has emerged as a promising therapy for patients with rCDI unresponsive to standard medical therapy, though long-term efficacy and safety data are scarce.

Materials and Methods

A multicenter retrospective study was performed on patients treated with FMT for rCDI with ≥ 6 months of clinical follow-up post-FMT. Patients were contacted to document sustained efficacy, potential adverse events, and antibiotic exposure. The electronic medical record was reviewed to confirm patient-reported outcomes and obtain additional data. The primary outcome was sustained cure, as defined by the absence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) at any timepoint after FMT.

Results

Of 528 patients treated, 207 were successfully contacted. The mean follow-up post-FMT was 34 (range: 6 to 84) months. One hundred fifty-seven patients (75.8%) reported sustained cure at the time of follow-up. One hundred patients (48%) reported the use of antibiotics for non-CDI indications post-FMT, of whom 11 (11%) had experienced CDI post-FMT. Fifty-two of the original 528 patients (9.8%) treated with FMT had died at the time of follow-up contact; none were felt attributable to the procedure. New medical conditions or diagnoses post-FMT were reported in 105 patients (50.5%). Fifteen reported improvement post-FMT in previously diagnosed medical conditions.

Conclusions

In this largest and longest study to date on efficacy and safety after FMT for treatment of rCDI, we found that the majority of patients experienced long-term cure. Although a number of new conditions developed post-FMT, there was no clustering of diseases associated with dysbiosis.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^116gDrri]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

As highlighted in this review, much of our current understanding of mechanistic insights into the efficacy of FMT are extended from what we have found from CDI studies. Certain mechanistic theories with circumstantial data to support them but no direct investigation as yet, for example, restored microbiota outcompeting C. difficile for the scavenging of carbon sources. Future studies should help test some of these mechanistic insights and attempt to understand the mechanisms that underpin successful FMT for specific disease indications. This may allow us to personalise FMT to not only disease states but to an individual and possibly refine FMT into a more targeted, efficacious, safer therapy.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation and microbial therapeutics for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection in pediatric patients [^1136vFEv]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and has high rates of recurrent disease. As a disease associated with intestinal dysbiosis, gastrointestinal microbiome manipulation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have evolved as effective, although relatively unregulated therapeutics and not without safety concerns. FMT for the treatment of CDI has been well studied in adults with increasing data reported in children. In this review, we discuss the current body of literature on the use of FMT in children including effectiveness, safety, risk factors for a failed FMT, and the role of FMT in children with comorbidities. We also review emerging microbial therapeutics for the treatment of rCDI.

### Host immunity modulates the efficacy of microbiota transplantation for treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection [^11593NNZ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results

FMT mediated clearance of C. difficile infection resolves intestinal inflammation

Fecal microbiota transplantation is a proven treatment for recurrent C. difficile disease, however, whether the host's immune system contributes to FMT-mediated resolution of C. difficile is unknown. To address this question, we first established a murine model of C. difficile infection followed by FMT treatment (Fig. 1a). Similar to previous reports in both mice and humans, FMT reduced C. difficile burden and toxin levels in the large intestine of persistently infected C57BL/6 mice to below the limit of detection while sham PBS treatment did not impact C. difficile burden (Supplementary Fig. 1A, B). By day 10 post-FMT, recipient mice had resolved C. difficile infection-driven intestinal inflammation characterized by immune cell infiltration, submucosa edema (Supplementary Fig. 1C), large intestine crypt elongation (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and elevated mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes in the proximal colon (Supplementary Fig. 1E). These data establish that FMT can indirectly shape intestinal immune homeostasis via resolution C. difficile infection and provoke further investigation into the role of the immune system in supporting FMT-mediated C. difficile resolution.

### The contribution of bile acid metabolism to the pathogenesis ofinfection [^112MErt3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation

FMT is now well-established as a safe and highly effective treatment option for patients with recurrent or refractory CDI. However, whilst it is recognised that FMT acts in such patients to restore the stool microbiome to a composition comparable with the pre-morbid state, – the specific mechanisms underlying its efficacy have until recently remained poorly defined. The demonstration that either a defined consortium of commensal bacteria or spores derived from healthy donor stool deliver efficacy comparable with that of conventional FMT in treating rCDI support the concept that the bacterial component of FMT is a key contributor to efficacy. – Of further particular interest has been the demonstration that sterile filtered FMT also is efficacious for treating rCDI. Collectively, these data suggest that soluble factors related to bacteria – but not necessarily intact bacteria per se – are important mediators of the efficacy of FMT, with potential explanations including bacterial products (e.g. enzymes or other proteins), associated bacteriophages, or gut microbial metabolites. Given these data described above demonstrating that a contributory factor to the pathogenesis of CDI is loss of gut microbiome members with bile-metabolising functionality, one recent area of focus has been as to whether one of the key mechanisms of FMT may be restoration of bacteria that produce these enzymes, and associated reversal of the abnormal bile acid milieu of the distal gut.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation across the lifespan: balancing efficacy, safety, and innovation [^111MPNyv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a rapidly growing therapy aimed at reconstituting the dysbiotic microbiota of a patient with the beneficial stool microbiota of a healthy individual. The efficacy rates of FMT are very robust for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in both children and adults. Although complications of FMT have been reported, it is generally believed to be a safe procedure. Novel indications for FMT are being studied, with the hope that ultimately it may be useful for a variety of disorders. As this field continues to grow, however, it is necessary to consider efficacy, safety, and innovation across the lifespan. There are unique concerns regarding FMT as it pertains to children, adults, and the elderly. In this review, we seek to update clinicians, researchers, and regulators on how these factors must be balanced across the lifespan as we move forward with this innovative therapy.

Clostridioides difficile infection — Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) indications, delivery, efficacy, and safety are as follows: In general, conventional antibiotic treatment should be used for at least 2 recurrences (ie, 3 CDI episodes) before offering fecal microbiota transplantation, and randomized, controlled trials have shown similar CDI cure rates after fecal transplants performed with fresh and frozen fecal samples. Although a number of methods of administration have been described, the most common transplant delivery route is via colonoscopy; however, oral capsules were found to be noninferior to colonoscopic delivery for preventing recurrent infection, and overall success rates for fecal transplantation, regardless of the delivery mode, are reported to be between 60% and 90% after a single treatment. A small, randomized, controlled trial compared primary fecal transplant (n = 9) with metronidazole therapy (n = 11) and suggested that transplant may be an alternative to antibiotics in this setting. There have been recent reports of fecal transplantation transmitting infectious agents, and prospective donors should be screened for colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms in addition to more typical infections; furthermore, in June 2019, in response to 2 fecal transplant-related deaths in immunosuppressed patients, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning detailing the importance of obtaining proper patient consent, including a discussion regarding risks related to the therapy.

### Real-world use of bezlotoxumab to prevent recurrentinfections: a single-center experience and meta-analysis [^114Urbp7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clostridioides difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients in the United States. Globally, the incidence of healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is estimated at 2.24 per 1000 admissions per year and 3.54 per 10,000 patient-days. While the overall incidence of CDI has declined in recent years, recurrence remains a significant hurdle in the treatment of CDI. Following an initial episode, up to 35% of patients experience a recurrence, and this risk increases to 65% in those with two or more prior infections. Recurrent CDI (rCDI) is associated with significant clinical and economic burdens, including increased hospital readmissions, complications such as toxic megacolon and bowel perforation, and substantially higher healthcare costs.

Current strategies for managing CDI and preventing recurrence include optimizing antibiotic therapy and restoring a healthy gut microbiome. Standard-of-care antibiotics such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin are effective in treating acute CDI and have some impact on recurrence risk. For instance, fidaxomicin has been shown to modestly lower recurrence rates compared to vancomycin in initial CDI treatment. In patients with multiple recurrences, prolonged or tapered antibiotic regimens are often used in an attempt to suppress relapse. Additionally, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a highly effective treatment for patients with refractory or multiply recurrent CDI, with success rates often exceeding 80% in those scenarios. However, FMT is typically reserved for patients after multiple relapses and comes with practical challenges in standardization and access. Even with these approaches, many high-risk patients still suffer repeat infections, underscoring the need for adjunctive therapies that specifically target recurrence mechanisms. Evolving data suggest microbiome-based therapies such as fecal microbiota transplantation, fecal microbiota, live-jslm, and fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk may be effective in patients with rCDI (recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection).

### The role of the gut microbiome in colonization resistance and recurrentinfection [^11115Uvk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct restoration of beneficial microbes and their metabolites is an optimal treatment for prevention of recurrence. Different probiotics have been proposed to be used in conjunction with antibiotics to aid gut microbiota restoration, including Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus, or Bifidobacterium species. However, results on efficacy of probiotic use demonstrate moderate or inconclusive benefit. Given the role of diet in modulating the gut microbiome, diet has also been proposed as a potential approach to reduce recurrent disease. Diets high in fiber, for instance, have been shown to increase diversity and benefit symptoms caused by other gastrointestinal conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. Despite the above discussed animal studies investigating the influence of diet on CDI, studies investigating diet modulation in human patients have not been conducted. Dietary changes to restore the gut microbiome thus remain to be investigated.

An example of a highly successful method of microbiome restoration to combat recurrent or refractive CDI is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is an evolving therapeutic strategy whereby stool is harvested from a healthy donor and transplanted into a patient's colon to restore the gut microbiome to a healthier state. It is a complex intervention that involves multiple components, including donor selection and screening of stool, choice of method of transplantation, and use of stool banks. Stool preparations can be fresh or freeze–thawed, and methods of transplantation include colonoscopy, an oral capsule, nasogastric delivery, or an enema.

FMT is recommended as a treatment option after a second or further recurrence of CDI by current 2021 IDSA/SHEA guidelines and 2021 ACG guidelines, to prevent further recurrence of CDI. It is highly effective in the treatment of recurrent CDI, with reported efficacy between 60% and 90% after a single treatment. Although FMT is a robust treatment option for recurrent CDI, its value in treating primary CDI remains to be determined. Antibiotics are standardly employed to treat patients with primary CDI; however, the established link between increased antibiotic exposure and increased likelihood of CDI recurrence, as well as the limited efficacy of standard-of-care antibiotics, necessitates improved therapeutic strategies. A recent small-scale clinical trial evaluated the use of FMT as a treatment for primary CDI and found that FMT may be an alternative to antibiotic therapy. In addition, moderate quality evidence from randomized controlled trials indicated that FMT is more effective in patients with C. difficile -associated diarrhea than vancomycin or placebo. Further research is underway to determine the efficacy of newer antibiotics for primary CDI and prevention of future recurrences, as well as vaccines and antibiotic-sparing therapies for CDI management.

### Impact of a purified microbiome therapeutic on abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes in patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection [^111DwqMv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several limitations to these analyses. As in any post hoc analysis, there may be underlying differences in the patient populations or biases that may account for our observations that are not inherently apparent. The hypothesis that microbiome restoration may reduce ARG abundance through microbiome remodeling would need to be tested in a prospective clinical trial. In addition, it is unclear whether the specific strains of spore-forming Firmicutes that comprise VOS or the microbiome remodeling and subsequent expansion of all spore-forming Firmicutes following VOS treatment led to the observed reduction in ARGs. The tools used to detect strain-level differences in metagenomic data are still being developed. Therefore, we opted to apply a commonly used, validated species-detection methodology, which limits our ability to directly answer this question. Since this was a post hoc analysis, we included a healthy cohort as a reference to provide additional context to the abundance of ARGs across drug classes and resistance mechanisms at baseline. In addition, these characteristics were comparable at baseline between VOS and placebo recipients, which strengthens the implications of these data. Also, since stool samples were not collected between weeks 2 and 8, we are limited in our ability to discern dynamic changes between VOS and placebo recipients for approximately a 6-week period of time. Our observations that VOS reduces ARGs are consistent with other published data using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and FMT-like drugs. However, whole-stool products that include gram-negative bacteria have the potential to carry Proteobacteria ARGs, despite donor screening for carriage of drug-resistant bacteria.

In conclusion, in this post hoc analysis of a randomized trial of patients at high risk of harboring drug-resistant bacteria, VOS more rapidly reduced the abundance of ARGs, as compared with placebo, and attained an ARG profile similar to a healthy cohort. These changes in ARGs were durable through 24 weeks posttreatment and were observed in association with remodeling of the GI microbiome. This proof-of-concept analysis suggests the feasibility of using microbiome therapeutics as a novel approach to address the urgent problem of reducing drug resistance, by leveraging the beneficial characteristics of spore-forming Firmicutes that may be less likely to harbor ARGs. Future trials should evaluate whether cultivated microbiome therapeutics may prevent carriage of drug-resistant bacteria in the gut and subsequent infections in vulnerable populations.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and other conditions in children: a joint position paper from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^116AJjpF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent CDI in children — recurrence risk, mechanisms, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are summarized: after antibiotic therapy, "approximately 20% to 30% of cases will have recurrence of symptoms within a few days to several weeks after cessation of antibiotics". Recurrence "is likely related to persistent dysbiosis, either related to the broad antibiotic spectrum of metronidazole, vancomycin, or other concomitant non-CDI antibiotics; lack of immune response to C difficile toxins; and/or continued C difficile exposures". Although probiotics such as "Saccharomyces boulardii" have been studied, "randomized trials supporting these findings are lacking in children". The authors state, "we recommend the diagnostic and treatment approach outlined in Figure 1". Regarding FMT, "FMT, arguably the most effective therapy against rCDI, has become a standard in the therapeutic algorithms", yet "concerns about this alternative treatment for CDI include unknown long-term consequences (63), especially in children", and "repeated and prolonged antibiotic exposures, especially in young children, may also have significant consequences later in life, such as increasing the risk of IBD (65,66) and obesity (67)".
