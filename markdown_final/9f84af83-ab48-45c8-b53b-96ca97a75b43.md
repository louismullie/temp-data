## Question

What is the treatment for Crohn's in a 55y old patient with past history of multiple sclerosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for Crohn's disease in a 55-year-old patient who also has a history of multiple sclerosis, with attention to disease severity, extraintestinal features, drug–disease interactions, and safety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about risk stratification and disease phenotype. Then, I should verify which therapies are contraindicated due to MS. Next, I will outline options for mild, moderate, and severe disease. After that, I should consider perianal disease, postoperative recurrence prevention, and special safety issues in an older adult with MS. Finally, I will set monitoring targets, drug–drug considerations, and an emergency algorithm for flares, while ensuring the plan aligns with ACG, ECCO, and AGA guidance and is tailored to MS comorbidity.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing and risk assessment. I need to check for age of diagnosis, anatomic extent, behavior (stricturing, penetrating), perianal disease, prior surgery, and objective inflammation by CRP and fecal calprotectin, since these features guide prognosis and therapy selection; in older-onset disease, I should also remember the possibility of an indolent course and higher risks with immunosuppression, so I must balance aggressiveness with safety [^1125gDQu] [^116aq4AU]. I should confirm that MS is an established diagnosis and clarify its current activity and disease-modifying therapy, because that will constrain Crohn's choices, especially anti-TNF agents [^1174Frey].

> Wait, let me verify the critical drug–disease interaction. Anti-TNF therapy can precipitate or worsen demyelination, so it is contraindicated in patients with MS. I should avoid infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept, and I need to document this contraindication clearly in the chart [^1174Frey] [^114HLbmL] [^113CtSJ7] [^116BygM6]. Hold on, I should double-check the nuance here: case series and pharmacovigilance reports describe new-onset demyelinating events after anti-TNF initiation, reinforcing that the risk is not theoretical and justifies a conservative stance in coexisting MS [^112B7AbM] [^1172xMh4].

> Now, for mild disease, I need to ensure steroid-sparing choices that are MS-compatible. Budesonide controlled-release for ileocecal disease is reasonable short-term, and I should pair it with early initiation of an immunomodulator for maintenance, ideally methotrexate given the anti-TNF prohibition. I should confirm that thiopurines are also an option if methotrexate is not suitable, but I will preferentially choose methotrexate given ECCO/AGA support and fewer hepatotoxic interactions in this age group [^115hXewY] [^111oFdRs] [^117HVBSs]. Let me consider local therapy and nutrition: mesalamine has limited benefit in Crohn's but can be tried in colonic disease, and antibiotics like metronidazole are not for maintenance. I should also reinforce screening for infections and vaccinations before immunosuppression in an older adult [^116aq4AU] [^115hXewY].

> For moderate-to-severe disease, I should confirm that ustekinumab is the preferred first-line advanced therapy here because it is mechanistically distinct and not linked to demyelination. It is FDA-approved for Crohn's and supported by AGA/ECCO guidance for induction and maintenance, and I can position it as monotherapy or with cautious combination if needed [^115hXewY] [^115871kE]. Hold on, I should verify the practicals: ustekinumab dosing is weight-based (IV induction followed by subcutaneous maintenance), and in older adults I need to monitor for infection risk and malignancy surveillance consistent with age and comorbidity [^115871kE] [^116bBzU6].

> If ustekinumab is not available or contraindicated, I will now examine natalizumab as a potential bridge in selected patients. I should confirm JCV serostatus because PML risk is tightly linked to JCV positivity and treatment duration; natalizumab is FDA-approved for both MS and Crohn's but should not be combined with immunosuppressants or anti-TNFs, and in practice it is best reserved for JCV-negative patients who have failed or cannot use other advanced therapies, with 6‑monthly JCV surveillance if continued [^112mbK8Q] [^111GDfdZ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost suggested routine natalizumab as first-line for Crohn's here, but I should correct that impulse: given the PML risk profile, natalizumab is typically a second- or third-line option rather than initial therapy unless there is a compelling dual-indication rationale and stringent risk mitigation in place [^111GDfdZ].

> Let me consider investigational or off-label options if standard therapies fail. Vedolizumab has gut-selective anti-integrin activity and, although not FDA-approved for MS, mechanistically it is less likely to affect CNS demyelination; in older patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's and MS, vedolizumab is a reasonable consideration, with shared decision-making about its off-label neurologic safety profile and ongoing vigilance for infections [^114rz8PF]. I should confirm that I do not combine it with natalizumab or anti-TNFs and that I continue age-appropriate infection screening and vaccinations before initiation [^116aq4AU].

> For perianal fistulizing disease, I need to ensure we avoid anti-TNF agents despite their usual first-line role. Ustekinumab can reduce drainage in fistulizing disease and is a reasonable alternative; if response is suboptimal, I should coordinate surgical drainage/seton placement and consider stem cell therapy in complex perianal disease per ECCO guidance, while continuing medical therapy to control luminal inflammation [^113Q1NXt]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not inadvertently recommending anti-TNF here; yes, the MS contraindication stands, so ustekinumab or surgical strategies are the key pillars in this scenario [^1174Frey].

> Next, I should review postoperative recurrence prevention. For high-risk patients, guidelines support anti-TNF therapy to reduce postoperative recurrence. But wait, given MS, anti-TNF is not an option, so I should substitute vedolizumab or ustekinumab for prevention in appropriate candidates, with endoscopic surveillance at 6–12 months to guide escalation or de-escalation decisions [^1158QdTS] [^111AG9wB]. I need to ensure that if the patient is low risk, observation may be reasonable, but in this age group I should have a low threshold for proactive prevention given the cumulative burden of recurrence over time [^113jBo8S].

> I should confirm safety considerations specific to a 55-year-old with MS. Older adults with IBD have higher risks of infection, bone loss, and malignancy; I need to screen for latent TB, hepatitis B/C, and VZV, update vaccinations, and consider DEXA for osteoporosis risk, while avoiding prolonged systemic corticosteroids when possible to mitigate infection and neuropsychiatric effects [^116bBzU6] [^116aq4AU]. Let me reconsider drug interactions: if the patient is on MS disease-modifying therapy, I should coordinate with neurology to avoid overlapping immunosuppression and to time therapies to minimize cumulative risk, especially around procedures or infections [^1174Frey].

> For monitoring, I need to ensure a treat-to-target approach anchored in objective inflammation rather than symptoms alone. I should reassess clinically and with CRP/fecal calprotectin at 4–12 weeks after induction, add endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging if symptoms persist or to confirm remission, and use therapeutic drug monitoring for biologics when response wanes. Deep remission (clinical plus endoscopic) is the goal, with de-escalation considered after sustained remission [^116aq4AU] [^112f911M]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not relying on symptoms alone; indeed, symptoms correlate poorly with mucosal activity, so objective reassessment is essential to avoid under- or overtreatment [^1125gDQu].

> I will now examine acute flares and emergencies. For severe flares, short-course systemic corticosteroids can be used judiciously with early taper and transition to steroid-sparing maintenance. I should exclude C. difficile, CMV, and other infections, and if the patient is already on a biologic, I should check drug levels and anti-drug antibodies before switching classes [^116aq4AU]. But wait, what if the flare is refractory? In that case, I should escalate to an alternative advanced therapy such as ustekinumab or, in carefully selected cases, natalizumab with strict JCV risk mitigation, and involve surgery early for obstruction, abscess, or refractory fistulizing disease rather than persisting with ineffective medical therapy [^115h8exZ] [^111GDfdZ].

> Putting this together, my final, tailored recommendation is as follows: for a 55-year-old with Crohn's and MS, I will avoid all anti-TNF agents, start ustekinumab for moderate-to-severe disease with weight-based dosing and maintenance every 8 weeks, monitor response objectively at 4–12 weeks, and maintain with ustekinumab monotherapy. For mild disease, I will use budesonide short-term with early initiation of methotrexate for maintenance. For perianal fistulizing disease, I will use ustekinumab plus surgical drainage/setons and consider stem cell therapy if complex. For postoperative prevention in high-risk patients, I will use vedolizumab or ustekinumab in place of anti-TNF. And throughout, I will coordinate with neurology, screen and vaccinate appropriately, and apply treat-to-target monitoring to achieve deep remission safely [^115hXewY] [^115871kE] [^111oFdRs] [^111AG9wB] [^116aq4AU] [^113Q1NXt].

For a 55-year-old with Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, **avoid anti-TNF agents** [^1174Frey] because they can trigger or worsen demyelination [^112B7AbM]; use **ustekinumab or vedolizumab** as first-line biologics for induction and maintenance [^114rz8PF] [^115871kE]. Methotrexate or thiopurines are options for maintenance if biologics are not suitable [^111oFdRs] [^117HVBSs]. Use short-term corticosteroids only for acute flares and taper promptly [^115hXewY]. Monitor closely for neurological changes, infections, and malignancy; coordinate care with neurology and gastroenterology [^116aq4AU].

---

## Clinical considerations and challenges

- **Disease severity and activity**: Assess Crohn's severity and activity objectively using endoscopy, imaging, and biomarkers (CRP, fecal calprotectin) [^116aq4AU].

- **MS activity and stability**: Evaluate MS activity, stability, and current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) to guide Crohn's treatment selection [^1174Frey].

- **Drug interactions**: Consider potential interactions between Crohn's therapies and MS DMTs, particularly immunosuppressants and biologics [^112mbK8Q].

- **Infection risk**: Increased susceptibility to infections due to immunosuppression requires vigilant monitoring and prophylaxis [^115871kE].

---

## Recommended treatment strategy

### Induction therapy

- **Ustekinumab**: Preferred first-line biologic for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. It is effective, safe, and does not exacerbate MS [^115hXewY] [^115871kE].

- **Vedolizumab**: Alternative first-line biologic, particularly if ustekinumab is contraindicated or ineffective. It has minimal systemic immunosuppression and a favorable safety profile in MS patients [^114rz8PF].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short-term use (≤ 8 weeks) for acute flares, with prompt tapering to minimize adverse effects [^115hXewY].

---

### Maintenance therapy

- **Ustekinumab or vedolizumab**: Continue as maintenance therapy based on induction response and tolerability [^notfound].

- **Methotrexate**: Consider as an alternative maintenance option, particularly if biologics are contraindicated or declined [^111oFdRs] [^117HVBSs].

- **Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine)**: Use cautiously due to increased infection risk and potential interactions with MS therapies [^112mbK8Q].

---

## Therapies to avoid or use with caution

- **Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab)**: Contraindicated due to risk of demyelination and MS exacerbation [^1174Frey] [^112B7AbM].

- **Natalizumab**: Effective for both MS and Crohn's disease, but carries a significant risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and should be reserved for select cases with careful risk assessment [^112mbK8Q] [^111GDfdZ].

- **Corticosteroids**: Long-term use should be avoided due to increased infection risk, osteoporosis, and other adverse effects [^116aq4AU].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **clinical assessments** should track Crohn's activity, MS symptoms, and treatment response [^116aq4AU]. Routine laboratory monitoring should include CBC, liver function tests, renal function, CRP, and fecal calprotectin [^116aq4AU]. MRI should be used to monitor MS activity and detect neurological complications [^116BygM6]. Maintain a high index of suspicion for infections — including opportunistic pathogens — and malignancies, especially lymphoma and skin cancers [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A **coordinated approach** involving gastroenterology, neurology, and primary care is essential for optimal outcomes. Patient education should emphasize adherence, infection prevention, and recognition of disease flare symptoms [^notfound]. Individualize treatment based on disease severity, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^115zd15Q].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Ustekinumab | Induction and maintenance | First-line |
| Vedolizumab | Induction and maintenance | Alternative first-line |
| Methotrexate | Maintenance | Alternative |
| Corticosteroids | Short-term acute flares | ≤ 8 weeks |
| Anti-TNF agents | Contraindicated | Avoid |
| Natalizumab | Select cases | Use with caution |

---

Ustekinumab or vedolizumab are the **preferred biologics** for a 55-year-old with Crohn's disease and MS, with methotrexate as an alternative maintenance option. Anti-TNF agents should be avoided due to demyelination risk, and corticosteroids should be used only short term. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary care are essential to manage disease activity, minimize adverse effects, and optimize quality of life.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic IBD that often begins in adolescenceand affects between 0.1 and 16 per 100 000 persons worldwidewith a significant personal, social and economic burden. The disease can affect any part of the GI tract but is usually located in the terminal ileum and/or colon. Typically, CD has a chronic relapsing remitting course and CD patients are faced with a lifetime of recurrent exacerbations that are treated with medical and surgical interventions, although without definitive cure.

The major therapeutic goals are reduction of acute signs and symptoms, induction and maintenance of remission, and prevention of complications. Therapeutic recommendations depend on the disease location, disease severity, disease complications (fistulas, abscesses, strictures) and previous response to treatment. Various agents, such as sulfasalazine, antibiotics, glucocorticosteroids (GCS), thiopurines, methotrexateand tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, are useful in the induction and/or maintenance of remission. Many of these, however, are only moderately efficacious and are associated with side effects. In addition, the newer biological agents have a relatively inconvenient parenteral route of administration and are costly. These therapeutic challenges mean that over 50% of people with CD require surgery within 10 yearsbecause pharmacological agents can no longer control the disease or complications such as perforation and/or stenosis develop. Therefore, a need exists to develop new efficacious and safe agents for the management of CD.

It is generally believed that CD involves exaggerated T cell immune responses to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals, and that environmental factors trigger the onset or periodic reactivation of disease. These circumstances result in the production of an excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with TNF antagonists such as infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab induces clinical response and clinical remissionssuggesting that agents that reduce inflammatory cytokines may have therapeutic benefits in patients with CD.

Laquinimod (TV-5600, previously ABR-215062) is a novel synthetic compound with high oral bioavailability, which is being developed as an oral formulation for CD, multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease and lupus nephritis. Preclinical data in various experimental models of colitis and MS suggest that laquinimod has a direct inhibitory effect on antigen presenting cells and T cells, resulting in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We conducted a randomised trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of escalating doses of oral laquinimod in patients with CD.

A 46-year-old man with a long-standing history of Crohn's disease who was treated with multiple therapies over a period of 9 years presented with oral lesions which on biopsy demonstrated peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Initially, the development of T-cell lymphoma was presumed to be secondary to prolonged immunosuppression but it did not respond to withholding immunosuppressive therapy. On treatment with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin and prednisone) chemotherapy, complete remission was achieved. Although development of malignancies in the immune-suppressed patient with Crohn's disease has been previously described but we present a rare case of T-cell lymphoma in a similar patient, which has not been reported before.

### Long-term safety of subcutaneous abatacept in rheumatoid arthritis: integrated analysis of clinical trial data representing more than four years of treatment [^116BiYg7]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Most prespecified autoimmune events were of mild-to-moderate intensity; 4 autoimmune events were considered severe (multiple sclerosis [MS], psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and vasculitis). The case of MS occurred on day 516 of abatacept treatment in a 44-year-old Caucasian female. The event was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study drug and led to discontinuation in that patient. Severe psoriasis was reported in 1 patient on day 839 of treatment and was considered to be an exacerbation of a mild event occurring on day 700; however, the event was considered to be unrelated to the study drug, and the patient continued to receive treatment. The case of Crohn's disease occurred on day 752 of treatment, was considered to be unrelated to the study drug, and did not result in discontinuation. The case of severe vasculitis (not otherwise specified) occurred on day 253 of treatment, was considered to be unrelated to the study drug, and did not lead to interruption or discontinuation of treatment with the study drug; the patient was treated with prednisone 20 mg/day, and the event was ongoing at the time of database locking. One event was considered to be very severe: rapid onset of vasculitis (again, not otherwise specified) that occurred on treatment day 574 in a patient with no history of vasculitis. Although the event was considered unlikely to be related to the study drug, it did lead to study drug discontinuation; the patient was treated with high dosages of corticosteroids (60 mg/day), and the event was ongoing at the time of database locking.

### Management of Crohn's disease… [^115ZhFzW]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Mild to Moderate Disease Mild to moderate Crohn's disease can be treated with a salicylate preparation, and in patients who are unresponsive, an antibiotic may help. 5 Response to therapy should be evaluated after several weeks; patients who do not respond should be treated for moderate to severe disease or with alternative therapy. In a study 9 conducted in 1979, sulfasalazine demonstrated benefits over placebo, with approximately 50 percent of patients enrolled in large clinical trials achieving clinical remission. The suggested dosage of sulfasalazine is 3 to 6 g per day. Sulfasalazine does not have significant benefit in maintaining remission 9, 10; mesalamine may maintain remission at higher dosages and in some subsets of patients. In the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn's disease, antibiotic therapy may be an acceptable alternative.

Metronidazole in a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per kg per day has demonstrated benefit in the treatment of ileocolitis and colitis, with most patients reporting clinical improvement and more than one half achieving remission. Moderate to Severe Disease Patients with Crohn's disease that is classified as moderate to severe should be treated with steroids until symptoms resolve and weight loss is reversed. The immunomodulators azathioprine and mercaptopurine may be used, but full response may not be achieved for several months. Infliximab may be an alternative if corticosteroids are ineffective or contraindicated. A variety of other immunomodulatory agents have been studied in active, refractory Crohn's disease, including cyclosporine, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. Parenteral methotrexate in a dosage of 25 mg per week has shown effectiveness in steroid-dependent patients, allowing for steroid tapering.

26 using infliximab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease showed improvement in 65 percent of patients, with complete remission in 33 percent. Single-dose infusions of 5 mg per kg, 10 mg per kg, and 20 mg per kg were used, with the best response seen at 5 mg per kg. Another study 27 showed improvement in four weeks in more than 80 percent of patients treated with 5 mg per kg, and more than 50 percent achieved remission. 27.

### Tailoring the treatment to the individual in Crohn's disease [^115zd15Q]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a heterogeneous disease with approximately 30–40% of patients having a simple benign history and the rest having a chronic progressive disease leading to complications, surgeries and potentially socio-professional marginalisation. Recent studies have shown that an early treatment with immunosuppressive treatment and/or anti-tumour necrosis factor agents could change the natural history of the disease and avoid the development of such disabling disease. The therapy should thus be tailored according to the risk of developing such disabling disease. Recent cohort studies have shown that clinical factors such as age at diagnosis, disease extent, disease location and behaviour at diagnosis were predictive for the development of severe or disabling disease and could be used in helping the physician to tailor therapy.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TYSABRI is an integrin receptor antagonist indicated for treatment of:

Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

TYSABRI is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. TYSABRI increases the risk of PML [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. When initiating and continuing treatment with TYSABRI, physicians should consider whether the expected benefit of TYSABRI is sufficient to offset this risk. (1.1)

Crohn's Disease (CD)

TYSABRI is indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease with evidence of inflammation who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF-α. (1.2)

Important Limitations:

In CD, TYSABRI should not be used in combination with immunosuppressants or inhibitors of TNF-α. (1.2)

### A phase II study of laquinimod in Crohn's disease [^112Mx3d1]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Laquinimod is an oral therapeutic agent under investigation for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), Huntington's disease, lupus nephritis and multiple sclerosis. This dose escalation study evaluated the safety and efficacy of laquinimod as induction therapy in patients with active moderate–severe CD.

Design

Multicentre, double-blind, sequential-cohort, randomised controlled trial with laquinimod doses of 0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 mg/day or placebo (n = 45 per cohort randomised in a 2:1 ratio) for 8 weeks with 4-week follow-up. Stable concomittant therapies and prior use of anti-tumour necrosis factor agents were permitted. Comprehensive safety assessments were performed and efficacy analyses included the proportions of patients in clinical remission (CD Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 and no treatment failure (TF)), and with a clinical response (70 or 100 point CDAI reduction from baseline or remission and no TF).

Results

117 patients received laquinimod and 63 patients received placebo. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the laquinimod group was similar to the pooled placebo group (86.2%–96.7% vs 82.5%) and most AEs were mild to moderate in severity. Treatment with laquinimod 0.5 mg showed consistent effects on remission (48.3% (CI 31% to 66%) vs 15.9% (CI 9% to 27%)), response 100 (55.2% (CI 37% to 71%) vs 31.7% (CI 22% to 44%)) and response 70 (62.1% (CI 44% to 77%) vs 34.9% (CI 24% to 47%)) versus placebo. Laquinimod 1.0 mg showed less benefit (26.7% remission (CI 14% to 44%) and 53.3% response 70 (CI 36% to 70%)), and no effect was noted on remission/response at higher doses.

Conclusions

Laquinimod was safe and well tolerated, and the effects on remission and response of the 0.5 mg dose suggest a treatment benefit in patients with CD.

### Do not assume symptoms indicate failure of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in Crohn's disease [^114diaaR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

It is a challenge to monitor patients with Crohn's disease who remain symptomatic despite anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Clinicians must use a systematic approach for each patient and obtain objective evidence about disease activity and response to therapy. Alternate etiologies for symptoms should be sought and treated, if found. Active Crohn's disease despite therapy requires reassessment and adjustments to management plans.

### Demyelination during anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy with infliximab for Crohn's disease [^112B7AbM]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system may be linked to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy.

Case History

A 19-year-old female with Crohn's ileocolitis developed right arm and leg numbness and right hand weakness 4 weeks after the initiation of infliximab. Neurologic examination confirmed upper and lower right extremity sensory and motor deficits. MRI examination of the head and thoracic cord showed multiple gadolinium-enhancing lesions with distribution and configuration most suggestive of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating process. The infliximab therapy was immediately stopped and follow-up at 8 weeks revealed symptomatic improvement.

Conclusion

This case report describes the onset of a demyelinating process after the institution of infliximab therapy in a patient with Crohn's disease.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with biologics [^115871kE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Ustekinumab — weight effects, malignancy risk, and viral comorbidities — notes that overweight or obese patients often need the higher dose (90 mg) of ustekinumab to achieve the response of lower-weight patients taking the 45 mg dose, and that serum concentrations are lower in heavier patients at each dose. There is no definitive evidence that ustekinumab used as monotherapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis increases the risk of solid tumor or lymphoreticular malignancy, and patients with a history of solid tumor malignancy who have failed other therapies may in certain circumstances receive ustekinumab without expectation of an increased risk of tumor recurrence. Use caution with patients with pre-existing immunosuppression-related conditions; as long as patients with HIV have no recent history of opportunistic infection, they may receive ustekinumab if they are also receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy that has effectively normalized their CD4+ T-cell counts and if they show undetectable viral load, and consultation with the patient's infectious disease care provider is advised before initiating ustekinumab therapy; it also should be considered that severe psoriasis may be a manifestation of poorly controlled or poorly managed HIV infection and that the use of HAART is likely to be an effective treatment of psoriasis in such individuals. In patients with a history of or currently active hepatitis C, ustekinumab might be considered for the treatment of psoriasis and concomitant management with an appropriate health care provider is warranted; in patients with currently active hepatitis B, ustekinumab might be considered for the treatment of psoriasis, the patient should first be evaluated by an appropriate health care professional and may require concomitant treatment with an approved antiviral medication directed against hepatitis B, a hepatitis B core antibody test is recommended, and patients with a history of hepatitis B (confirmed resolved infection) do not need to follow-up with a specialist but require monitoring because of the risk of reactivation. In the setting of multiple sclerosis and/or inflammatory bowel disease, patients might benefit from ustekinumab therapy and ustekinumab is FDA-approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease.

Crohn's disease — treatment for patients not in remission: For low risk patients, options include immunosuppressive therapy, assessing drug levels, and considering anti-TNF therapy. For moderate/high-risk patients, options include using anti-TNF monotherapy over no therapy or thiopurine monotherapy, and using anti-TNF + thiopurine over thiopurine monotherapy or anti-TNF monotherapy. The algorithm also includes assessment of inflammatory biomarkers and branches labeled inflammation present versus inflammation not present with actions to switch to a different drug class or to continue current drug class and dose with monitoring.

### Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment: clinical decision tool [^112f911M]. Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease evaluation and treatment — clinical symptoms correlate poorly with the underlying inflammation, and the combination of symptom remission and endoscopic remission has been dubbed deep remission; instituting a change in therapy in symptomatic patients with objective evidence of inflammation and then reassessing the patient within 6 months to ensure that deep remission has occurred has been dubbed treat to target where the target is deep remission. Therapeutic drug monitoring is applied to help guide decision making in patients treated with biologic agents who lose response. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute clinical support tool, "Identification, Assessment, And Initial Medical Treatment in Crohn's Disease", weaves these concepts together into a practical algorithm to help clinicians assess patients for active inflammation and the presence of complications and co-morbid conditions, risk stratify their patients, apply the therapies shown to be effective in the AGA Institute document, and ensure that patients' underlying inflammation is sufficiently treated. Both the AGA Institute and the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America have developed quality indicators for inflammatory bowel disease, and initial versions are focused on things that can be easily measured (eg, vaccinations, measuring bone density, and administering steroid sparing medications) and on demonstrating that it is possible to reduce practice variation. One could reasonably argue that these quality indicators need to be refocused on treating the underlying inflammation to resolution.

### Infliximab in Crohn's disease: early and long-term treatment [^113sMis1]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The natural history of Crohn's disease is characterized by a remitting and relapsing course that progresses to complications and surgery in the majority of patients. Current treatment guidelines advocate a stepwise approach according to disease location and severity at presentation, with goals mainly aimed at inducing and maintaining clinical remission. Major advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease offered significant opportunities for the development of new therapies over the past years. Infliximab and other biologic agents have shown impressive results in Crohn's disease patients refractory to standard therapy, suggesting a potential disease course-modifying action. These led to the proposal to reverse the traditional therapeutic algorithms using these agents early in the course of the disease. Preliminary data suggest that early intervention may be a more effective treatment strategy in some Crohn's disease patients. As yet, early and indiscriminate use of biologics remains to be supported by convincing evidence. Data on long-term treatment of Crohn's disease with infliximab or other biologics are even more scarce. Future studies aimed to identify predictors of complicated disease and long-term randomized studies aimed to compare "step-up" and "top-down" strategies in high-risk groups should help to answer if early introduction of biological therapy alters the natural history of Crohn's disease.

### Refractory fulminant colitis following ocrelizumab therapy requiring colectomy in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^117MgzTR]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 40s was referred for acute and chronic postprandial abdominal cramps on a background of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis on ocrelizumab therapy as well as coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet, with a family history of ulcerative colitis. Initial colonoscopy demonstrated mild patchy colitis. The patient was trialled on mesalazine, which was ceased due to intolerance. Subsequently, she continued on mercaptopurine monotherapy for management of mild symptoms. Despite this, her symptoms rapidly progressed, with endoscopic and histological evidence of severe rectal-sparing pancolonic inflammation, consistent with severe ocrelizumab-induced colitis. This was refractory to intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous cyclosporine rescue therapy, requiring surgical management with a subtotal colectomy and subsequent ileorectal anastomosis, after which she remained in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission.

### Advances in the treatment of Crohn's disease [^1148BfH6]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The medical therapy of Crohn's disease has improved considerably in recent years. In large part, this is due to the introduction of new efficacious agents, both "biologics" and traditional small molecules. Further study of older drugs has also advanced our ability to devise the optimum approach to individual Crohn's disease patients by better clarifying the benefits, adverse effects, and means to optimize doses of established medications. In this review, we present an evidence-based approach to the medical management of active Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease in remission, and perianal Crohn's disease that emphasizes recent advances that have come from the results of randomized controlled clinical trials.

### Interferon β-1a for the maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn's disease: results of a phase II dose-finding study [^112tPHtD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) share common pathogenic processes. Interferon (IFN) beta-1a is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with MS and has been shown to down-regulate the expression of interleukin-12, a cytokine that is thought to be involved in mucosal degeneration in CD. IFN beta-1a therefore offers promise as a treatment for CD.

Methods

In this multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II, dose-finding study, patients with steroid-induced clinical remissions of CD were randomized 1:1:1:1 to subcutaneous IFN beta-1a: 66 mcg three times weekly (tiw), 44 mcg tiw, 44 mcg twice weekly (biw), or matching placebo tiw with steroid tapering. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients relapse-free at Week 26. Safety was also assessed.

Results

This study was terminated early following a planned interim analysis at 26 weeks. Of the planned 192 patients, 67 were randomized to treatment: placebo (n = 16), or IFN beta-1a 44 mcg biw (n = 17), 44 mcg tiw (n = 16) or 66 mcg tiw (n = 18). In total, 20/67 patients (29.9%) completed 26 weeks and 7 patients (10.4%) completed 52 weeks. The proportion of patients who remained relapse-free at Week 26 did not differ significantly between the placebo group (5/16, 31%) and the IFN beta-1a 44 mcg biw (6/17, 35%; p = 0.497), 44 mcg tiw (7/16, 44%; p = 0.280) or 66 mcg tiw (2/18, 11%; p = 0.333) groups. There was little difference between treatment groups in secondary efficacy endpoints. IFN beta-1a was generally well tolerated at all doses. Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild or moderate in IFN beta-1a-treated patients, with the most common AEs (influenza-like symptoms, headache, injection-site reactions) being similar to those reported with IFN beta-1a in MS.

Conclusion

There was no difference in efficacy between patients with CD receiving IFN beta-1a or placebo. However, these results should be considered in the context of the low patient numbers and high dropout rate. Overall, IFN beta-1a was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile that was consistent with previous experience in MS.

### Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in the older patient [^116bBzU6]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing, and as our population ages, there is a growing number of IBD patients who are transitioning into advanced age; 15% to 20% of IBD patients are classified as late-onset (between 60–65 years of age). This has led clinicians to treat a large number of older patients with IBD. The principles of management of IBD in older patients are the same as those who are younger. There are, however, phenotypic differences that are unique to late-onset IBD and age-related concerns that clinicians must consider when initiating therapy for their older patients with IBD. Given the increasing number of older IBD patients, the aim of this article is to present an updated, evidence-based review of the therapeutic options and issues that arise in this unique patient population.

### Association of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy with the development of multiple sclerosis [^114HLbmL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

A 35-year-old woman with a history of indeterminate colitis developed symptoms of multiple sclerosis after treatment with infliximab. Neurologic examination confirmed upper and lower extremity motor and sensory deficits. MRI showed multiple enhancing white matter lesions distributed throughout her brain as well as her thoracic spine. There may be a link between inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and anti-tumor necrosis-alpha therapy. This case report describes the onset or worsening of a demyelinating process after the initiation of infliximab therapy in a patient with indeterminate colitis.

### Neurology of inflammatory bowel disease [^1174Frey]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the digestive system, comprising two main distinctive entities, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Besides gastrointestinal manifestations, IBD causes extraintestinal manifestations in the central and peripheral nervous system. The incidence of neurological complications in IBD ranges from 0.25% to 47.5%. The pathophysiology of neurological manifestations of IBD is mostly immune mediated, but dysfunction of the brain-gut axis, arterial and venous thromboembolism, infections, nutritional deficiencies and side-effects of medications (steroids, metronidazole, sulfasalazine, anti-TNF-α, anti-integrin antibodies) are other contributory mechanisms. Patients with IBD have an increased risk of arterial and venous stroke, mainly during periods of exacerbations. Vasculitis is extremely rare. There is a bidirectional association between multiple sclerosis and IBD, with a relative risk for comorbidity of 1.54, being 1.53 for the risk of multiple sclerosis in IBD and 1.55 for the risk of IBD in multiple sclerosis patients. Anti-TNF-α therapy is contraindicated in the treatment of patients who have both IBD and multiple sclerosis. Demyelinating disorders can also be a rare complication of anti-TNF-α therapy. Optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, progressive myelopathy, central nervous system infections, epilepsy and encephalopathy are among other uncommon neurological complications. Peripheral nervous system manifestations include peripheral neuropathy, either demyelination and axonal, myasthenia gravis and polymyositis/dermatomyositis and localized forms of myositis.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: looking at the less frequent associations [^114rz8PF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurological diseases

Multiple sclerosis

MS and its ophthalmic manifestation, optic neuritis, are multifactorial demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system caused by an attack on oligodendrocytes by the immune system. Destruction of oligodendrocytes progressively leads to a deficit in myelin production. The clinical picture is extremely variable. Diagnostic criteria include clinical signs and typical features at magnetic resonance imaging; additional diagnostic tests include evoked potential evaluation and spinal fluid sampling for the assay of specific oligoclonal bands.

The first report of an association between IBD and MS was published in 1982and successively confirmed by several studies (reviewed in Kosmidou et al.). According to a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies, the prevalence of MS in IBD patients is 0.2% while the prevalence of IBD in MS patients is 0.6%. The same meta-analysis showed that IBD patients have a significantly higher prevalence of MS than controls [relative risk (RR), 1.91] and that MS patients have a significantly higher prevalence of IBD than controls (RR = 1.53). The association was reported to be higher for women, with no significant difference between CD and UC patients.–

Immunologic studies have demonstrated that Th17 cells are involved in both MS and IBD (reviewed in Maddur et al.). These cells produce IL-17 and IL-22, which promote inflammation. High levels of IL-17 were detected in both MS patients and IBD patients, supporting a pathogenic role of Th17 cells. In MS, the activation of Th17 cells is thought to promote central nervous system inflammation and degeneration.

In clinical practice, the management of patients with both demyelinating diseases and IBD can be challenging, because anti-TNF agents are known to worsen or even induce demyelination and should be avoided in these patients. On the other hand, the only advanced therapy that may have a role in both diseases is the class of the sphingosine-1 receptor modulator, which are still on study for IBD. Thus, to date, given the harmless nature of vedolizumab on demyelinating diseases, a possible option is to treat IBD with this drug and MS with a separate target therapy, if needed.

Another particular clinical picture is that of the so-called 'radiologically isolated MS', that is considered to be the prodromic stage of evolving MS by most of the authors. In this case, a strict follow-up of the patient by both gastroenterologist and neurologist is mandatory, as theoretically anti-TNF therapy may have a deleterious effect, as for MS.

### Development of Crohn's disease in a patient taking etanercept [^113CtSJ7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

In addition to its well known proinflammatory effects, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) has complex effects on the growth, differentiation, and death of immune cells. TNF antagonists have had dramatic effects on the suppression of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic inflammatory diseases. However, TNF inhibition of RA has led to an increased incidence of drug induced anti-dsDNA production, with cases of systemic lupus erythematosus as well as exacerbations of multiple sclerosis. While etanercept does not generally alter the course of Crohn's disease we describe a rare instance where this agent may have contributed to the development of clinically significant inflammatory bowel disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^1125gDQu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Crohn's disease — natural history and risk factors indicate progression risks and monitoring needs: Most patients initially present with nonpenetrating, nonstricturing behavior, but up to half develop an intestinal complication within 20 yr of diagnosis, particularly with ileal, ileocolonic, or proximal gastrointestinal involvement, extensive anatomic involvement, or deep ulcerations. High-risk features for progressive burden include young age at diagnosis, initial extensive bowel involvement, ileal/ileocolonic involvement, perianal/severe rectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis, and penetrating or stenosis phenotype. Over long observation, only 20%–30% have a nonprogressive or indolent course. Symptoms do not correlate well with active inflammation and therefore should not be the sole guide for therapy; objective evaluation by endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging should be used periodically. In the absence of immunomodulator or biologic treatment, corticosteroid dependency and/or resistance occurs in up to half of patients.

### Evidence-based use of anti-TNF α therapy in Crohn's disease; where are we in 2011? [^114uLY1Z]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The efficacy of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) therapy with infliximab and adalimumab in moderate to severe Crohn's disease has now been proved. This article reviews the evidence supporting best practice with these agents in the light of recent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance. Recent studies point to greater efficacy when these drugs are used early in the disease, particularly when mucosal healing can be achieved. For infliximab, the combination with immunomodulator drugs appears to afford greater efficacy, but possibly at the expense of the risk of rare but serious side effects. Patients should be selected carefully for treatment based on prognostic factors predicting aggressive disease, on the one hand, and comorbid factors that might predict side effects, on the other. Multiple drug combinations should be avoided where possible. Finally, a minority of patients in stable remission with complete mucosal healing may be selected for anti-TNFα drug withdrawal.

Crohn's disease

Available data on FMT in Crohn's disease are limited to case reports and small case series. Vermeire et al. reported no significant clinical or endoscopic improvement at 8 weeks in four patients with refractory Crohn's disease administered FMT via nasojejunal tube three times over a 2-day period. Transient recipient GiMb changes were observed in all patients (weeks 2–4) returning to baseline microbial composition by week 8. These findings along with other studies suggest that Crohn's disease has an increased resistance to FMT relative to ulcerative colitis, although preliminary data suggest that intensive, prolonged FMT may result in a clinical response and sustained GiMb transformation in some Crohn's disease patients. An illustrative case of terminal ileal Crohn's disease that normalized histologically has been published. We present here an example of a patient with CDI and Crohn's colitis treated with FMT 12 years ago in whom not only the CDI but also Crohn's colitis was cured (Fig. 2). The implication of the influence of C. difficile and other infections or alterations in the GiMb on induction and maintenance of Crohn's disease activity is a subject of immense current interest.

### 25 years of anti-TNF treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: lessons from the past and a look to the future [^114Jy9nn]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies have been widely used for approximately 25 years now. The first clinical observations in patients with refractory Crohn's disease rapidly responding to infliximab prompted accelerated clinical development and approval for this indication. However, many questions remained unanswered when this treatment came to market related to maintenance schedules, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and positioning. Many of these open questions were addressed by investigators and sponsors during more than two decades of clinical use. The authors were among the first to use infliximab in Crohn's disease and felt that now is a good time to look back and draw lessons from the remarkable anti-TNF story. Even today, new insights continue to appear. But more importantly, what was learnt in the past 25 years has created a platform for future development of even stronger and safer therapies. We should not forget to learn from the past.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^116aq4AU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — general management principles and objective assessment — are based on disease location, severity, disease-associated complications including extraintestinal manifestations, and factors affecting future prognosis, and the goal is to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission without significant adverse effects; objective evaluation by endoscopic, sonographic, or cross-sectional imaging is recommended, with improvement evident within 4–12 weeks and maximal treatment effect by 12–16 weeks, after which patients achieving response or remission are transitioned to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy; for continued active symptoms despite optimized therapy, evaluation with an objective study is recommended, and if symptoms or inflammation persist, assessment for medication optimization, addition of other agents, or transition to a different medical or surgical strategy is warranted; biomarkers such as CRP and FC can be assessed but should not exclusively serve as a treatment endpoint, and mimickers such as C. difficile, cytomegalovirus infection, and medication-related adverse effects should be excluded, noting that risks of C. difficile infection may be up to 5-fold higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

### Crohn's disease: ACG releases updated management… [^115hXewY]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations HIGH-LEVEL EVIDENCE Moderate to Severe Disease. In persons with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who are naïve to immunomodulators or infliximab, treatment with these medications combined is more effective than monotherapy. Patients in whom corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, or anti– tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been ineffective, as well as those who have not taken anti-TNF inhibitors previously, should receive ustekinumab. Moderate to Severe Disease. Short-term oral corticosteroids can be prescribed to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease, with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine considered to support remission. Cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and tacrolimus should be avoided because they are not effective. For disease not amenable to corticosteroids, thiopurines, or methotrexate, anti-TNF agents are recommended. Natalizumab should only be continued to maintain remission if results of serum antibody to John Cunningham virus testing are negative, with testing performed every six months and treatment halted upon a positive result. Mild to Moderate Disease. Treatment with antimycobacterials should not be used as the main treatment for any patient with mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Metronidazole should not be used as the main treatment regimen, and ciprofloxacin is not recommended for luminal inflammatory disease. Sulfasalazine can be used in persons with colonic mild to moderate Crohn's disease, and controlled ileal-release budesonide can be used in persons with mild to moderate ileocecal disease. Moderate to Severe Disease. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

Although azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine should not be used to initiate symptom remission in the short term, they may be effective in reducing corticosteroid use, and thiopurine methyltransferase testing should be considered before they are initiated. Methotrexate is an option to sustain remission, as well as to treat patients dependent on corticosteroids.

### Early biological therapy in operated Crohn's disease patients is associated with a lower rate of endoscopic recurrence and improved long-term outcomes: a single-center experience [^1139ty7p]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Messages

What is already known?

Patients undergoing Crohn's disease–related surgery are treated with biological therapy in case of risk factors for recurrence or if there is an endoscopic recurrence of disease.

What is new here?

Crohn's disease patients treated with biological therapy postoperatively experience a reduced rate of hospitalization and surgery regardless of endoscopic disease recurrence and risk factors.

How can this study help patient care?

Early treatment with postoperative biological therapy may prevent disease recurrence and improve long-term outcomes of patients with Crohn's disease.

### Controversies in the management of anti-TNF therapy in patients with Crohn's disease: a Delphi consensus [^1154cWfE]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Consensus documents and clinical guidelines are primarily aimed to analyse the best available evidence in order to provide guidance in the treatment decision-making process. Usually, they are focused on the most relevant or common patient clinical profiles. Still, in daily practice, the treating physicians must deal with clinical scenarios that are not specifically covered by these documents.

This consensus document sought to provide guidance for managing patients with moderate-to-severe CD, including patient stratification for specific therapies or monitoring strategies, with special attention given to areas that still remain controversial. We are confident that this project likely complements the recommendations provided via national and international consensus documents and guidelines.

### Sarcoidosis complicating treatment with natalizumab for Crohn's disease [^116oRgMC]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Natalizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the lymphocyte adhesion molecule a4 integrin, with proven efficacy in multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease (CD). The development of sarcoidosis with extrapulmonary involvement is reported in two patients with refractory CD who had received maintenance therapy with natalizumab. This complication has not been previously reported. It is hypothesised that the effect of natalizumab in altering lymphocyte mucosal trafficking may underlie the development of sarcoidosis in these patients.

### Infliximab for Crohn's disease: more than 13 years of real-world experience [^1172xMh4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Four events of demyelinating disease (0.02/100 patient-years) were reported in 3 infliximab-treated patients; none were reported in the other-treatments-only group. The rate of peripheral neuropathy was higher in the infliximab-treated group (47 events, 0.22/100 patient-years) than in the other-treatments-only group (13 events, 0.09/100 patient-years). Multiple sclerosis (MS; 3 events, 0.01/100 patient-years; 6 events, 0.04/100 patient-years) and relapsing-remitting MS (0 events, 0.00/100 patient-years; 2 events, 0.01/100 patient-years) occurred at higher rates among patients who received other treatments only (Table 2).

Overall, 2.8% (1648/59,875) of infliximab infusions were associated with an infusion reaction, most commonly headache (0.5%) and arthritis (0.4%) (Supplementary Table 1). The rate of infusions associated with an infusion reaction decreased over time from 5.4% of 11,504 infusionsto the present rate of 2.8% of 59,875 infusions.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^116iSKhW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Crohn's disease (CD) clinical features and diagnosis — Key concept: Hallmark/cardinal symptoms of CD include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue and weight loss, fever, growth failure, anemia, recurrent fistulas, or extraintestinal manifestations can also be presenting features. The most common symptom of CD is chronic diarrhea, but some patients may not experience this symptom. Key concept: CD is diagnosed clinically; there are no truly pathognomonic features, and endoscopic, radiographic, and histologic criteria with evidence of chronic intestinal inflammation will be present. Key concept: Extraintestinal manifestations of CD include arthropathy, dermatological, ocular, and hepatobiliary disease (primary sclerosing cholangitis), and other extraintestinal complications include thromboembolic events, metabolic bone disease, osteoporosis, cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis, and other immune-mediated diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis, pericarditis, psoriasis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis).

### Inflammatory demyelinating events following treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor [^116BygM6]. Cytokine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is an inflammatory cytokine involved in certain inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Crohn's disease. The anti-TNF-alpha treatments used for RA may be associated with inflammatory demyelinating events affecting the central nervous system and may possibly aggravate known MS.

Objective

We report here three new cases of inflammatory demyelinating events of the central nervous system following treatment with anti-TNF-alpha.

Results

The neurological symptoms appeared on average 5 months after initiation of the treatment. For all patients, the inflammatory process was confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging. The symptoms totally or partially regressed as soon as anti-TNF-alpha treatment was stopped except for one patient who developed clinically defined MS.

Conclusions

Inflammatory demyelination of the central nervous system may be associated with the use of anti-TNF-alpha. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with these treatments should benefit from a follow-up which includes brain MRI.

### Natalizumab (Tysabri) [^115PkVMW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

Only prescribers registered in the MS TOUCH®Prescribing Program may prescribe TYSABRI for multiple sclerosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The recommended dose of TYSABRI for multiple sclerosis is 300 mg intravenous infusion over one hour every four weeks.

2.2 Crohn's Disease (CD)

Only prescribers registered in the CD TOUCH®Prescribing Program may prescribe TYSABRI for Crohn's disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

The recommended dose of TYSABRI for Crohn's disease is 300 mg intravenous infusion over one hour every four weeks. TYSABRI should not be used with concomitant immunosuppressants (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, or methotrexate) or concomitant inhibitors of TNF-α. Aminosalicylates may be continued during treatment with TYSABRI.

If the patient with Crohn's disease has not experienced therapeutic benefit by 12 weeks of induction therapy, discontinue TYSABRI. For patients with Crohn's disease who start TYSABRI while on chronic oral corticosteroids, commence steroid tapering as soon as a therapeutic benefit of TYSABRI has occurred; if the patient with Crohn's disease cannot be tapered off of oral corticosteroids within six months of starting TYSABRI, discontinue TYSABRI. Other than the initial six-month taper, prescribers should consider discontinuing TYSABRI for patients who require additional steroid use that exceeds three months in a calendar year to control their Crohn's disease.

### What is the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease treated with vedolizumab? [^115g2kg8]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

A further set of challenges with this analysis relates to the available data on population levels of PML. Ideally, we would standardize for age, sex, and immunosuppressant use for all populations; however, the rarity of the condition means that the population data required to achieve this are unavailable. Our estimates, with the exception of that relating to natalizumab, therefore do not take into account any of these confounding factors.

When considering the limitations of this analysis, however, it is important to consider the alternatives. It could be argued that absolute proof that there is no risk could be demonstrated only through a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with PML development as the primary outcome measure and with sufficient power to demonstrate equivalence between vedolizumab-treated patients and those receiving placebo. Such a trial would arguably be unethical and would require an unfeasibly large patient population (for example, in the context of 0 events and based on the statistical "rule of 3", a sample size of 300,000 PY [for each of the vedolizumab and placebo cohorts] would be required to rule out a risk of > 1 event per 100,000 PY with 95% confidence). Therefore, targeted observational research such as the current analysis is likely to be the best available option in this scenario. Due to uncertainty in the current estimate of the true risk of PML associated with vedolizumab, we have provided estimates of the probability of observing future PML cases under various risk scenarios.

### Optimal use of biologics in the management of Crohn's disease [^115DUFSm]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cure. The inflammation that drives the disease can lead to debilitating symptoms and a number of complications that may lead to surgery. The introduction of biologic therapy a decade ago has offered a new option for patients failing conventional therapy. Over time, biologic therapy has also led to the desire to achieve treatment goals beyond the control of symptoms. In order to achieve short-term and long-term goals with these new agents, it is important to review how these therapies may be optimized for the best results.

### Natalizumab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease [^115XSinp]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and pivotal clinical trials for natalizumab in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease.

Data Sources

A PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted (1966-June 2005), and information was obtained from Iowa Drug Information Services. Additional data sources included meeting abstracts, bibliographies from identified articles, and information from the manufacturer.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies and review articles examining natalizumab were evaluated. All published, randomized clinical trials evaluating natalizumab in MS and IBD were included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Natalizumab is the first drug in a new class of agents called selective adhesion molecule inhibitors. It has shown promising results in MS and inflammatory bowel disease and appears superior compared with current therapies in reducing relapse rates. However, 3 recent, confirmed case reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) create concern about natalizumab's use in combination with existing therapies or in undefined patient subgroups. Natalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in March 2005 while the drug's safety is further evaluated.

Conclusions

Although long-term efficacy and safety of natalizumab have not been established, available data indicate that it is a novel drug for patients with MS or inflammatory bowel disease. Analysis of its possible association with PML will determine the risk-benefit evaluation and eventual place in therapy for natalizumab.

### The natural history of adult Crohn's disease in population-based cohorts [^116DbBLD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Natural history studies provide invaluable data on the disease course. First, they help define the end points for clinical trials that are designed to test drugs for the end point of disease modification in chronic disabling diseases. Natural history studies can also help to identify subsets of patients in whom the disease prognosis can be stratified according to clinical features. This comprehensive review summarizes our current knowledge of the natural history of Crohn's disease in adults as reported in population-based studies that include long-term follow-up results.

Methods

We conducted a literature search of English and non-English language publications listed in the electronic databases of MEDLINE (source PUBMED, 1935 to December 2008).

Results

One-third of the patients had ileitis, colitis, or ileocolitis at the time of diagnosis. Disease location remained broadly stable over time. Up to one-third of the patients had evidence of a stricturing or penetrating intestinal complication at diagnosis, and half of all patients had experienced an intestinal complication within 20 years after diagnosis. Ten percent of the patients had prolonged clinical remission. Steroid dependency occurred in one-third of the patients, and surgery was required in one-third after initiation of steroid therapy. The annual incidence of hospitalizations was 20%. Half of the patients required surgery within 10 years after diagnosis. The risk of postoperative recurrence was 44–55% after 10 years.

Conclusions

Crohn's disease is a disabling condition over time. The impact of changing treatment paradigms with increased use of immunosuppressants and biological agents on its natural history is poorly known.
