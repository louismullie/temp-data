## Question

A technician wants to determine whether cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA is present in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. DNA purified from the leukocytes of the patient is reacted in a mixture containing oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling are performed, and the reaction product is detected by gel electrophoresis. The technician most likely used which of the following laboratory procedures on this patient's blood?

Answer Choices:
A. Northern blotting
B. Polymerase chain reaction
C. Reverse transcription
D. Southern blotting

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory method was used to detect CMV DNA in a bone marrow transplant recipient's blood, given the description of DNA amplification with specific primers, thermostable polymerase, nucleotides, thermal cycling, and gel detection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the described steps match the core principles of polymerase chain reaction. Then, I should verify how this differs from Northern and Southern blotting and from reverse transcription. Next, I will consider the clinical context of CMV DNA detection in transplant recipients and whether PCR is the standard approach. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly note why the alternatives are incorrect, supported by references.

> Let me first confirm the method signature. The description of adding target-specific oligonucleotides, thermostable DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and performing repeated heating and cooling cycles to amplify DNA, followed by gel electrophoresis to visualize the product, is a classic endpoint PCR workflow, which is exactly how PCR amplifies specific DNA sequences for detection [^bd6ed100] [^78ef4117].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives so I don't jump to conclusions. Northern blotting detects RNA, not DNA, and involves gel separation of RNA followed by transfer and hybridization, which does not match DNA amplification here, so A is out. Southern blotting detects DNA but relies on restriction digestion, gel separation, transfer, and hybridization rather than enzymatic amplification with thermal cycling, so D is not correct either. Reverse transcription converts RNA to cDNA and would require an RT step before amplification; the vignette starts with DNA and does not mention RNA, so C is not the best fit even though RT-PCR is common in virology for RNA viruses [^bd6ed100].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical context to ensure this is the expected test. In hematopoietic cell transplantation, CMV viral load testing by PCR is standard for risk stratification, diagnosis, and monitoring, and guidelines endorse PCR-based CMV DNA assays for transplant recipients, which aligns with using PCR to detect CMV DNA in blood leukocytes in this scenario [^dc9a65b4] [^6fd8596a].

> I will now examine whether any of the distractors could plausibly be confused with this setup. Initially, I wondered if Southern blotting might be argued because it also deals with DNA, but wait, the absence of restriction digestion, membrane transfer, and probe hybridization makes that inconsistent with the described protocol, reinforcing that PCR is the correct choice here [^bd6ed100].

> Putting this together, the described steps — DNA template, sequence-specific primers, thermostable polymerase, dNTPs, thermal cycling, and gel detection of amplicons — are definitive for polymerase chain reaction, and the clinical context of CMV DNA testing in transplantation further supports PCR as the method of choice. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Polymerase chain reaction [^bd6ed100] [^dc9a65b4].

---

The technician most likely used **polymerase chain reaction (PCR)** [^bd6ed100] to detect CMV DNA in the blood of a bone marrow transplant recipient. PCR amplifies specific DNA sequences through repeated heating and cooling cycles, using oligonucleotide primers, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides, with detection of the amplified product by gel electrophoresis [^78ef4117]. This approach is the standard for CMV DNA detection in transplant recipients because of its high sensitivity and specificity [^6fd8596a] [^dc9a65b4].

## Step-by-step analysis of the described procedure

| **Step** | **Description** | **Corresponding pcr component** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | DNA purified from leukocytes | Template DNA |
| 2 | Oligonucleotides specific for CMV DNA | Primers |
| 3 | Thermostable DNA polymerase | DNA polymerase (e.g. Taq) |
| 4 | Nucleotides | dNTPs |
| 5 | Repetitive cycles of heating and cooling | Denaturation, annealing, extension |
| 6 | Detection of reaction product by gel electrophoresis | Amplicon visualization |

---

This sequence matches **PCR** [^bd6ed100], which repeatedly denatures, anneals, and extends to amplify target DNA, with gel electrophoresis used to visualize the amplicon [^78ef4117].

---

## Comparison with other laboratory procedures

- **Northern blotting**: Detects RNA, not DNA; requires gel separation, transfer, and hybridization, not amplification [^notfound].
- **Reverse transcription**: Converts RNA to cDNA; not used for direct DNA detection.
- **Southern blotting**: Detects DNA but uses restriction digestion, gel separation, transfer, and hybridization, not amplification [^notfound].

---

## Clinical relevance of PCR in CMV detection

PCR is the **gold standard** for CMV DNA detection in transplant recipients, offering high sensitivity and specificity [^6fd8596a] [^dc9a65b4]. It is used for:

- **Diagnosis**: Detects active CMV infection.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks viral load during treatment.
- **Preemptive therapy**: Guides antiviral initiation at threshold viral loads [^25f78690].

---

## Conclusion

The described method is **PCR**, the standard for CMV DNA detection in transplant recipients due to its accuracy and clinical utility [^bd6ed100] [^6fd8596a].

### Clinical applications of the polymerase chain reaction: an update [^78ef4117]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The development, in the past decade, of nucleic acid amplification and detection methods is useful in the study of the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of a variety of clinical (including rheumatologic) disorders. An association between infectious agents and rheumatic disorders has been established through such methods as polymerase chain reaction. This article describes the principles behind polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis and updates its clinical applications. It is beyond the scope of this article, however, to describe other nucleic acid amplification methods or to include a complete list of all polymerase chain reaction assays that have been developed. Other recent reviews offer additional details.

### Principles and applications of polymerase chain reaction: basic science for the practicing physician [^bd6ed100]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the technology of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its use in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed using the PubMed database for English-language articles published between January 1, 1985, and November 31, 2007, using the following keywords: polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and applications of real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Study Selection

Select review articles and primary articles relevant to medical applications of PCR were chosen.

Results

As a revolutionary technique, PCR provides a rapid and accurate means of amplifying DNA. It has enabled the cloning and manipulation of genes for biomedical research and has facilitated the diagnosis of genetic, infectious, and oncologic diseases. The use of reverse transcriptases to evaluate RNA levels and the extension of PCR technology to quantify DNA amplification in real time has brought major advances to the application of PCR. By allowing the determination and quantification of changes in gene expression, these techniques have provided a greater understanding of disease processes and now serve as a foundation for diagnostics and basic science research.

Conclusions

Both PCR and real-time PCR have dramatically changed the field of basic science and diagnostic medicine. These technologies are now a well-established, indispensable part of research and clinical laboratories.

### Real-time polymerase chain reaction for the rapid detection of group B streptococcal colonization in neonates [^ad09a10b]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection remains a leading cause of neonatal sepsis. Currently, the management guidelines of neonates born to women with unknown GBS status at delivery are unclear. In this cohort, who undergo at least a 48-hour observation, a rapid method of detection of GBS colonization would allow targeted evaluation and treatment, as well as prevent delayed discharge.

Objective

The goal of this research was to evaluate the validity of rapid fluorescent real-time polymerase chain reaction in comparison with standard culture to detect GBS colonization in infants born to women whose GBS status is unknown at delivery.

Design/Methods

Neonates at >32 weeks' gestation born to women whose GBS status was unknown at delivery were included. Samples were obtained from the ear, nose, rectum, and gastric aspirate for immediate culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction after DNA extraction using the LightCycler. Melting point curves were generated, and confirmatory agar gel electrophoresis was performed.

Results

The study population (n = 94) had a mean +/- SD gestational age of 38 +/- 2 weeks and birth weight of 3002 +/- 548 g. The rates of GBS colonization by culture were 17% and 51% by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The 4 surface sites had comparable rates of GBS. The overall sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values of real-time polymerase chain reaction were: 90%, 80.3%, 28%, and 98.9%.

Conclusions

Real-time polymerase chain reaction resulted in a threefold higher rate of detection of GBS colonization and had an excellent negative predictive value in a cohort of neonates with unknown maternal GBS status at delivery. Thus, real-time polymerase chain reaction would be a useful clinical tool in the management of those infants potentially at risk for invasive GBS infection and would allow earlier discharge for those found to be not at risk.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2020 guideline on diagnosis and management of babesiosis [^f23768f1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Non-Babesia microti infection diagnostics—A Babesia species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can confirm active Babesia infection and the infecting species, and some commercial laboratories and referral centers, such as the Parasitic Diseases Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, can provide PCR and DNA molecular analyses to detect non-B. microti species. If a B. microti PCR test is performed first and is negative but babesiosis is still suspected, a blood smear or pan-Babesia PCR test should be performed. Symptomatic patients who test positive for Babesia (non-B. microti) antibody should either have a blood smear, a PCR assay capable of detecting all Babesia species (a pan-Babesia PCR assay), or a Babesia species-specific PCR that matches the Babesia (non-B. microti) antibody. The whole B. microti indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay does not detect B. duncani antibody, the whole cell B. duncani IFA assay fails to detect B. microti antibody, and sera from B. venatorum infected patients will cross-react against whole cell B. divergens antigen. Antibody testing is used to determine the seroprevalence of Babesia infection in epidemiological studies and may have a role in screening the blood supply, and this approach is impractical for the diagnosis of acute babesiosis.

### Comparison of clinician diagnosis of COVID-19 with real time polymerase chain reaction in an adult-representative population in Sweden [^5372a3f1]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As COVID-19 continues to spread in waves across the world, rapid and accurate diagnosis are essential tools to identify, isolate, and appropriately manage patients, thereby decreasing the rate of infectivity, morbidity, and mortality. Robust and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 also aids in surveillance, management and control of disease, epidemiologic characterization, contact tracing, and decision making for public health purposes. However, at the beginning of the pandemic, diagnosis was challenging, primarily because of the disparate symptoms manifested by those infected, ranging from mild or no symptoms to life-threatening presentations. In response, various diagnostic approaches were employed, which are classified based on their underlying indications and principles.

Diagnostic approaches currently being used for COVID-19 can be broadly divided into two basic categories: clinical and in vitro diagnostics. The clinical diagnostic methods are based on assessment of symptoms, imaging techniques, and laboratory tests. Findings from these methods can be non-specific and insufficient to provide compelling evidence of COVID-19 infection. The diagnostic methods are commonly divided into: (a) nucleic acid-based assays, in which RNA of the virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is amplified; and (b) serological assays, in which antibodies/antigens specific to SARS-CoV-2 are targeted. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the most sensitive and widely implemented nucleic acid-based assays, commonly considered to be the “gold standard” for diagnosis of COVID-19.

### The gene: the polymerase chain reaction and its clinical application [^889f1e18]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Chromosomal DNA transfers and stores information regarding the structure and function of the cell. Genetic information, encoded within sequences of nucleotides that compose DNA, is grouped into functional units called genes. Genetic diseases are caused by changes in the chromosomal DNA, leading to a change in the quantity or function of the protein gene product. In the past, genetic diagnosis was limited by the availability of sufficient quantity and quality of DNA and the absence of an efficient amplification procedure. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), an inexpensive, rapid, and accurate means of amplifying DNA, is already making a major contribution to the diagnostic sciences. PCR techniques have been widely used in diverse applications, including molecular analysis of microbial pathogens, inheritable diseases and syndromes, and neoplasms. The purpose of this article is to 1) Review gene structure and function, 2) review principles of PCR technology and its applications in molecular biology, and 3) discuss an experimental clinical application of PCR to identify novel infectious agents responsible for odontogenic infections.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^52a76ce1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Q fever—Diagnosis incorporates polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of whole blood or serum provides rapid results and can be used to diagnose acute Q fever in approximately the first 2 weeks after symptom onset but before antibiotic administration. A fourfold increase in phase II immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of paired acute and convalescent specimens is the diagnostic gold standard to confirm diagnosis of acute Q fever; a negative acute titer does not rule out Q fever because an IFA is negative during the first stages of acute illness and most patients seroconvert by the third week of illness. A single convalescent sample can be tested using IFA in patients past the acute stage of illness; however, a demonstrated fourfold rise between acute and convalescent samples has much higher sensitivity and specificity than a single elevated, convalescent titer. Diagnosis of chronic Q fever requires demonstration of an increased phase I IgG antibody (≥1:1024) and an identifiable persistent infection, and PCR, immunohistochemistry, or culture of affected tissue can provide definitive confirmation of infection by Coxiella burnetii; test specimens can be referred to CDC through state public health laboratories.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^40fa7f6f]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up—For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) pretransplant CMV assessment—Testing CMV viral load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to HCT is recommended in general as it may complement CMV risk stratification post transplantation (B-III), but pre-emptive therapy prior to transplant should be determined on a case-by-case (CIII); on the other hand, insufficient data is available for routine PCR testing in CMV seronegative recipients, and when CMV serology is checked more than once pre-HCT, discordant results may occur and should be interpreted with caution.

### Detection of fungi in the sinus mucosa using polymerase chain reaction [^e6baa0e8]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the presence of fungi in the sinus mucosa of patients with and without chronic rhinosinusitis.

Study Design and Setting

Prospective observational study using polymerase chain reaction and conventional culture to detect fungi in the sinus mucosa. Middle meatus mucosal samples were collected from 31 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and 14 control subjects.

Results

Fungi were detected in 6.5% of subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis and in none of the control subjects using polymerase chain reaction. Fungi were detected in 29% of subjects with the combination of inhalant allergies, nasal polyposis, and asthma. Fungi were detected in none of the subjects without the combination of these three comorbidities (P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Polymerase chain reaction assay appears to be able to detect fungi in chronic rhinosinusitis.

Significance

Fungi may not be implicated in the pathogenesis of most chronic rhinosinusitis.

Ebm Rating

### The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cardiovascular diagnosis [^dd154ad2]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a recently discovered technique of molecular biology that has revolutionized both basic science and clinical research laboratories. Its beautiful simplicity derives from its ability to geometrically amplify a single copy of a DNA sequence to millions of copies in a matter of hours. PCR thus allows both the molecular biologist to clone genes and the clinical pathologist to screen blood samples for human immunodeficiency virus, with rapidity and ease never before available. In this brief review we will discuss the basic technique of the PCR, its applications in the basic science and clinical areas, and further emphasize its current and potential roles in cardiovascular medicine.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2025-2026: technical report [^9ed42a20]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Influenza diagnostic tests (Table 4) summarize methods, turnaround times, and performance: rapid molecular assay (nucleic acid amplification) detects Influenza A or B viral RNA, does not distinguish subtypes, has a typical time to results of 15–30 min, and shows high sensitivity; high specificity; rapid influenza diagnostic test (antigen detection) detects Influenza A or B virus antigens, does not distinguish subtypes, has a typical time to results of 10–15 min, and shows moderate sensitivity; high specificity; and molecular assays (including reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) detect Influenza A or B viral RNA, can distinguish subtypes (“Yes, if subtype primers are used”), have a typical time to results of 1–8 h, and show very high sensitivity; very high specificity. Negative results may not rule out influenza, specificities are generally high (>90%) for all tests compared with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the typical sensitivity of a rapid test performed in a clinician’s office is 50% to 70%, clinicians may wish to confirm negative rapid tests with molecular assays during peak community influenza activity, and some FDA-cleared rapid tests are CLIA-waived while most rapid influenza molecular assays are CLIA-waived depending on complexity.

### Optimization of primer sets and detection protocols for SARS-CoV-2 of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using PCR and real-time PCR [^f9c91f3e]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is the viral strain that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whose major symptoms include severe pneumonia in humans. In addition to pneumonia, other symptoms include high fever, dry cough, fatigue, and frequent pain in the digestive system. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As of April 11, 2020, COVID-19 affects 210 countries, and the estimated case number has reached 1,700,000 people, with a death toll of over 100,000 people, while the number of recovered patients is approximately 382,000 people. Due to the spread of the pandemic, there is a desperate need for the development of diagnostic and treatment tools for COVID-19. Various SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits are already available from many companies and national health agencies. Most of these kits are based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) technology. However, publicly available information on these diagnostic kits is lacking.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^11f64463]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing—rapid versus standard NAATs in symptomatic individuals: The panel suggests using either rapid or standard laboratory-based NAATs in symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Remarks state that definitions of rapid NAATs have varied, with some, including the U.S. FDA, using turnaround times less than or equal to 30 minutes and others less than or equal to 60 minutes or longer; for this guideline, rapid testing was defined as a turnaround time of 60 minutes or less, which is for testing only (inclusive of nucleic acid extraction) and does not include time between specimen collection and testing or time between testing and reporting. Rapid tests typically have few operator steps and may be amendable to testing near patients or at the point-of-care performed by non-laboratory staff, and methodologies include rapid reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid isothermal NAAT. Appropriate specimen collection and transport are critical, and resources are available on the IDSA website.

### Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction: a potential tool for genetic analysis in neuropathology [^9cafc300]. Brain Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Since its introduction in the early- to mid-1980s, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been modified and optimized for an increasing number of applications. Early on, the focus was on the amplification of a specific nucleic acid template into quantities amenable to identification and experimental manipulation. While this remains an important application, recent technology has allowed the use of PCR to accurately quantitate the amount of a specific nucleic acid template present in a complex sample. Rather than simply analyzing the final product amount following the course of sequential cycles of amplification, quantitative PCR allows one to measure the accumulation of PCR product during the course of the reaction ("real-time PCR"). Under the appropriate conditions the number of PCR cycles required for the accumulation of a specific amount of product (during the exponential phase of the reaction) is a reflection of the relative amount of nucleic acid template present in the sample under analysis. Real-time quantitative PCR allows one to analyze a relatively large number of samples in a short period of time, potentially allowing multiple markers to be applied on a sample within a time frame consistent with clinical settings. In this overview, we will highlight the uses of real-time quantitative PCR as a potential diagnostic tool in neuropathology, focusing on the analysis of CNS tumors.

### Sensitivity of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 through time [^8b0e67f8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We find that RT-PCR testing remains a sensitive technique for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection and has proven to be an effective tool in New Zealand’s border measures and test-trace-isolate-quarantine approach to COVID-19 prevention and control. However, RT-PCR has its limitations and a negative test result does not rule out the possibility of infection with SARS-CoV-2, particularly for tests conducted in the early days after infection and before onset of symptoms. If clinical suspicion remains high, or if accuracy is important for case management or disease control, then it may be advisable to keep precautionary measures in place and conduct further testing.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^d0fec573]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—Recommendation 4 states: The IDSA panel suggests using either rapid or standard laboratory-based NAATs in symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Appropriate specimen collection and transport to the laboratory or testing site are critical to ensuring high-quality results, and definitions of rapid NAATs vary, with some considering turnaround times less than or equal to 30 minutes and others using less than or equal to 60-minutes or even longer; this time is for testing only (inclusive of nucleic acid extraction) and does not include time between specimen collection and testing or time between testing and reporting. Rapid molecular test methodologies include rapid reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid isothermal NAAT, while standard tests require instrumentation and/or processing that must typically be performed in a clinical laboratory by trained laboratory staff. This recommendation applies only to tests evaluated in the included studies, and one test, Abbott IDNow, was included in most of the studies and may have skewed results towards lower sensitivity; variability of test performance with different specimen-types may be important, evaluated assays used diverse technologies that may theoretically impact results, and limited data were available for immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or those infected with contemporary variants.

### Epstein-Barr virus in the multiple sclerosis brain: a controversial issue – report on a focused workshop held in the centre for brain research of the medical university of vienna, Austria [^f858b518]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

Polymerase chain reaction-based evidence

Several groups have attempted to identify EBV infection in the multiple sclerosis brain by polymerase chain reaction methodology. Summarizing the experience of all laboratories, there is good agreement that with polymerase chain reaction technology it is easily possible to detect infection in EBV + tumour control tissue or in lymphoblastoid cell lines. However, EBV infection in whole multiple sclerosis brain sections or single cells isolated from the CSF was very rarely detected (;;;). A positive result was obtained only by using pre-amplification polymerase chain reaction techniques (;) and/or by selectively isolating regions with dense B cell infiltrates using laser capture microdissection.

performed real-time polymerase chain reaction for the detection of genomic EBV as well as real-time polymerase chain reaction for the abundant EBV-encoded RNA. A first set of 17 brain samples from five cases with multiple sclerosis, which contained white matter lesions, were completely negative with both techniques despite a robust signal for CD20 messenger RNA and the presence of CD20 + B cells, confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In a second set, the investigation focused on 12 tissue samples, three of which contained B cell aggregates in the brain parenchyma and four of which contained a loose B cell infiltrate in the meninges. EBV RNA was seen in two out of 12 cases and one of these also contained EBV DNA. The conclusion was that, if present at all, only very few EBV + cells were contained in the samples. Similarly, a negative result was obtained with real-time polymerase chain reaction byfor EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1 and LMP2 messenger RNA.anddid not detect EBER1 transcripts in single B lymphocytes and plasma cells derived from multiple sclerosis CSF, nor EBV-specific transcripts (EBER1, EBNA2, LMP1 and BFRF-1) in 15 multiple sclerosis lesions from 14 patients, five of them being reported previously byto have a high load of EBV-infected B cells. However, in a second studyevaluated an additional group of paraffin-embedded multiple sclerosis plaques and positive and negative control lymphoma tissue pre-screened for EBV DNA by nested real-time polymerase chain reaction and confirmed the presence of EBV in rare multiple sclerosis tissue samples. In contrast to EBV + lymphoma tissue, EBER1-positive multiple sclerosis plaque contained no additional EBV-specific transcripts such as EBNA2, LMP1 and BFRF-1, consistent with latency stage 0 of EBV infection. In a recent report,were unable to detect LMP2A and EBNA1 transcripts by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in multiple sclerosis whole brain sections. However, selective pre-amplification of complementary DNAs allowed detection of a low polymerase chain reaction signal for LMP2A and EBNA1 in two and three of four brain samples, respectively. Moreover, these authors showed high levels of transcripts for LMP2A and EBNA1 relative to the house-keeping gene GAPDH and to the B cell-associated gene CD19 in all inflammatory cell infiltrates that were isolated from the meninges and white matter lesions (both active and chronic active) with laser capture microdissection. According to, these results are consistent with the observation that, even in the most infiltrated multiple sclerosis brain samples, total and EBV-infected B cells represent only a very minor proportion of the total population of CNS resident and inflammatory cells and are highly concentrated in very tiny areas, like the perivascular spaces of post-capillary venules and the leptomeningeal space. Besides aspects related to B cell frequency and localization, the possibility that the levels of viral transcripts in EBV-infected B cells surviving in a chronically inflamed environment are much lower than in EBV + tumour cells could help explain why selection of B cell-enriched areas and increased polymerase chain reaction sensitivity are so crucial for successful detection of EBV in the multiple sclerosis brain.

### Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-associated coronavirus [^6478d801]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

A real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed to rapidly detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The assay, based on multiple primer and probe sets located in different regions of the SARS-CoV genome, could discriminate SARS-CoV from other human and animal coronaviruses with a potential detection limit of <10 genomic copies per reaction. The real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay or culture isolation and proved suitable to detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens. Application of this assay will aid in diagnosing SARS-CoV infection.

HIV DNA PCR and related assays—infant diagnostic performance and early detection: The specificity of the HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is 99.8% at birth and 100% at age 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. HIV DNA PCR assays identify 20% to 55% of infants with HIV infection from birth through the first week of life, increasing to >90% by age 2 weeks to 4 weeks and to 100% at age 3 months and 6 months. Among 47 infants with HIV infection who had negative DNA PCR test results at birth, 68% were identified during neonatal antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis at 4 to 6 weeks; by 3 months, all 47 infants were identified. In a Cape Town study, HIV DNA assays were evaluated within 8 days of life during and after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART); in seven infants who achieved virologic suppression (defined as a continuous downward trend in plasma HIV RNA, with <100 copies/mL after 6 months), total HIV DNA continued to decay over 12 months, with undetectable HIV DNA after 6 days on treatment in one infant, at 3 months in another, and after 4 months in a third, suggesting that rapid decline of HIV-1 RNA and DNA may complicate definitive diagnosis.

### Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR using different sample sources: review of the literature [^5496e4aa]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since its outbreak in China in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulting from primary infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global concern leading to more than 7 145 500 confirmed diagnoses and more than 408 000 deaths all over the world (data as of June 10, 2020),with a rapid evolution of the epidemiological profile over time.

Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on either nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or oropharyngeal swabs (OPS).Despite suboptimal detection rates,collection of secretions from the upper airway by means of NPS/OPS still represents the first-line diagnostic modality to test patients and otherwise asymptomatic population for COVID-19, provided that it is early and adequately performed after onset of symptoms.As a fact, reduced detection rates reflect analytical sensitivity of RT-PCR test and the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19, given that a false negative RT-PCR result could be possibly obtained both in the initial phase of the disease (ie, a few days before symptom onset) and at the “tail end” of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ie, from 20 days after symptom onset) due to a low viral load and a viral shedding below analytical RT-PCR sensitivity threshold.

### Optimization of primer sets and detection protocols for SARS-CoV-2 of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using PCR and real-time PCR [^66ffada0]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, our study provides the first guideline for SARS-CoV-2 detection protocols. In addition, we have fully disclosed the optimized primer sets targeting the four essential genes of SARS-CoV-2. In combination with the information available from our previous study, anyone with basic knowledge of biology should be able to develop an easy-access, low-cost, fast, flexible, and high-accuracy detection kit for SARS-CoV-2. We hope that our efforts will be helpful for establishing a large-scale, high-fidelity screening approach for asymptomatic people for the further prevention of transmission and early intervention and treatment for rapidly propagating COVID-19.

### Highly sensitive detection and localization of maternally acquired human cytomegalovirus in placental tissue by in situ polymerase chain reaction [^b8fc0818]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Transplacental transmission of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can result in congenital malformations, although details on the mechanisms of transmission and the location of CMV in infected placentae need to be described.METHODS. Placental tissue from term (third trimester) deliveries was screened for CMV infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ PCR (IS-PCR), and IS reverse-transcriptase PCR (IS RT-PCR).RESULTS. CMV DNA was detected in tissue samples from 11 placentae that had been determined to be negative for CMV during routine pathological examination. IS-PCR demonstrated the presence of CMV DNA in all cell types within placental villi, and IS RT-PCR further defined this result by identifying viral transcripts from all stages of replication. CMV DNA and RNA were shown to be highly concentrated in placental trophoblast cells. The infecting viruses were detected with primers specific for the major immediate early section of the genome (UL122/123), the UL21.5 virion gene, and the glycoprotein B (gB) gene and were determined to be predominantly genotype gB2. Therefore, maternal and fetal host factors, as well as viral load and possibly viral genotype, may all affect the outcome of placental CMV infection.CONCLUSION. Placental villi are involved in the transfer of blood from maternal to fetal circulation. Infection and replication of CMV within placental trophoblasts suggests that these structures may be involved in the transmission of CMV.

The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Multiplex infectious disease PCR (polymerase chain reaction) panel implementation—advantages, logistics, and limitations—is characterized by the following: highly multiplexed syndromic panels are more complicated to develop than single-target assays and increasing targets in a single reaction may result in a loss of sensitivity; multiple primer pairs may increase mispairing with nonspecific amplification and primer dimers, and differing reaction components and temperature cycling across targets make it difficult to find a single optimal condition set; early use showed PCR to be at least as, if not more, sensitive than culture- and non–culture-based methods and, in many instances, PCR has displaced culture as the gold standard; newer panels permit near-patient testing and provide results in <30 minutes, enabling CLIA-waived point-of-care use by nonlaboratory personnel so physicians can administer targeted therapy during the initial visit, reducing the need for follow-up or avoiding unnecessary antibiotics; limitations include that multiplex PCR detects nucleic acid from both living and dead organisms, complicating identification of the relevant pathogen in polymicrobic samples, differentiation between active and resolving infection, or serving as a test of cure, and the presence of S. pneumoniae in the nares or oropharynx of a patient with pneumonia may represent colonization rather than the cause of infection.

Polymerase chain reaction

PCR primers (DelF-TGAGTTCACTACATGATGAGAGATAA and DelR-TCCAGTAGTCTCGCTTAAAAATTG) were designed from the deletion end points identified by oligonucleotide microarray analysis (fig 3A). Primers (DupF- GGCCAGCATATTTCTCCAAA and DupR-AAATCTGGCC GAAGTTCTGA) were designed from the duplication end points identified by oligonucleotide microarray analysis (fig 3B). PCR was performed on sample DNAs and on a control DNA sample known to be absent for the mutations. All PCR reactions were performed in a 50 μl mixture containing 50 ng DNA, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1 μM of each primer, 1.25 UHotMaster Taq polymerase, and 1XHotMaster buffer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA). Cycling was: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 68°C for 10 min. PCR reactions were analysed with an HDA-GT12 Genetic Analyzer (eGene Inc, Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA); products only amplified from individuals with the specific copy number change were analysed (fig 2C,D). PCR products were sequenced to determine the exact end points of the mutation.

### Microbiological laboratory testing in the diagnosis of fungal infections in pulmonary and critical care practice. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^c3a79948]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline—Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for suspected Aspergillus infection in severely immunocompromised patients is described as follows: PCR‑based detection of Aspergillus spp. has been proposed as a novel means to diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis; PCR‑based strategies allow detection of very low copy number of target DNA, oligonucleotide primers confer high specificity, and quantitative real‑time PCR facilitates quantification of pathogen burden and establishment of threshold values to define infections; several groups have investigated blood‑ and BAL‑based samples, but tests vary in extraction methods, primers, probes, gene targets, and platforms; therefore, no particular PCR‑based strategy is currently recommended for clinical diagnosis of suspected IPA.

Fetal blood type determination via amniocentesis polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—accuracy and follow-up: Amniocentesis is the primary modality used to determine fetal blood type using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on uncultured amniocytes in 2 mL of amniotic fluid, with sensitivity and specificity reported as 98.7% and 100%, respectively, and positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 96.9%. Chorionic villus biopsy has been employed for this purpose, but its use should be discouraged because of the risk of unnecessary fetomaternal hemorrhage and worsening alloimmunization. If the fetus is negative for the erythrocyte antigen in question, further testing may not be warranted; however, although the false-negative rate is low (1–3%), periodic noninvasive assessment may be warranted. Detection of fetal D by molecular analysis of maternal plasma or serum in the second trimester has greater than 99% accuracy, but this is not a widely used clinical tool.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—evidence for testing asymptomatic individuals with known exposures notes that no direct evidence comparing testing versus no testing was found, so diagnostic accuracy data were used with a composite reference standard of more than two standard NAATs (i.e., rapid RT-PCR and laboratory-based NAAT); across five studies with 349 positive and 530 negative individuals, pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI: 93 to 99) and pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 96 to 100). Considering prevalences of 1%, 5%, and 10% in asymptomatic individuals with known exposures, there were no predicted false-positive and 0 to 3 predicted false-negative results per 1,000 individuals, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate due to down rating for indirectness.

Cytomegalovirus diagnosis—congenital and acquired delineates that to diagnose congenital CMV infection, the gold standard remains a positive viral culture from saliva or urine within the first 21 days of life, and beyond this age, positive cultures can be due to postnatally acquired CMV infection; other methodologies to diagnose congenital CMV infection (blood or saliva PCR) have been investigated but do not yet replace culture as a recommended diagnostic standard. For clinically suspected acquired CMV disease, culture, antigenemia, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to provide supportive laboratory evidence, but these tests may be positive in the absence of clinical disease and therefore do not themselves constitute a diagnosis of CMV disease in the absence of clinical findings, and localized CMV disease (e.g., gastrointestinal disease) may not manifest with positive blood tests and laboratory diagnosis may require direct sampling of the involved organ for CMV testing.

### Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-associated coronavirus [^37d98685]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed to rapidly detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The assay, based on multiple primer and probe sets located in different regions of the SARS-CoV genome, could discriminate SARS-CoV from other human and animal coronaviruses with a potential detection limit of <10 genomic copies per reaction. The real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR assay or culture isolation and proved suitable to detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens. Application of this assay will aid in diagnosing SARS-CoV infection.

### Laboratory-based molecular test alternatives to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^6862cadd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing people with a SARS-CoV-2 infection played a critical role in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a priority for the transition to long-term management of COVID-19. Initial shortages of extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reagents impaired the desired upscaling of testing in many countries, which led to the search for alternatives to RNA extraction/purification and RT-PCR testing. Reference standard methods for diagnosing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection rely primarily on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Alternatives to RT-PCR could, if sufficiently accurate, have a positive impact by expanding the range of diagnostic tools available for the timely identification of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, access to testing and the use of resources.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of alternative (to RT-PCR assays) laboratory-based molecular tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Search Methods

We searched the COVID-19 Open Access Project living evidence database from the University of Bern until 30 September 2020 and the WHO COVID-19 Research Database until 31 October 2022. We did not apply language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included studies of people with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection, and studies evaluating commercially developed laboratory-based molecular tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection considered as alternatives to RT-PCR testing. We also included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR tests and established clinical diagnostic criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened studies and resolved disagreements by discussing them with a third author. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We presented sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test using paired forest plots and summarised results using average sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. We illustrated the findings per index test category and assay brand compared to the WHO's acceptable sensitivity and specificity threshold for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection using nucleic acid tests.

Main Results

We included data from 64 studies reporting 94 cohorts of participants and 105 index test evaluations, with 74,753 samples and 7517 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. We did not identify any published or preprint reports of accuracy for a considerable number of commercially produced NAAT assays. Most cohorts were judged at unclear or high risk of bias in more than three QUADAS-2 domains. Around half of the cohorts were considered at high risk of selection bias because of recruitment based on COVID status. Three quarters of 94 cohorts were at high risk of bias in the reference standard domain because of reliance on a single RT-PCR result to determine the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or were at unclear risk of bias due to a lack of clarity about the time interval between the index test assessment and the reference standard, the number of missing results, or the absence of a participant flow diagram. For index tests categories with four or more evaluations and when summary estimations were possible, we found that: a) For RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification, the average sensitivity was 95.1% (95% CI 91.1% to 97.3%), and the average specificity was 99.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.9%; based on 27 evaluations, 2834 samples and 1178 SARS-CoV-2 cases); b) For RT-LAMP assays, the average sensitivity was 88.4% (95% CI 83.1% to 92.2%), and the average specificity was 99.7% (95% CI 98.7% to 99.9%; 24 evaluations, 29,496 samples and 2255 SARS-CoV-2 cases); c) for TMA assays, the average sensitivity was 97.6% (95% CI 95.2% to 98.8%), and the average specificity was 99.4% (95% CI 94.9% to 99.9%; 14 evaluations, 2196 samples and 942 SARS-CoV-2 cases); d) for digital PCR assays, the average sensitivity was 98.5% (95% CI 95.2% to 99.5%), and the average specificity was 91.4% (95% CI 60.4% to 98.7%; five evaluations, 703 samples and 354 SARS-CoV-2 cases); e) for RT-LAMP assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction, the average sensitivity was 73.1% (95% CI 58.4% to 84%), and the average specificity was 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%; 24 evaluations, 14,342 samples and 1502 SARS-CoV-2 cases). Only two index test categories fulfil the WHO-acceptable sensitivity and specificity requirements for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. In addition, WHO-acceptable performance criteria were met for two assays out of 35 when tests were used according to manufacturer instructions. At 5% prevalence using a cohort of 1000 people suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays omitting/adapting RNA extraction/purification will be 94%, with three in 51 positive results being false positives, and around two missed cases. For TMA assays, the positive predictive value of RT-PCR assays will be 89%, with 6 in 55 positive results being false positives, and around one missed case.

Authors' Conclusions

Alternative laboratory-based molecular tests aim to enhance testing capacity in different ways, such as reducing the time, steps and resources needed to obtain valid results. Several index test technologies with these potential advantages have not been evaluated or have been assessed by only a few studies of limited methodological quality, so the performance of these kits was undetermined. Only two index test categories with enough evaluations for meta-analysis fulfil the WHO set of acceptable accuracy standards for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests: RT-PCR assays designed to omit/adapt RNA extraction/purification and TMA assays. These assays might prove to be suitable alternatives to RT-PCR for identifying people infected by SARS-CoV-2, especially when the alternative would be not having access to testing. However, these findings need to be interpreted and used with caution because of several limitations in the evidence, including reliance on retrospective samples without information about the symptom status of participants and the timing of assessment. No extrapolation of found accuracy data for these two alternatives to any test brands using the same techniques can be made as, for both groups, one test brand with high accuracy was overrepresented with 21/26 and 12/14 included studies, respectively. Although we used a comprehensive search and had broad eligibility criteria to include a wide range of tests that could be alternatives to RT-PCR methods, further research is needed to assess the performance of alternative COVID-19 tests and their role in pandemic management.

### At what times during infection is SARS-CoV-2 detectable and no longer detectable using RT-PCR-based tests? A systematic review of individual participant data [^ac568ec7]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond 10 days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites. The included studies are open to substantial risk of bias, so the positivity rates are probably overestimated.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^52f99ecf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline—abstract states that accurate molecular diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are necessary to confirm coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in respiratory specimens informs decision-making at patient, healthcare institution, and public health levels. The guideline’s goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests, with IDSA convening a multidisciplinary panel and using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations, and access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is described as critical for patient care and hospital infection prevention.

### Can broad-range 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene polymerase chain reactions improve the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^86c9d792]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We aim to evaluate the accuracy of the broad-range 16S polymerase chain reaction test in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, using the Medical Subject Headings terms "polymerase chain reaction," "RNA, ribosomal, 16S," and "bacterial meningitis." For our primary analysis, we examined the 16S polymerase chain reaction in culture-proven bacterial meningitis. In ancillary observations, we included studies of culture-negative presumed bacterial meningitis, in which there was high clinical suspicion for bacterial meningitis despite negative cerebrospinal fluid culture results. We extracted information necessary to calculate sensitivity and specificity and used bivariate hierarchic modeling meta-analysis methods to obtain pooled statistics. We also estimated potential sources of error and bias such as between-study heterogeneity and publication bias.

Results

Fourteen of 299 studies met inclusion criteria for culture-proven bacterial meningitis; 448 (16.1%) of 2,780 subjects had positive cerebrospinal fluid culture results. Pooled analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 92% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75% to 98%), specificity of 94% (95% CI 90% to 97%), positive likelihood ratio of 16.26 (95% CI 9.07 to 29.14), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.09 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.28) for culture-proven bacterial meningitis. The polymerase chain reaction test result was also positive in 30% of cases of culture-negative presumed bacterial meningitis. There was significant heterogeneity between studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis supports the role of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid polymerase chain reaction as a diagnostic tool in bacterial meningitis. With further refinements in technology, the polymerase chain reaction test has the potential to become a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in the emergency department.

Exploratory Clinical Efficacy Results

An exploratory efficacy objective of Cohort B was to evaluate clinical efficacy of PEMGARDA compared to placebo in the prevention of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in randomized participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline and without moderate-to-severe immune compromise. Table 3 provides the results for the Cohort B exploratory clinical efficacy endpoint. Most infection events occurred during a period of time when JN.1 and variants with similar susceptibilities were dominant. No deaths or COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurred in either treatment arm of Cohort B through Month 6. PEMGARDA is not authorized for use in individuals who do not have moderate-to-severe immune compromise.

### Prevalence of xenotropic murine leukaemia virus-related virus in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in the Netherlands: retrospective analysis of samples from an established cohort [^953cebcb]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Our negative XMRV polymerase chain reaction results were unlikely to be due to low amounts of nucleic acid tested or low sensitivity of the assays used. We used 50-300 ng of total nucleic acid from peripheral blood mononuclear cells per polymerase chain reaction, which is similar to the amount used by Lombardi et al.Moreover, by adding 10-fold serial dilutions of a defined amount of template DNA to peripheral blood mononuclear cells before nucleic acid isolation, we demonstrated that both the real time polymerase chain reaction assay (fig 1C) and the nested polymerase chain reaction assay (fig 2B) could detect at least 10 copies of XMRV per 10 5 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating a high sensitivity. A similar sensitivity of the nested polymerase chain reaction assay was observed when we used the same primers as described by Urisman et al (inner reverse primer GAG-I-R instead of the inner reverse primer GAG-I-R2 used in our assay) (data not shown).

Our negative XMRV polymerase chain reaction results are also unlikely to be due to problems with nucleic acid isolation, loss of RNA or DNA integrity, synthesis of copy DNA, or the polymerase chain reaction procedure, since both the phocine distemper virus RNA (an internal control of which a fixed amount was added to each of the samples before nucleic acid isolation) and the β-globin gene were efficiently amplified in all samples tested (data not shown).

### Venetoclax (Venclexta) [^3179f6b0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated using allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR). The definition of negative status was less than one CLL cell per 104leukocytes. Rates of MRD negativity 3 months after the completion of treatment regardless of response and in patients who achieved CR are shown in Table 20 . At this assessment, 134 patients in the VEN+G arm who were MRD negative in peripheral blood had matched bone marrow specimens; of these, 122 patients (91%) were MRD negative in both peripheral blood and bone marrow.

Twelve months after the completion of treatment, MRD negativity rates in peripheral blood were 58% (126/216) in patients treated with VEN+G and 9% (20/216) in patients treated with GClb.

In Combination with Rituximab

MURANO was a randomized (1:1), multicenter, open-label trial (NCT02005471) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (VEN+R) versus bendamustine in combination with rituximab (B+R) in patients with CLL who had received at least one line of prior therapy. Patients in the VEN+R arm completed the VENCLEXTA 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)] and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Rituximab was initiated after the 5-week dose ramp-up at a dose of 375 mg/m2intravenously on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m2intravenously on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. Patients randomized to B+R received bendamustine 70 mg/m2intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for 6 cycles in combination with rituximab at the above described dose and schedule. Each cycle was 28 days.

### Performance evaluation of a new rapid urine test for Chlamydia in men: prospective cohort study [^b2e42e11]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Testing with polymerase chain reaction and transcription mediated amplification

The performance of the Chlamydia Rapid Test was assessed to meet the requirements for Conformité Européenne licensure, which stipulate that the comparator test should be a “state of the art” assay and should be performed with specimens approved for the test. Polymerase chain reaction testing for chlamydia, which is licensed for urine specimens, was chosen as the ideal standard test for the study. The Roche Amplicor CT/NG polymerase chain reaction assay has undergone comprehensive evaluations with male urine samples and is similar in reliability to other nucleic acid amplification methods for detection of C trachomatis in urine.

Urine specimens were sent to a laboratory accredited by the Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) for C trachomatis testing with the Amplicor CT/NG polymerase chain reaction assay according to manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ). Samples that yielded discordant results with the Chlamydia Rapid Test and the polymerase chain reaction assay were tested with the mono-specific Aptima CT kit, a transcription mediated amplification assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions at the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory (Health Protection Agency, Colindale). In addition, 100 randomly selected specimens negative with polymerase chain reaction and 20 concordant positive samples were masked and tested by this latter assay to minimise potential bias introduced by testing discordant samples only.

Quantification of organism load

Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed as described previouslybut with modifications.A portion (500 µl) of the FirstBurst urine sample from men with positive results with polymerase chain reaction was centrifuged at 17 860 g for 15 minutes at 25°C and the resulting pellet processed as described previously.A 20 µl portion of each DNA extract was used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Estimation of organism load was determined from a reference curve constructed with a calibrated plasmid pCTL12A preparation (provided by I Clarke).

Statistical analysis

Standard statistical methods were used to analyse data with SAS V9.1 software (SAS, Cary, NC). A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

### The use of real-time polymerase chain reaction for rapid diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis [^161cf6f7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction on a specimen from an osteolytic lesion of a femoral condyle, in which the frozen section demonstrated granulomas. The process was much more rapid than is possible with culture. The rapid detection of M tuberculosis and the concomitant exclusion of granulomatous disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria or systemic fungi are necessary to appropriately treat skeletal tuberculosis. The detection and identification of M tuberculosis by culture may require several weeks using traditional methods. The real-time polymerase chain reaction method used has been shown to be rapid and reliable, and is able to detect and differentiate both tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Real-time polymerase chain reaction may become a diagnostic standard for the evaluation of clinical specimens for the presence of mycobacteria; this case demonstrates the potential utility of this assay for the rapid diagnosis of skeletal tuberculosis.

### Engineered helicase replaces thermocycler in DNA amplification while retaining desired PCR characteristics [^3ef20cfb]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an essential method in molecular diagnostics and life sciences. PCR requires thermal cycling for heating the DNA for strand separation and cooling it for replication. The process uses a specialized hardware and exposes biomolecules to temperatures above 95 °C. Here, we engineer a PcrA M6 helicase with enhanced speed and processivity to replace the heating step by enzymatic DNA unwinding while retaining desired PCR characteristics. We name this isothermal amplification method SHARP (SSB-Helicase Assisted Rapid PCR) because it uses the engineered helicase and single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) in addition to standard PCR reagents. SHARP can generate amplicons with lengths of up to 6000 base pairs. SHARP can produce functional DNA, a plasmid that imparts cells with antibiotic resistance, and can amplify specific fragments from genomic DNA of human cells. We further use SHARP to assess the outcome of CRISPR-Cas9 editing at endogenous genomic sites.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in patients (i.e., those with at least one common symptom of COVID-19) had predicted false negative results ranging from 2 to 20 and false positive results from 5 to 9 per 1000 patients tested across considered prevalences; the pooled sensitivity of the rapid tests was 96%, and all rapid molecular tests had very high specificities. Positive results from rapid NAATs do not usually need to be confirmed by standard laboratory-based NAATs, and negative rapid molecular test results do not need routine confirmation. The certainty of the evidence was moderate due to risk of bias with the use of laboratory-based NAAT as the reference standard, and with some inconsistency of sensitivity results for some assays.

### Sensitive and specific measurement of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^c24b8a51]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2009). Low credibility.

A sensitive and specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method, involving three rounds of amplification with two allele-specific oligonucleotide primers directed against an rearrangement, was developed to quantify minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For a single sample containing 10 microg of good quality DNA, MRD was quantifiable down to approximately 10(-6), which is at least 1 log more sensitive than current methods. Nonspecific amplification was rarely observed. The standard deviation of laboratory estimations was 0.32 log units at moderate or high levels of MRD, but increased markedly as the level of MRD and the number of intact marker gene rearrangements in the sample fell. In 23 children with ALL studied after induction therapy, the mean MRD level was 1.6 x 10(-5) and levels ranged from 1.5 x 10(-2) to less than 10(-7). Comparisons with the conventional one-round quantitative polymerase chain reaction method on 29 samples from another 24 children who received treatment resulted in concordant results for 22 samples and discordant results for seven samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the method are due to the use of nested polymerase chain reaction, one segment-specific and two allele-specific oligonucleotide primers, and the use of a large amount of good quality DNA. This method may improve MRD-based decisions on treatment for ALL patients, and the principles should be applicable to DNA-based MRD measurements in other disorders.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)

The current first choice for the etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on detection of unique sequences of virus RNA by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).The PCR test is appropriate for the acute phase of illness; however, cases of missed diagnoses have already been reported using this method. Recently, related research shows that the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel rRT-PCR test is highly sensitive and specific, which might help to reduce the false-negative rate and would be significantly useful for detecting specimens with low viral loads.Thus, in terms of technical and financial support, the current rRT-PCR testing available is relatively optimal for SARS-CoV-2 screening of suspected cases.

### Engineered helicase replaces thermocycler in DNA amplification while retaining desired PCR characteristics [^8364b9a4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Nucleic acids amplification is an essential method involved in rapid molecular diagnostics, gene manipulations, and genetic analyses, including the detection of bacteria, viruses, and diagnosis of genetic disorders. The most widely used method for DNA amplification is Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), implemented through thermal cycling. Promising next-generation methods include enzymatic isothermal amplification; however, existing isothermal methods are limited to producing only short amplicons, or complex heterogeneous mixed and branched products, and often require multiple sets of complicated pairs of primers,. As a result, to the best of our knowledge, no existing isothermal method can approach the versatility of thermocycler-based PCR.

There are more than 10 different approaches for isothermal amplification – which differ in how they initiate each reaction cycle and allow primers to bind the template. PCR heat denatures the DNA duplex and subsequently cools it down to initiate each replication cycle (Fig. 1a), while isothermal methods either use specially designed primers or other assisting proteins to enable primer binding to the template. LAMP (Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) uses 4 to 6 loop-forming primers to generate 3′ ends that are extendable by Bst DNA polymerase (DNAP). LAMP is a rapid, commercially available, and highly sensitive exponential amplification method. However, LAMP products are highly complex, hard to interpret, compare, and use in applications such as cloning, gene manipulation, and sequencing. Furthermore, LAMP primer design requires specialized software, and primers optimized for PCR cannot be used as LAMP primers. Isothermal amplification methods based on gp32, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, uses a set of two primers and can produce over 1 kilo base-pair (bp) amplicons; however, the template is amplified only a few times, far from the exponential growth in PCR, and the product also contains high molecular-weight multimers and other undesired bands. RPA (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification) uses two primers and a recombinase,. RPA primers are sometimes longer than PCR primers, 30 to 38 bases, which is necessary for recombinase binding. The recombinase-primer complex then searches for homologous template sequence resulting in strand invasion and primer-template pairing, followed by polymerase extension. RPA provides exponential amplification and a competitive detection limit, but it can produce only short amplicons, 100 to 200 bp in length. Longer primers used by RPA are more prone to forming secondary structure and nonspecific product, requiring more careful primer design, or unnatural bases. SIBA (Strand Invasion-Based Amplification) also uses a recombinase, UvsX, but it reduces the possibility of the undesired product formation by using an invasion oligonucleotide in addition to primers, but still generates only short amplicons. SDA (Strand Displacement Amplification)and NEAR (Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction)are similar methods that use a nicking enzyme to assist the amplification initiation. Both methods provide exponential amplification, but the product is also only several hundred base pairs long. Both methods use a set of 4 primers, with additional sequence requirements for the nicking enzyme.

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics—definitions and operational considerations—note that appropriate specimen collection and transport to the laboratory or testing site are critical to ensure quality results; definitions of rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) vary, with some, including the U.S. FDA, using turnaround times less than or equal to 30 minutes while others use less than or equal to 60 minutes or longer. This time is for testing only (inclusive of nucleic acid extraction) and does not include time between specimen collection and testing or between testing and reporting. Rapid tests typically have few operator steps and may be amenable to testing near patients or at the point-of-care by non-laboratory staff.

### Diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction of ocular posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder after pediatric renal transplantation [^8425052d]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction of intraocular posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in a pediatric renal transplant patient.

Design

Observational case report.

Methods

Retrospective review.

Results

An 11-year-old girl developed infectious mononucleosis 15 months after renal transplantation for focal segmental sclerosis. Papillitis and hypopyon uveitis developed 8 months later, followed by iris nodules. Diagnosis of intraocular posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was made by polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for Epstein-Barr virus and confirmed by histopathology of an iris biopsy specimen. Infiltrating iris lymphocytes in the biopsy specimen were positive for Epstein-Barr DNA. Polymerase chain reaction also revealed gene rearrangement of the variable region of the heavy immunoglobulin chain, consistent with a monoclonal B-lymphocyte population. Iris nodules resolved with reduction in immunosuppressive medication.

Conclusion

Polymerase chain reaction for Epstein-Barr virus may be helpful in diagnosis of intraocular posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

In the context of test evaluation, and throughout this review, we use the term 'reference standard' to denote the best available method (test or tests) for diagnosing the target condition, as opposed to other uses of the term in diagnostic virology (such as reference methods or reference materials).

### High-resolution methylation polymerase chain reaction for fragile X analysis: evidence for novel FMR1 methylation patterns undetected in Southern blot analyses [^1f975844]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats and subsequent methylation of the FMR1 gene. Molecular diagnosis of fragile X currently requires Southern blot analysis to assess methylation. This study describes the evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction-only workflow for the determination of methylation status across a broad range of FMR1 genotypes in male and female specimens.

Methods

We evaluated a novel method that combines allele-specific methylation polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis with eight cell line and 80 clinical samples, including 39 full mutations. Methylation status was determined using a three-step workflow: (1) differential treatment of genomic DNA using a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme; (2) polymerase chain reaction with two sets of dye-tagged primers; and (3) amplicon sizing by capillary electrophoresis. All samples were analyzed by both methylation polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis.

Results

FMR1 methylation status and CGG repeat sizing were accurately and reproducibly determined in a set of methylation controls and genomic DNA samples representing a spectrum of CGG repeat lengths and methylation states. Moreover, methylation polymerase chain reaction revealed allele-specific methylation patterns in premutation alleles that were unobtainable using Southern blot analysis.

Conclusions

Methylation polymerase chain reaction enabled high throughput, high resolution, and semiquantitative methylation assessments of FMR1 alleles, as well as determinations of CGG repeat length. Results for all samples were concordant with corresponding Southern blot analyses. As a result, this study presents a polymerase chain reaction-based method for comprehensive FMR1 analysis. In addition, the identification of novel methylation mosaic patterns revealed after polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis may be relevant to several FMR1 disorders.

Real‐Time Polymerase Chain Reaction

Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) was used to assess mRNA expression in human VSMCs. Briefly, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Qiagen), treated with RNase‐free DNAse I, and 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed in a reaction containing 100 μg/mL oligo‐dT, 10 mmol/L of 2′‐deoxynucleoside 5′‐triphosphate, 5×first‐Strand buffer, and 2 μL of 200‐U reverse transcriptase. For real‐time polymerase chain reaction amplification, 3 μL of each reverse transcription product were diluted in a reaction buffer containing 5 μL of SYBR Green polymerase chain reaction master mix and 300 nmol/L of primers in a final volume of 10 μL per sample. The reaction conditions consisted of 2 steps at 50 °C for 2 minutes and 95 °C for 2 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 3 steps, 15‐second denaturation at 95 °C, 60‐second annealing at 60 °C, and 15 seconds at 72 °C. Human primers used are detailed in Table S1. Data are expressed as target gene/GAPDH housekeeping gene. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2 ΔΔCt method.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) diagnosis in cutaneous and mucosal lesions—polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performance and alternatives: Speed and sensitivity of diagnosis are maximized with the shell vial method after 24 hours and detection of HSV DNA by PCR is very sensitive and specific and is the gold-standard method; DNA PCR may be especially useful when assessing recurrent or late-presenting skin lesions because HSV DNA remains in healing lesions and scabs even though HSV can no longer be cultured; in neonatal HSV disease, PCR of mucosal and cutaneous sites has not been evaluated systematically and culture remains the standard of care; direct immunofluorescence can be performed on scraped cells but the sensitivity of this method may be less than 75%, with results usually available the same day.

### DNA polymerases and human disease [^5debca96]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2008). Medium credibility.

The human genome encodes at least 14 DNA-dependent DNA polymerases--a surprisingly large number. These include the more abundant, high-fidelity enzymes that replicate the bulk of genomic DNA, together with eight or more specialized DNA polymerases that have been discovered in the past decade. Although the roles of the newly recognized polymerases are still being defined, one of their crucial functions is to allow synthesis past DNA damage that blocks replication-fork progression. We explore the reasons that might justify the need for so many DNA polymerases, describe their function and mode of regulation, and finally consider links between mutations in DNA polymerases and human disease.

### First detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in pleural fluid [^a3644c35]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infection due to the spread of a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), resulting in a wide range of clinical features, from asymptomatic carriers to ARDS. The gold standard for diagnosis is nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal swabs. However, due to limitations in this technique's sensitivity, thoracic imaging plays a crucial, complementary role in diagnostic evaluation and also allows for detection of atypical findings and potential alternative targets for sampling (eg, pleural effusion). Although less common, pleural involvement has been described in a minority of patients. This report describes the first case of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pleural fluid obtained by means of ultrasound-guided thoracentesis, and its main characteristics are detailed. Pleural effusion is not a common finding in COVID-19 infection, but a prompt recognition of this potential localization may be useful to optimize diagnostic evaluation as well as the management of these patients.

### Oligonucleotide subsets selection by single nucleotide resolution barcode identification [^c958c100]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Effective subset selection from complex oligonucleotide libraries is crucial for genomics, synthetic biology, and DNA data storage. The polymerase chain reaction, foundational for amplifying target subsets is limited by primer design and length for specificity, which constrains the scalability of oligo libraries and increases the synthesis burden for primers. We introduce an oligo subset selection methodology that utilizes sequence-specific cyclic nucleotide synthesis and blocking of the template oligos. This approach eliminates the need for primers for selective hybridization and enables the encoding and selection of hundreds of subsets with barcode lengths of fewer than five nucleotides. Moreover, cyclic selection enables a hierarchical data structure in the oligo library, enhancing the programmability. This advancement offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for handling complex oligo libraries.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) vasculitis—diagnosis and initial management: Stroke associated with CNS infection should be considered a life-threatening emergency and should be triaged accordingly. VZV vasculitis may present with large and small artery strokes with arterial luminal irregularities, beading, or stenosis, and suspected cases should undergo lumbar puncture for anti-VZV immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and polymerase chain reaction; anti-VZV immunoglobulin G has the highest sensitivity of the 3 tests, and a negative VZV polymerase chain reaction does not rule out VZV vasculitis. If suspicion is high, it may be reasonable to treat empirically while awaiting confirmatory tests, and acyclovir is the drug of choice for treatment of VZV infection.

Nested polymerase chain reaction assay

The XMRV gag nested polymerase chain reaction assay was adapted from Urisman et al.The reaction mixtures contained 25 µl of 2X PCR Master (Roche Diagnostics), and 200 nM of each primer in a reaction volume of 50 µl. In the first reaction, 5 µl of copy DNA was used. Subsequently, 5 µl of the first reaction was used as input for the nested reaction. Primers were as described, except for the reverse primer of the nested reaction (GAG-I-R), which was replaced by GAG-I-R2 to yield a 92 base pairs reaction product (we used primer GAG-I-R2 because it produced less background in the nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). The target sequence of GAG-I-R2 is 100% conserved among all XMRV isolates published to date (data not shown). Cycling conditions were as previously described.Polymerase chain reaction products (20 µl) were analysed on a 2.5% agarose gel.

To determine the sensitivity of our XMRV nested polymerase chain reaction assay, a 708 base pairs XMRV gag polymerase chain reaction product was generated using primers GAG-UNIQ-F described by Dong et al(which is located upstream of GAG-O-F) and GAG-O-R, and 22Rv1 copy DNA as a template. Purification and determination of the amount of the polymerase chain reaction product were performed as described above for the real time polymerase chain reaction calibrator. A dilution series was made and 10 1 to 10 7 copies of the calibrator were added to 10 6 peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to nucleic acid isolation. This corresponds to 1 to 10 6 per reaction since a tenth of the isolated nucleic acid was used as input for the nested polymerase chain reaction, which was performed as described above. In the same way, we tested the sensitivity of the nested polymerase chain reaction assay described by Urisman et alusing primer GAG-I-R instead of GAG-I-R2.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing—NAAT analytical and assay considerations note that this recommendation applies only to tests evaluated in the included studies, and that one test, Abbott IDNow, was included in most of the studies evaluated in this recommendation and may have skewed results towards lower sensitivity. Variability of test performance with different specimen-types may be important, and the evaluated assays used diverse technologies (e.g., isothermal and non-isothermal test amplification) that may theoretically impact results. Limited data were available regarding the analytical performance of NAATs in immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, in those who have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or in those infected with contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variants, and some assays require instrumentation and/or processing that must typically be performed in a clinical laboratory by trained laboratory staff.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for SARS‑CoV‑2—states that test turnaround time is not intrinsically linked to poor diagnostic test accuracy and that all rapid NAATs had very high specificities, minimizing false positives. Positive results from rapid NAATs do not need to be confirmed routinely by standard laboratory based NAATs, and with the pooled sensitivity of the rapid tests of 88%, especially RT‑PCR, negative rapid NAAT results do not need to be confirmed routinely by standard laboratory-based NAATs. Evidence limitations include limited data in children, potential impact of specific test, anatomic site, viral transport media use, and specimen quality on performance, and no studies directly comparing rapid isothermal NAAT and rapid RT‑PCR. Overall, the specificity of rapid and standard laboratory based NAATs is equivalent, and the sensitivity of rapid NAATs, especially RT‑PCR, and standard laboratory-based NAAT are similar.
