## Question

Which DOAC prevents varicose veins?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which direct oral anticoagulant prevents varicose veins. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question is about preventing the development of lower-extremity varicose veins versus preventing thrombotic complications related to varicose-vein disease or its procedures. Then, I should verify what major venous guidelines actually recommend for prevention and medical management of varicose veins. Next, I will review the established roles of DOACs in venous disease contexts that commonly coexist with varicose veins, such as superficial vein thrombosis and ablation-related thrombosis. Finally, I need to reconcile varicose vein pathophysiology with anticoagulant pharmacology to determine if any DOAC could plausibly prevent vein formation and conclude accordingly, anchoring this to SVS/AVF and ESVS guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities involved, because I need to ensure I am not conflating different vascular conditions. Varicose veins are a manifestation of chronic venous disease due to venous valve incompetence, vein wall remodeling, and ambulatory venous hypertension; they are not a thrombotic disorder per se, and their development is driven by genetic, hormonal, and biomechanical risk factors such as age, pregnancy, and prolonged standing, rather than coagulation activation [^notfound] [^115HBdjL]. DOACs, by contrast, are anticoagulants targeting factor Xa or thrombin to prevent and treat venous thromboembolism, which is mechanistically distinct from the structural valve and wall pathology of varicose veins, so I should be cautious about assuming any disease-modifying effect on varicose vein formation [^111AMGWg].

> Next, I should review what authoritative guidelines actually recommend for preventing or medically managing varicose veins, because that will clarify whether any DOAC has a role here. The ESVS 2022 and SVS/AVF/AVLS guidelines emphasize conservative measures such as compression therapy for symptom control and as an option when intervention is deferred, along with procedural treatments for reflux and tributary varicosities; they also discuss phlebotonics for symptom relief in selected patients, but they do not recommend DOACs to prevent the development of varicose veins, which is consistent with the nonthrombotic pathobiology of the condition [^117BRpjP] [^113YpVh8] [^116Hg5cC].

> Wait, let me verify whether DOACs are used anywhere in the varicose vein care pathway, because there could be confusion between preventing varicose veins and preventing thrombotic complications that occur in these patients. In fact, DOACs do appear in guidance for thrombotic problems linked to varicose disease: rivaroxaban 10 mg daily is an accepted alternative to fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily for 45 days in selected cases of superficial vein thrombosis above the knee, and DOACs are preferred over VKAs for ablation-related thrombus extension and for acute proximal DVT after varicose vein procedures [^112Ma4mC] [^112cLxtD] [^116RTxiv] [^116f896k]. At first glance, I almost thought that using rivaroxaban in superficial vein thrombosis might imply it can prevent varicose veins themselves, but hold on — that would be a mistake; these recommendations target thrombotic complications, not the primary prevention of varicose vein formation, and I should not conflate the two [^1174x9Hp].

> I should double-check the peri-procedural thromboprophylaxis evidence too, because pharmacologic prophylaxis is sometimes discussed alongside endovenous varicose procedures. Systematic reviews suggest that adding pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, including DOACs, can reduce postprocedural DVT and EHIT rates in selected settings, with low major bleeding signals, but this pertains to venous thromboembolism prevention around procedures, not to preventing the development of varicose veins or reversing their underlying structural disease [^115cZeiM] [^117YEgp9] [^1177KBWv].

> Let me think about biological plausibility, because I need to ensure my conclusion aligns with mechanism. Varicose veins arise from chronic venous reflux and wall/valve remodeling, not from intraluminal fibrin clot formation; anticoagulation does not restore valve competence or reverse the connective tissue and smooth muscle changes that characterize varicose veins, and current venous guidelines do not propose DOACs as disease-modifying agents for varicose vein genesis or progression, which reinforces that no DOAC prevents varicose veins from forming [^113YpVh8] [^115grmAQ]. Moreover, population data highlight nonmodifiable and mechanical drivers of varicose risk, underscoring why primary prevention is difficult and why anticoagulation is not a preventive strategy for varicose vein development [^115HBdjL].

> Hold on, I should verify there isn't a wording confusion with "variceal" hemorrhage in cirrhosis, since that sometimes gets mixed up with "varicose". If the question were about primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding, the recommendations are nonselective beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation — again, not DOACs — so DOACs would still not be the preventive therapy in that separate condition either [^1112i6th] [^1152wViT].

> Putting this together, I can conclude with confidence that none of the DOACs prevent varicose veins, because anticoagulation does not modify the venous wall and valve pathology that underlies varicose vein formation and no major guideline endorses DOACs for this purpose; DOACs are reserved for preventing and treating thrombotic complications such as SVT, EHIT, and DVT in appropriately selected scenarios, which is a different clinical goal entirely [^113YpVh8] [^1174x9Hp] [^112Ma4mC]. For patients seeking prevention or symptom control of varicose veins, guideline-supported options include compression therapy, lifestyle measures, and definitive treatments of reflux, with phlebotonics considered for symptomatic relief in select cases, none of which involve DOACs as primary prevention of varicose vein development [^117BRpjP] [^116Hg5cC] [^113YpVh8].

---

None of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) **prevent varicose veins** [^113YpVh8]. Varicose veins result from venous valve incompetence and structural vein wall changes — not thrombosis — so anticoagulation does not address the underlying pathology. DOACs are used to treat or prevent thrombotic complications (DVT, PE, SVT) in patients with varicose veins [^112xokAm] [^112Ma4mC], but they do not prevent varicose vein development or progression [^117BRpjP]. Prevention and management of varicose veins rely on **compression therapy, lifestyle changes, and procedural interventions**, not anticoagulation [^117BRpjP].

---

## Pathophysiology of varicose veins

Varicose veins **result from chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)**, characterized by [^113YpVh8]:

- **Venous valve incompetence**: Reflux and venous hypertension.

- **Vein wall remodeling**: Dilation and tortuosity.

- **Risk factors**: Age, female sex, pregnancy, obesity, prolonged standing, and family history [^115HBdjL].

The primary pathology is mechanical and structural — **not thrombotic** — so anticoagulation does not address the root cause [^113YpVh8].

---

## Role of anticoagulation in varicose veins

Anticoagulation is indicated in varicose vein patients **only when thrombotic complications occur**, such as [^111bivZB]:

- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: Acute or chronic [^112xokAm].

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Associated with DVT [^1111TYHe].

- **Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT)**: Especially when extensive or near the saphenofemoral junction [^1174x9Hp].

DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are effective for treating and preventing these complications; however, they **do not prevent varicose veins** [^117CffWw] [^112Ma4mC].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Current clinical guidelines and evidence clearly state that anticoagulation, including DOACs, **does not prevent varicose veins**:

- **AVF/AVLS/SVS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend DOACs for thrombotic complications (DVT, PE, SVT) in varicose vein patients, but not for preventing varicose veins [^112Ma4mC] [^112Dx2yP] [^111Ns9vn].

- **ESVS 2022 guidelines**: Emphasize anticoagulation for thrombotic events, not for preventing varicose veins [^113YpVh8].

- **SURPRISE trial**: Rivaroxaban was non-inferior to fondaparinux for preventing thromboembolic complications in SVT, but did not prevent varicose veins [^1174x9Hp].

---

## Alternative preventive strategies

Preventing varicose veins relies on mechanical support, lifestyle changes, and procedures tailored to disease severity. Compression therapy is the **primary conservative approach** to reduce symptoms and slow progression [^117BRpjP]. Lifestyle modifications — such as weight control, regular exercise, and avoiding prolonged standing — help address modifiable risks [^115HBdjL]. Endovenous ablation, sclerotherapy, or surgical ligation are used for symptomatic or advanced disease [^115CY7r4].

---

## Risks and limitations of anticoagulation

Using anticoagulation solely to prevent varicose veins is **inappropriate and risky** because it exposes patients to major and minor bleeding, particularly in those at higher bleeding risk [^112xokAm]. It offers no structural benefit because anticoagulation **does not improve valve function or vein wall integrity**, and it conflicts with evidence and guidelines, which do not support anticoagulation for primary prevention of varicose veins [^113YpVh8].

## Summary of evidence

| **Intervention** | **Effect on varicose veins** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) | - No prevention of varicose veins <br/> - Used for thrombotic complications | - AVF/AVLS/SVS 2024 guidelines [^112Dx2yP] <br/> - SURPRISE trial [^1174x9Hp] |
| Compression therapy | Reduces symptoms and slows progression | AVF/AVLS/SVS 2023 guidelines [^117BRpjP] |
| Lifestyle modifications | Reduces risk factors and progression | AVF/AVLS/SVS guidelines [^113YpVh8] |
| Procedural interventions | Treats existing varicose veins | AVF/AVLS/SVS guidelines [^115CY7r4] |

---

No DOAC **prevents varicose veins** because the disease is driven by valve incompetence and vein wall changes, not thrombosis. DOACs are for thrombotic complications — not for preventing varicose veins — and prevention relies on compression, lifestyle measures, and procedures [^113YpVh8].

In patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, stent recanalization of iliofemoral veins or the inferior vena cava can restore venous patency and improve functional outcomes. The risk of stent thrombosis is particularly increased during the first 6 months after intervention. The ARIVA trial (Aspirin Plus Rivaroxaban Versus Rivaroxaban Alone for the Prevention of Venous Stent Thrombosis in Patients With PTS) tested whether 100 mg of daily aspirin plus 20 mg of rivaroxaban is superior to 20 mg of rivaroxaban alone to prevent stent thrombosis within 6 months after stent placement for post-thrombotic syndrome.

- **Methods**: In this multinational, academic, open-label, independently adjudicated trial, patients with a Villalta score > 4 points and a stenosis or occlusion of the inferior vena cava, iliac veins, or common femoral vein successfully treated with venous stent placement were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the study groups. Key exclusion criteria included 75 years of age, contraindications to anticoagulant use, or acute venous thrombosis < 3 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of no occlusion in the treated segment assessed at serial duplex ultrasound examinations or no reintervention needed to maintain patency within 6 months. Secondary outcomes, including Villalta score, quality of life, and safety outcomes, were also assessed. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04128956).

- **Results**: From 2020 through 2022, 172 patients were screened, 169 were randomized, and 162 were included in the full analysis set, receiving either aspirin plus rivaroxaban or rivaroxaban alone.

Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^1174x9Hp]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

The management of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) in patients with varicose and nonvaricose veins is outlined in Guideline 12. It addresses the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superficial venous interventions, while the management of endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) and other thrombotic complications of superficial venous interventions were presented in Guidelines 11.

- **Management recommendations**:
	- For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee, more than 3 cm from the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) and measuring at least 5 cm in length, whether or not associated with varicose veins, the guidelines recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days. Alternatively, rivaroxaban 10 mg/day for 45 days may be appropriate for patients unwilling or unable to perform subcutaneous injections. **Grade of recommendation**: 1 (strong), **Quality of evidence**: A (high).

	- For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks, 3 cm or less from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks should be continued.

- **Consensus statement**:
	- For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks, the guidelines suggest against using prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While both have been found to reduce SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). If NSAIDs are used for the treatment of short segment distal SVT, surveillance with duplex ultrasound (DUS) for VTE extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT). **Grade of recommendation**: 1 (strong), **Quality of evidence**: A (high).

### Secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism after initial oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^111Lw6Cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, little evidence is available on the length and type of anticoagulation used for extended treatment for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with unprovoked VTE who have completed initial oral anticoagulation therapy.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of available oral therapeutic options (aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) for extended thromboprophylaxis in adults with a first unprovoked VTE, to prevent VTE recurrence after completion of an acceptable initial oral anticoagulant treatment period, as defined in individual studies.

- **Search methods**: For this review, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (March 2017) as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2). We also searched trials registries (March 2017) and reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials in which patients with a first, symptomatic, objectively confirmed, unprovoked VTE, who had been initially treated with anticoagulants, were randomized to extended prophylaxis (vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), antiplatelet agents, or DOACs) versus no prophylaxis or placebo. We also included trials that compared one type of extended prophylaxis versus another type of extended prophylaxis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

- **Main results**: Six studies with a combined total of 3436 participants were included in the analysis.

### Benefits and harms of direct oral anticoagulation and low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^116AwGWf]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

In 25 trials involving 30,230 patients, 235 patients (0.78%) had symptomatic venous thromboembolism; in 61 studies involving 40,588 patients, 100 patients (0.25%) had symptomatic pulmonary embolism; in 13 studies involving 4,343 patients, 42 patients (0.95%) had symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis; and in 38 studies involving 32,338 patients, 173 patients (0.53%) had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis of any extension. The results of the network meta-analysis on symptomatic venous thromboembolism, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and symptomatic proximal and deep vein thrombosis of any extension, for all comparisons, are shown. The certainty of the evidence was high that all active treatments probably reduced symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with no active treatment. Direct oral anticoagulants were associated with a significant (P = 0.02) reduction in symptomatic venous thromboembolism compared with low-dose LMWH (odds ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.89), but not compared with high-dose LMWH (0.93, 0.51 to 1.71); the certainty of the evidence was moderate.

There was no significant difference between the network options on symptomatic pulmonary embolism; the certainty of the evidence was low to moderate. Direct oral anticoagulants, but not LMWH at low or high doses, were superior to no active treatment on symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis of any extension; the certainty of the evidence was low to high, depending on the comparison.

### Varicose vein surgery after acute isolated superficial vein thrombosis in daily practice: INSIGHTS-SVT study [^111pcLHd]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study, with real-world data, contributes to our understanding of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) management by highlighting the importance of individualized treatment strategies, appropriate timing of interventions, and the need for continued research to refine our approach to this condition. It reinforces the notion that the management of SVT should be guided by a careful assessment of each patient's individual circumstances and risk factors.

### A different way to look at varicose veins [^114yDCDk]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The development of varicose veins is commonly attributed to vessel wall degeneration. However, certain observations challenge the idea that varicose veins occur solely due to pathological processes. For example, their high prevalence (50% or greater) in many populations statistically normalizes varicose veins. Additionally, their well-established genetic predisposition raises the possibility that this high prevalence reflects a survival benefit. One way to explain this apparent contradiction is to theorize that varicose veins are produced by the same mechanism(s) that lead to the growth and remodeling of other types of blood vessels. If so, being "good" at forming varicose veins may also predispose individuals to be "good" at forming various types of collateral blood vessels when necessary.

- **Methods**: A selected literature review was conducted. Works chosen for review included those suggesting that the process of varicose vein formation may share the same basic mechanisms as the formation of collateral veins, arteries, and lymphatic vessels. Clinical outcomes may differ between subjects with and without varicose veins.

- **Results**: Evidence suggests that subjects who are "good" at forming varicose veins may also excel at forming various types of collateral vessels, potentially leading to better overall survival with less cardiovascular morbidity than those without varicose veins.

- **Conclusions**: Varicose veins may be "the price we pay" for an enhanced ability to form collateral vessels when necessary.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^1111TYHe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot may migrate from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, to the lungs. Conventional treatment of PE traditionally involves unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. These DOACs offer potential advantages over conventional treatments, including oral administration, a predictable effect, no need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions.

This review evaluates the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment of PE for a minimum duration of three months. It is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors against conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of PE.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 2 March 2022. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for additional studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where individuals with a PE confirmed through standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of portal vein thrombosis [^113VGa2J]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for the treatment of portal vein thrombosis. This was a single-center, retrospective study. Adult patients initiated on a direct oral anticoagulant or warfarin for the treatment of a new portal vein thrombosis were included.

- **Primary failure outcome**: The absolute difference in rethromboembolic events 90 days following initiation of a direct oral anticoagulant versus warfarin.

- **Primary safety outcome**: The absolute difference in bleeding events 90 days following initiation of a direct oral anticoagulant versus warfarin. Descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact, and Student's t-tests were utilized as appropriate.

Thirty-three patients were included. Thirteen (39.4%) patients received direct oral anticoagulants, and 20 (60.6%) received warfarin. None of the patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants experienced a primary failure event compared to four receiving warfarin (P < 0.001). None of the patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants experienced a primary safety event compared to one receiving warfarin (P < 0.001).

Direct oral anticoagulants appear to be effective and safe in the treatment of portal vein thrombosis and in preventing rethromboembolic events. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm the efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants in portal vein thrombosis.

### New anticoagulants [^1163ySjd]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants are pivotal agents for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Limitations of existing anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists and heparins, have led to the development of newer anticoagulant therapies. These anticoagulants have been designed to target specific coagulation enzymes or steps in the coagulation pathway.

- **New anticoagulants**: Those under evaluation in clinical trials include: (1) inhibitors of the factor VIIa/tissue factor pathway; (2) factor Xa inhibitors, both indirect and direct; (3) activated protein C and soluble thrombomodulin; and (4) direct thrombin inhibitors. Although most are parenteral agents, several direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin are orally active.

- **Clinical development**: This often starts with studies in the prevention of venous thrombosis before evaluating for other indications, such as the prevention of cardioembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic heart valves. At present, the greatest clinical need is for an oral anticoagulant to replace warfarin for the long-term prevention and treatment of patients with venous and arterial thrombosis.

Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, is the first of a series of promising new agents that might fulfill this need. Large phase 3 trials evaluating ximelagatran for the secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism and prevention of cardioembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation have been completed.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in sickle cell disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Cc4ub]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants are commonly used for the treatment of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and for stroke prevention among patients with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk of stroke. For several decades, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), primarily warfarin, were the only available oral anticoagulants, and hence the experience of using them is significant. However, VKA use has drawbacks, including a narrow therapeutic window that warrants frequent monitoring of the international normalized ratio, drug interactions with numerous medications, and food interaction with vitamin K-rich food. Meanwhile, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed to overcome these limitations. DOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, are oral anticoagulants approved for use for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in several cardiovascular indications.

VTE among patients with SCD is associated with a 2 to 4 times increase in mortality risk compared with patients with SCD without VTE. Nevertheless, the evidence guiding the management of VTE in SCD, specifically in terms of the anticoagulant of choice, is scarce. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to address this important question. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate DOAC effectiveness and safety in SCD.

### Oral anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism [^111AMGWg]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite advances in diagnosis, prevention, and management, venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. For decades, antithrombotic therapy for prevention and treatment of VTE was limited to parenteral agents related to heparin and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Both classes of anticoagulants are effective but have limitations, including considerable variability in dose-response, narrow therapeutic margins between the risks of thrombosis and bleeding, and the need to monitor anticoagulation intensity.

Over the past decade, the introduction of new oral anticoagulants that specifically inhibit coagulation factors IIa (thrombin) or Xa has changed practice in a variety of clinical situations, including VTE prophylaxis and treatment. This review outlines the use of the novel oral anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the prevention and treatment of VTE. It also discusses practical considerations for choosing the appropriate drug for each patient. Although the introduction of novel anticoagulant drugs is promising, selecting the optimum strategy for an individual patient requires an understanding of the specific circumstances associated with thrombus formation and the pharmacological properties of each agent.

### Direct oral anticoagulants for the treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis - A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1135Sgku]. Thrombosis Research (2023). High credibility.

Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is an uncommon manifestation of venous thromboembolism in the splanchnic venous system, with scarce evidence surrounding its management. We assessed the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) compared to low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), or no anticoagulation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary efficacy outcome being complete recanalization of affected vessels, and the primary safety outcome being major bleeding. Meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model, with dichotomous outcomes synthesized with odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: Seven non-randomized studies and one randomized study, involving 883 participants, were included for analysis. DOACs were more effective than VKAs (OR = 4.33; 95% CI: 2.4, 7.83; n = 1 study) in non-cirrhotic patients and more effective than no anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients (OR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.49, 10.03; n = 3 studies). DOACs had a statistically significant reduction in major bleeding compared to observation [OR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.29; n = 3 studies], LMWHs [OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.29; n = 1 study], and VKAs [OR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.69; n = 2 studies] in non-cirrhotic patients. No difference in major bleeding was found between DOACs and observation, LMWHs, or VKAs in cirrhotic patients.

- **Conclusion**: DOACs appear to be a favorable alternative to VKAs and LMWHs in non-cirrhotic patients. This avenue of research would benefit from larger studies that adjust for SVT etiologies and patient risk factors.

### Temporal trends in the practice pattern for venous thromboembolism in Japan: Insight from JROAD-DPC [^115DGTnz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Recently, direct oral anticoagulants have been introduced for venous thromboembolism, which might change the management strategies. However, there have been limited data on the real-world practice pattern in Asian countries.

- **Methods and results**: The JROAD‐DPC (Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases - Diagnosis Procedure Combination) is a nationwide claim database from 1,022 hospitals in Japan between April 2012 and March 2017. We identified 54,369 patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis at admission based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) code. The mean age was 69.1 ± 15.6 years, 59% were women, and mean body mass index was 23.5 ± 5.0 kg/m². The proportion of patients with deep vein thrombosis decreased over time from 72% in 2012 to 38% in 2017.

	- After the release of direct oral anticoagulants, the proportion of patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants increased dramatically among patients with anticoagulation therapy at discharge using edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban in 35%, 22%, and 27% of patients, respectively, in 2017. On the other hand, the proportion of patients receiving warfarin decreased from 94% in 2012 to 15% in 2017. The median length of a hospital stay decreased over time from 20 days in 2012 to 13 days in 2017 in patients with pulmonary embolism, and from 14 days in 2012 to 12 days in 2017 in patients with deep vein thrombosis. The median cost of hospitalization for pulmonary embolism moderately decreased over time, whereas that for deep vein thrombosis…

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^1147qzxV]. Gut (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gastroesophageal varices, particularly for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, the BSG 2015 guidelines recommend the initiation of nonselective β-blockers or performing variceal band ligation as primary prophylaxis.

Consider starting pharmacotherapy with propranolol at 40 mg BID, titrating the dose to the maximum tolerated or until a heart rate of 50–55 bpm is achieved, up to a maximum dose of 320 mg, as first-line primary prophylaxis.

Offer variceal band ligation if nonselective β-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. It is important to consider patient choice when deciding between variceal band ligation and nonselective β-blockers.

### Varicose veins show enhanced chemokine expression [^117TD4zE]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in patients with varicose veins and to assess the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on cytokine expression prior to the removal of varices. Leucocyte infiltration in the wall of varicose veins has been documented previously.

- **Material and methods**: Sections of veins were removed during operations from both patient groups. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPAs) were performed to assess chemokine expression. Group I included non-varicose saphenous veins from healthy patients undergoing amputation for trauma. Varicose veins were collected from patients with primary varicose veins undergoing surgical treatment who received no drug (group II) or treatment with 300 mg/day of ASA for 15 days before surgery (group III).

- **Results**: Non-varicose veins constitutively expressed low levels of monocyte-chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL)-8 mRNA. In contrast, varicose veins exhibited a distinct chemokine expression pattern, with significant up-regulation of MCP-1 and IL-8, along with marked expression of IP-10, RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta mRNA. Removal of the endothelium did not alter this expression pattern. Varicose veins obtained from patients treated with ASA showed a consistent decrease in chemokine expression, although it did not reach statistical significance.

- **Conclusions**: Varicose veins showed increased expression of several chemokines compared to control veins. A non-significant reduction in activation was observed following treatment with ASA.

Regarding medical management for varicose veins, and more specifically with respect to the management of bleeding varicose veins, the AVF/AVLS/SVS 2024 guidelines recommend attempting leg elevation, direct compression, and sclerotherapy before suture ligation to control bleeding in patients presenting with acute bleeding from varicose veins. It is advised to refer patients with bleeding from varicose veins promptly to a venous specialist.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^115cZeiM]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The rate of VTE after endovenous varicose vein intervention may be higher than previously anticipated and carries a small but significant morbidity and mortality. There is evidence that additional pharmacological thromboprophylaxis reduces the rate of DVT, and it is recommended that anticoagulant agents are considered for endovenous varicose vein procedures. There is a strong likelihood of selection bias inherent within the analyzed studies; the pooled data from randomized trial arms are the most robust but are still limited by lack of head-to-head comparisons.

Critical safety endpoints, such as major and minor bleeding, are generally underreported and raise the question of the most appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis agent in the era of oral substitutes. Studies demonstrate highly variable VTE risk between participants, and risk stratification using a validated scoring system may be useful for future randomized controlled trials to ensure equipoise to randomization and establish the efficacy and safety of this intervention.

Evidence

Despite the very low incidence of thromboembolic events among patients undergoing endovenous ablation, one large systematic review did find a significantly lower incidence of EHIT among those receiving pharmacological prophylaxis (1.63% vs. 3.04%; P < .001). However, this was not a uniform finding across individual studies, and there was heterogeneity in the prophylactic regimens used. Another systematic review included eight studies (3 RCTs, 5 cohort studies, 6479 patients) comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to no prophylaxis following a variety of varicose vein procedures.

- **Prophylaxis evaluation**:

	- Five studies evaluated prophylaxis after open surgery and three after EVLA. The risk of DVT was lower for endovenous procedures than for open surgery. Prophylaxis was associated with a non-significant reduction in the composite risk of DVT, PE, and superficial venous thrombosis (pooled RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.04–10.43; p = 0.74) and of DVT alone (pooled RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.08–4.60; p = 0.61). There was significant heterogeneity in both results.

	- Notably, confining the analysis to randomized trials did show a significant reduction in the risk of DVT (0.22% vs. 4.15%; RR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02–0.13; P < .001). Among the two studies reporting bleeding risk, there was no difference among those receiving or not receiving prophylaxis.

	- Although a few included studies evaluated the efficacy of fondaparinux and rivaroxaban as well as short vs. extended courses of prophylaxis, conclusions based on the available data are difficult.

### Does aspirin prevent venous thromboembolism [^1168joFP]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology: Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality in medical and surgical patient populations. Clinical research in the prevention and treatment of VTE has been dynamic, exploring various treatment modalities ranging from mechanical prophylaxis to direct oral anticoagulants. Aspirin has long been an inexpensive cornerstone of arterial vascular disease therapy, but its role in the primary or secondary prophylaxis of VTE remains debated.

Risk-benefit tradeoffs between aspirin and anticoagulants have evolved due to advances in surgical techniques, postoperative care, and the development of safe, easy-to-use oral anticoagulants. This text reviews:

- **Proposed mechanisms**: Aspirin may act on venous thrombosis through several pathways.
- **Evidence for aspirin use**: Examines both primary and secondary prophylaxis of VTE.
- **Risk of bleeding**: Compares the risk of bleeding with aspirin versus anticoagulation.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^117YEgp9]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Major and minor bleeding were defined as per the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidelines. Of the twelve trial arms that reported on bleeding after pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, there was one instance of major bleeding, associated with the coadministration of LMWH and ibuprofen. Other trials that considered minor bleeding rates noted a range from 0% to 10%. There was no significant difference in bleeding events between three days of Fondaparinux versus Rivaroxaban, nor between Rivaroxaban 10 mg OD for five days versus ten days. Of the eleven trial arms that included VTE-related mortality as an outcome, there was one VTE-related death that occurred in the mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone group following a PE from an iliofemoral DVT.

- **Risk of bias**: Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tool for nonrandomized studies of interventions and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials. Randomized trials were generally at high or unclear risk of bias, primarily due to the lack of registered protocols, high rates of attrition, and potential for performance biases resulting from a lack of blinding. For nonrandomized studies, there was a critical risk of selection bias through confounding by indication, as well as significant attrition bias and high potential for reporting bias.

- **Quality assessment**: In the randomized trial arms, the quality of evidence for the rates of DVT and PE was judged as moderate in light of the risk of bias.

### Oral rivaroxaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism [^117CffWw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). High credibility.

Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring.

- **Methods**: We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study comparing oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study.

- **Results**: The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban demonstrated noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%] vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.04; P < 0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients, additional results should be completed in future reports.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^112GAb3J]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The inherent risk of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is the risk of bleeding. There was insufficient reporting of this outcome to perform a quantitative analysis, so a narrative review was performed. Qualitative studies have demonstrated reticence of patients to engage with thromboprophylaxis regimes, chiefly because of the lack of education about the risks of VTE, lack of involvement in the risk assessment process, and low acceptability of self-injection. Direct oral anticoagulants have been used for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis after surgery without increasing the major bleeding risk; however, minor bleeding events were more common. The data collected in this study support a similar hypothesis, with low rates of minor bleeding and just one instance of major bleeding across all the studies, due to NSAID and LMWH coadministration. Given the relative lack of safety data, it is imperative that primary safety endpoints such as bleeding and VTE-related mortality are reported by all future observational and interventional studies as per established international guidance.

In this study, all endovenous treatment modalities were considered together to enhance the amount of literature that could be analyzed. No significant difference in DVT rates for different endovenous closure modalities has been reliably demonstrated, and post hoc analysis demonstrated no correlation between type of intervention and rate of DVT. In the same way, treatment of incompetent SSV and anterior accessory saphenous vein were included in quantitative analyses. Although some have discussed a trend…

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^115AmgiR]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was extracted from all 221 studies. For randomized trial arms, the rate of DVT in the mechanical and additional pharmacological thromboprophylaxis arms was 0.52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23%–1.19%] (9 trial arms, 1,095 patients, 2 events) (Fig. 1). For mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone, the rate of DVT was 2.26% (95% CI, 1.81%–2.82%) (38 trial arms, 6,951 patients, 69 events) (Fig. 2). Heterogeneity, expressed via I², was found to be 0% and 62%, respectively.

Across all prospective study designs, the rate of DVT in the additional pharmacological thromboprophylaxis arms was 0.73% (95% CI, 0.52%–1.02%) (31 study arms, 6,151 participants, 23 events, I² = 0%) versus 1.31% (95% CI, 1.16%–1.48%) (123 study arms, 36,418 participants, 214 events, I² = 60%) for mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone. For the combined study arms (all retrospective and prospective study designs), the DVT rate for the additional pharmacological thromboprophylaxis arms was 0.71% (95% CI, 0.57%–0.89%) (43 trial arms, 13,869 participants, 63 events, I² = 0%).

For mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone, the heterogeneity of 93% precluded quantitative synthesis and prompted further inquiry into between-study differences.

### Aspirin plus rivaroxaban versus rivaroxaban alone for the prevention of venous stent thrombosis among patients with post-thrombotic syndrome: The multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label ARIVA trial [^113ghFw9]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis is the most common clinical manifestation of venous thromboembolism, affecting approximately 2 per 1000 individuals per year. Deep vein thrombosis causes significant morbidity during its acute phase and leads to functional complications months after the initial diagnosis. Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is the most frequent long-term complication of proximal deep vein thrombosis, occurring in up to 50% of patients with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis treated with standard anticoagulation and compression stockings. PTS contributes to substantial individual burden, leading to long-term morbidity, persistent discomfort, and impaired quality of life for affected patients, often resulting in a reduced ability to perform daily activities.

Compression stockings, exercise and physical therapy, wound care, and long-term anticoagulant treatment may relieve the symptoms related to the presence of PTS and stabilize the disease. However, no medical treatment has been proven effective in reversing PTS to regress subjective limitations and symptoms. Recanalization of chronically occluded iliac veins with stent placement has been shown in a randomized trial and multiple single-arm studies to restore blood flow and alleviate functional limitations associated with PTS.

- **Optimal antithrombotic strategies**: Several aspects of venous stent placement require further investigation, including the optimal antithrombotic strategy. Currently, there is no agreement on the optimal antithrombotic strategy to prevent venous stent thrombosis. As a result, existing guidelines and consensus documents are still under development or inconclusive.

Evidence

Nonsaphenous, pelvic origin varicose veins occur in women in the medial and posterior thigh, vulva, and inguinal area. They result from reflux from the internal iliac vein through the inguinal, obturator, perineal, and gluteal escape points. Vulvar varicosities are estimated to occur in 22% to 34% of women with pelvic varicose veins and in 18% to 22% of pregnant women.

Seventy-two symptomatic patients had pelvic source varicose veins; however, only 7% had chronic pelvic pain. In a systematic review of 13 studies on ovarian vein embolization in 866 women, technical success was 99.8%; significant improvement in pelvic pain was reported in nine studies. In one study, lower extremity varicosities recurred in only 13% of cases at 5 years after embolization. Hartung et al. reported a 51% improvement in lower extremity varicosity following ovarian vein embolization in 119 women who had both pelvic symptoms and lower extremity varicose veins. In another study of 43 patients, Castenmiller et al. showed improvement in the lower extremity varicose veins in 14% after ovarian vein embolization, but the success rate was 88% for the treatment of vulvar varicose veins.

Gavrilov reported good clinical results with direct treatment of vulvar varicosities using foam sclerotherapy (FS) and phlebectomy. In 32 patients with asymptomatic pelvic varicose veins, phlebectomy alone for vulvar varices resulted in no recurrence 3 to 8 years after the procedure. Sclerotherapy was effective at 1 year in 10 of 12 patients. The consensus of experts supports the strategy of direct treatment for pelvic origin varicose veins.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the additional benefit of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for endovenous varicose vein interventions [^1122BTdx]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The most significant limitation of this meta-analysis is the lack of direct head-to-head randomized trials comparing additional pharmacological thromboprophylaxis to mechanical measures alone. Therefore, network and standard meta-analysis were precluded, and a metaproportions approach was taken to aggregate the data from randomized trial arms and observational studies. The observational study arms introduced a significant amount of bias into the analysis, chiefly through confounding by indication. Trial arms in which pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was administered may have done so for a perceived higher risk of thrombosis in the cohort. Likewise, participants in the mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone trial arms are more likely to have been recruited to the trial because of their low perceived VTE risk. However, this bias is likely to diminish the effect size reported rather than increasing it, meaning the VTE rate may be overestimated for pharmacological in addition to mechanical thromboprophylaxis.

This selection bias makes the quality of evidence for the pooled rate of DVT inherently weaker and explains the downgrading of evidence from high to moderate quality in the GRADE assessment. Although no direct head-to-head comparisons exist, the data extracted from randomized trial arms limits the level of confounding by indication and provides a less biased review of the pooled VTE rate for pharmacological in addition to mechanical thromboprophylaxis versus mechanical thromboprophylaxis alone. Thus, the randomized data are the most important findings presented.

- **Evidence**: In a recent systematic review of 944 limbs with previous DVT or deep vein obstruction, most patients had iliofemoral venous disease and advanced CEAP class (C4-C6). These patients had better results when vein ablation was combined with treatment of iliac vein obstruction. It should be noted, however, that few C2 patients were included in the review, leaving this issue unexplored and unresolved. In the case of iliofemoral venous obstruction, interventions on the superficial venous system should not impair venous return from the limb. For this reason, in patients with symptoms of proximal outflow obstruction, such as venous claudication, thigh swelling and pain, or in those with suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities, or with continuous flow and lack of respiratory variations in the common femoral vein on DUS, investigation of the iliac veins is warranted. During ablation of the incompetent superficial veins, collaterals to the suprapubic and abdominal wall veins should be preserved.

In patients with medial thigh or vulvar varicosities, evaluation of pelvic venous pathology with DUS or other imaging studies is not indicated if they have no symptoms of pelvic venous disease.

- **Rationale**: There is an association between pelvic venous insufficiency and medial thigh and vulvar varicosities, and lower extremity varicosities are often more severe in patients with associated pelvic varicose veins. Although ovarian vein embolization in patients with pelvic venous disorders may be helpful for lower extremity varicosities, embolization in patients with varicose ve…

### Selection of saphenous vein conduit in varicose vein disease [^1166Zfgp]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Limbs with varicose veins are difficult to assess as a source of saphenous vein conduit. Anatomic, histologic, and ultrasound studies demonstrate two types of longitudinal veins in the lower extremities. The great saphenous vein is deep to the saphenous fascia. Accessory saphenous veins are superficial to this layer and have thin walls with diminished muscle cells and elastic fiber. Accessory saphenous veins dilate and form varicosities. Segments of great saphenous veins are often suitable as coronary conduits. No studies have assessed the suitability of saphenous veins as coronary artery conduits in patients with varicose vein disease.

- **Methods**: Intraoperative high-resolution ultrasound studies were performed in coronary artery bypass graft procedures to assess lower extremity venous morphology in limbs of 77 patients without known venous disease, in 19 limbs with venous telangiectases, and in 23 limbs with varicose veins.

- **Results**: Dilated great saphenous vein segments were identified in 6% of normal limb venous segments compared with 21% of segments in limbs with telangiectases (p = 0.027) and 22% of segments in limbs with varicosities (p = 0.012). The incidence of absent or hypoplastic great saphenous vein segments is increased in limbs with varicosities (35%) compared with normal limbs (21%; p = 0.032). In the calf, at least one great saphenous vein segment suitable for coronary artery bypass grafting is present in 70% of limbs with varicosities and in 89% of limbs with telangiectases.

- **Conclusions**: Ultrasound studies document that varicose veins are limited.

### Varicose vein surgery after acute isolated superficial vein thrombosis in daily practice: INSIGHTS-SVT study [^113o1NWw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). High credibility.

The study flow is illustrated in Fig 1. Of the 872 patients with available 12-month follow-up data, 197 patients (22.6%) underwent invasive treatments at some time point during the follow-up. Among these 197 patients receiving invasive treatments, 70 received such interventions within the first 3 months, 136 patients between 4 and 12 months, and nine patients received invasive treatment twice, spanning both periods.

A total of 817 patients (93.4%) received anticoagulation therapy after the index event as the initial treatment choice at baseline. Of the 197 patients, 182 (92.4%) undergoing surgery and 635 of the 675 patients (94.1%) not undergoing surgery received anticoagulation. Furthermore, 141 of 197 patients (71.6%) received some form of non-pharmacological treatment in addition to anticoagulation therapy. The median duration of anticoagulation therapy was 28 days (interquartile range [IQR], 18–42 days) for patients who underwent surgery and 35 days (IQR, 21–42 days) for those who did not.

Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^113jqpJ8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

This guideline is consistent with that previously suggested by the AVF/SVS. Other guidelines include those from the UK Royal Society of Medicine, which suggest preoperative assessment of all patients for both VTE and bleeding risk, with pharmacological prophylaxis for 7 to 14 days in intermediate-risk patients and for 4 to 6 weeks in high-risk patients. The European Society for Vascular Surgery recommends VTE risk assessment in all patients with consideration of individualized thromboprophylaxis (Class IIa, Level B).

Although the weight of the evidence does suggest some benefit to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, the evidence is difficult to generalize due to the limited magnitude of effect among those systematic reviews reporting a benefit of routine thromboprophylaxis (number needed to treat 25.4–172.4 for the prevention of DVT) and significant heterogeneity in the results. There is also a lack of risk stratification in most studies. In addition to the uncertain value of routine thromboprophylaxis, there is little data regarding the optimal agents, dose, or duration of thromboprophylaxis if used. We therefore suggest pharmacoprophylaxis in high-risk patients, but with a low certainty of evidence.

Lines represent cumulative event rates in percent, along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) over time until 12 months, categorized by type of intervention. EVTA, endovenous thermal ablation; SFJ/SPJ, ligation of the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction.

A great majority of patients enrolled in the registry (93.4%) received anticoagulation at baseline. Notably, concerning both anticoagulant and non-pharmacological treatments, the differences between patients who underwent surgery and those who did not were minimal and did not reach statistical significance. Specifically, among patients who received surgery compared with those who did not, fondaparinux was administered at baseline to 125 patients (63.5%) vs. 417 (61.8%); low molecular weight heparins were given to 48 patients (24.4%) vs. 170 (25.2%); and other anticoagulants (direct oral anticoagulants, vitamin K anticoagulants, and unfractionated heparin) were used by nine patients (4.6%) vs. 48 (6.7%). Additionally, non-pharmacological treatment was utilized by 141 patients (71.6%) who underwent surgery.

The primary outcome of symptomatic VTE within the initial 3 months of follow-up was observed in 51 patients (7.6%) treated conservatively, which included 37 patients with varicose veins and 14 patients without varicose veins. In contrast, 16 patients (8.1%), who underwent surgical treatment, experienced this outcome. Importantly, this data indicates that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of symptomatic VTE within the first 3 months.

### Aspirin plus rivaroxaban versus rivaroxaban alone for the prevention of venous stent thrombosis among patients with post-thrombotic syndrome: The multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label ARIVA trial [^11474zkN]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

The study evaluated the effectiveness of combining aspirin with rivaroxaban versus using rivaroxaban alone for the prevention of venous stent thrombosis in patients with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of freedom from occlusion in the treated segment and reintervention needed to maintain patency (primary patency rate) within 6 months. A duplex ultrasound of the affected leg was conducted according to a standardized protocol during all follow-up visits after 3 and 6 months to evaluate the presence or absence of thrombosis in the treated segment. In case of reintervention, final confirmation of occlusion was obtained by digital subtraction venography of the stent segment.

- **Secondary efficacy outcomes**:
	1. Primary patency rate at 3 months
	2. Secondary patency rates at 6 months
	3. Primary sustained clinical success at 3 and 6 months
	4. Incidence of patients with open stents but residual stenosis > 50%
	5. Limb circumference difference between legs
	6. Quality of life (Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire [CIVIQ-20] score)
	7. Changes in Villalta and revised venous clinical severity scores at 3 and 6 months
	8. Investigator and patient global efficacy judgments after 6 months, a subjective assessment on treatment effectiveness using a 5-point rating scale ranging from 0 (very good) to 4 (worse than baseline).

The secondary patency rate was defined as the percentage of patients with a patent stent at 6 months follow-up regardless of any reintervention for stent occlusion. Primary sustained clinical success was defined as the absence of PTS (Villalta score ≤ 4) and no reintervention. The CIVIQ-20 is a patient-reported assessment scale.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment and long-term prevention of venous thrombo-embolism [^1111C9de]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) specifically target factor IIa or Xa and represent a major step forward in the treatment and long-term prevention of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE). They are at least as effective and as safe as conventional therapy (heparins and vitamin-K inhibitors) and have practical advantages, such as fixed dosing and no need for laboratory monitoring. These antithrombotic agents introduce a new paradigm for the day-to-day management of VTE. DOACs should streamline the management of most patients with VTE and will facilitate care in the outpatient setting. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how to select specific DOACs for particular profiles of patients, and the optimal management of bleeding complications is evolving.

### AASLD practice guidance on the use of TIPS, variceal embolization, and retrograde transvenous obliteration in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^1173A4aF]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for variceal hemorrhage, particularly in relation to TIPS, technical considerations should be noted. The AASLD 2023 guidelines recommend initiating rifaximin 550 mg BID within 14 days before TIPS and maintaining it for 6 months. This approach aims to reduce the risk of post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy in patients undergoing elective TIPS for the prevention of variceal rebleeding.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^112xokAm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately one in 1000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors, which have characteristics that may be favorable compared to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or dose adjustment, and few known drug interactions. DOACs are now commonly being used for treating DVT. Recent guidelines recommended DOACs over conventional anticoagulants for both DVT and PE treatment.

This Cochrane Review was first published in 2015. It was the first systematic review to measure the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT. This is an update of the 2015 review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of DVT.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers, up to 1 March 2022.

### Management of uncomplicated varicose veins - a case vignette for a clinical decision proposal [^117XsPsb]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Venous disorder is common in the general population. Uncomplicated varicose veins represent a significant proportion of the disease burden and can considerably impact quality of life, producing a wide spectrum of symptoms. Little is known about the natural course of the disease at this stage, and the treatment strategy employed is often not based on robust scientific evidence.

The aim of this article is to elucidate the options to manage uncomplicated varicose veins. There are likely to be significant geographic differences in the treatment strategy employed. It is hoped that we will arouse discussion among physicians regarding the management of this very common medical condition. The reader will be asked for their preferred treatment choice for a given clinical case vignette.

### Treatment of varicose veins affects the incidences of venous thromboembolism and peripheral artery disease [^115zbpYv]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment of varicose veins has been studied in relation to its impact on the incidences of venous thromboembolism and peripheral artery disease. The study highlights several therapeutic strategies and their respective outcomes.

- **Results**: Initial findings suggest that effective treatment of varicose veins may reduce the risk of subsequent venous thromboembolism. Patients undergoing certain procedures exhibited lower incidences compared to those untreated.

- **Implications**: These findings could impact current clinical guidelines, emphasizing the importance of treating varicose veins not only for cosmetic and symptomatic relief but also for preventing severe vascular conditions.

Further research is needed to validate these findings and to explore the mechanisms by which varicose vein treatment influences these conditions.

### Pradaxa [^112jhUSv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate efficacy, all patients were required to undergo bilateral venography of the lower extremities three days after the last dose of the study drug, unless an endpoint event occurred earlier in the study. In the primary efficacy analysis, Pradaxa capsules (110 mg orally, 1–4 hours after surgery, followed by 220 mg daily) were found to be non-inferior to enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) in a composite endpoint of confirmed VTE (proximal or distal DVT on venogram, confirmed symptomatic DVT, or confirmed PE) and all-cause death during the treatment period. In the studies, 2628 patients (76.5%) in RE-NOVATE and 1572 patients (78.9%) in RE-NOVATE II had evaluable venograms at study completion.

### What did we learn from new oral anticoagulant treatment [^11465whT]. Thrombosis Research (2012). High credibility.

Orally active direct inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa have now been approved for the treatment or prevention of deep vein thrombosis and stroke associated with atrial fibrillation. The factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, has shown promising results in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome but is not yet approved for that indication. These agents share a rapid onset and are cleared with half-lives of approximately 10 hours.

At present, there is no approved antidote for either class of anticoagulant, making the treatment of life-threatening bleeding episodes problematic. These agents have fewer drug interactions than warfarin, have a predictable clearance, and hence do not require monitoring. Patients with renal insufficiency have delayed clearance and hence may have elevated levels of the drug, leading to an increased risk of bleeding.

### Risk indicators for varicose veins in forty- to sixty-year-olds in the Tampere varicose vein study [^115HBdjL]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The objectives of the study were to discover the main determinants for the prevalence of varicose veins in a general population and to assess the possibilities for prevention of this common surgical disease. Varicose veins were evaluated in three defined cohorts of 3,284 men and 3,590 women aged 40, 50, and 60 years using a validated questionnaire. The response rate was 75% among men and 86% among women, and varicose veins were determined by self-assessment.

- **Significant associations**: Increasing age, female sex, childbirths, standing posture at work, higher weight or height, and a positive family history were significantly associated with varicose veins in a univariate analysis. These factors were further taken into a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio, OR 2.2), increasing age (OR 2.2–2.8), a reported positive family history for varicose veins (OR 4.9), increasing number of births (OR 1.2–2.8), standing posture at work (OR 1.6), and higher weight (OR 1.2) and height (OR 1.4) were found to be independent and significant risk indicators of varicose veins.

- **Most important factors**: Increasing age, positive family history of varicose veins, and childbirths in women were the most important factors in terms of population etiologic fractions. Familial predisposition and pregnancy-related factors bear important associations with varicose veins. Thus, prevention of varicose veins appears to be difficult.

Varicose veins are nonlethal, and therefore, higher age is related to higher prevalence.

### Historical overview of varicose vein surgery [^112Zrpgi]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Varicose veins are as old as Hippocrates. Varicose vein treatments come and go. Surgery for varicose vein disease is one of the most common elective general surgical procedures. The history of varicose vein surgery has been traced, noting the first descriptions of varicose veins. This research particularly focuses on the ligation of the saphenofemoral junction, stripping of the great saphenous veins, phlebectomy, and perforant vein surgery.

The rapid rise of minimally invasive procedures, such as foam sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and endovenous laser therapy, is highlighted. Within 10 years, the advantages of minimal invasiveness for these procedures, combined with claims of equivalent short-term outcomes and even better long-term results, have already influenced our everyday practice.

At present, the gold standard treatment of varicose veins remains surgical ligation and stripping of the insufficient vein. Concomitantly or sequentially with the treatment of truncal insufficiency, residual varicosities can be treated by phlebectomy. However, new minimally invasive techniques have changed the clinical landscape for varicose vein surgery tremendously. The dramatic changes of the last decade are probably the precursors of the next generation.

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for varicose veins, more specifically with respect to compression therapy, the AVF/AVLS/SVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering offering compression therapy as primary treatment. This can be applied for either a trial period or as definitive management in patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reflux in superficial truncal veins. The consideration is warranted if the patient's ambulatory status and underlying medical conditions justify a conservative approach or if the patient prefers conservative treatment.
