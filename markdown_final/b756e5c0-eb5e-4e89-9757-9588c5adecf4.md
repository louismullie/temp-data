## Question

How should low sodium be treated in a 23-year-old male with Na 127, Cl 91, and a normal BMI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage and treat low sodium (hyponatremia) in a 23-year-old male with Na 127 mmol/L, hypochloremia at Cl 91 mmol/L, and a normal BMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about symptom severity and whether this is a neurologic emergency. Then, I should verify volume status and confirm hypotonicity with urine osmolality and sodium to narrow the etiology, particularly SIADH versus other causes. Next, I will outline initial management for severe versus mild-to-moderate or asymptomatic presentations, define safe correction limits, and specify monitoring. After that, I should plan escalation if fluid restriction fails, including NaCl plus loop diuretic, urea, or carefully monitored tolvaptan. I also need to address hypochloremia etiologies and correction. Finally, I will summarize a practical algorithm tailored to this 23-year-old with likely euvolemic hyponatremia, ensuring safeguards against overcorrection and osmotic demyelination syndrome are explicit [^114hpGSU] [^114yeaQw] [^116Rry73] [^112MGZPb] [^114mqwBU] [^115yzmgu].

> Let me first confirm the severity framework and indications for hypertonic saline. Moderate symptoms include nausea without vomiting, confusion, or headache, while severe symptoms include vomiting, altered consciousness, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress, and these categories guide urgency and hypertonic saline use, so I should classify the patient accordingly before any infusion decisions [^114hpGSU] [^114yeaQw]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even if the sodium is 127 mmol/L, treatment intensity depends more on symptoms and acuity than the absolute value alone, and bolus 3% saline is reserved for moderate-to-severe symptoms to rapidly raise sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L in the first few hours when indicated [^113SHKnQ] [^116Rry73].

> Next, I should review volume status and confirm the underlying mechanism. Wait, I should verify that normal BMI does not equal euvolemia; I still need orthostatic vitals, mucous membranes, JVP, edema, and lung exam to distinguish euvolemic from hypo- or hypervolemic states, and to order serum osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium because urine Osm ≤ 100 mOsm/kg suggests excess free water intake, whereas urine Osm > 100 mOsm/kg with urine Na > 30 mmol/L in a clinically euvolemic patient supports SIADH after excluding hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency with TSH and morning cortisol testing [^114Mg1Pm] [^1121fSgV] [^116NqJCy]. I need to ensure a medication review screens for thiazides, SSRIs, carbamazepine, opioids, and other culprits before labeling this SIADH, since removing the cause may resolve the hyponatremia [^116Fduk1] [^114Mg1Pm].

> If the patient is severely symptomatic, I will act immediately. I will now examine hypertonic saline dosing: give 3% NaCl as a 150 mL IV bolus over 20 minutes and reassess; repeat 1–2 times as needed to raise serum sodium by about 4–6 mmol/L to control severe symptoms. Wait, I initially thought a continuous infusion was preferred, but I should correct that — guidelines favor bolus dosing for faster, controlled increments with less risk of overshooting compared with continuous infusions in this context, while continuous infusions can still be used with careful titration in some protocols [^116Rry73] [^113EZiHH] [^113SHKnQ]. I should confirm that hypertonic therapy proceeds in a monitored setting with frequent sodium checks and neuro assessments to avoid rapid overcorrection and ODS [^117YPJ9F] [^114yeaQw].

> For mild-to-moderate symptoms or asymptomatic euvolemic hyponatremia at 127 mmol/L, conservative therapy is appropriate. Let me think about first-line measures: fluid restriction to 500–1000 mL/day, adequate dietary solute, and removal of precipitating medications or pain/nausea stimuli are foundational in SIADH management, and these should be implemented before considering pharmacologic escalation [^116Fduk1] [^112MGZPb]. I should double-check real-world practice patterns; registry data suggest fluid restriction is the most common monotherapy for SIADH, though its efficacy is variable and needs close monitoring of response [^114oZizi] [^112GCSuE].

> If fluid restriction fails to raise sodium adequately within 24–48 hours, I need to escalate carefully. Let me consider second-line options with monitoring plans: increasing solute with oral NaCl tablets combined with a low-dose loop diuretic can enhance free water excretion, and urea 0.25–0.5 g/kg/day is an effective, guideline-endorsed alternative; both approaches require serial sodium and potassium checks to avoid rapid shifts or hypokalemia [^112MGZPb]. But wait, what if these are insufficient or poorly tolerated? Tolvaptan is an option for persistent SIADH, yet I must initiate and re-initiate only in hospital with frequent sodium monitoring to avoid overcorrection, respect the FDA boxed warning, limit use to less than 30 days, and avoid in advanced liver disease, noting that European guidance is more restrictive due to overcorrection risk and cost concerns while US expert panels allow second-line use with vigilant safeguards [^115U3W56] [^116NqJCy] [^112C1CHA].

> I should confirm correction limits to prevent osmotic demyelination. Standard patients should not exceed 10–12 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, whereas high-risk patients — such as those with very low baseline sodium, alcoholism, malnutrition, liver disease, or severe hypokalemia — should be limited to 6–8 mmol/L per 24 hours, with a practical target closer to 6 to account for laboratory imprecision and spontaneous aquaresis that can accelerate correction [^114Xdtdc] [^114C7k4P] [^114mqwBU] [^115yzmgu]. Hold on, I should verify the relowering protocol if limits are exceeded; prompt cessation of corrective therapy, administration of desmopressin 2 mcg IV not more often than every 8 hours, and infusion of electrolyte-free water, such as 10 mL/kg of 5% dextrose over about an hour, are guideline-supported steps to re-lower sodium safely under expert supervision [^113ToEcJ] [^113PyTGH] [^116VvNY1]. Let me reconsider the strategy to prevent overshoot in the first place; a proactive or reactive desmopressin approach, sometimes termed a "DDAVP clamp", can stabilize urine output and help keep correction within target ranges, though evidence is largely observational [^111nqQot] [^117SmC1L] [^113GqJQ3].

> Next, I should review monitoring and setting. I need to ensure serum sodium is measured every 2–4 to 6 hours during active correction, with continuous neurologic observation and strict urine output tracking to catch emergent aquaresis that can drive rapid sodium rises, and management should occur in a higher-acuity setting when using hypertonic saline or vaptans to mitigate risk of overcorrection and to respond quickly to clinical changes [^114yeaQw] [^113SHKnQ] [^115U3W56]. Hold on, I should verify chloride and kidney risk during hypertonic therapy; neurocritical care guidance highlights avoiding severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia to reduce AKI risk and suggests upper sodium and chloride ranges when hypertonic sodium solutions are used, underscoring the need to monitor both electrolytes and renal function closely [^113znEJ3] [^116G47uc].

> I will now examine the hypochloremia. Let me consider causes: diuretic exposure, GI losses, endocrine disorders, and dilutional states like SIADH can all lower serum chloride, and a broad medication list beyond diuretics can contribute. Wait, let me verify that chloride correction should match the mechanism; stopping thiazides if present, replacing chloride via oral or IV isotonic sodium chloride when volume depleted or symptomatic, and avoiding unnecessary hypotonic fluids are appropriate, while also avoiding iatrogenic hyperchloremia that may worsen renal outcomes in some contexts [^113BeD5t] [^113znEJ3]. I should double-check that when using potassium chloride for concurrent hypokalemia, monitoring for hyperchloremia and renal function is prudent, although in this case the primary issue is low chloride rather than excess, so replacement should be judicious and tailored to etiology and volume status [^1131Cxjw] [^112ZizF3].

> Bringing this together for this 23-year-old with Na 127 mmol/L and Cl 91 mmol/L, I need to ensure a conservative, safety-first algorithm. Assuming no moderate or severe neurologic symptoms, I would initiate fluid restriction around 800 mL/day with adequate solute intake, stop offending drugs, obtain urine osmolality and sodium along with TSH and morning cortisol to evaluate SIADH and endocrine mimics, monitor serum sodium every 4–6 hours initially, and aim for a slow rise toward 130–135 mmol/L within correction limits. If sodium remains under 130 mmol/L after 24–48 hours or if fluid restriction is impractical, I would add oral NaCl with a low-dose loop diuretic or urea, reserving in-hospital tolvaptan for refractory SIADH with vigilant monitoring and strict adherence to daily correction limits and relowering protocols if exceeded. Throughout, I should confirm chloride trends, address reversible causes such as diuretics or GI losses, and monitor for signs of overcorrection to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome [^116Fduk1] [^112MGZPb] [^114C7k4P] [^114mqwBU] [^115U3W56] [^113BeD5t].

For a 23-year-old male with Na 127 mmol/L and Cl 91 mmol/L, the key is to identify the cause and volume status to guide therapy. If asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, start with fluid restriction to 800–1,000 mL/day and stop any contributing drugs [^114yeaQw]. If hypovolemic, give isotonic saline [^114Mg1Pm]; if hypervolemic, use fluid/salt restriction plus loop diuretics; for SIADH, consider salt tablets, loop diuretics, or tolvaptan if needed [^114Mg1Pm] [^116NqJCy]. Reserve 3% hypertonic saline [^116Rry73] for severe symptoms or Na < 120 mmol/L, and limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 h (≤ 6 mmol/L if high risk) to avoid osmotic demyelination [^113Zqmc7]. Monitor serum sodium every 2–4 h during correction and adjust therapy to prevent overcorrection [^115yzmgu].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm hypotonic hyponatremia**: Measure serum osmolality; hypotonic hyponatremia is most common.

- **Assess volume status**: Clinical exam and urine sodium/osmolality distinguish hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic states.

- **Identify underlying causes**: Review medications (e.g. diuretics, SSRIs), endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), renal disease, and SIADH [^114Mg1Pm].

---

## General management principles

Treat the **underlying cause** to correct the hyponatremia [^114BWXt2] [^114Mg1Pm]. Monitor serum sodium every 2–4 hours during active correction [^115yzmgu] to avoid rapid shifts in sodium [^114Mg1Pm]. Limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (≤ 6 mmol/L if high risk) to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^114mqwBU] [^1121b7dy].

---

## Specific treatment strategies

### Fluid restriction

Fluid restriction is **first-line** for euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (e.g. SIADH, heart failure) [^114Mg1Pm]. Set intake at 800–1,000 mL/day and monitor adherence and sodium response.

---

### Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl)

- **Indication**: Severe symptoms (seizures, coma) [^113SHKnQ] or Na < 120 mmol/L.

- **Administration**: 100 mL bolus over 10 minutes; repeat if needed to raise Na by 4–6 mmol/L initially [^1175CAmS] [^114Mg1Pm].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent sodium checks to avoid overcorrection [^111V9Y4A] [^114Mg1Pm].

---

### Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)

Use **isotonic saline** for hypovolemic hyponatremia [^111nVwLA] [^114Mg1Pm]. A typical rate is 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour to restore volume and correct sodium.

---

### Loop diuretics

Use **loop diuretics** for hypervolemic hyponatremia (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis) [^114Mg1Pm]. They increase free water excretion and reduce fluid overload [^114Mg1Pm] [^114oZizi].

---

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)

**Vaptans** are indicated for SIADH or hypervolemic hyponatremia that is unresponsive to fluid restriction [^114Mg1Pm] [^116NqJCy]. Examples include tolvaptan and conivaptan [^114Mg1Pm]. Initiate in the hospital with close sodium monitoring because of the risk of rapid correction [^115U3W56].

---

### Salt tablets

Use **salt tablets** for SIADH or chronic euvolemic hyponatremia [^114Mg1Pm] [^112MGZPb]. A typical dose is 1–2 g orally three times daily to increase solute intake and promote free water excretion.

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check serum sodium every 2–4 hours during active correction [^114Mg1Pm] [^113SHKnQ].

- **Prevent overcorrection**: Use desmopressin (DDAVP) if rapid correction occurs or is anticipated [^114Mg1Pm] [^117SmC1L].

- **Relowering sodium**: If overcorrection occurs, give hypotonic fluids and/or desmopressin to re-lower sodium safely [^114Mg1Pm] [^116VvNY1] [^113Zqmc7].

## Summary of treatment approach

| **Volume status** | **Treatment** | **Additional measures** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) | Treat underlying cause [^111WX8Kf] |
| Euvolemic (SIADH) | - Fluid restriction <br/> - Salt tablets <br/> - Vaptans | Treat underlying cause |
| Hypervolemic | - Fluid restriction <br/> - Loop diuretics <br/> - Vaptans | Treat underlying cause |

## Conclusion

Management of hyponatremia in a 23-year-old male with Na 127 mmol/L and Cl 91 mmol/L focuses on **identifying the cause and volume status**, then applying targeted therapy with careful monitoring to avoid rapid correction and ODS [^113SHKnQ].

### Potassium chloride [^114Mbv4L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**:

	- Monitoring serum potassium levels is crucial, and dosages should be adjusted accordingly. For treating hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more frequently depending on the severity, until they return to normal. For maintenance or prophylaxis, monitor potassium levels monthly to bi-annually.

	- The treatment of potassium depletion, especially in patients with cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, and electrolytes. This includes magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, as well as electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as required.

- **Administration**:

	- Dilute the contents of one pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water. Take with meals or immediately after eating. If serum potassium concentration is less than 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

- **Adult dosing**:

	- Treatment of hypokalemia involves a daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq, given in 2 to 5 divided doses. Limit doses to 40 mEq per dose, and the total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

	- For maintenance or prophylaxis, the typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize the dose based on serum potassium levels. Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: Meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use.

- **Administration**: Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion?
- **Dosing**: What is the appropriate dose?
- **Administration route**: Is a central venous line necessary?
- **Concomitant treatments**: Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long?

This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115BMnj9]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

- **Appraisal of guidelines and consensus statements**: Four reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. AGREE II is an internationally validated, rigorously developed 23-item tool used to evaluate six domains of guideline development: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. The AGREE tool has also been used to assess consensus statements. The reviewers rated each item on a Likert scale from 1 ('Strongly Disagree') to 7 ('Strongly Agree').

We calculated a total score for each domain by summing up all the scores of the individual items in a domain for each reviewer and then standardizing this total as a percentage of the maximum possible score for that domain. The minimum possible score for each domain equaled the number of questions multiplied by the number of reviewers, multiplied by 1 (strongly disagree). The maximum score for a domain equaled the number of questions multiplied by the number of reviewers, multiplied by 7 (strongly agree). To ensure standardization of each reviewer's approach, all reviewers completed the online training tutorial before starting the project.

In a consensus meeting among the reviewers, we discussed every item for which scores differed by more than 1 point (e.g. 1 versus 3) on the original 7-point scale. Reviewers in turn explained the rationale for their score and had the opportunity to revise their score if needed.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: Expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic electrolyte disorder, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Potassium chloride for oral solution [^113gJdZZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**: If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

- **Administration**: Dilute the potassium chloride for oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Take with meals or immediately after eating.

- **Adult dosing**:

	- **Treatment of hypokalemia**: Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Administer in 2 to 5 divided doses, limiting doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

	- **Maintenance or prophylaxis**: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dosage based on serum potassium levels. Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. When hyponatremia is considered acute severe (4 to 6 days), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, several authors have recommended a correction rate of less than 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is challenging to diagnose whether severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed.

The modalities for treating severe hyponatremia have traditionally consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline combined with fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has demonstrated their effectiveness in inducing sustained water diuresis and facilitating the correction of hyponatremia.

### Samsca [^115U3W56]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warning: Initiate and re-initiate in a hospital and monitor serum sodium**: Samsca should be started and restarted only in a hospital setting where serum sodium can be closely monitored. Rapid correction of hyponatremia (e.g. > 12 mEq/L/24 hours) may lead to osmotic demyelination, resulting in dysarthria, mutism, dysphagia, lethargy, affective changes, spastic quadriparesis, seizures, coma, and death. For patients with severe malnutrition, alcoholism, or advanced liver disease, a slower rate of correction is advisable.

- **Not for use for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)**: Due to hepatotoxicity risks, tolvaptan should not be used for ADPKD outside of the FDA-approved REMS.

### Premature baby with extreme hyponatraemia (95 mmol per litre): a case report [^111Hkxae]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic work-up**: Table 1 presents standard laboratory data obtained on presentation, and then 12, 24, and 96 hours after treatment initiation. Figure 1 shows a timeline of blood sodium levels. From day one of life and until the baby was fully enterally fed, serum sodium was measured daily (i.e. until day 17). Sodium level remained within the normal range except for day 17 when it was 127 mmol per litre. No more measurements were done until day 24; hence, it was not possible to describe the rate of sodium drop accurately.

Blood sodium levels depend on sodium and water intake and excretion. Excretion is mainly regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and is geared towards maintenance of circulatory volume. Intake is regulated by thirst but in an artificially fed baby would be determined by the volume and tonicity of feeds. The pathogenesis of hyponatraemia in this baby has been explored: sodium dilution due to excessive fluid intake/retention. Despite receiving between 180 and 200 mL per kg per day of milk, this baby had rather poor weight gain: in the 11 days before presentation, his weight gain was a mere 60 g (Fig. 2a), whereas target weight gain is around 30 g per day. His hydration status on presentation was described as reduced (mild abdominal skin tenting), and he had clinical features of early hypovolaemic shock with vasoconstriction: tachycardia, pallor, mottled skin, and hypo-.

### Potassium chloride [^112iv5Pi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Potassium Chloride Injection is indicated in the treatment of potassium deficiency states when oral replacement is not feasible. This highly concentrated, ready-to-use potassium chloride injection is intended for the maintenance of serum potassium levels and for potassium supplementation in fluid-restricted patients who cannot accommodate additional volumes of fluid associated with potassium solutions of lower concentration. When using these products, patients should be on continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent testing for serum potassium concentration and acid-base balance.

### A young man with secondary adrenal insufficiency due to empty sella syndrome [^1128FYdF]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

In the management of hyponatremia, recent guidelines suggest that the sodium correction rate should be less than 12 mmol/L/day or even more restricted to 8 to 10 mmol/L/day. Hypokalaemia has been identified as an important risk factor for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Since corticosteroid replacement is the mainstay treatment for managing secondary adrenal insufficiency-associated hyponatremia, it is crucial to be cautious not to correct sodium levels rapidly when combining corticosteroids. The synergistic effect of corticosteroid replacement along with intravenous sodium administration could result in rapidly downregulated vasopressin.

Nevertheless, this patient presented with delirium and agitation without overcorrection of sodium after corticosteroid treatment, and decreased serum potassium was noted. A decrease in Na + ‑K + ‑ATPase activity during hypokalaemia may affect the cell's ability to preserve its volume and predispose the cell to injury by rapid osmotic stress. Once the clinical clues of sodium overcorrection develop, immediate discontinuation of sodium correction and relowering of serum sodium are necessary. The patient's symptoms were alleviated after immediate relowering of sodium and supplementation with potassium.

- **Corticosteroids and mineralocorticoid effects**: Corticosteroids, including fludrocortisone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone, also have mineralocorticoid effects resulting in sodium and water retention, potassium excretion, and transcellular potassium shift caused by hyperinsulinaemia. A decrease in serum potassium level might also arise from the mineralocorticoid effect.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, specifically concerning the management of severely symptomatic patients, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend limiting the increase in serum sodium concentration to a total of 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and an additional 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter until the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. Based on the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago.

After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### SPL drug information for potassium chloride [^112ZizF3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of potassium chloride IV:

- **Decreased serum sodium**: Use caution in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, and patients with psychogenic polydipsia. Also, be cautious with patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia, such as certain diuretics, antiepileptic, and psychotropic medications. Avoid administering potassium chloride infusion in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. Monitor serum sodium levels if use cannot be avoided.

- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as potassium chloride infusion can cause electrolyte disturbances, such as overhydration/hypervolemia and congested states, including pulmonary edema and peripheral edema. Avoid administering potassium chloride infusion in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. Monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance as needed if use cannot be avoided.

- **Increased serum chloride**: Use caution in patients with or at risk of hyperchloremia. Monitor serum chloride levels and renal function.

- **Increased serum potassium, cardiac arrhythmias**: Use extreme caution in patients at risk of hyperkalemia and/or associated with increased sensitivity to potassium, such as those with severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, congestive heart failure or AV block, as well as potassium-aggravated skeletal muscle channelopathies like hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonia congenita, and potassium-aggravated myotonia/paramyotonia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^116NqJCy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

International hyponatremia guidelines differ in their recommendations regarding the use of tolvaptan. US expert panel recommendations, while acknowledging insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, endorse its use as a second-line treatment, with appropriate monitoring and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded, and even raise the possibility that it may be a potential first-line therapy option in the future. European guidelines, however, recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatremia, primarily out of concern regarding the potential risk of excessively rapid serum sodium correction. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy used for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (up to 120 mg daily).

A US FDA safety notice was issued in 2013 limiting the use of tolvaptan in hyponatremia to less than 30 days' duration and removing the indication for patients with cirrhosis. Safe long-term tolvaptan use for up to 4 years has been reported in 111 participants in the SALTWATER trial (the SALT trial extension study), though 1 patient with cirrhosis developed hepatorenal syndrome and died, which was considered "possibly related" to tolvaptan use. So far, there are no reported cases of liver dysfunction directly attributed to the lower doses and typically short durations of tolvaptan in SIAD.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia.

- **Established practice**: Has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration.

We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), who are symptomatic, can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate. Conversely, they can suffer permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations from an American expert panel have arrived at similar conclusions regarding the extent of correction of hyponatremia, though important differences remain.

- **Review of evidence**: We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: A simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^111nqQot]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction also must be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium levels should not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

- **Study design**: Quality improvement report.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114EsrDx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care, informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. Consensus statements were defined as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia, as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia, if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting the treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

- **Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements**: We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations, as well as those of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice. However, the management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with this syndrome are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the state of management of hyponatremia due to the syndrome across various hospital settings. It aimed to identify which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ between the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and the use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1,524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1,034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in this syndrome were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a…

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. Report of the hyponatremia registry [^112GCSuE]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (HN), defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) below the lower limit of normal, is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence as high as 30–42%. HN is independently associated with mortality in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and hospitalized patients in general, and with increased hospital costs and readmission rates. Chronic HN has been linked to impaired gait and balance, increased falls and fracture rates, and osteoporosis. However, a causal role of HN for these associations is largely unproven.

Correction of severe HN of sudden onset can be genuinely lifesaving, and treatment of chronic HN associated with neurological symptoms is undeniably beneficial. Despite the widespread clinical impression that correction of less severe chronic HN is also worthwhile, evidence-based data demonstrating clinical benefit are limited.

Hypovolemic HN responds readily to volume repletion. Until recently, treatment of hypervolemic HN has been limited to fluid restriction (FR) and correction of the underlying disorder. Treatment modalities for euvolemic HN have included FR, hypertonic saline (HS), loop diuretics, demeclocycline, and urea. With the approval of the vasopressin-receptor antagonists conivaptan and tolvaptan, more targeted treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic HN became available. It remains uncertain how treatment options are employed and how correction magnitude and incidence of adverse outcomes are affected by the type of therapy. With this background, the multinational HN Registry was initiated.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^113Zqmc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The precise serum sodium threshold to commence relowering is not definitively established and may depend on clinical factors reflecting the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). European guidelines recommend prompt intervention for relowering serum sodium when there is an increase greater than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours, or greater than 8 mmol/L in any subsequent 24-hour period. A US expert panel advises considering relowering if correction exceeds 10 to 12 mmol/L/day for individuals at low to moderate risk of ODS, and endorses a more conservative threshold of 6 to 8 mmol/L within 24 hours for those at higher risk of ODS, broadly defined as a plasma sodium of less than 120 mmol/L.

Relowering of serum sodium is supported by sound physiologic principles, preclinical data, and case series in humans. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence for the best strategy. In an animal model of ODS, where rats had serum sodium reduced below 115 mmol/L for 3 days followed by excessive correction with hypertonic saline (a rise in plasma sodium greater than 25 mmol/L for at least 12 hours), relowering with an oral water bolus to achieve a correction gradient of less than 20 mmol/L per day improved mortality and histological severity of ODS compared to more modest correction that still exceeded 20 mmol/L/day, or no relowering at all. Furthermore, all rats in which the 24-hour sodium increase was limited to less than 20 mmol/L with relowering had good neurological outcomes, although mild brain lesions were observed in 20%. This contrasts with the control rats which experienced a 100% rate of histological brain damage and a 57% mortality rate.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^113SHKnQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality due to osmotically induced cerebral edema. Additionally, excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death due to osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder.

In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations, which defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal management of this disorder.

The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia. These are based on both the consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent evidence.

### Prognostic role of serum chloride levels in acute decompensated heart failure [^116Vvjer]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) can be complicated by electrolyte abnormalities, but the major focus has been on the clinical significance of serum sodium levels.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to determine the prognostic significance of serum chloride levels in relation to serum sodium levels in patients with ADHF.

- **Methods**: We reviewed 1,318 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure admitted for ADHF to the Cleveland Clinic between July 2008 and December 2013. We also validated our findings in an independent ADHF cohort from the University of Pennsylvania (n = 876).

- **Results**: Admission serum chloride levels during hospitalization for ADHF were independently and inversely associated with long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per unit change: 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92 to 0.95; p < 0.05). Results were similar in the validation cohort in unadjusted (HR per unit change for mortality risk within 1 year: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.91 to 0.95; p < 0.001) and multivariable risk-adjusted analysis (HR per unit change for mortality risk within 1 year: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92 to 0.99; p = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: These observations in a contemporary advanced ADHF cohort suggest that serum chloride levels at admission are independently and inversely associated with mortality.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1121b7dy]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

As osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) can be a devastating outcome, overcorrection should be scrupulously avoided to reduce risk. For this reason, recommended sodium correction targets often err on the conservative side for safety, particularly in those with risk factors for ODS for whom a daily correction limit of 6 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours is endorsed by US expert opinion guidelines. It is the net 24-hour change in plasma sodium (pNa) rather than the precise hourly rate of correction that is most important.

The management of patients who develop ODS is outside the scope of this review, but in brief, there are no established therapies. To maintain correction within the goal range, relowering of serum sodium with hypotonic fluid and/or desmopressin may be required if pNa targets are surpassed, and can still be beneficial even for those who have developed early symptoms of ODS. Case reports describe good outcomes after treatment of ODS with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, and zolpidem; however, it is unclear if improvements occurred as the result of these interventions. Glucocorticoids have been assessed in animal models of ODS and have shown reduced histological damage, but there are conflicting data regarding mortality benefit. Nevertheless, glucocorticoid therapy after overcorrection is recommended in US expert guidelines for those with a baseline pNa less than 120 mmol/L.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115yzmgu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

- **Desmopressin administration**: Desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone), administered either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis, has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia.

- **Clinical guidelines**: Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction.

	- **High-risk patients**: The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours.

- **Rapid onset of hyponatremia**: On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^116baiLd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Inaccuracies of estimates entered in the formulas

Among these estimates, sodium concentration in serum and infusate and volume of infusate can be accurately measured, but clinical estimates of body water with adjustments for volume abnormalities are essentially inaccurate. Figure 4 shows that the predicted effect of widely varying estimates of body water on the changes in [Na] after infusion of various volumes of 0.154 mol/L saline is relatively small. After the first infusion of saline in the illustrative patient, predicted by formula 7, [Na] values differed by only 0.7 mEq/L, whereas initial body water estimates differed by 10 L, both substantially lower than the observed [Na] value. Although variation in the estimates of body water has a small effect on the discrepancies between observed and predicted [Na], it is appropriate to use realistic values for body water in the calculations, especially in hyponatremia with pronounced hypovolemia when lower values of body water produce higher estimates of the postinfusion [Na].

- **Effect of varying body water estimates**: Figure 4 shows the change in serum sodium concentration of a patient with an initial serum sodium concentration ([Na]) of 111 mEq/L infused with various volumes of 0.154 mol/L saline. Calculations from formula 7 are shown in Table 3.

Inaccuracies of predictive formulas

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis/hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^112J1dsn]. Pituitary (2024). Low credibility.

The treatment of hyponatremia is variable, depending primarily on the extracellular fluid volume (EFV) and the severity of symptoms. In cases of severely symptomatic hyponatremia, intravenous hypertonic (3% NaCl) saline solution should be administered regardless of the EFV. In non-critical situations, rehydration with isotonic (0.9% NaCl) saline infusion is the main therapy for hyponatremia with reduced EFV. Patients with hyponatremia who have normal or increased EFV may be treated with fluid restriction, urea, loop diuretics, and vaptans. The use of tolvaptan, the only vaptan available in Europe, is restricted to patients with hyponatremia secondary to SIAD. Recently, the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in patients with SIAD has been advocated. It is noteworthy that the rate of serum sodium ([Na+]) correction is a critical issue, especially in chronic hyponatremia, because an increase beyond 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours may cause osmotic demyelination.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to support evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to aid clinicians in managing hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be grounded in a systematic review of the evidence and involve a transparent, multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may stem from a failure to meet development standards, leading to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on diagnosing and managing hyponatremia in adults and children.

For patients without risk factors, sodium correction should be limited to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: Agreeing the guidelines [^111BrHrr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The applicability of guidelines remains a major issue for clinicians who may infrequently encounter patients with either acute symptomatic hyponatraemia requiring urgent correction or profound chronic hyponatraemia with additional risk factors, such as malnutrition, hypokalaemia, or a history of alcoholism, for osmotic demyelination syndrome. It is improbable that clinicians would always be able to quickly access or fully assimilate comprehensive advice from recent scholarly publications on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia. For instance, Spasovski et al. (European Guideline Development Group) produced a 39-page clinical practice guideline, and Verbalis et al. (Expert Panel Recommendations) published an extensive narrative review spanning 42 pages. These guidelines are freely available but present several important differences, particularly in the drug treatment of chronic hyponatraemia, which may lead to confusion for clinicians.

If appropriate, fluid restriction is used in the management of chronic hyponatraemia; however, it often has limited efficacy. Additional pharmacological agents have been used, including demeclocycline, lithium, urea, loop diuretics, and vaptan drugs, such as conivaptan and tolvaptan. Tolvaptan has been used more extensively in the United States for the treatment of hypervolaemic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia than in Europe, where its use is restricted to hyponatraemia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone. The European clinical practice guideline has been widely discussed regarding these differences.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115ACxpd]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines received the highest scores for scope and purpose (median 62%; range 28% to 92%) and clarity of presentation (median 47%; range 27% to 75%), and the lowest scores for applicability (median 19%; range 10% to 68%) and editorial independence (median 19%; range 2% to 79%).

Initial appraisal results differed by more than one point on the Likert scale between two or more reviewers for 143 out of 230 items (62%). The majority of discrepancies were found in the domain of clarity of presentation, with 90% of items differing by more than one point. Group discussion resulted in changes to 287 out of 920 (31%) of individual entries. Finally, no scores differed by more than two points, and for 82% of items, scores were the same or within one point of each other.

- **Major reasons for changing an entry**:
	- Change of own opinion after clarification of other reviewers' opinions during the group discussion (180 out of 920 entries; 20%).
	- Aiming for consistency between entries given the same available data (39 out of 920; 4%).
	- Re-evaluation of the score in light of a noted comment during the appraisal process (30 out of 920; 3%).
	- Correction for available data that were overlooked during the initial appraisal (22 out of 920; 2%).
	- Misinterpretation of the question during the initial appraisal (6 out of 920; 0.7%).
	- Adjusting for arbitrary scoring of items that were felt to be inapplicable for some reason (3 out of 920; 0.3%).
	- Adjusting for inconsistent approach to dealing with the assumption that a criterion was fulfilled even if not clearly mentioned (4 out of 920; 0.4%).
	- Data entry error (3 out of 920; 0.3%).

Overall, these adjustments resulted in substantial agreement and calibration among reviewers.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, specifically in severely symptomatic patients, initial management according to the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommends considering administering bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with a sodium concentration of < 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. It is recognized that bolus infusion improves sodium concentration more quickly with less risk of overcorrection.

### Desmopressin to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia: A systematic review [^117SmC1L]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search of four databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed, and study quality was appraised.

- **Results**: The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found three strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia:
	1. Proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration.
	2. Reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output.
	3. Rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent.

A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with a lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series.

- **Conclusions**: Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^112YHSCX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically synthesize and appraise clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. In accordance with the PRISMA statement, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and reviewed an additional 337 websites of specialist societies and guideline organizations. We used AGREE II, a validated and reliable instrument, along with an adequate number of reviewers to individually appraise the guidance documents.

To resolve major discrepancies and increase consistency, we introduced an audiotaped group consensus meeting. During this meeting, reviewers could explain and justify their scores and adapt them if necessary. This generally resulted in only modest downgrading of domain scores by 1% to 10%. Most changes occurred because reviewers felt they had scored inconsistently for a similar rationale or because they had missed information during the initial appraisal that was, in fact, available in the documents.

Although the scores did not change substantially, the group felt that the discussion further highlighted the qualitative differences between the guidance documents. Furthermore, even reviewers with large deviations from the mean in their initial scores agreed with the final conclusions, indicating that the final average scores were truly a product of consensus rather than a mathematical calculation, as proposed in the original AGREE protocol. We believe that a consensus meeting is valuable in any guideline appraisal process.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, specifically for moderately symptomatic patients, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend limiting the increase in serum sodium concentration to 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/L is reached.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^112C1CHA]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, several real-world studies have reported a substantial risk of overly rapid hyponatremia correction, estimated at around 25% for individuals with a starting serum sodium of 120 mmol/liter. This significantly greater magnitude of sodium rise in real-life data compared with RCTs, as summarized in a table, is most likely explained by real-life tolvaptan use in individuals with much lower baseline serum sodium levels. The underlying explanation may be that patients starting with lower serum sodium have higher volumes of excess body water, which becomes available for renal excretion after tolvaptan administration, leading to a more pronounced aquaresis and a greater increase in serum sodium.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to healthcare problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but from different angles. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences; however, they did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life, and patient preferences should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of descriptions regarding barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to address the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are intended to aid decision-making at the point of care. However, as they are often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^113pumUb]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance, including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication, and the complications of excessive therapy, such as the osmotic demyelination syndrome.

- **Recent findings**: Correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/L within 6 hours, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/L daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial. Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls because of impaired gait and an increased likelihood of fracture due to hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

- **Table 1: Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L**

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, particularly in the management of mildly symptomatic patients in a chronic setting, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend avoiding an increase in serum sodium concentration of more than 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours, or more than 8 mmol/L during every subsequent 24-hour period in patients with moderate or profound hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition, decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis, or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but chronic mild hyponatremia is also associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, individuals with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in a hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis; testing is often inadequate, and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

### Potassium chloride [^111WdaJ9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Administration and monitoring**: Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity until they return to normal levels. For maintenance or prophylaxis, monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, and electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium. Electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient should also be monitored. Correct volume status, acid-base balance, and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

- **Administration**: Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Take with meals or immediately after eating. If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

- **Adult dosing**:

	- **Treatment of hypokalemia**: Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Administer in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

	- **Maintenance or prophylaxis**: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of using potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is under review.

Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided by replacing urinary water losses or by stopping them with desmopressin (DDAVP). Alternatively, desmopressin can be given at the beginning of therapy and at regular intervals thereafter to keep the urine concentrated until the serum sodium has been gradually returned to near-normal levels by the administration of hypertonic saline, given as a slow continuous infusion or small titrated boluses. The technique, which has been called the "DDAVP clamp", has been reported to successfully meet correction goals, but more data are needed comparing the technique to other therapeutic options.

Some experts have never accepted the term "osmotic demyelination syndrome", asserting that limits recommended by guidelines are too strict, potentially deterring physicians from providing life-saving therapy with hypertonic saline. They have maintained since the beginning of the controversy that neurologic complications from untreated or undertreated hyponatremia (such as seizures, respiratory arrests, and herniation) are more common than neurologic complications due to excessive therapy.
