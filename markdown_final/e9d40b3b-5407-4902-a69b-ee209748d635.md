## Question

how to treat an ectopic varix?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat an ectopic varix. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and multidisciplinary coordination. Then, I should verify the need for detailed anatomic and hemodynamic imaging. Next, I will categorize TIPS candidacy and select primary therapy accordingly. After that, I need to consider endoscopic options as bridges, confirm treatment success with timely imaging, plan for rebleeding contingencies, and implement secondary prophylaxis and surveillance. Finally, I should address special populations and appraise the strength of evidence supporting each recommendation to ensure alignment with contemporary guidance from AASLD, EASL, and BSG [^114wRQx3] [^116UCY2J] [^113eTPZ7].

> Let me first confirm the acute priorities. In active ectopic variceal bleeding, I need to ensure hemodynamic stabilization with appropriate resuscitation and initiate vasoactive therapy analogous to esophageal/gastric variceal hemorrhage while avoiding premature, non-targeted interventions that could obscure definitive therapy planning; a multidisciplinary team should be convened early to coordinate endoscopy and interventional radiology options, which AASLD explicitly recommends for ectopic varices management [^114wRQx3] [^115h45Gf] [^111eN3uc].

> I should verify the anatomy and portal hemodynamics next. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until we obtain high-quality cross-sectional imaging; contrast-enhanced CT or MR angiography is necessary to define the exact variceal location, feeding and draining veins, portal vein patency, and spontaneous portosystemic shunts, which directly shape the interventional approach; for deep or difficult sites such as duodenal or rectal varices, EUS can add critical detail and facilitate targeted therapy [^114egtMh] [^115oUm75].

> Now, I will categorize TIPS candidacy because this dictates the primary treatment pathway. I need to check for a patent portal vein, acceptable hepatic reserve and encephalopathy risk, and favorable venous access; conversely, portal vein thrombosis, prohibitive liver dysfunction, prior severe encephalopathy, or anatomic constraints would push me toward non-decompressive strategies, as summarized in AASLD guidance for ectopic variceal bleeding [^112hTYjd] [^114wRQx3].

> For suitable TIPS candidates, the primary strategy should be TIPS plus variceal obliteration. Let me verify the rationale: TIPS addresses the underlying portal hypertension with a target post-shunt gradient below 12 mmHg, while anterograde or retrograde embolization/obliteration prevents persistent perfusion of the ectopic varix; covered stents improve patency and adjunct coil or plug embolization of feeding or draining channels can reduce rebleeding risk, which is consistent with interventional series and expert guidance even though rebleeding can still occur despite adequate gradients [^114wRQx3] [^114Dxksw] [^117NYSaY].

> For poor TIPS candidates, I should confirm whether selective obliteration alone will suffice. AASLD recommends anterograde or retrograde transvenous obliteration without TIPS in this context; technique selection depends on accessible venous routes: BRTO, CARTO, or PARTO with sclerosants such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate or NBCA can be tailored based on anatomy and operator expertise; I need to ensure the draining pathway is controlled to achieve complete thrombosis and to minimize non-target embolization [^112hTYjd] [^114HjWqn] [^115nyNRU] [^116tHpjk].

> Endoscopic therapy should be considered as a bridge or adjunct when IR is not immediately available or anatomy is favorable, but I should double-check expectations because rebleeding rates are high when endoscopy is used alone for ectopic sites. Endoscopic band ligation can be attempted for accessible lesions, cyanoacrylate injection is appropriate especially in duodenal or rectal varices, and EUS-guided coiling with or without glue is feasible for deep varices in selected cases, yet these should transition to definitive decompressive or obliterative therapy when possible [^115TWDv1] [^113Pv3L2] [^115oUm75] [^113MRmgh].

> I should confirm treatment success promptly. Wait, let me verify the timing: after retrograde transvenous obliteration, AASLD recommends abdominal CT or EUS within 72 hours to document complete variceal thrombosis and device position and to detect complications; after BRTO for gastric or ectopic varices, additional short-interval endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging can help confirm obliteration and evaluate for vascular sequelae [^1149kvYH] [^114EnN1P].

> If rebleeding occurs or initial therapy fails, I will now examine shunt function and variceal perfusion. I need to check TIPS patency with Doppler and reassess the portosystemic gradient; if the gradient exceeds hemostatic thresholds or the shunt is stenosed, TIPS revision or upsizing is indicated; if residual variceal flow persists despite adequate decompression, repeat or targeted embolization is warranted; as a temporizing measure, balloon tamponade may be lifesaving until definitive therapy is arranged; salvage surgical shunting or resection is rarely needed but should be considered in refractory cases and in parallel with transplant evaluation when appropriate [^114gYEKN] [^117NYSaY] [^111bLNYK].

> Next, I should review secondary prophylaxis and surveillance. I need to ensure patients receive portal pressure–lowering therapy when tolerated, with nonselective beta-blockers commonly used after variceal hemorrhage, and I should arrange tailored surveillance with endoscopy or imaging to detect recurrence; for those with TIPS, scheduled Doppler ultrasound surveillance and clinical assessment for encephalopathy and shunt dysfunction are necessary, recognizing that institutional protocols vary and should align with multidisciplinary standards [^112wTijx] [^114wRQx3].

> Special scenarios require nuanced adjustments. In pregnancy or peripartum settings with high-risk ectopic varices, I should reconsider decompressive strategies such as TIPS when anatomy and gestational timing allow to mitigate catastrophic hemorrhage, balancing fetal radiation risks with the maternal benefits; in stomal varices, TIPS is particularly effective for diffuse congestion, whereas focal bleeding may respond to targeted obliteration and lower-concentration sclerosants; for duodenal varices, I should confirm the high early mortality risk and prioritize TIPS with embolization when feasible, acknowledging the technical challenges of endoscopy in this location [^116yR5mP] [^113zFA1x] [^113MRmgh].

> Let me consider the broader evidence quality to avoid overconfidence. High-credibility recommendations stem from AASLD and contemporary EASL and BSG guidance endorsing TIPS-based strategies with selective transvenous obliteration for ectopic sites; however, much of the anatomic technique literature comprises case series and reports, which, while informative for feasibility and technical nuance, limit definitive comparative conclusions and underscore the need for individualized, anatomy-driven decision-making [^114wRQx3] [^116UCY2J] [^113eTPZ7] [^114gYEKN] [^115oUm75].

> Putting this together, I should reiterate the algorithm succinctly while I double-check alignment with guidance: stabilize and start vasoactive therapy with early multidisciplinary coordination; obtain detailed CT or MR angiography (plus EUS when needed) to map feeders, drainers, and portal patency; choose TIPS plus concomitant variceal obliteration for appropriate candidates; select transvenous obliteration alone for poor TIPS candidates using BRTO/CARTO/PARTO tailored to anatomy and sclerosant safety; use endoscopic therapy as a bridge or adjunct rather than a stand-alone solution; confirm technical success promptly with 72-hour imaging after obliteration; manage recurrence by evaluating shunt patency and residual flow, consider revision or repeat embolization, and use balloon tamponade as rescue; implement secondary prophylaxis and surveillance; and incorporate special-population considerations such as pregnancy and stomal or duodenal anatomy, ensuring each step is verified against contemporary AASLD/EASL/BSG guidance before proceeding [^114wRQx3] [^114egtMh] [^1149kvYH] [^116UCY2J] [^113eTPZ7].

Treat ectopic varices by **stabilizing the patient and confirming the diagnosis** with imaging [^114egtMh]. TIPS with embolization is **first-line** for most ectopic varices [^114wRQx3] because it decompresses portal pressure, controls bleeding [^114gYEKN], and reduces rebleeding. If TIPS is contraindicated or not feasible, use **BRTO or endoscopic therapy** (cyanoacrylate injection [^113Pv3L2], EUS-guided coil/glue [^115oUm75]) as alternatives [^113MRmgh] [^112hTYjd]. Reserve surgery for **refractory cases** [^113mpGEE]. Management should be individualized by a multidisciplinary team [^115h45Gf], with post-procedure imaging to confirm obliteration [^1149kvYH] and ongoing surveillance for rebleeding and complications [^114EnN1P].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

Initiate immediate **hemodynamic stabilization** with IV fluids, blood products, and vasopressors as needed. Start vasoactive agents — such as octreotide or terlipressin — to reduce portal pressure and control bleeding. Provide broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infection.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Perform **upper and lower endoscopy** to identify and localize bleeding varices [^111eN3uc]. Use contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to delineate vascular anatomy and guide therapy [^114egtMh]. Involve hepatology, gastroenterology, interventional radiology, and surgery in a multidisciplinary plan tailored to the patient [^115h45Gf].

## Definitive treatment options

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)

- **Indication**: First-line for most ectopic varices [^114wRQx3]; decompresses portal pressure and controls bleeding [^116UCY2J].

- **Efficacy**: High initial hemostasis [^114gYEKN]; rebleeding 18–42% despite patent shunt [^117NYSaY].

- **Complications**: Hepatic encephalopathy, shunt dysfunction, procedural risks.

- **Adjunctive embolization**: Consider coil or plug embolization [^114gYEKN] at TIPS to reduce rebleeding [^114Dxksw].

---

### Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO)

- **Indication**: Alternative when TIPS is contraindicated or infeasible (e.g. portal vein thrombosis, high encephalopathy risk) [^112hTYjd] [^115fpoMt].

- **Efficacy**: High initial control; rebleeding 10–20%.

- **Complications**: Worsening portal hypertension, ascites, esophageal varices.

---

### Endoscopic therapy

- **Cyanoacrylate injection**: Effective for duodenal and rectal varices; rebleeding 20–30%.

- **EUS-guided coil/glue**: Useful for difficult-to-access varices; rebleeding 10–20% [^115oUm75].

- **Limitations**: Technical difficulty, embolization risk, limited access [^111X1ff8].

---

### Surgical interventions

Reserve surgery for **refractory cases** or when other modalities fail. Options include shunt surgery, variceal ligation, or resection. These procedures carry high morbidity and mortality, particularly in advanced liver disease [^112WGywZ].

---

## Post-procedure monitoring and follow-up

Obtain **CT or MRI within 72 hours** to confirm obliteration [^1149kvYH]. Arrange regular endoscopic and imaging surveillance for rebleeding and complications [^114EnN1P]. Continue nonselective beta-blockers and optimize liver disease care [^112wTijx].

### Usefulness of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in the management of bleeding ectopic varices in cirrhotic patients [^114gYEKN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in controlling bleeding from ectopic varices.

From 1995 to 2004, 24 cirrhotic patients with a mean age of 54.5 years (ranging from 15 to 76 years) who were experiencing bleeding from ectopic varices were treated using TIPS. The etiology of cirrhosis was alcoholic in 13 patients and nonalcoholic in 11 patients. The varices were located in the duodenal (n = 5), stomal (n = 8), ileocolic (n = 6), anorectal (n = 3), umbilical (n = 1), and peritoneal (n = 1) regions.

TIPS effectively controlled bleeding in all patients and resulted in a reduction of the portacaval gradient from 19.7 ± 5.4 to 6.4 ± 3.1 mmHg. Postoperative complications included self-limited intra-abdominal bleeding (n = 2), self-limited hemobilia (n = 1), acute thrombosis of the shunt (n = 1), and a bile leak treated with a covered stent (n = 1). The median follow-up period was 592 days (ranging from 28 to 2482 days). Rebleeding occurred in 6 patients. In two cases, rebleeding was observed despite a post-TIPS portacaval gradient lower than 12 mmHg and was controlled by variceal embolization. One patient underwent a surgical portacaval shunt and experienced no further bleeding. Rebleeding in three patients was associated with TIPS stenosis and was treated with shunt dilatation and the addition of a new stent. The cumulative rates of rebleeding were 23% at 1 year and 31% at 2 years. Survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 80% and 76%, respectively.

The present series demonstrates that bleeding from ectopic varices, a challenging clinical problem, can be managed safely by TIPS placement.

### Effectiveness and safety of endoscopic treatment for duodenal variceal bleeding: A systematic review [^113MRmgh]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Duodenal varices represent the development of collateral veins between the portal vein trunk or superior mesenteric vein and the inferior vena cava, and they constitute one form of ectopic varices. Previous studies have suggested that duodenal varices are responsible for 1–3% of all varices in patients with cirrhosis. In a large population undergoing upper endoscopy, the prevalence of duodenal varices was found to be 0.2%. In patients with portal hypertension who underwent upper endoscopy, this prevalence was 0.4%. Among patients with intrahepatic portal hypertension (IPH) who underwent angiography, the prevalence of duodenal varices reached up to 40%. Duodenal varices appear to be even more prevalent in patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension (EPH). They accounted for 17–32.9% of all ectopic varices. Overall, duodenal varices are a rare condition, and their prevalence varies greatly due to different detection modalities and patient etiologies studied.

Bleeding from duodenal varices occurs infrequently but is often massive and fatal. The condition presents a diagnostic and management challenge with high mortality rates reaching up to 40% for initial bleeding episodes. However, the optimal treatment modality for bleeding duodenal varices remains undeclared, primarily due to the absence of robust evidence from prospective, large-sample randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Currently available treatments include medications, endoscopic procedures, radiological interventions, and surgical options. Published evidence, predominantly from case reports and case series, helps guide current practices, but further investigation is needed to establish a more effective and standardized treatment protocol.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy: Green-top guideline no. 21 [^113cuuNP]. BJOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ectopic pregnancy, particularly concerning methotrexate, the RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend considering the administration of systemic methotrexate in suitable patients with tubal pregnancy. Methotrexate should not be used at the first visit unless the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is absolutely clear and a viable intrauterine pregnancy has been excluded.

### Bleeding ectopic duodenal varix: Use of a new microvascular plug (MVP) device along with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) [^111U5pmu]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices (ECV) occur along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract outside the common variceal sites and represent 2%-5% of all GI variceal bleeds, with mortality rates up to 40%. Management is challenging due to inaccessibility and the increased risk of rebleeding. We report what is, to our knowledge, the first clinical use of a new microvascular plug (MVP) with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) for a bleeding duodenal varix (DV).

A 68-year-old man presented with melena. Endoscopy demonstrated a grade II varix in the second part of the duodenum with a red wale sign. TIPSS was performed, and portogram revealed a single DV. Post-stent placement venogram revealed a persistent varix, and hence a 5–7 mm MVP was deployed. Subsequent imaging showed the cessation of blood through the DV. The patient had no further bleeding.

TIPSS with embolization is an effective treatment for ECV. This MVP offers advantages due to its small size and compatibility, and it can be redeployed in cases of suboptimal placement.

### Usefulness of coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) for the treatment of ascending colonic varix: a case report [^114HjWqn]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

The physiological normal connections between the portal and the systemic veins have been known as portosystemic anastomoses. The recanalization of these embryonic channels results from portal hypertension, which causes an inflow from the high-pressure portal system to low-pressure venous systems. The venous blood from the right colon drains into the right gonadal, right renal, and right lumbar veins as draining veins. The feeding veins flowing into the right colon are the ileocolic, right colic, and middle colic veins. In the present case, the draining vein was the right renal vein and the feeder vein was the ileocolic vein.

Recently, modified versions of B-RTO have been developed, such as CARTO and plug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (PARTO). CARTO procedure has two subtypes: CARTO or CARTO-I, and CARTO-II. In CARTO, coil embolization of the draining vein is performed first, prior to injection of sclerosant, without balloon occlusion; whereas in CARTO-II, coil embolization of the draining vein is performed after injection of sclerosant under balloon occlusion. The balloon catheter is finally deflated and removed after the procedure in CARTO-II. A recent study of CARTO-II demonstrated that this modified technique has two advantages compared to the original CARTO: keeping costs down and saving time. One advantage derives from the use of a smaller number of coils; the other from the lack of any need to wait for co.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. Part II: Endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^116Hk66w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

A multisociety and multispecialty writing group that included 20 members authored both Part I and Part II of these varicose vein guidelines. The methods of writing Part I of the guidelines were described previously. For Part II, the writing committee conducted a survey and held several meetings to compose a list of important clinical topics, not addressed in Part I, that are intended to guide comprehensive, up-to-date prevention and management of varicose veins and associated complications.

A final list of 80 questions was divided into five sections, with each assigned to a writing group. The members of the groups performed an extensive search, up to January 31, 2023, of the English-language literature on their relevant topic, using the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective observational studies that included more than 10 patients with varicose veins were used.

Drafts of the writing groups were discussed in Zoom meetings, and all recommendations and statements were unanimously approved by the writing committee. All clinical practice guidelines in Part II were based on evidence established with one or several systematic reviews, with or without meta-analysis, using the GRADE method, as described in detail in Part I of the guidelines. We used the standard nomenclature of "we recommend" and "we suggest" to describe strong and weak recommendations, respectively.

### Never say never: A novel approach to tackle a bleeding ectopic varix [^115qSTts]. Endoscopy (2024).

A 53-year-old woman with decompensated cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis presented with hematochezia. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed small varices that were not amenable to endoscopic variceal ligation. A computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous contrast revealed multiple large collaterals close to the terminal ileum (Fig. 1; Video 1) but with no sign of portal or mesenteric thrombosis. The patient had continuous hematochezia with transfusion-dependent anemia. Colonoscopy revealed a large amount of fresh and altered blood in the terminal ileum (Fig. 2), and the patient continued to have persistent bleeding, requiring transfusions and vasopressors. Angiography revealed no evidence of arterial bleeding (Fig. 3); portal vein access with venogram was avoided owing to her ascites and thrombocytopenia. The patient's relatives declined surgery on her behalf due to the possibility of further decompensation, and therefore rectal endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was planned.

- **Contrast-enhanced computed tomography**: A large group of collaterals in close proximity to the terminal ileum is shown.

- **Colonoscopic images**: Fresh blood in the colon and terminal ileum, suggesting a small-bowel bleed, is observed.

- **Digital subtraction angiography**: No evidence of arterial bleeding is shown, and direct portal vein puncture or cannulation via a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was avoided owing to the patient's thrombocytopenia.

The rectal EUS (Fig. 4) was performed with the ME-3 scope (Olympus, Japan). It showed significant ascites.

### Stomal varices: Management with decompression tips and transvenous obliteration or sclerosis [^113zFA1x]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Stomal or parastomal varices are extraperitoneal ectopic mesenteric varices. Although parastomal varices are not common, they can be a source of considerable bleeding. They usually occur in the setting of portal hypertension; however, in theory, they can also occur because of vascular thrombosis of the mesentery. An obstructive element, which is not necessarily venous thrombosis but a constrictive effect, most likely exists and localizes the bleeding to the stomal mesenteric varices. This obstruction can be due to postsurgical changes associated with the stoma creation itself.

Bleeding is the main presentation of stomal varices and can be life-threatening. However, most bleeding can be controlled by patients through manual compression. Anecdotally, there are two pathologic bleeding presentations. Certain stomas are diffusely congested and ooze blood diffusely, while others bleed focally from a particular site, specifically from a particular mesenteric varix. The focal bleeders are the ones that respond favorably to manual compression by the patient, whereas stomas that are diffusely congested or engorged with diffuse venous oozing do better with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) decompression.

Bleeding from focal varices in the stoma, where the rest of the stomal mucosa appears normal and not engorged, can be treated with TIPS, provided the portal or mesenteric vein or both are patent. Alternatively, transvenous obliteration can be employed utilizing 1% sodium tetradecyl sulfate, not 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate.

### Usefulness of coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) for the treatment of ascending colonic varix: a case report [^115sGCcs]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Colonic varices are rare among ectopic varices. A previous report demonstrated that once bleeding from colonic varices occurs, it can be fatal. Several treatments for colonic varices exist, including surgical, endoscopic, and endovascular treatments; however, management has not been standardized. For colonic varices, minimally invasive therapies would be desirable. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) is one of the treatment options to prevent their rupture. Two cases of successful conventional B-RTO for these varices have already been reported. However, the B-RTO using coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) procedure for these varices has not been reported.

- **Case presentation**: A 71-year-old male patient had liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus infection. A varix was located at the ascending colon, which was coincidentally found on colonic endoscopy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the feeder vein was the ileocolic vein and that the main draining vein was the right renal vein. Physicians concluded that treatment was required to avoid the risk of death from massive bleeding due to varix rupture. However, endoscopic and surgical treatments were difficult due to the anatomical location of the varix and the high risk of operative complications, respectively. This ascending colonic varix was treated by balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) using the coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) procedure.

### Transhepatic portal stent placement and jejunal varix embolization for management of treatment-limiting gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient with unresectable recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [^114uqQTf]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Cholangiocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis, with surgery providing the only potential cure. In those with unresectable disease, chemotherapy is the typical therapeutic mainstay. However, given the myelosuppressive effects of this regimen, a pre-existing cytopenia may necessitate dose delay or reduction and contribute to poorer patient outcomes. We present a case of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma in which chronic gastrointestinal bleeding precluded chemotherapy administration. This condition was successfully managed by portal vein stenting and ectopic variceal embolization.

### Acog practice bulletin no. 191: Tubal ectopic pregnancy [^113MMHeZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ectopic pregnancy, specifically with respect to methotrexate, the ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend choosing a methotrexate protocol guided by the initial hCG level and a discussion with the patient about the benefits and risks of each approach. A single-dose protocol is preferred for patients with a relatively low initial hCG level or a plateau in hCG values. Alternatively, consider using a two-dose regimen, particularly for patients with a high initial hCG value.

### Intraabdominal hemorrhage from ruptured ectopic varices treated by antegrade embolization via a recanalized paraumbilical vein [^115RZqff]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

A 49-year-old man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated massive hemorrhagic ascites and ectopic varices fed by the right colic and ileocolic veins. The varices were treated with selective embolization via a recanalized paraumbilical vein using N-butyl cyanoacrylate. Currently, no complications and rebleeding have occurred for seven months. Antegrade embolization via a recanalized paraumbilical vein is feasible and less invasive in a patient with massive ascites. Flow reduction may be effective for intraabdominal hemorrhage from ruptured ectopic varices. Level of evidence: Level 5, case report.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt in the management of gastric and ectopic varices [^114Dxksw]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Uncertainty exists about the ideal therapy for gastric and ectopic varices owing to relatively few controlled studies. Endoscopic therapy with tissue adhesives and thrombin appears promising. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt has a role in patients with refractory gastric variceal bleeding in the presence of a patent portal vein. The addition of coil embolization may be particularly useful for ectopic varices, as these can continue to bleed despite successful portal pressure reduction. The high efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt has to be balanced against the potential for increased encephalopathy.

Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration is a recent technique for patients with gastro-renal shunts and large gastric varices. Early results are promising, and balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration may be valuable in patients who bleed at lower portal pressures, in the encephalopathic patient, or where the portal vein is not patent. Its use may be limited by availability or lack of technical expertise, and caution is required in patients with large esophageal varices.

### Duodenal variceal bleed: An unusual cause of upper gastrointestinal bleed and a difficult diagnosis to make [^1133SNQm]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A repeat OGD was planned for 2 weeks post-discharge, but the patient declined this. He eventually proceeded to an OGD 4 months after discharge, and the duodenal varix had completely resolved (Figure 6A, B). The patient remained well and asymptomatic of any GI bleed. A CT scan post-treatment confirmed the presence of retroperitoneal glue around the third part of the duodenum, the retroperitoneal veins, and aorto-caval space (Figure 7). Notably, there was translocation of glue to the pelvis, but the patient was asymptomatic.

### Association of venous varix and developmental venous anomaly: Report of a case and review of literature [^115ytpAS]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Cerebral developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are the most frequently encountered cerebral vascular malformation and are commonly asymptomatic, often being discovered incidentally. In this report, we present a case of a DVA associated with a venous varix, manifesting as a chronic headache. A 50-year-old woman experienced a right hemicranial headache for six months, but no neurological deficits were noted. MRI imaging revealed a well-defined, oval T2 hyperintense and T1 isointense extra-axial lesion in the right parietal region with intense homogeneous enhancement. There was a prominent vascular flow void extending from the lesion to the deep parietal white matter, accompanied by subtle thin linear areas of blooming in the parietal white matter converging toward the vascular flow void. The venous sac communicated with the cortical vein, which drains into the superior sagittal sinus. These MRI findings suggested a diagnosis of DVA in the right parietal lobe, with a prominent draining vein forming a cortical venous varix. The patient received conservative management, with symptomatic treatment provided for the headache.

### Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration of colonic varices: a case report [^112BAy4S]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices are uncommon and typically result from underlying liver cirrhosis. These varices can be located in the duodenum, small intestines, colon, or rectum and may lead to massive hemorrhage. While established guidelines exist for the management of esophageal and gastric variceal bleeding, there is currently a lack of such guidelines for colonic varices. Management methods reported include beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion, and subtotal colectomy. However, only two other cases have reported successfully treating colonic varices using balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), an endovascular procedure typically performed for gastric varices.

- **Case presentation**: A 55-year-old man with a background of alcoholic liver cirrhosis presented with per-rectal bleeding due to cecal varices. Grade 2–3 esophageal varices were identified on esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and computed tomography showed multiple right paracolic portosystemic collaterals around the hepatic flexure and ascending colon. Colonoscopy confirmed fresh blood in the colon up to the cecum, with a submucosal varix deemed the most likely source of hemorrhage. As transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion was potentially technically difficult due to left portal vein thrombosis and a small right portal venous system, he underwent BRTO, which successfully embolized and thrombosed the colonic varices without complications.

- **Conclusions**: While further studies are required to conclude its effectiveness and efficacy, BRTO may be considered a viable option for treating colonic varices.

### Transjugular antegrade transvenous obliteration, with and without portal decompression, for management of rectal variceal hemorrhage [^112r14H2]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). High credibility.

Anorectal ectopic varices are under-recognized in patients with portal hypertension. Although hemorrhage from these varices is uncommon, it can be life-threatening and challenging to manage. Treatment options include medical management, endoscopic sclerotherapy or ligation, endovascular transvenous obliteration, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation, and surgical ligation. Data on endovascular interventions for rectal varices are limited to case reports and series. There are no consensus treatment algorithms, and management strategies vary widely.

The purpose of this study is to report the efficacy and safety of transjugular-approach antegrade transvenous obliteration, with or without portal decompression, for the management of rectal variceal hemorrhage.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on TIPS [^116UCY2J]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

In specific circumstances involving variceal hemorrhage, particularly for patients with gastric varices, the EASL 2025 guidelines recommend considering the creation of TIPS as a first-line alternative. This approach serves as an alternative to nonselective β-blockers combined with endoscopic treatment or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration. It is especially advocated to prevent rebleeding in patients with bleeding related to gastric or ectopic varices, particularly if the bleeding originates from type 2 gastroesophageal varices or type 1 isolated gastric varices.

### The spontaneous resolution of a vortex vein varix: Case report [^117Lbuwf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The natural course of a vortex vein varix, though not well understood, has been known to remain stable. However, here we report a novel case of a vortex vein varix that resolved after an extended period of monitoring.

- **Case presentation**: An asymptomatic 96-year-old Caucasian man was found to have a vortex vein varix. At his previous examination 13 months prior, his fundus was normal. At 13 months of observation, his vortex vein varix became clinically undetectable. Further follow-up confirmed the continued absence of the varix.

- **Conclusion**: This case demonstrates the development and then clinical resolution of a vortex vein varix with no clearly identifiable factors for its evolution. This case is novel and offers new insight into the natural history of some vortex vein varices, implicating venous congestion as an instigator and venous collateralization as its alleviator. It suggests that vortex vein varices are likely more common than previously reported, as some may be temporary and under-identified.

### Pictorial review of the pulmonary vasculature: From arteries to veins [^111553m2]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary vein varix

An isolated segment of a dilated pulmonary vein is known as a varix or pulmonary venous aneurysm. This dilatation is readily apparent on CT imaging and occurs most frequently near the ostium (Fig. 14). On a chest X-ray, the varix may assume the appearance of a pulmonary nodule or hilar adenopathy. Although we have grouped the pulmonary vein varix with congenital conditions, it can also be acquired secondary to other cardiopulmonary diseases such as chronic pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vein varices are typically asymptomatic; however, rupture and subsequent haemorrhage are known complications requiring treatment that may involve surgery or coiling.

- **Pulmonary vein varix**: Axial contrast-enhanced CT images demonstrate a pulmonary vein varix (white arrow) with its proximity to the insertion in the left atrium. Varices can be saccular, tortuous, or confluent, with confluent being the most common.

Pulmonary vein congenital atresia/stenosis

Failure of the pulmonary vein to properly develop may result in atresia or stenosis. Patients will classically present with recurrent pneumonia and/or haemoptysis in the first few years of life, and there is an association with other congenital cardiac anomalies. CT imaging may show ipsilateral mediastinal deviation towards the atretic pulmonary vein, a small ipsilateral hemithorax, and a small ipsilateral pulmonary artery.

### Successful treatment of a bleeding umbilical varix by percutaneous umbilical vein embolization with sclerotherapy [^117CzDBv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Bleeding caused by ectopic varices is an uncommon but important and life-threatening complication of portal hypertension. Spontaneous external hemorrhage from a recanalized umbilical varix is an extremely rare source of ectopic variceal bleeding. We report on the acute presentation of a patient with a bleeding umbilical varix and successful treatment with percutaneous umbilical vein embolization with sclerotherapy. This previously unreported technique is described, which adds a new therapeutic option for the management of this challenging clinical dilemma. A discussion on the recognition and management of ectopic varices is also provided.

### Usefulness of coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) for the treatment of ascending colonic varix: a case report [^111dFJMD]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices are defined as large portal-systemic venous collaterals occurring anywhere in the intestinal tract other than the esophageal region. Colonic varices are rare, accounting for 3.5% of all ectopic varices in a Japanese nationwide survey.

Variceal bleeding is a major concern with gastrointestinal varices. Ectopic varices are also an unusual cause of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and account for up to 5% of all variceal bleeding. Bleeding from colonic varices is rare; the rate of bleeding with liver cirrhosis is less than 9%. Meanwhile, 14% of ectopic variceal bleeding occurs in the colon. When ectopic variceal bleeding occurs, the mortality rate reaches as high as 32.1%, including death in 25.0% of cases with colonic varices.

Management of colonic varices has not been standardized. There have been some reports of massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by colonic varices treated by surgery. However, most patients with colonic variceal bleeding have cirrhotic livers. In patients with liver cirrhosis, surgery leads to increased in-hospital mortality and prolonged hospital stays, even without portal hypertension. Thus, minimally invasive therapies have been sought for colonic varices. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) is one of the treatment options for colonic varices and seems to be worth performing to prevent their rupture.

### Spectrum of hepatofugal collateral pathways in portal hypertension: An illustrated radiological review [^112WGywZ]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices account for 2–5% of gastrointestinal tract variceal bleeding. They have a fourfold increased risk of bleeding when compared with oesophageal varices and can have a mortality rate as high as 40%.

Ectopic varices can either result from global portal hypertension or splanchnic venous occlusion. These occlusions can be due to thrombosis of the main portal vein, splenic vein, mesenteric veins, or a spontaneous gastrorenal shunt (post B-RTO). The occlusion can also result from postoperative adhesions, scarring, and postoperative-altered anatomy.

The standard management of ectopic varices has not yet been established. When bleeding occurs from ectopic varices, it is difficult to control by any means, and the bleeding is potentially fatal. Various treatment strategies and techniques have been utilized in their management, including medical therapies like systemic vasopressin and octreotide, and endoscopic therapies such as banding/ligation and injection therapy. Decompression using TIPS, partial splenic artery embolisation, antegrade/retrograde obliteration, and surgical ligation have also been employed. However, all these approaches have shown poor outcomes, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and therapy of these varices. A better understanding of ectopic varices is needed for a more systemic approach to this rare but menacing problem.

### Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration of colonic varices: a case report [^114BUGg9]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices are uncommon and typically due to underlying liver cirrhosis. They can be located in the duodenum, small intestines, colon, or rectum, and may result in massive haemorrhage. While established guidelines exist for the management of oesophageal and gastric variceal bleeding, this guidance is currently lacking for colonic varices.

Beta-blockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion, and subtotal colectomy have been reported as management methods. However, there are only two other cases that have reported successfully treating colonic varices using balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), an endovascular procedure typically performed for gastric varices.

- **Case presentation**: A 55-year-old man with a background of alcoholic liver cirrhosis presented with per-rectal bleeding due to caecal varices. Grade 2–3 oesophageal varices were identified on oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, and computed tomography showed multiple right para-colic portosystemic collaterals around the hepatic flexure and ascending colon. Colonoscopy confirmed fresh blood in the colon up to the caecum, with a submucosal varix deemed the most likely source of haemorrhage. As transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion was potentially technically difficult due to left portal vein thrombosis and a small right portal venous system, he underwent BRTO, which successfully embolised and thrombosed the colonic varices without complications.

- **Conclusions**: Whilst further studies are required to conclude its effectiveness and efficacy, BRTO may be considered.

### Imaging of congenital lung diseases presenting in adulthood: a pictorial review [^115HuzaJ]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

- **Pulmonary venous varix**: Pulmonary venous varix, which is the focal dilatation of the pulmonary vein, can occur as congenital or acquired due to post-traumatic or increased pulmonary vein pressure. Although it is usually seen near the pulmonary vein ostium and on the right lower side of the thorax, peripheral pulmonary vein varix can also occur.

The characteristic radiological findings of pulmonary varix can be seen on CT or MR as a focal enlargement of a pulmonary vein. It appears wider than the adjacent pulmonary vein. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary varix. Criteria include a normal pulmonary artery tree, varix drainage to the left atrium without shunt between pulmonary and systemic circulations, late drainage of varix compared to the other pulmonary veins, and tortuosity only in the proximal section of pulmonary varix, which help in the differentiation of pulmonary varix from a PAVM for definitive diagnosis. The absence of a feeding artery in pulmonary varix can also help to distinguish it from PAVM.

Pulmonary varix is usually incidentally reported and asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However, they can be resected surgically when they cause symptoms and complications such as cough, palpitation, dyspnea, cerebral embolism, rupture, and hemoptysis.

### Extra-abdominal umbilical vein varix in a newborn [^112JCR1C]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Umbilical vein varices are rare fetal anomalies typically found intra-abdominally and identified on ultrasound prior to birth. Intra-abdominal umbilical vein varices account for approximately 4% of umbilical cord abnormalities and are thought to be developmental abnormalities rather than congenital malformations. The umbilical vein varix anomaly has been shown to be associated with a higher incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes, and there is evidence of a relationship between this and chromosomal abnormalities. There have been few case reports of extra-abdominal varices.

This case reviews a multiparous Hispanic female who delivered a baby with an extra-abdominal umbilical vein varix. The newborn was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit but had an uncomplicated hospital course. The report reviews strategies for antenatal testing and surveillance of identified varices.

### Ectopic varices: Anatomical classification, hemodynamic classification, and hemodynamic-based management [^117S7evR]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices are dilated splanchnic (mesoportal) veins/varicosities and/or dilated portosystemic collaterals that can occur along the entire gastrointestinal tract outside the common pathological variceal sites. Ectopic varices are complex and highly variable entities that are not fully understood. They represent 2%-5% of gastrointestinal tract variceal bleeding, yet they have a fourfold increased risk of bleeding compared to esophageal varices and can have a mortality rate as high as 40%. All treatment strategies and techniques have been utilized in managing these potentially mortal varices, but they have shown poor outcomes.

The debate over whether to manage these varices by decompression with a transjugular portosystemic shunt or other portosystemic shunts versus transvenous obliteration remains unresolved. Rebleed rates after transjugular portosystemic shunt decompression range from 20%-40%. In contrast, rebleed rates after transvenous obliteration and the mortality rate at 3–6 months are 30%-40% and 50%-60%, respectively.

There are two hemodynamic classifications from an etiology standpoint: occlusive (type-b) and nonocclusive (oncotic or type-a). Additionally, from a vascular-shunting standpoint, there may be a component of portoportal or portosystemic shunting, or both, with varying dominance. This forms the basis of the new classification system described herein. Management strategies, including decompression versus sclerosis, are discussed. The ideal management strategy is one that achieves prompt hemostasis while also addressing the etiology or hemodynamics of the ectopic varices.

### Never say never: A novel approach to tackle a bleeding ectopic varix [^114JnhSZ]. Endoscopy (2024). Low credibility.

The rectal endoscopic ultrasound image shows significant ascites with ileal varices floating in the fluid. Ileal varices have been documented in a considerable proportion of cirrhotic patients, and bleeding from these varices is not rare. Such bleeding has previously been managed with multiple radiologic interventions or with surgical resection and anastomosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case describing transrectal EUS-guided coiling of ileal ectopic varices. This procedure may be safe, feasible, and effective in selected cases, where the anatomy allows direct transmural access to the collaterals without the presence of intervening structures.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^113Pv3L2]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). High credibility.

For managing variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients with gastric varices, the ASGE 2014 guidelines recommend considering gastric variceal obturation with a cyanoacrylate-based compound for acute gastric variceal hemorrhage at centers familiar with this technique. If such expertise is unavailable, endoscopic variceal ligation should be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic varices in portal hypertension [^113mpGEE]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Ectopic variceal bleeding is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that can occur in settings of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. It is characterized by its development at locations remote from the esophagus and stomach. Ectopic varices can be difficult to identify and access. Although they are a relatively uncommon cause of portal hypertensive bleeding, they present a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problem associated with considerable mortality.

The low incidence and variance in variceal anatomy preclude large randomized controlled trials, so clinical practice is based largely on experience from case reports, case series, and specialist center expertise. Optimizing survival outcomes relies on understanding a patient's portal venous anatomy and functional hepatic reserve. This understanding guides timely and targeted endoscopic and endovascular interventions to facilitate the rapid control of ectopic variceal bleeding.

### Ectopic varices in the gastrointestinal tract: Short- and long-term outcomes of percutaneous therapy [^111wy8gL]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the results of percutaneous management of ectopic varices, a retrospective review was conducted on 14 patients (9 men, 5 women; mean age 58 years) who, between 1992 and 2001, underwent interventional radiological techniques for managing bleeding ectopic varices. A history of prior abdominal surgery was present in 12 out of 14 patients. The interval between the surgery and percutaneous intervention ranged from 2 to 38 years.

Transhepatic portal venography confirmed that ectopic varices were the source of portal hypertension-related gastrointestinal bleeding. Embolization of the ectopic varices was performed using a transhepatic approach, with coil embolization of the veins draining into the ectopic varices. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was performed in the standard fashion.

Eighteen procedures (12 primary coil embolizations, 1 primary TIPS, 2 re-embolizations, and 3 secondary TIPS) were conducted in 13 patients. One patient was not a candidate for percutaneous treatment. All interventions, except for one re-embolization, were technically successful. In 2 of 18 interventions, re-bleeding occurred within 72 hours (both embolization patients). Re-bleeding (23 days to 27 months after initial intervention) was identified in 9 procedures (8 coil embolizations, and 1 TIPS due to a biliary fistula). One patient required a TIPS revision due to ultrasound surveillance findings. New encephalopathy developed in 2 of the 4 TIPS patients.

Percutaneous coil embolization is a simple and safe treatment for bleeding ectopic varices; however, re-bleeding is frequent, indicating a need for further research and improvement in techniques.

### Ectopic varices masquerading as lower gastrointestinal bleeding [^113WvWFt]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A middle-aged woman, previously in good health, arrived at the hospital with severe hemorrhagic shock. An abdominal and pelvic CT scan showed hepatomegaly, fluid in the sigmoid colon, perigastric, and right-sided pelvic varices without a clear source of bleeding. Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy excluded gastric varices and active upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the colonoscopy was inconclusive due to hemodynamic instability and massive bleeding, which made it impossible to proceed with a full colonoscopy.

An explorative laparotomy identified liver cirrhosis and bleeding from varices of the right fallopian tube, which had formed a fistula with the cecum. A right hemicolectomy with a side-to-side anastomosis and a right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy were carried out. The patient was thereafter transferred to the intensive care unit, intubated, requiring massive fluid resuscitation and high doses of vasoactive agents. Nine days after hospital admission, she was transferred to the surgical ward and followed up by a hepatologist.

Bilateral single ectopic ureters with hypoplastic bladder are rare and difficult to treat. Urinary diversion, such as by ileal conduit, is usually performed because of small bladder capacity. We report a case treated by staged operation without urinary diversion or bladder augmentation. The outcome shows that ureterovesicostomy between the dilated ureter and the bladder is a feasible method to increase capacity for bilateral single ectopic ureters with hypoplastic bladder.

### Pulmonary varix mimicking arteriovenous malformation [^115VEr15]. Clinical Imaging (2008). Low credibility.

We report here a case of a 44-year-old female with a pulmonary varix. The patient was asymptomatic; a routine chest X-ray incidentally revealed a serpiginous mass in the left hilar region. Computed tomography revealed a serpiginous, dilated vascular structure in the left upper lobe that continued into the lower lobe and was suggestive of an arteriovenous malformation. Pulmonary angiography revealed no arterial abnormality; however, the filling of an abnormally dilated pulmonary vein was observed. Angiography is considered to be the most useful method for the confirmatory diagnosis of pulmonary varices.

### Transcatheter embolotherapy with N-butyl cyanoacrylate for ectopic varices [^116tHpjk]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to address the technical feasibility and clinical outcome of transcatheter embolotherapy with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) for bleeding ectopic varices.

The institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived informed consent. From January 2004 to June 2013, a total of 12 consecutive patients received transcatheter embolotherapy using NBCA for bleeding ectopic varices in our institute. Clinical and radiologic features of the endovascular procedures were comprehensively reviewed.

Preprocedural computed tomography images revealed ectopic varices in the jejunum (n = 7), stoma (n = 2), rectum (n = 2), and duodenum (n = 1). The 12 procedures consisted of solitary embolotherapy (n = 8) and embolotherapy with portal decompression (main portal vein stenting in 3, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in 1). With regard to vascular access, percutaneous transhepatic access (n = 7), transsplenic access (n = 4), and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt tract (n = 1) were used. There was no failure in either the embolotherapy or the vascular accesses, indicating a technical success rate of 100%.

Two patients died within 1 month of the procedure due to preexisting fatal medical conditions. Only one patient, with a large varix partially embolized using coils and NBCA, experienced a rebleeding 5.5 months after the procedure. The patient was retreated with NBCA and did not experience any further bleeding during a follow-up period of 2.5 months. The remaining nine patients did not experience rebleeding during the follow-up periods.

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^1171FrmX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Despite the lack of standardized clinical care pathways, it is generally accepted that the treatment of rectal varices focuses on the amelioration of the underlying pathology, namely the portal hypertension. In cases where the bleeding is especially profuse, the majority consensus seems to be on rapid interventional decompression of the mesenteric circulation, either by radiological or surgical means. However, in patients whose only symptom is rectal bleeding and whose general medical condition has yet to be physiologically and/or pharmacologically optimized, we suggest that endoscopic intervention may have a role similar to its use in managing patients with bleeding oesophageal varices.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: Expert review [^111X1ff8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Management of bleeding gastric varices (GV) presents a unique challenge for patients with portal hypertension. Despite over thirty years of diagnostic and treatment advances, standardized practices for bleeding GV are lacking and unsupported by adequate evidence. There are no definitive natural history studies to assist with risk assessment, nor are there prospective clinical trials to guide clinical decision-making. The available literature on the natural history and management of gastric varices consists of case series, restricted cohort studies, and a few small randomized trials, all of which have significant selection biases. This review summarizes the available data and recommendations based on expert opinion on how best to diagnose and manage bleeding from gastric varices.

Regarding specific circumstances for variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients with gastric varices, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend treating acute gastric variceal hemorrhage medically, similar to esophageal variceal hemorrhage. The guidelines suggest using cyanoacrylate as the endoscopic hemostatic treatment for cardiofundal varices, which include gastroesophageal varices type 2 or isolated gastric varices type 1.

### Massive bleeding from ectopic varices in the postpartum period: Rare but serious complication in women with portal hypertension [^1146jxc2]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension (PHT) often leads to collateralization of blood flow through variceal vessels that shunt blood from the portal to the systemic circulation. Life-threatening bleeding from esophageal and ectopic varices often complicates severe PHT. An increase in PHT occurs during the last stages of the second trimester of pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of PHT bleeding in the later stages of pregnancy. In this report, we present two rare cases of pregnant women with PHT who experienced postpartum bleeding from very uncommon sites.

The first case involved a rupture of an intra-abdominal varix. The second case included two episodes of bleeding from abdominal wall varices after two emergent cesarean sections in two consecutive pregnancies. Based on a literature review, we constructed an algorithm that includes instructions on how to handle women with PHT during various stages of pregnancy and labor.

### The spontaneous resolution of a vortex vein varix: Case report [^112BE29D]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Fundus photograph**: An unremarkable fundus photograph of the left eye was taken 13 months prior to the initial examination. At the initial presentation, a fundus photograph showed a 6 × 6 × 1.5 mm vortex vein varix located in the superotemporal midperiphery.

- **Autofluorescence imaging**: The lesion appeared isoautofluorescent with some shadowing along the elevated posterior and inferior margins.

- **Imaging techniques**:
	- a. B-scan ultrasonography revealed a dome-shaped, acoustically solid choroidal lesion without extrascleral extension.
	- b. With external pressure applied to the globe, the vortex varix appeared flattened.

- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**:
	- a. Initial OCT imaging through the vortex varix showed thickened choroidal vessels causing elevated but otherwise undisturbed retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retina.
	- b. Approximately nine months after the initial examination, OCT revealed a relative shallowing of the vortex varix.

- **Follow-up examination**: A fundus photograph taken of the left eye at a three-month follow-up interval after the resolution of the vortex varix indicated that the affected area remained flat.

### Usefulness of coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) for the treatment of ascending colonic varix: a case report [^117AUVfk]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Colonic varices are rare among ectopic varices. A previous report demonstrated that once bleeding from colonic varices occurs, it can be fatal. Several treatments for colonic varices exist, including surgical, endoscopic, and endovascular treatments; however, management has not been standardized. Minimally invasive therapies would be desirable for colonic varices. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) is one treatment option to prevent rupture. Two cases of successful conventional B-RTO for these varices have already been reported. However, B-RTO using the coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) procedure for these varices has not been reported.

- **Case presentation**: A 71-year-old male patient had liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus infection. A varix was located at the ascending colon, coincidentally found on colonic endoscopy. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the feeder vein was the ileocolic vein and that the main draining vein was the right renal vein. Physicians concluded that treatment was required to avoid the risk of death from massive bleeding due to varix rupture. Endoscopic and surgical treatments were difficult due to the anatomical location of the varix and the high risk of operative complications. This ascending colonic varix was treated by balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) using the coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) procedure via the right renal vein.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: Expert review [^114EnN1P]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients with gastric varices post-treatment surveillance, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining a short-interval endoscopic assessment (48 hours) of the gastric varices to ensure obliteration of vascular flow after balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration for bleeding gastric varices. In cases where residual vascular flow is detected, a cyanoacrylate injection should be administered. It is also advised to obtain a CT or MRI within 4–6 weeks from the procedure and subsequently as clinically indicated to confirm obliteration of gastric varices and evaluate for potential vascular complications.

### Successful treatment of mesenteric varices by retrograde transvenous obliteration by the delivery of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate via an abdominal wall vein [^112KC8FL]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of small-bowel varices is low. Bleeding from ectopic varices is reported in 1–5% of patients with liver cirrhosis and in 20–30% of patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension. Of bleeding ectopic varices, 17% each were found in the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum, 14% in the colon, 8% in the rectum, and 9% in the peritoneum. Roughly half of patients with ectopic variceal bleeding had a history of surgery. In fact, 66% of patients with small-bowel varices had undergone abdominal or pelvic surgery, suggesting that postoperative adhesions between an incision in the abdominal wall and the small bowel may result in the formation of collaterals drained by the systemic venous circulation. In our patient, the mesenteric varices were attributable to portal hypertension and postoperative adhesions.

Therapeutic options for bleeding ectopic varices include local treatment for the varices and portal decompression. Local interventional radiology includes percutaneous transhepatic obliteration (PTO) and BRTO. Portal decompressive treatment includes surgical dissection and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). L'Hermine et al. reported that PTO controlled bleeding from gastroesophageal varices in 83% of their patients. However, the formation of new inflow routes may result in rebleeding after PTO. According to Ninoi et al, BRTO more effectively controls gastric variceal bleeding than TIPS or PTO.

Ono et al. reported the successful management of mesenteric varices with BRTO performed via an abdominal wall collateral vein; they accessed the mesenteric varices directly.

### Intra-amniotic umbilical vein varix: A case report and review of the literature [^115qPWUK]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

An umbilical vein varix is defined as focal dilatation of the umbilical vein. Most cases of fetal umbilical vein varix are reported to be intra‐abdominal. Extra‐abdominal or intra‐amniotic umbilical vein varix is rare, with only a few case reports published in the literature.

Adverse fetal complications have been reported, including compression and kinking of the umbilical cord, aneurysm rupture, and thrombosis inside the aneurysm. Owing to the rarity of this condition, there are no specific guidelines for its management during pregnancy, especially concerning follow‐up intervals or the timing of delivery.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^111bLNYK]. Gut (2015). High credibility.

For specific circumstances of variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients with gastric varices, the BSG 2015 guidelines recommend considering balloon tamponade in cases of gastroesophageal varices and isolated gastric varices type 1. This approach is advised if bleeding control fails, and should be implemented until definitive treatment can be undertaken.

### Vallecular varix causing diagnostic confusion in hematemesis [^114myDiR]. Head & Neck (2008). Low credibility.

Hematemesis is a common and dramatic presentation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include peptic ulcer disease and varices. However, endoscopists need to be aware of other rare causes to avoid a delay in diagnosis, which may be potentially fatal.

- **Methods and results**: We present a case of vallecular varix causing hematemesis and successfully treated with sclerosant injection. We also review the literature regarding its pathogenesis and treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Vallecular varicosities are a rare cause of life-threatening bleeding from the aerodigestive tract. The area should be targeted early for evaluation, especially in cases of bleeding of unknown origin.

Regarding surgical interventions for ectopic pregnancy, more specifically with respect to surgical management (general indications), the ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend performing surgery in patients with ectopic pregnancy exhibiting any of the following:

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Surgery is advised for those presenting with this condition.

- **Symptoms of an ongoing ruptured ectopic mass**: Such as pelvic pain.

- **Signs of intraperitoneal bleeding**: Any indication of this warrants surgical intervention.

### Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided coil injection therapy of esophagogastric and ectopic varices [^115oUm75]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Endoscopic band ligation and glue injection are established techniques for variceal bleeding. As EUS may enhance variceal detection and improve therapeutic targeting, we aim to report our experience on EUS-guided coil embolization, with and without concomitant glue injection, of varices.

- **Methods**: A prospectively maintained EUS database was retrospectively reviewed to identify consecutive patients who underwent EUS-guided variceal angiotherapy. All patients had failed or were poor candidates for standard endoscopic, surgical, or interventional radiologic therapies. The main outcome measurements were rates of rebleeding and adverse events.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients [mean age 58 (SD 12) years, 50% male] underwent EUS-guided coil injection with (n = 4) or without (n = 10) concomitant glue injection to treat esophagogastric (n = 1), gastric (n = 5), duodenal (n = 3), or choledochal (n = 5) varices. Prior endoscopic and cross-sectional imaging detected only 57% and 64% of the varices seen. A mean of 5.1 (SD 1.9) coils and a median of 3.25 (range 2–3.5) mL of cyanoacrylate were injected during the initial procedure. During a median follow-up of 12 (range 1–104) months, three patients died from unrelated causes and eight patients did not have further bleeding episodes. In the remaining three patients who had choledochal varices, the frequency and intensity of rebleeding decreased significantly. Only one asymptomatic adverse event occurred with coil migration to the liver.

- **Conclusions**: EUS-guided angiotherapy of varices is safe and feasible in selected patients who fail to respond to conventional therapies.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^113mVzyf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Hemorrhage resulting from gastric varices can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause for gastric variceal bleeding, occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in non-cirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions. These are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process involves an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend appropriate imaging or treatment.

### Ectopic varices: A potential cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension [^112B7dnj]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A newly diagnosed 53-year-old woman with cirrhosis experienced repeated gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to symptomatic anemia. She underwent a routine diagnostic endoscopic evaluation, which did not localize the aetiology of her bleeding. Ultimately, the etiology was identified as ectopic varices in the small bowel, a result of underlying high portal pressures. She was then treated with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for portal system decompression, resulting in the resolution of her bleeding.

### Usefulness of coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration II (CARTO-II) for the treatment of ascending colonic varix: a case report [^115nyNRU]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

This is the first report of B-RTO using CARTO-II for an ascending colonic varix. B-RTO has been performed for various ectopic varices, such as duodenal, stomal, and small intestinal varices, as well as colonic varices. There have been only two reports of B-RTO for an ascending colonic varix. In these reports, conventional B-RTO was performed via the right renal vein. Similarly, in the present case, the varix was also located at the ascending colon, and B-RTO was performed via the same route. The present report reconfirmed the importance of B-RTO for ascending colonic varices by demonstrating no recurrence or complications during long-term follow-up. Furthermore, this report showed that the CARTO-II procedure could also be applied to ascending colonic varices.

### Effectiveness and safety of endoscopic treatment for duodenal variceal bleeding: A systematic review [^116pWHGE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Several limitations of this review should be noted. First, duodenal varix is a rare condition, and all studies included were case reports and case series, rather than prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Second, although the studies retrieved were comprehensive, it is still possible that unpublished case reports were not found, leading to publication bias. Third, there was a selection bias in the systematic review of case reports, as it included patients of different ethnicities and with different underlying diseases. Additionally, the exclusion of non-English publications may have affected the study results. Fourth, in this review, the studies included used various types and volumes of sclerosants and tissue adhesives, as well as different ratios of mixed lipiodol and tissue adhesives. This variability may have impacted the results. Theoretically, a higher ratio of lipiodol to tissue adhesive (with a greater volume of lipiodol injected) increases the risk of ectopic embolism. Previous studies have shown that using different ratios of lipiodol to tissue adhesive (from a 1/1 to a 0.3/1 volume ratio) could reduce the risk of distant embolism from 0.7% to 0%.

Despite these limitations, there are several strengths in our systematic review. First, the study is the first structured systematic review evaluating the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic treatment for duodenal variceal bleeding. Second, it remains the only study to analyze comparative endoscopic treatment modalities for bleeding duodenal varices. Currently, guidelines and consensus are not available.

### Identification and management of abdominal wall varices in pregnancy [^116yR5mP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension in pregnancy is associated with an elevated risk of variceal hemorrhage. Ectopic varices, which are located outside the esophagus or stomach, are rare but pose a significant risk of maternal morbidity and mortality.

- **Case**: A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 0010, with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, was found to have abdominal wall ectopic varices on third-trimester obstetric ultrasonography. Computed tomography angiography confirmed these findings. Given the concern for catastrophic hemorrhage during delivery, she underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement at 35 weeks of gestation, which reduced the pressure gradient within the portosystemic circulation. She subsequently had an uncomplicated cesarean delivery.

- **Conclusion**: Identification of ectopic varices on obstetric ultrasonography may allow for treatment before delivery, thereby decreasing the risk of serious maternal morbidity or mortality.

### Pessary for management of cervical varices complicating pregnancy [^114VbZuY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Cervical varices complicating pregnancy are rare but can cause significant maternal and perinatal morbidity. There is limited evidence regarding the optimal management of bleeding caused by cervical varices during pregnancy.

- **Case**: A 38-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital at 16 weeks of gestation due to vaginal hemorrhage in the setting of cervical varices accompanied by placenta previa. A cervical pessary was placed at 21 weeks of gestation without further bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated variceal reduction after pessary placement, and a cesarean delivery was performed at 36 weeks of gestation without complications.

- **Conclusion**: Cervical pessary should be considered as a conservative option to control the bleeding associated with cervical varices during pregnancy.

### Gastric varices: An updated review of management [^113LhK3X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices but are associated with increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial due to the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

### Management of ectopic variceal bleeding with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: A systematic review of case reports [^116g5VzY]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Ectopic varices account for 5% of variceal bleedings and occur outside the gastro-esophageal region. This review evaluates the efficacy of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for ectopic variceal management. A comprehensive search through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase was conducted until January 16, 2023, using relevant keywords. Case reports and case series with fewer than 10 patients on TIPS for ectopic variceal management were included. The quality assessment followed the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for case reports.

This systematic review evaluated 43 studies involving 50 patients with ectopic varices undergoing TIPS. Patients had a mean age of 54.3 years, half were female, and two were pregnant. Alcoholic liver disease (48%) and hepatitis C infection (26%) were common causes of portal hypertension. Ascites and splenomegaly were reported in 32% and 28% of the patients, respectively. Rectal, oral, and stomal variceal bleeding accounted for 62%, 16%, and 22% of the patients, respectively. Ectopic varices were mainly located in the duodenum (28%) and rectum (26%) regions. Complications affected 42% of the patients, rebleeding in eleven and hepatic encephalopathy in seven. The follow-up lasted 12 months on average, and finally, 5 received a liver transplant. Mortality post-TIPS was 18%. Despite complications and a notable mortality rate, favorable outcomes were observed in almost half of the patients with ectopic variceal bleeding managed with TIPS. Further research is warranted to refine strategies and improve patient outcomes.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt in the management of portal hypertension [^117NYSaY]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Ectopic variceal bleeding can be challenging to manage. The evidence for TIPSS in the management of bleeding ectopic varices is based on case series. Earlier reports showed excellent results for initial haemostasis, although rebleeding occurred in between 18%–42% of patients despite a patent shunt, leading the authors to recommend adjunctive measures such as coil embolization or thrombin injections. The largest multicentre study of 53 patients found that TIPSS was a good option for those patients with stomal varices in particular. Covered stents were used in 85% of patients. Rebleeding occurred in up to 32% of patients and was related to MELD score, sites other than enterostomy, and previous local therapy. Rebleeding was noted to be 50% in those with bleeding duodenal varices. An interesting observation was that neither post-TIPSS portal pressure gradient (PPG) at a threshold of 12 mm Hg nor coil embolization influenced rebleeding rates, although the numbers were small.

The evidence for TIPSS in the management of portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) is limited to case reports and small case series. The severity of liver disease, the presence of oesophageal varices, and endoscopic therapy for oesophageal varices have been reported to influence the incidence of PHG. TIPSS has been found to be successful in improving the appearances of PHG and reducing transfusion requirements in patients refractory to conservative therapies with NSBB and iron replacement. It is important to differentiate PHG from gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE). GAVE has characteristic endoscopic appearances.
