## Question

Arachnoid cyst symptoms

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about arachnoid cyst symptoms, including how often they are asymptomatic, what symptoms occur when they are symptomatic, how location modifies presentation, and how to interpret controversial associations like epilepsy, cognitive effects, and psychiatric symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about prevalence and the baseline likelihood of symptoms. Then, I should verify which symptoms are truly attributable to mass effect versus those that are nonspecific or coincidental. Next, I will examine location-specific syndromes, including posterior fossa, suprasellar, middle fossa, and spinal cysts. After that, I need to review special contexts such as trauma-related rupture, hemorrhage, and subdural collections. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable approach to attributing symptoms and deciding when intervention is warranted, making sure I double-check areas of controversy like epilepsy and cognition before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the baseline epidemiology and natural history, because I need to ensure I'm not overcalling symptoms in incidental cysts. Large pediatric and adult series consistently show arachnoid cysts are common incidental findings, with prevalences around 1.4–2.6% on imaging, and most remain stable and asymptomatic over years of follow-up, with only a small minority enlarging or becoming symptomatic, which argues for a conservative default stance when no clear attributable signs are present [^f79f1a94] [^7e11b029] [^d341389f].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle about symptom causation. The clinical manifestations are fundamentally determined by size and location, with secondary effects like CSF flow obstruction, hemorrhage, or rupture, rather than a fixed symptom complex tied to the cyst itself; this means attribution must be anatomically and temporally coherent, and I should be cautious not to ascribe nonspecific complaints to an incidental cyst just because it is present [^72b26473] [^d341389f].

> I will now examine the most common symptomatic pattern: increased intracranial pressure from mass effect or CSF obstruction. Headache is the most frequent complaint when symptomatic, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, papilledema, and visual disturbances; suprasellar and posterior fossa cysts are particularly prone to obstructive hydrocephalus, and optic nerve edema is especially linked to rupture events rather than size alone, which I should keep in mind when interpreting fundus findings [^d75ec0f3] [^529ef9ef] [^7c76c809].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about seizures. I initially thought epilepsy was a classic manifestation, but I should double-check the strength of evidence. The association between arachnoid cysts and seizures is controversial, with mixed study results; some series and reviews suggest a plausible epileptogenic role via cortical irritation or reorganization, and case reports describe seizure reduction after fenestration, yet other data show no clear causal link, so I need to ensure seizures are well localized and refractory before attributing them to the cyst and recommending surgery [^b9093b0b] [^504e9d4f].

> Next, I should review focal neurological deficits by location. Middle fossa cysts can compress the temporal lobe and cause language, memory, or behavioral changes, and posterior fossa cysts can compress cranial nerves or the brainstem, producing ataxia, cranial neuropathies, or even hemifacial spasm; suprasellar cysts can compress the chiasm and cause bitemporal hemianopsia, and compress the hypothalamus–pituitary axis to yield endocrine disturbances including precocious puberty or SIADH, so I need to map symptoms to the exact neuroanatomy before linking them to the cyst [^5afcef4e] [^cf2b19d7] [^57b02964] [^70070ac5].

> Let me consider spinal arachnoid cysts separately, because their symptom profile differs. Intraspinal cysts, whether extradural or intradural, typically present with back pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy with gait disturbance, limb weakness, sensory changes, and sphincter dysfunction; syrinx formation is not uncommon and can worsen deficits, and importantly, surgical decompression often leads to meaningful improvement even after prolonged symptoms, so I should maintain a lower threshold for intervention when neurological deficits are present [^865e6257] [^133d9d85] [^7269dca0].

> But wait, what if the cyst ruptures or bleeds after minor trauma. I need to check the risk and presentation. Case series and reports indicate that middle fossa cysts can rupture or bleed after mild head injury, producing acute headache, vomiting, diplopia, subdural hematoma or hygroma, and even distant spinal subdural collections; optic disc edema is common in ruptured cases, and the risk appears higher with larger cysts, so a history of recent trauma with new or escalating symptoms should prompt urgent imaging and neurosurgical consultation [^1c562b19] [^66046fc3] [^7c76c809].

> I should confirm the cognitive and psychiatric controversy. Some studies and case series report reversible cognitive deficits, attention or memory problems, and even psychiatric syndromes with middle fossa cysts, with improvement after decompression, but these findings are inconsistent and often confounded; population-based data in older adults generally fail to show excess cognitive impairment in cyst carriers, so I must be very cautious and reserve neurosurgical consideration for carefully selected, treatment-resistant cases with a compelling anatomical and clinical correlation [^5afcef4e] [^a872baa5] [^39726c33].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. Most arachnoid cysts are incidental and require no treatment beyond reassurance and selective follow-up; symptoms attributable to a cyst should be specific, anatomically coherent, and temporally related, with supportive imaging evidence of mass effect, obstruction, or rupture; red flags include progressive focal deficits, hydrocephalus, papilledema, intractable seizures convincingly localized to the cyst region, or post-traumatic rupture with hemorrhage, which strengthen the case for intervention after multidisciplinary review [^d341389f] [^d1445968].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address a common pitfall. Nonspecific headaches, mood symptoms, or vague dizziness are common in the general population and are frequently discovered alongside incidental cysts; unless there is a clear mechanistic link and progression, these should not be attributed to the cyst, and patients should be counseled accordingly to avoid unnecessary procedures and anxiety, aligning with guidance that most arachnoid cysts are benign and observation is appropriate in the absence of definitive indications [^d341389f] [^e52a4b0d].

Arachnoid cysts are **usually asymptomatic** and found incidentally [^f79f1a94], but when symptomatic, symptoms reflect local mass effect or CSF flow disruption [^72b26473]. The most common symptoms are **headache, nausea, and vomiting** from increased intracranial pressure [^b61987e7]; seizures can occur, especially with temporal lobe cysts [^b9093b0b]; focal deficits (weakness, sensory changes, cranial neuropathies) arise from compression of adjacent brain or nerves [^1c7328f4]; and visual disturbances or endocrine changes are seen with suprasellar cysts [^57b02964]. Spinal cysts cause back pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy with gait instability and sphincter dysfunction [^865e6257]. Symptoms vary by size and location, and **large or growing cysts** are more likely to be symptomatic [^26958163].

---

## General symptom profile

Most arachnoid cysts are **asymptomatic** and discovered incidentally on imaging [^f79f1a94]; when symptomatic, symptoms are typically due to mass effect or CSF flow disruption [^72b26473]. The most frequently reported symptoms include:

- **Headache**: Often nonspecific, but may indicate increased intracranial pressure or mass effect [^d75ec0f3].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: Commonly associated with elevated intracranial pressure [^b61987e7].
- **Seizures**: Particularly associated with temporal lobe cysts, though the relationship is complex and not fully understood [^b9093b0b].
- **Focal neurological deficits**: Such as weakness, sensory disturbances, or cranial nerve palsies, depending on cyst location and size [^1c7328f4].
- **Visual disturbances**: Including blurred vision, double vision, or visual field defects, especially with suprasellar or posterior fossa cysts [^57b02964].
- **Endocrine disturbances**: Particularly with suprasellar cysts, including growth hormone deficiency, precocious puberty, or diabetes insipidus [^notfound].

---

## Location-specific symptoms

Symptoms vary significantly depending on the **anatomical location** of the cyst:

| **Location** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Middle cranial fossa (temporal lobe) | - Headache <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Cognitive or behavioral changes <br/> - Focal neurological deficits [^5afcef4e] |
| Posterior fossa (cerebellopontine angle, quadrigeminal cistern) | - Headache <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Cranial nerve palsies (e.g. facial weakness, hearing loss) [^3549310a] |
| Suprasellar region | - Visual disturbances (bitemporal hemianopsia) <br/> - Endocrine abnormalities (growth hormone deficiency, precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus) <br/> - Headache <br/> - Nausea/vomiting [^57b02964] |
| Spinal (intradural or extradural) | - Back pain <br/> - Radiculopathy <br/> - Myelopathy (gait instability, limb weakness, sphincter dysfunction) [^865e6257] |

---

## Age-related symptom presentation

Symptom presentation also varies with **age**:

- **Infants and young children**: Macrocephaly, developmental delays, hydrocephalus, and seizures are common presentations [^fb664425].
- **Older children and adolescents**: Headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits are more frequently observed [^165fac6c].
- **Adults**: Headache, visual disturbances, and focal neurological deficits are typical, with seizures being less common than in children [^f79f1a94].

---

## Factors influencing symptom severity

Several factors influence the **severity and likelihood** of symptoms:

- **Cyst size**: Larger cysts are more likely to cause symptoms due to greater mass effect or CSF flow disruption [^26958163].
- **Cyst location**: Cysts near critical structures (e.g. brainstem, optic pathways, spinal cord) are more likely to cause significant symptoms [^529ef9ef].
- **Rate of growth**: Rapidly expanding cysts are more likely to cause acute symptoms than stable, slowly growing lesions [^notfound].
- **Patient age**: Younger patients, particularly infants, are more susceptible to symptoms due to the malleability of the skull and developing brain [^7e11b029].

---

## Conclusion

Arachnoid cysts are **typically asymptomatic**, but when symptomatic they cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, focal neurological deficits, visual disturbances, and endocrine abnormalities, depending on size and location. Symptom severity is influenced by cyst size, location, growth rate, and patient age.

### Incidental findings on brain and spine imaging in children [^d341389f]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts — incidental intracranial cysts in children are very common, with most recent large studies estimating a prevalence on imaging at ~2%. The prevalence does not change significantly with advancing age, and boys are nearly twice as likely to harbor arachnoid cysts as girls. Most are found in the anterior middle fossa and retrocerebellar locations, with middle fossa cysts having a left-sided predominance. Arachnoid cyst size does not correlate precisely with symptoms or the need for treatment, and although they occasionally present with neurologic signs or symptoms, in most cases they are asymptomatic and found incidentally. Because individuals frequently present with both an arachnoid cyst and an unrelated condition or symptom, clinicians should exercise caution when ascribing nonspecific symptoms, such as headache, behavior disturbance, or epilepsy, to the presence of an arachnoid cyst.

### Intracranial arachnoid cysts in children: a review of pathogenesis, clinical features, and management [^504e9d4f]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are developmental anomalies that are most often diagnosed in childhood. They are often discovered as incidental findings found on imaging. Occasionally they may produce symptoms because of expansion or bleeding. There may be underlying maldevelopment of the cortex especially the temporal lobe. There is controversy regarding the role and the type of surgery indicated in its treatment. Recent descriptions of aphasia and attention-deficit disorders associated with these cysts indicate that we do not fully understand this entity. There is also no acceptable explanation for the male preponderance and increased incidence on the left side. The distribution, clinical features, treatment modalities, and some unusual syndromes associated with arachnoid cysts in children are discussed in this review.

### Symptomatic increased intracranial pressure due to arachnoid cysts [^b61987e7]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are typically benign lesions, but rarely, they may cause signs and symptoms relating to increased intracranial pressure. We report 4 pediatric patients with arachnoid cysts who received successful surgical treatment after failing to respond to conservative medical therapies. After undergoing a shunting procedure, each patient experienced improvement in symptoms, resolution of optic disc swelling, and reduction or elimination of medications necessary to manage the condition. These cases illustrate the potential for arachnoid cysts to outstrip compensatory mechanisms and cause signs and symptoms requiring definitive surgical intervention.

### Arachnoid cysts and epilepsy: seizures and epileptogenesis [^b9093b0b]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are sacs within the arachnoid membrane, filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and overwhelmingly asymptomatic; however, they can also lead to neurological symptoms such as epilepsy. The dependence of AC on epilepsy has been a subject of controversy because of studies with mixed results on whether AC contributes to seizure activity. This is a narrative review for the synthesis of available present research on the pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy, clinical presentation, and treatment options in patients with epilepsy and ACs. Some find no impactful association between ACs and seizures, while others point out the probable role of ACs in Epileptogenesis. Endoscopic fenestration and similar surgical interventions were found quite effective at reducing the frequency of seizures for selected patients, although not all of them achieve complete seizure control. Such a decision needs to be tailored on the basis of considerations such as localization and size of cysts and general health conditions. Future research should investigate the genetic and molecular basis of ACs and, based on large prospective long-term studies, define the AC-epilepsy relationship and refine treatment strategies in affected individuals.

### Intracranial arachnoid cysts – do they impair mental functions? [^5afcef4e]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Arachnoid cysts are benign, congenital malformations of the arachnoid with a predilection for the temporal fossa. Radiologically, most arachnoid cysts appear to be expansive lesions, and functional imaging has shown that arachnoid cysts may cause a reorganization of cortical functions.

Methods

The present article is based on a literature search for articles reporting dyscognition or psychiatric symptoms in arachnoid cyst patients. Emphasis is placed on systematic, prospective studies reporting results from larger series of patients. A total of five articles were identified that had investigated cognition in larger series of patients. A variety of cognitive functions were found to be impaired, including verbal perception and memory, more complex verbal tasks, visuospatial functions, and visual attention. In addition, numerous case reports were identified that link arachnoid cysts to a wide variety of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.

Conclusions

This survey indicates that arachnoid cysts may affect cognition and also that they do so in a reversible manner, as the patients' cognitive impairment seems to improve after surgical decompression of the cyst.

### Posterior fossa arachnoid cysts can mimic meniere's disease [^98f963c1]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2003). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts constitute 1% of all intracranial space-occupying lesions. In the posterior fossa, they typically produce vague, nonspecific symptoms. However, a subset of these lesions can produce signs and symptoms indistinguishable from those of Meniere's disease. We discuss the clinical and laboratory features of 2 cases of posterior fossa arachnoid cysts mimicking Meniere's disease as well as the substantial resolution of symptoms in 1 patient after cysto-peritoneal shunt. Posterior fossa arachnoid cyst must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of Meniere's disease.

### What provokes a disappearing arachnoid cyst?-case study and literature review [^e393c727]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intracranial Arachnoid cysts (AC) are stable cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)-filled sacs that can rarely undergo progressive shrinkage or disappearance throughout life. In this manuscript, we present a case of post-traumatic complete resolution of an AC, review the possible triggers of this phenomenon, and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms behind them.

Methods

After presenting our case, we performed a literature review using the PubMed Database of all the reported cases of AC reduction or resolution (last updated in February 2021). Spontaneous cases were excluded. An analysis of the remaining cases (1985–2021) according to their inciting event, demographical, and clinical characteristics was then presented.

Results

58 patients were identified, 33 of which spontaneously resolved. The remaining 25 were included in the survey in addition to the case we presented. The mean age was 20.2 years, average time to resolution was 25.3 months, with only two third of the cases showing complete disappearance of the AC. A central nervous system infection was the inciting cause of resolution in one infant (4%), a history of head trauma in 16 (62%) patients and an intracranial procedure in 9 (35%) patients.

Discussion

AC disappearance is a rare phenomenon that can occur spontaneously or after an inciting event. The cyst wall rupture and CSF flow perturbation theories seem to be the most applicable pathophysiological mechanisms in triggered AC resolution.

### Arachnoid cysts: spontaneous resolution distinct from traumatic rupture. case report [^89ded1f6]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Although many arachnoid cysts are discovered incidentally and require no intervention, a small subset has been known to rupture. Note that rupture can occur either spontaneously or in association with trauma. Based on a review of the literature on ruptured arachnoid cysts, it appears that patients with middle fossa cysts are more likely to experience symptomatic traumatic rupture than those with cysts in other locations. Middle fossa cysts are more commonly associated with hemispheric subdural collections and hematomas than are any other cysts. The authors report on two representative cases illustrating the distinct presentation, imaging characteristics, and management of these cysts.

Conclusion

There is evidence that arachnoid cysts can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms and plausible mechanisms to understand how this occurs. The role of surgery is less clear. Until the evidence is more conclusive, ethical considerations might hinder its general use.

### Haemorrhage into an arachnoid cyst: a serious complication of minor head trauma [^182a864b]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are infra-arachnoidal cerebrospinal fluid collections that are usually asymptomatic. However, they can become acutely symptomatic because of haemorrhage and cyst enlargement, which may result from minor head trauma. The range of symptoms is wide and many are "soft" signs. Diagnosis is important as cysts causing mass effect require surgery. A case is reported of a child presenting with localised headaches after minor head trauma. Computed tomography demonstrated an arachnoid cyst with evidence of haemorrhage, which required surgical intervention. Other cases of arachnoid cyst presenting to our hospital or reported in the literature are reviewed with respect to presenting symptoms and signs. Localised headaches, behavioural or cognitive changes and ataxia are more commonly associated with this disorder than nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances or seizures. This range of symptomatology following minor head trauma may warrant computed tomography when other criteria for this investigation are not met.

### Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts: clinical, radiological, and surgical features [^5f241740]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Extradural arachnoid cysts in the spine are rare and are seldom a cause of spinal cord compression. They are thought to arise from congenital defects in the dura mater, and they almost always communicate with the intrathecal subarachnoid space through a small defect in the dura. The mainstay of treatment in patients with neurological symptoms is surgical removal of the cyst together with ligation of the communicating pedicle and closure of the dural defect. In the present paper the authors review the literature and discuss the clinical and pathological features, mechanisms of pathogenesis, neuroimaging characteristics, and surgical management of spinal extradural arachnoid cysts. The surgical technique for removal of these lesions is illustrated in a patient with a large thoracolumbar spinal extradural arachnoid cyst causing neurogenic claudication.

### Cut it out or wait it out? Case series of middle fossa arachnoid cysts presenting with psychiatric symptoms and a discussion of the ethics of neurosurgical management [^86e1a737]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts have been linked to neuropsychiatric morbidity. We describe two patients presenting with dissociative and manic symptoms believed to be associated with middle fossa arachnoid cysts. They were managed medically and remitted eventually, but symptoms were resistant. We briefly review the literature to discuss mechanisms by which cysts could cause symptoms and consider whether neurosurgical management would be appropriate. Although neurosurgery can be considered, its role is currently limited by practical and ethical considerations.

### Incidental findings on brain and spine imaging in children [^d1445968]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts — treatment indications and complications are outlined as follows: cysts "should be treated in most cases if they are causing clear and specific neurologic symptoms", and "even small cysts may require treatment if they block normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways and cause symptomatic hydrocephalus", with suprasellar cysts "especially likely to cause symptoms and require treatment". However, "evidence of mass effect on imaging is not, by itself, a sufficient indication for surgical treatment", and because most have a benign natural history, "surgical treatment should be avoided except in the unusual instance in which a cyst is clearly responsible for specific symptoms". Subdural hygromas related to arachnoid cysts "are rare" and "do not always require surgical treatment", and because surgery itself "can cause iatrogenic hygromas", "prophylaxis against future hygroma risk should not be regarded as an adequate indication for surgical treatment". Similarly, hemorrhage into a cyst after trauma is "a very rare event", so "prophylaxis against future hemorrhage risk should not be used to justify surgical treatment in an asymptomatic child", and such hemorrhages are "associated with generally good outcomes, even when surgical evacuation of the hemorrhage is deemed necessary".

Introduction

Arachnoid cysts are benign space-occupying lesions mostly of the left temporal fossa. Although rarely caused by trauma, infection or neoplasia, they are usually developmental defects. These cysts represent 1% of intracranial masses and are commonly incidental findings. Most are asymptomatic, and vague symptoms might not be easily detected. Neurosurgical management is mainly conservative.

The neuropsychiatry of arachnoid cysts is controversial (see table 1). Psychiatric illnesses exist in the case reports that either improved only after drainage of cysts, or where drainage leads to a decreased need for medicationor where neurosurgical intervention was withheld and psychopathology proved resistant. Studies have found significantly more cognitive problemsand pathological personality traitsin patients with arachnoid cysts compared with normal populations.

Table 1
Selected case reports of middle fossa arachnoid cysts in patients with neuropsychiatric presentations

There have also been studies that failed to show neuropsychological differences in patients with arachnoid cystsand case reports where psychiatric treatment, as usual, leads to predictable symptomatic improvement. Improved understanding of the mechanisms by which cysts might contribute to symptoms is, therefore, necessary to aid decision-making.

We report two cases with middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts with unusual clinical courses. We speculate whether the neurosurgical intervention could benefit our patients, considering the evidence for the cysts to be aetiologically significant, and discuss indications for surgery in these cases with special reference to ethical considerations.

### Prevalence and natural history of arachnoid cysts in adults [^f79f1a94]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Arachnoid cysts are a frequent finding on intracranial imaging. The prevalence and natural history of these cysts in adults are not well defined.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of a consecutive series of adults who underwent brain MRI over a 12-year interval to identify those with arachnoid cysts. The MRI studies were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis. For those patients with arachnoid cysts, we evaluated presenting symptoms, cyst size, and cyst location. Patients with more than 6 months' clinical and imaging follow-up were included in a natural history analysis.

Results

A total of 48,417 patients underwent brain MRI over the study period. Arachnoid cysts were identified in 661 patients (1.4%). Men had a higher prevalence than women (p < 0.0001). Multiple arachnoid cysts occurred in 30 patients. The most common locations were middle fossa (34%), retrocerebellar (33%), and convexity (14%). Middle fossa cysts were predominantly left-sided (70%, p < 0.001). Thirty-five patients were considered symptomatic and 24 underwent surgical treatment. Sellar and suprasellar cysts were more likely to be considered symptomatic (p < 0.0001). Middle fossa cysts were less likely to be considered symptomatic (p = 0.01. The criteria for natural history analysis were met in 203 patients with a total of 213 cysts. After a mean follow-up of 3.8 ± 2.8 years (for this subgroup), 5 cysts (2.3%) increased in size and 2 cysts decreased in size (0.9%). Only 2 patients developed new or worsening symptoms over the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding on intracranial imaging in all age groups. Although arachnoid cysts are symptomatic in a small number of patients, they are associated with a benign natural history for those presenting without symptoms.

### Extradural arachnoid cyst with lumbosacral cord and root compression in Marfan syndrome… [^7e311600]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid pulsation in patients with Marfan syndrome may dilate the dural sac, causing dural ectasia. This condition, which may be identified in more than 90% of patients, is considered a specific sign of the disease and is usually asymptomatic. 1 Rarely, dural ectasia is associated with sacral arachnoid cysts, which may cause lumbosacral root compression with pain and sphincteric disturbance. 2 Herein, we report a 25-year-old man with Marfan syndrome who presented with a 2-year history of worsening distal sensory motor deficits of the lower limbs. Clinical examination showed bilateral clawfoot with weakness of the distal muscles and hypoesthesia below the L4 level. Electromyography showed denervation in the distal lower limb muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed a large intraspinal, cerebrospinal fluid–containing cyst that displaced ventrally the thecal sac and the conus medullaris.

In the sagittal T2-weighted images, the upper pole of the cyst was at level Th11-Th12 and the lower pole, at the midlevel of L4; a faint linear image was seen in the cerebrospinal fluid–containing cyst and both 3-dimensional fast imaging using steady-state acquisition magnetic resonance–myelography and axial, high-resolution, T2-weighted images confirmed the presence and the location of the septum and the displacement of the dural sac. The final diagnosis was extradural arachnoid cyst. Di Lazzaro V, Pilato F, Dileone M, et al. Extradural Arachnoid Cyst With Lumbosacral Cord and Root Compression in Marfan Syndrome.

### Rare intrasellar arachnoid cyst distinguishing from other benign cystic lesions and its surgical strategies [^09d33081]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The study reported a case of an intrasellar arachnoid cyst with visual disturbances as the main symptom. Arachnoid cyst is a common intracranial benign space-occupying lesion, but rarely seen in intrasellar region with less than 100 cases reported available in English language literature. Therefore, it is still controversial about the diagnosis and treatment of such patients. This article reviewed previous literature and discussed the differential diagnosis and surgical strategies of intrasellar arachnoid cyst in combination with our own case.

### Intracranial arachnoid cyst rupture after mild TBI in children: have we underestimated this risk? [^1c562b19]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

The association between intracranial arachnoid cyst rupture and mild brain trauma is infrequently reported. The purpose of this case report is to describe the case of a child with a left temporal arachnoid cyst who suffered rupture with haemorrhage after mild trauma during a football match. The child presented with chronic headache of mild intensity that progressed to a more intense headache after a traumatic event. He underwent surgical intervention after diagnosis of chronic haemorrhage in an arachnoid cyst in the ipsilateral subdural space. The risk of intracranial arachnoid cyst rupture should be considered during the evaluation of oligosymptomatic patients because it is a potentially catastrophic event.

### Cut it out or wait it out? Case series of middle fossa arachnoid cysts presenting with psychiatric symptoms and a discussion of the ethics of neurosurgical management [^a20626dc]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These cases highlight some of the practical diagnostic difficulties in patients with complex comorbidity. We considered the possibility of substance-induced bipolar and related disorder in case 1 but thought this less likely given the persistence of severe mood and psychotic symptoms over an abstinent period of longer than 2 months. This patient also had striking symptoms suggestive of temporal lobe dysfunction, which cannot be accounted for based on his psychiatric diagnosis alone. Similarly, in case 2, the bizarre presentation, reminiscent of TLE, in our opinion does not clearly fit any primary psychiatric syndrome.

It is impossible to know whether the arachnoid cysts were present before the first onset of psychiatric symptoms, but we believe they likely contributed to the clinical picture in both patients. In both cases, treatment resistance and the unpredictable course suggest that the cysts influence prognosis. This raises the question of whether surgery could change the course of illness. To answer this, we require reasonable confidence that the cysts could cause the symptoms and, secondly, that the risks of surgery do not outweigh the potential benefit.

Middle fossa arachnoid cysts have been associated with psychiatric symptoms. Causality can be inferred by temporal lobe pathology in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as psychosis in relation to TLE. This is underlined by reports of the resolution of psychiatric symptoms following arachnoid cyst surgery.

The mechanism is generally understood as a mass effect. It is not surprising that larger cysts more often require surgery. Reorganisation, hypoperfusion and hypometabolism occur in adjacent tissue, especially with higher intracystic pressures, and decompression might improve cerebral function in seemingly asymptomatic patients.

However, most cysts enlarge slowly, if ever, allowing the tissue to adapt. The cranium is malleable in youth so that the presence of a cyst produces a larger intracranial volume without pressure effects. There is no linear association between cyst size and symptoms, or between neuroimaging improvement and symptom improvement postoperatively.

### Cut it out or wait it out? Case series of middle fossa arachnoid cysts presenting with psychiatric symptoms and a discussion of the ethics of neurosurgical management [^8ecaf3d3]. General Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgery could be an option in those selected patients who are informed of the weak evidence base, especially considering arachnoid cysts are both common and often benign. Issues of capacity and informed consent might further limit the role of surgery in acute psychiatry. The decision to operate should, therefore, be based on the consensus between the patient, psychiatrist and neurosurgeon. The involvement of the family, neuropsychologists, neurologists and ethicists could be prudent. If surgery is selected, anecdotal evidence from case reports suggests that minimally invasive procedures could be effective.

There are some major limitations to our study. First, this is a limited case series, and although it adds to a growing literature on the neuropsychiatry of arachnoid cysts, the ability to draw firm conclusions about the value of surgery is hampered by a lack of prospective studies with rigorous experimental design. Second, the lack of follow-up (which is a function of our hospital serving as a referral centre for several districts in a large province) limits our ability to comment on longer-term outcomes. Both patients returned to local psychiatric follow-up. Future prospective studies examining the natural progress of neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with arachnoid cysts would be critical to improving our understanding of the appropriate management of these lesions.

Our study does, however, contribute to a growing literature on neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with middle fossa arachnoid cysts and adds impetus for further research into the nature of this relationship.

### Arachnoid web of the spine: a systematic literature review [^b624b7a7]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

An arachnoid web of the spine (AWS) is a rare and oftentimes challenging lesion to diagnose, given its subtle radiographic findings. However, when left untreated, this lesion can have devastating effects on a patient's neurological function. To date, only limited case reports and series have been published on this topic. In this study, the authors sought to better describe this lesion, performing a systematic literature review and including 2 cases from their institution's experience.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in September 2018 that queried Ovid MEDLINE (1946–2018), PubMed (1946–2018), Wiley Cochrane Library: Central Register of Controlled Trials (1898–2018), and Thompson Reuters Web of Science: Citation Index (1900–2018), per PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria specified all studies and case reports of patients with an AWS in which any relevant surgery types were considered and applied. Studies on arachnoid cysts and nonhuman populations, and those that did not report patient treatments or outcomes were excluded from the focus review.

Results

A total of 19 records and 2 patients treated by the senior authors were included in the systematic review, providing a total of 43 patients with AWS. The mean age was 52 years (range 28–77 years), and the majority of patients were male (72%, 31/43). A syrinx was present in 67% (29/43) of the cases. All AWSs were located in the thoracic spine, and all but 2 (95%) were located dorsally (1 ventrally and 1 circumferentially). Weakness was the most frequently reported symptom (67%, 29/43), followed by numbness and/or sensory loss (65%, 28/43). Symptoms predominated in the lower extremities (81%, 35/43). It was found that nearly half (47%, 20/43) of patients had been experiencing symptoms for 1 year or longer before surgical intervention was performed, and 35% (15/43) of reports stated that symptoms were progressive in nature. The most commonly used surgical technique was a laminectomy with intradural excision of the arachnoid web (86%, 36/42). Following surgery, 91% (39/43) of patients had reported improvement in their neurological symptoms. The mean follow-up was 9.2 months (range 0–51 months).

Conclusions

AWS of the spine can be a debilitating disease of the spine with no more than an indentation of the spinal cord found on advanced imaging studies. The authors found this lesion to be reported in twice as many males than females, to be associated with a syrinx more than two-thirds of the time, and to only have been reported in the thoracic spine; over 90% of patients experienced improvement in their neurological function following surgery.

### Management of subdural hygromas associated with arachnoid cysts [^38d8fde5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Arachnoid cysts may occasionally be associated with subdural hygromas. The management of these concurrent findings is controversial.

Methods

The authors reviewed their experience with arachnoid cysts and identified 8 patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts and an associated subdural hygroma. The medical records and images for these patients were also examined.

Results

In total, 8 patients presented with concurrent subdural hygroma and arachnoid cyst. Of these 8 patients, 6 presented with headaches and 4 had nausea and vomiting. Six patients had a history of trauma. One patient was treated surgically at the time of initial presentation, and 7 patients were managed without surgery. All patients experienced complete resolution of their presenting signs and symptoms.

Conclusions

Subdural hygroma may lead to symptomatic presentation for otherwise asymptomatic arachnoid cysts. The natural course of cyst-associated subdural hygromas, even when symptomatic, is generally benign, and symptom resolution can be expected in most cases. The authors suggest that symptomatic hygroma is not an absolute indication for surgical treatment and that expectant management can result in good outcomes in many cases.

### Prevalence and symptoms of intracranial arachnoid cysts: a population-based study [^39726c33]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

To investigate the prevalence of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a large population-based sample. We also aimed to assess the association between arachnoid cysts and cognitive impairment, depression, epilepsy, headache, dizziness, previous head trauma, hip fractures, and mortality. A population-based cohort and nested case-control study. The sample comprised representative populations (n = 1235) aged ≥ 70 years. All participants underwent baseline neuropsychiatric examinations, including computed tomography (CT) of the brain, between 1986 and 2000. All CT scans were examined for arachnoid cysts. Headache, dizziness, history of head trauma, dementia, depression, epilepsy, and hip fracture were assessed using data from clinical examinations, interviews and the Swedish hospital discharge register. Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination, and depressive symptoms using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Date of death was obtained from the National Swedish Death Registry. The prevalence of arachnoid cysts was 2.3% (n = 29), with no significant difference between men and women. Probands with and without cysts had the same frequency of headache, dizziness, previous head trauma, cognitive impairment, and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, there were no differences regarding the prevalence of dementia, depression, epilepsy, or previous hip fracture. Arachnoid cysts were not associated with increased mortality. Arachnoid cysts are common incidental finding, with the same rate in men and women, and are probably asymptomatic. The lack of relation with symptoms like headache, dizziness and cognitive impairment suggest caution in ascribing symptoms to incidentally discovered arachnoid cysts and a restrictive attitude to treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Adult non-neoplastic intracranial cysts are a heterogenous group of disorders that include a variety of distinct pathologies. Intracranial cysts that follow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have historically been described as arachnoid cysts. The incidence of arachnoid cysts is estimated to be 1.4%, yet over 94% of these patients are asymptomatic. Thus, most patients are diagnosed incidentally on neuroimaging. Current standard of care for asymptomatic patients is observation and close follow-up with imaging. However, if neurological signs and symptoms, such as headache, seizures, hydrocephalus or focal neurological deficits, are present, neurosurgical intervention is warranted. Microscopic fenestration to adjacent CSF spaces, endoscopic fenestration, stereotactic aspiration, and cystoperitoneal shunting are all surgical treatment options, with endoscopic fenestration the most common. Reported patient outcomes postoperatively are generally strong, with a reported symptom improvement between 72% and 90.5% across 3 cohort studies of intracranial arachnoid cysts.

Given favorable postoperative outcomes for patients with decompression of intracranial cysts, the etiology of these cysts is poorly studied. Cysts have long thought to be congenital, but they can also develop later in adulthood. While in large retrospective imaging studies on intracranial cysts, most do not grow or become symptomatic, there is clear clinical evidence of growing intracranial cysts that lead to development of mass effect and neurological symptoms. When intracranial cysts grow the etiology of this growth is unclear. One proposed mechanism is that some intracranial cysts develop a "ball-valve" mechanism in which CSF is trapped in a one-way directional flow, leading to increased pressure and subsequent cyst growth. Additional proposed mechanisms include active CSF secretion from the cyst inner membrane or osmotic gradients triggered by a higher protein concentration in cyst fluid. It is not known whether cysts capable of growth represent a unique pathological entity distinct from arachnoid cysts. However, it has been suggested that intracranial cysts may represent multiple pathological diagnoses, each with a varying mechanism and capacity for growth.

### Prevalence and natural history of arachnoid cysts in children [^7e11b029]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Object

Arachnoid cysts are a frequent finding on intracranial imaging in children. The prevalence and natural history of these cysts are not well defined. The authors studied a large consecutive series of children undergoing MR imaging to better define both the MR imaging-demonstrated prevalence and behavior of these lesions over time.

Methods

The authors reviewed a consecutive series of 11,738 patients who were 18 years of age or younger and had undergone brain MR imaging at a single institution during an 11-year period. In the patients in whom intracranial arachnoid cysts were identified, clinical and demographic information was recorded and imaging characteristics, such as cyst size and location, were evaluated. Prevalence data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, linear regression, and ANOVA. All patients with sufficient data (repeat MR imaging studies as well as repeated clinical evaluation over at least 5 months) for a natural history analysis were identified. This group was assessed for any change in symptoms or imaging appearance during the follow-up interval.

Results

Three hundred nine arachnoid cysts (2.6% prevalence rate) were identified. There was an increased prevalence of arachnoid cysts in males (p < 0.000001). One hundred eleven patients met all criteria for inclusion in the natural history analysis. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, 11 arachnoid cysts increased in size, 13 decreased, and 87 remained stable. A younger age at presentation was significantly associated with cyst enlargement (p = 0.001) and the need for surgery (p = 0.05). No patient older than 4 years of age at the time of initial diagnosis had cyst enlargement, demonstrated new symptoms, or underwent surgical treatment.

Conclusions

Arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding on intracranial imaging in pediatric patients. An older age at the time of presentation is associated with a lack of clinical or imaging changes over time.

II. What imaging studies should be used to classify disease?

Recommendation.

4 We recommend both a brain MRI and a non-contrast CT scan for classifying patients with newly diagnosed NCC (strong, moderate).

Evidence summary.

The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, prognosis, and management vary depending on the location of the cysticerci and viability of the cysticercus and the associated host response (Tables 1–3). The mildest form of NCC is the patient with an SEL. Lesions in these patients are often cystic. Patients also frequently present with one or more viable cysticerci, which are identified as cystic lesions on neuroimaging studies. A third group of patients presents with parenchymal calcifications. Many of these patients present with chronic epilepsy. A fourth group has one or more cysticerci in the ventricles. They often present with symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus. Finally, a fifth group has cysticerci in the subarachnoid space and can present with a range of presentations associated with basilar arachnoiditis. Many patients have mixed forms. In this case, they should generally be managed based on the more severe manifestation, with parenchymal disease usually milder whereas ventricular and subarachnoid disease carrying a worse prognosis.

Management depends on careful staging. Neurocysticercosis patients should be classified to determine if they have enhancing parenchymal lesions, viable parenchymal lesions, ventricular disease, SAN, isolated spinal disease, and/or ocular disease (Tables 2 and 3). Patients can have cysts in more than one of the previously mentioned locations. For example, although most cases with NCC have isolated parenchymal lesions, patients with parenchymal lesions may also have additional lesions in parenchyma, subarachnoid space, or ventricles. If possible, MRI should be performed in all cases to look for additional cysticerci. Recent advances in imaging include MRI with 3D volumetric sequencing, such as fast imaging using steady-state acquisition (FIESTA), 3D constructive interference in steady state (3D CISS), or balanced fast field echo (BFFE). These sequences provide enhanced resolution in areas with high T2 signal such as CSF. In cysticercosis, they have enhanced sensitivity for detection of extra-axial cysticerci in the ventricles or subarachnoid spaces.– There is a strong association of basal SAN with asymptomatic involvement of the spine. Thus, all patients with intracranial subarachnoid disease should also undergo an MRI of the spine.

III. What additional tests should be performed before initiation of therapy?

### Causes of arachnoid cyst development and expansion [^c4b2a2b4]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are frequent incidental findings on neuroimaging studies and in clinical practice. Theories of their origin, still matter for debate, compose four categories: 1) a ball-valve mechanism; 2) an osmotic gradient between the intra- and extracystic medium; 3) primary malformation of the arachnoid membrane or cerebral lobe agenesis; and 4) fluid hypersecretion by the lining cells of the cyst wall. The cause of cyst enlargement is also debatable, although there is strong controversial evidence supporting the last two theories rather than the former. Brain water homeostasis and its regulatory pathways are weakly understood at the molecular level. In this brief report the authors attempt to add new insights into the pathogenesis of arachnoid cysts by considering aquaporin expression in the cyst wall and discuss possible future research directions and molecular targets.

### Huge frontal-temporal lobe arachnoid cyst presenting as an weariness migraine [^b2485e1a]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To the authors' knowledge, most of intracranial arachnoid cyst located in middle cranial fossa and lateral fissure cistern. So, huge frontal-temporal lobe arachnoid cyst is rare. Symptoms of arachnoid cyst may be atypical, including headache, nausea, vomiting, epilepsy, poor memory, and so on. Of course, migraine related to weariness is a rare benign headache disorder. The authors reported a patient presenting with weariness migraine associated with large frontal-temporal lobe arachnoid cyst.

### Long-term follow-up of a multiloculated arachnoid cyst of the middle cranial fossa [^60356970]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are benign intracranial lesions that are typically diagnosed incidentally. We describe the case of a 56-year-old man who presented with a multiloculated arachnoid cyst of the middle cranial fossa that extended into the sphenoid sinus. The lesion was identified on computed tomography of the head, which had been obtained for an unrelated investigation. However, establishing a definitive diagnosis proved to be difficult. Because the cyst had caused extensive skull base erosion, the patient was managed conservatively with close observation. We report the radiographic progression of this lesion during more than a decade of follow-up, and we review the literature pertaining to the presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of arachnoid cysts.

### Cognition, FDG metabolism, and amyloid accumulation in relation to intracranial arachnoid cysts [^a872baa5]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With increasing availability and use of CT and MR scanning, incidental findings become more frequent. Arachnoid cysts are traditionally regarded as incidental and harmless and are in most cases left untreated; there are frequent findings with a prevalence of 0.5% as reported in a large meta-analysis on brain scans of people without neurological and psychiatric symptoms, 1.4% as reported in a more recent study of 48,417 patients undergoing MR for various reasons and 2.3% as reported in a study of a large population-based sample of people aged ≥ 70 years. They are cystic congenital structures arising from the arachnoid mater and contain cerebrospinal fluid; the most frequent location is the left medial cranial fossa. Despite their status as incidental findings, existing data on arachnoid cysts and symptomatology are contradictory as are recommendations for surgery. Recent literature has described surgically reversible psychological symptoms and cognitive deficits that correlate with cyst locations, also in incidentally detected cysts. Moreover, several reports indicate arachnoid cysts as an important differential diagnosis to Alzheimer's dementia.

Wester et al. conducted a series of studies on patients referred to neurosurgical departments for evaluation of incidental arachnoid cysts discovered during CT or MR scanning for other indications. They found psychological and focal cognitive deficits such as attention, memory, spatial abilities, and language that correlated with cyst locations and they found amelioration after surgery. These data were corroborated by several unrelated groups. Others suggest that arachnoid cysts contribute to symptoms of other psychiatric or neurological diseases and argue that surgery may ameliorate symptoms despite a persisting underlying condition. In contrast, Rabiei et al. did not find objective cognitive nor psychological deficits to be more prevalent in arachnoid cyst patients nor postsurgical amelioration of symptoms. Likewise, other groups have failed to reproduce findings of symptomatology related to "incidental" arachnoid cysts as well as postsurgical amelioration. It is, thus, controversial whether cysts cause symptoms, whether surgery improves symptoms, and how arachnoid cysts may be mechanistically linked to focal cognitive, psychiatric, or neurological symptoms.

### Cognition, FDG metabolism, and amyloid accumulation in relation to intracranial arachnoid cysts [^9f87c908]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

One source of controversy in the debate on arachnoid cysts is the lack of mechanistic understanding of focal cognitive deficits. As arachnoid cysts are considered congenital, they would not be expected to become symptomatic only in adulthood. Moreover, potential agenesis of brain tissue is an unlikely explanation of focal symptoms considering (1) the rapid cognitive normalization that has been reported after surgical treatment, (2) that cognitive symptoms never have shown a statistical association to cyst volume, and (3) that no strict association between symptom alleviation and reduction in cyst volume after surgery has been documented.

Recently, interstitial or glymphatic flow has been discussed as a physiological mechanism for nutrient supply and removal of debris. Subsequently, altered pressure gradients could be speculated to affect nutrient supply and removal of debris resulting in metabolic alterations such as accumulation of amyloid. Interestingly, Helland et al. found a significant relationship between intracystic pressure and pre-surgical complaints as well as between intracystic pressure and arterial mean pressure and pCO₂. A pressure gradient might obstruct interstitial flow and cause accumulation of metabolites. In addition, Zaatreh et al. found occasional focal metabolic aberrations by FDG-PET scanning.

To develop hypotheses that can guide further research, more knowledge on mechanistic findings and different populations with arachnoid cysts is necessary. Case reports and series are likely to reflect bias depending on which patients have been investigated and why. Hence, evaluation of populations that are homogenous with respect to the rationale for scanning such as is the case for the population in the present study can add valuable perspectives.

In the present cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of intracranial arachnoid cysts and to determine if arachnoid cysts were associated with cognitive deficits and changes in brain metabolism.

The specific hypotheses were:
The prevalence of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a population of cognitively impaired individuals is higher than the prevalence in the background population.
Supratentorial arachnoid cysts can cause focal cognitive deficits which are detectable with a neuropsychological test battery and correlate with cyst location.
There are individuals in a population of patients suspected to suffer from dementia that have surgically reversible symptoms caused by supratentorial arachnoid cysts.
Supratentorial arachnoid cysts can affect brain metabolism as estimated with FDG-PET imaging.
Supratentorial arachnoid cysts can lead to focal amyloid accumulation detectable with PiB-PET imaging.

### Atypical presentation of arachnoid web causing paraparesis with absence of sensory symptoms [^74937b74]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Arachnoid webs are thought to be the remnants of collapsed arachnoid cysts or potentially the result of trauma, such as from repeated falls. They compress the spinal cord, resulting in myelopathic symptoms that may be permanent if they persist untreated. Furthermore, new theories suggest that webs disrupt the pressure gradient of the spinal cord, creating a suction effect at the region of the web, which obstructs the flow of cerebral spinal fluid. Arachnoid webs are notoriously subtle on imaging and, as they are a rare condition, often go undetected for a prolonged period during which patients experience progressive deterioration and profound reduction in quality of life. An MRI of a patient with suspected arachnoid web characteristically shows dorsal indentation of the spinal cord, primarily in the thoracic spine. A comprehensive review by Nisson et al supports that webs are preferentially present in the thoracic spine, with 100% of their 43 patients having webs in this region. This study additionally reports that webs more commonly affect males, with approximately two-thirds of cases presenting with a concomitant syrinx. Regardless of their aetiology, arachnoid webs can cause devastating neurological dysfunction and necessitate evaluation for neurosurgical intervention.

### Ventral "spinal epidural meningeal cysts" – not epidural and not cysts? Case series and review of the literature [^eeda718c]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ventral spinal epidural meningeal cysts are rare entities for which the pathogenesis is poorly understood.

Objective

We present the clinical, radiographic, surgical, and pathologic findings of 4 patients with extensive ventral spinal epidural meningeal cysts and review the relevant literature. In addition, we discuss a suspected mechanism for pathogenesis.

Methods

Four patients with anterior spinal epidural meningeal cysts are retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Ventral spinal epidural meningeal cysts are often large, extending on average from C2 to L1 in our series. Patients typically present with a prolonged course of symptoms and signs, including segmental muscle weakness and atrophy, subtle myelopathy, mild to moderate spinal pain, and headache. Histopathologic analysis of the cyst wall demonstrates collagenous tissue consistent with dura but without arachnoid features. Dynamic computed tomographic myelography is the study of choice for localization of the primary dural defect. Patient symptoms and neurological deficits routinely improve after appropriate surgical intervention.

Conclusion

Diverse signs and symptoms herald the presentation of ventral spinal meningoceles. Intraoperative, radiographic, and pathological findings are all suggestive of an intradural dissection as the etiology. Hence, they may be more appropriately named "ventral spinal intradural dissecting meningoceles". Definitive treatment involves identification and obliteration of the dural defect.

### Spinal arachnoid cysts in adults: diagnosis and management. A single-center experience [^865e6257]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVEAdult spinal arachnoid cysts (SACs) are rare entities of indistinct etiology that present with pain or myelopathy. Diagnosis is made on imaging studies with varying degrees of specificity. In symptomatic cases, the standard treatment involves surgical exploration and relief of neural tissue compression. The aim of this study was to illustrate features of SACs in adults, surgical management, and outcomes.METHODSThe authors searched medical records for all SACs in adults in the 10-year period ending in December 2016. Radiology and pathology reports were reviewed to exclude other spine cystic disorders. Recurrent or previously treated patients were excluded. Demographic variables (age, sex) and clinical presentation (symptoms, duration, history of infection or trauma, and examination findings) were extracted. Radiological features were collected from radiology reports and direct interpretation of imaging studies. Operative reports and media were reviewed to accurately describe the surgical technique. Finally, patient-reported outcomes were collected at every clinic visit using the SF-36.RESULTSThe authors' search identified 22 patients with SACs (mean age at presentation 53.5 years). Seventeen patients were women, representing an almost 3:1 sex distribution. Symptoms comprised back pain (n = 16, 73%), weakness (n = 10, 45%), gait ataxia (n = 11, 50%), and sphincter dysfunction (n = 4, 18%). The mean duration of symptoms was 15 months. Seven patients (32%) exhibited signs of myelopathy. All patients underwent preoperative MRI; in addition, 6 underwent CT myelography. SACs were located in the thoracic spine (n = 17, 77%), and less commonly in the lumbar spine (n = 3, 14%) and cervical/cervicothoracolumbar region (n = 2, 9%). Based on imaging findings, the cysts were interpreted as intradural SACs (n = 11, 50%), extradural SACs (n = 6, 27%), or ventral spinal cord herniation (n = 2, 9%); findings in 3 patients (14%) were inconclusive. Nineteen patients underwent surgical treatment consisting of laminoplasty in addition to cyst resection (n = 13, 68%), ligation of the connecting pedicle (n = 4, 21%), or fenestration/marsupialization (n = 2, 11%). Postoperatively, patients were followed up for an average of 8.2 months (range 2–30 months). Postoperative MRI showed complete resolution of the SAC in 14 of 16 patients. Patient-reported outcomes showed improvement in SF-36 parameters. One patient suffered a delayed wound infection.CONCLUSIONSIn symptomatic patients with imaging findings suggestive of spinal arachnoid cyst, surgical exploration and complete resection is the treatment of choice. Treatment is usually well tolerated, carries low risks, and provides the best chances for optimal recovery.

### Intracranial arachnoid cyst rupture after mild TBI in children: have we underestimated this risk? [^66046fc3]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Background

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are uncommon among children and may account for up to 2.6% of expanding intracranial lesions. Their most frequent location is the middle fossa. Most are asymptomatic or present with headache, convulsions and haemorrhage.

Haemorrhages are uncommon and potentially catastrophic events, and their pathophysiology is unclear; they may arise after traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spontaneously.

Traumas, even those with low kinetic energy, are a risk factor for intracystic haemorrhage due to the pressure imbalance and the rupture of the blood vessels within the lesion. In addition, the incidence of intracystic haemorrhage is related to lesion size, especially when the lesion is larger than 5 cm.

The treatment of choice for arachnoid cysts with haemorrhage is surgical, consisting of haematoma drainage and cyst fenestration into the subarachnoid space, with the objective of restoring cerebrospinal fluid flow.

Currently, the indication of surgical treatment for asymptomatic arachnoid cysts is controversial. The argument in favour of conservative treatment is based on the low incidence of cyst rupture, which occurs in approximately 6% of patients.

This report describes a case of haemorrhage in a temporal arachnoid cyst after mild TBI.

### Supratentorial arachnoid cyst located in the brain parenchyma: case report [^3521b71f]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Importance

Arachnoid cysts have not been reported to be located within the brain parenchyma. We present a case of an arachnoid cyst that was contained entirely within the right frontal lobe devoid of communication with the subarachnoid space and ventricle.

Clinical Presentation

A 65-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of progressive headache and nausea. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imagining scans showed a well-defined, nonenhancing mass measuring 5 × 5 × 3.5 cm in the right frontal lobe. The mass appeared to be contained entirely within the brain parenchyma. The patient underwent a right frontal craniotomy, at which time the cystic mass was identified in the brain parenchyma without any communication with the arachnoid space. The cyst contained a clear fluid, and its wall was excised. The fluid contents demonstrated a composition similar to that of normal cerebrospinal fluid. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations of the cyst wall were compatible with the diagnosis of an arachnoid cyst. Postoperatively, the symptoms of the patient resolved, and no recurrence was observed up to 6 months after removal.

Conclusion

The present case showed an intraparenchymal arachnoid cyst arising in the frontal lobe. Although the etiology is not known, an arachnoid cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis of primary intracerebral cysts.

### Arachnoid cysts: case series and review of the literature [^d75ec0f3]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Object

Arachnoid cysts are commonly encountered fluid collections in the central nervous system. Recent advances in neuroimaging have translated into an increased detection of these cysts; that is, diagnoses can be made more frequently at earlier stages. Significant advances have also been made in the surgical management of these lesions. The authors report on a case series that illustrates the diverse forms of presentation and the treatment modalities commonly used for arachnoid cysts.

Methods

Between January 2002 and December 2006, 20 patients with arachnoid cysts underwent surgery performed by the senior author at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Seventy percent of the cysts were supratentorial, 5% infratentorial, and 25% spinal. All diagnoses were confirmed on neuroimaging, surgery, and histological examination. Included in the study were 12 male (60%) and eight female (40%) patients, ranging in age from 2 weeks to 39 years (mean age 10.9 years) at the time of surgery. Symptoms at presentation included headache (41%), weakness (23%), seizure (14%), hydrocephalus (9%), scoliosis (4%), cognitive decline (4%), and visual loss (4%). Twenty-five percent of the cysts were sylvian, 20% intraventricular, and 20% suprasellar. Supratentorial cysts were treated endoscopically in 73% of patients and with open resection in the remaining 27%. Complications included spasticity, hemiparesis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, hydrocephalus, and subdural hygroma. On follow-up evaluation, 60% of patients had stable cysts and improved symptoms, 13% complete symptom resolution, and 13% stable symptoms. All patients with spinal cysts underwent laminectomies and fenestration, and one cystosubarachnoid (CS) shunt was placed. Cyst reaccumulation occurred in three patients; two patients required cystoperitoneal (CP) and CS shunts. No deaths occurred.

Conclusions

Most arachnoid cysts are found incidentally and can be managed conservatively. Symptomatic patients are surgical candidates. Treatments include CP shunt placement, craniotomy, or endoscopic fenestration, and stereotactic aspiration. Recent advances in neurosurgical techniques and neuroendoscopy continue to favor fenestration over shunt insertion as the method of choice for initial cyst decompression.

### Exploring predictors of surgery and comparing operative treatment approaches for pediatric intracranial arachnoid cysts: a case series of 83 patients [^26958163]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Object

Although intracranial arachnoid cysts are a common incidental finding on pediatric brain imaging, only a subset of patients require surgery for them. For the minority who undergo surgery, the comparative effectiveness of various surgical approaches is debated. The authors explored predictors of surgery and compared operative techniques for pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst seen at a tertiary care center.

Methods

The authors reviewed records of pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst. For each patient, data on baseline characteristics, the method of intervention, and surgical outcomes for the initial surgery were extracted, and cyst size at diagnosis was calculated (anteroposterior × craniocaudal × mediolateral). Baseline variables were analyzed as predictors of surgery by using logistic regression modeling, excluding patients whose surgery was not related to cyst size (i.e., those with obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to the cyst compressing a narrow CSF flow pathway or cyst rupture/hemorrhage). Data collected regarding surgical outcomes were analyzed descriptively.

Results

Among 83 pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst seen over a 25-year period (1989–2013), 27 (33%) underwent surgery; all had at least 1 cyst-attributed symptom/finding. In the multivariate model, age at presentation and cyst size at diagnosis were independent predictors of surgery. Cyst size had greater predictive value; specifically, the area under the curve for the receiver-operating-characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% CI 0.82–0.97), with an ideal cutoff point of ≥ 68 cm³. This cutoff point had 100% sensitivity (95% CI 79%-100%), 75% specificity (95% CI 61%-85%), a 53% positive predictive value (95% CI 36%-70%), and a 100% negative predictive value (95% CI 91%-100%); the positive likelihood ratio was 4.0 (95% CI 2.5–6.3), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0 (95% CI 0–0.3). Although the multivariate model excluded 7 patients who underwent surgery (based on prespecified criteria), excluding these 7 cases did not change the overall findings, as shown in a sensitivity analysis that included all the cases. Descriptive results regarding surgical outcomes did not indicate any salient differences among the surgical techniques (endoscopic fenestration, cystoperitoneal shunting, or craniotomy-based procedures) in terms of symptom resolution within 6 months, need for reoperation to date, cyst-size change from before the operation, morbidity, or mortality.

Conclusions

The results of these exploratory analyses suggest that pediatric patients with an intracranial arachnoid cyst are more likely to undergo surgery if the cyst is large, compresses a narrow CSF flow pathway to cause hydrocephalus, or has ruptured/hemorrhaged. There were no salient differences among the 3 surgical techniques for several clinically important outcomes. A prospective multicenter study is required to enable more robust analyses, which could ultimately provide a decision-making framework for surgical indications and clarify any differences in the comparative effectiveness of surgical approaches to treating pediatric intracranial arachnoid cysts.

### Atypical presentation of arachnoid web causing paraparesis with absence of sensory symptoms [^ed0c7f46]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Arachnoid web is a serious and rare pathology of the spinal cord causing myelopathy from the increased thickness of the arachnoid layer and interruption of cerebrospinal fluid flow around the cord. As of 2019, there were only 43 reported cases of this condition in the current literature.

Presentation with both hyperreflexia and muscle atrophy of the lower limbs with gait disturbances, subtle findings on imaging and the relative rarity of arachnoid webs contributed to the difficulty in making an accurate clinical diagnosis for this patient.

In a 2022 retrospective study examining 17 patients with arachnoid webs, 100% of cases presented with scalpel signs, illustrating how critical imaging is in making this diagnosis. Although the presence of a scalpel sign is considered a primary diagnostic indicator for this condition, there are cases of minimal or no scalpel sign on imaging but an arachnoid web being found regardless. This suggests that improvements in imaging may allow for more diagnoses of webs in the future that exist without detectable scalpel signs. Continuing developments in MRI may further improve diagnostic capacity for arachnoid webs. Currently, MRI and CT myelography are variable in their capacity to successfully identify thickened arachnoid tissue directly and scalpel sign is more often used as an indirect suggestion of the presence of a web.CT myelography can indicate webs, but as webs typically produce incomplete CSF obstruction, these cannot be diagnostic in isolation. With increased resolution, imaging could more directly reveal arachnoid thickening. Constructive interface in steady state MRI — not widely available clinically — is very promising as it has 'improved spatial resolution' and can show in greater detail meningeal adhesions, differentiating these from arachnoid cysts or tumours when compared with currently used T2 MR images.

Multiple previous case reports of arachnoid webs discuss significant sensory changesas a classic part of the patient presentation, particularly in the lower limbs. However, sensory changes cannot be considered diagnostic of arachnoid webs. As illustrated in table 1, 41% or less of patients will present with sensory perturbation. Additionally, the syrinx may be absent in as many as almost 60% of cases, according to the reviews, as shown in table 1. Although arachnoid webs are most typically found in the thoracic spine, case reports now describe them in the cervical spine as well, further muddying the waters on when to suspect a possible web.

### Symptomatic spinal arachnoid cysts: report of two cases with review of the literature [^b49b1729]. Spine (2003). Low credibility.

Study Design

Two unusual cases of intradural extramedullary noncommunicating arachnoid cysts are presented, with a review of literature.

Objective

To assess surgical excision results in the reversal of symptoms and neurologic deficits.

Summary Of Background Data

Most patients harboring arachnoid cysts are asymptomatic. Noncommunicating intradural extramedullary arachnoid cysts are more rare than communicating intradural extramedullary cysts. Noncommunicating intradural extramedullary arachnoid cysts are a very rare cause of spinal cord compression. Rarely, these cysts can present with bizarre symptoms, such as angina.

Materials and Methods

The first case, a 75-year-old woman, presented with progressive paraparesis. The second case, a 40-year-old man, presented with signs and symptoms of angina, with mild spasticity in the lower limbs. In both cases, magnetic resonance imaging revealed compression of the spinal cord as the etiology of presentation. The first patient is the second oldest patient in the literature with an idiopathic spinal arachnoid cyst. The second case has an unusual presentation that has not previously been reported in the literature.

Results

Both cases underwent surgical excision of the arachnoid cyst, with resolution of symptoms and reversal of neurologic deficit.

Conclusions

Our experience indicates that complete recovery from an arachnoid cyst is possible after surgical excision, even when symptoms are present for a long duration, even in the elderly.

### Arachnoid cyst of the craniocervical junction: case report [^e583f432]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

An arachnoid cyst at the craniocervical junction presenting with obstructive hydrocephalus as a result of blockage of the outflow of the fourth ventricle is described. This is a very rare anatomic site, with only five other cases described in the literature.

Clinical Presentation

A 37-year-old woman presented with a 9-month history of severe neck pain, persistent vomiting, visual disturbances, and numbness of the nose, cheek, and lips. She had severe bilateral papilledema on ophthalmoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a midline cystic lesion extending down to C2.

Intervention

The patient underwent posterior fossa craniectomy and excision of the arachnoid cyst. She made a full recovery and was asymptomatic at follow-up examination.

Conclusion

The symptomatology of these rare craniocervical arachnoid cysts and their development are discussed.

### Spontaneous development of a de novo suprasellar arachnoid cyst. case report [^eb347190]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are commonly thought to arise from either congenital defects or trauma. In this article the authors report the spontaneous development of a suprasellar third ventricular arachnoid cyst whose origin was not clearly congenital or traumatic. At the age of 4 months, the patient presented with hypertonia, and a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study showed no abnormalities. At the age of 2 years, the boy presented with headaches and projectile emesis, symptoms that prompted further imaging studies. An MR image of the brain revealed a suprasellar cyst and obstructive hydrocephalus. The cyst was endoscopically fenestrated, which led to long-term symptom resolution.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of intracranial arachnoid cysts in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age [^fb664425]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Object

Arachnoid cysts can cause a variety of clinical signs and symptoms in infants. The authors sought to determine whether the clinical presentation of pediatric patients younger than 2 years old and harboring arachnoid cysts influenced the type of intervention that would be required.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted for all patients younger than 2 years of age who had undergone craniotomy for fenestration of an arachnoid cyst at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles between 1995 and 2006. Forty-two patients were included in the study. The mean age was 10.4 months. The median follow-up time was 33 months. Clinical presentations were as follows: macrocephaly without ventriculomegaly (21 patients, 50%), hydrocephalus (six patients, 14%), and other symptoms (15 patients, 36%). After fenestration of the arachnoid cyst, 12 of 21 patients (57%) presenting with nonspecific macrocephaly required placement of a cystoperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt, compared with 1 of 15 patients (7%) presenting with other symptoms (p value = 0.0039). Five of six patients with hydrocephalus (83%) were shunt dependent following fenestration. Overall, 18 of 42 patients (43%) were shunt dependent after fenestration. Ten of these patients (55%) required revisions during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Patients younger than 2 years of age and harboring an arachnoid cyst commonly present with macrocephaly. These patients are more likely to require shunts than are those presenting with other findings, such as seizures or incidental lesions. The development and expansion of arachnoid cysts may be related to aberrant cerebrospinalfluid dynamics, and these lesions may be a form fruste of hydrocephalus. Arachnoid cysts should be treatedwith craniotomy and cyst fenestration, taking into account the likelihood of perioperative shunt dependency.

### Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts in adults: an institutional experience and literature review [^7269dca0]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Adult spinal intradural arachnoid cysts are rare pathologic entities with an unclear etiopathogenesis. These lesions can be dichotomized into primary (idiopathic) or secondary (related to inflammation, intradural surgery, or trauma) etiologies. Limited series have depicted optimal management strategies and clinical outcomes.

Objective

To illustrate our experience with spinal intradural arachnoid cysts and to present a literature review of surgically treated cysts to elucidate the clinical and anatomic differences between etiologies.

Methods

Institutional review revealed 29 patients. Various data were extracted from the medical record. Initial and follow-up symptomatologies of the surgical cohort were compared. The literature review included case series describing cysts managed surgically.

Results

From patients treated surgically at our institution (22), there was a significant reduction in thoracic back pain postoperatively (P = 0.034). A literature review yielded 271 additional cases. Overall, primary and secondary lesions accounted for 254 and 39 cases, respectively. Cysts of secondary origin were more likely localized ventral to the spinal cord (P = 0.013). The rate of symptomatic improvement after surgical intervention for primary cysts was more than double than that of secondary cysts (P < .001). Compared with primary etiologies, the rates of radiographic progression (P = 0.032) and repeat surgery (P = 0.041) were each more than double for secondary cysts.

Conclusion

Surgical intervention for spinal intradural arachnoid cysts improves thoracic back pain. The literature supports surgical intervention for symptomatic primary spinal intradural arachnoid cysts with improved clinical outcomes. Surgery should be cautiously considered for secondary cysts given worse outcomes.

### Suprasellar versus third ventricular cysts: anatomic and surgical considerations [^84b1f787]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Importance

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are benign cerebrospinal fluid-filled sacs that occur in 2.6% of children and 1.4% of adults. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SACs) represent between 9% and 21% of pediatric arachnoid cysts. These are often confused with the less common third ventricular cysts (3VCs). Both can grow and cause obstructive hydrocephalus, requiring urgent treatment. The aim of surgical treatment was to re-establish cerebrospinal fluid circulation. In this article, we describe and contrast the imaging characteristics of SAC and 3VC, and show stepwise endoscopic surgical approaches for each.

Clinical Presentation

We show examples of patients with SAC and 3VC who presented with symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus and who underwent endoscopic intraventricular resection of the cysts leading to long-term resolution of the hydrocephalus and symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging of the anatomic differences and video demonstrations of the surgical approaches reveal important features that distinguish between the 2 cysts.

Conclusion

Safe endoscopic treatment of SAC and 3VC requires a thorough understanding of how each distorts the anatomy of the third ventricle and suprasellar cistern, and a stepwise surgical approach based on this anatomy.

### A form of dysplasia or a fortuitous association? A cerebral aneurysm inside an arachnoid cyst: case report [^65686c9c]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Although arachnoid cysts and intracranial aneurysms are very common lesions, their association in the same patient is rare. We present a case of a middle cerebral artery aneurysm ruptured into an arachnoid cyst. We found only six cases with intracystic hemorrhage reported in the literature. The presence of an arachnoid cyst can mislead clinical presentation. The patient presented a paradoxically small temporal fossa and thickening of the temporal and sphenoid bone. The authors suggest that this uncommon association (arachnoid cyst, atypical cranial vault, and "mirror-like" cerebral aneurysm) could represent a form of dysplasia.

Clinical Presentation

A 46-year-old patient presented with a 3-week history of slight headaches, which had worsened in the last 3 days before presentation. Computed tomographic scans showed a cystic lesion located in the middle cranial fossa and sylvian fissure with suspected aneurysm dilation inside. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed an intracystic hemorrhage but not subarachnoid hemorrhage. Paradoxically, changes in the cranial vault around the cyst were noted. Digital subtraction angiography showed bilateral "mirror" middle cerebral artery aneurysms.

Intervention

A large right pterional craniotomy was performed with full microsurgical removal of the arachnoid cyst walls and aneurysm clipping. The aneurysm was in the medial wall of the arachnoid cyst with its dome inside the cyst. The contralateral aneurysm was clipped 2 weeks later. The follow-up period was uneventful, and the patient returned to normal life.

Conclusion

Rupture of a cerebral aneurysm into an arachnoid cyst is rare. Clinical presentation may be unusual because the cyst can prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage. A middle fossa cranial arachnoid cyst in the presence of temporal bone depression, small middle fossa, and thickness of squamous temporal bone and the lesser wing of sphenoid is rare and suggests that congenital factors may play an important role in their development. The exceptional association between "mirror" aneurysms and arachnoid cyst with bone changes suggests a possible congenital form of dysplasia.

### Intrasellar arachnoid cysts [^92946523]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical, endocrinological, and radiological presentation of nine cases of surgically verified intrasellar arachnoid cysts and to discuss the physiopathological mechanisms of formation of these cysts.

Methods

Among 1540 patients presenting with pituitary lesions, nine presented with an intrasellar arachnoid cyst. Their charts were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Presenting symptoms included headache (n = 2), visual symptoms (n = 3), menstrual irregularities (n = 2), rapid weight gain (n = 1), vertigo (n = 1), and/or confusion (n = 1). Two cysts were discovered incidentally. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed an intrasellar cystic lesion in all cases, with a huge suprasellar extension in six cases. The cyst was of the same intensity as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in only two patients. A transsphenoidal approach allowed the transdural aspiration of fluid and injection of a water-soluble contrast agent under mild pressure. In three patients, the contrast infiltrated along the pituitary stalk toward the subarachnoid spaces; in the other patients, it remained in the intrasellar compartment. Cyst membranes were removed as completely as possible with fenestration toward the subarachnoid spaces in communicating cysts. In spite of tight packing of the sella and sphenoid sinus, CSF fistulae requiring reoperation developed in two patients.

Conclusion

The clinical picture of an intrasellar arachnoid cyst resembles that of a nonfunctional pituitary adenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging scans typically show a cystic intrasellar lesion with suprasellar extension, containing isointense or, more often, hyperintense fluid on T1-weighted sequences. In spite of the risk of CSF fistulae, the preferred surgical approach is transsphenoidal. A physiopathological mechanism is proposed according to anatomic variations of the sellar diaphragma allowing penetration of subarachnoid spaces into the sellar compartment and their enlargement by a ball-valve mechanism.

### Clinical variety and prognosis of intracranial arachnoid cysts in children [^165fac6c]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts (AC) occur in different intracranial locations. Management and prognosis depend on the clinical presentation and treatment guidelines do not exist. With this study, we want to demonstrate the clinical variety of arachnoid cysts in children and place a focus on outcome factors in operated cases. This retrospective study of a consecutive single unit series of children, who underwent AC surgery between January 2010 and September 2019, provides demographic, clinical, imaging data, and information about surgical treatment and outcome. Overall, 63 patients (71.4 male) underwent surgery. Mean age was 50 months (0–191). Mean follow-up was 40 months (0–121). Eighty-one percent of patients presented with symptoms/signs of raised ICP. Focal neurological deficits were present in 15.9%, headache in 11.1% of children. Galassi cysts represented the predominant type (30.2%), followed by suprasellar (14.3%), quadrigeminal (12.7%), retrocerebellar, CPA and midline (each 11.1%), and hemispheric cysts (7.9%). Endoscopic and microsurgical fenestrations were performed in 27% and 58.7%, stent or shunt insertion in 6.3%/57.9% of the cases. In 33.3% of the cases one and in 12.7%, a second reintervention became necessary. Reoperation rate was significantly higher in children < 1 year (p = 0.003). Cyst volume decreased in 85.7%. Seventy percent of the patients were symptom free, 5% suffered from headache, and 22% from developmental disorders. All focal neurological symptoms resolved. Complication rate and outcome are depending on age and cyst location. Recurrence and revision rates are significantly higher in young infants (p = 0.003). Midline cysts with CCA are associated with developmental disorders.

### Syringomyelia associated with intradural arachnoid cysts [^133d9d85]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Object

Intradural arachnoid cysts are relatively uncommon pouches of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) found within the subarachnoid space. The authors present a series of eight symptomatic patients in whom syrinx cavities were associated with arachnoid cysts, and they discuss treatment strategies for this entity.

Methods

The population comprised eight men whose mean age was 50 years (range 35–81 years). All patients experienced gait difficulty, and it was the chief complaint in seven; arm pain was the primary complaint in one. No patient had a history of spinal trauma, meningitis, or previous spinal surgery at the level of the syrinx cavity or arachnoid cyst. In each patient imaging revealed a syrinx cavity affecting two to 10 vertebral levels. Posterior thoracic arachnoid cysts were found in proximity to the syrinx cavity in each case. There was no evidence of cavity enhancement, Chiari malformation, tethered cord, or hydrocephalus. All patients underwent thoracic laminectomy and resection of the arachnoid cyst wall, and postoperative neurological improvement was documented in each case. The mean follow-up duration was 19 months (range 4–37 months). Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the disappearance of the arachnoid cyst and a significant decrease in syrinx cavity size in each patient.

Conclusions

Spinal arachnoid cysts can be associated with syringomyelia, likely due to alterations in normal CSF dynamics. In symptomatic patients these cysts should be resected and the normal CSF flow restored. The results of the present series indicate that neurological improvement and reduction in syrinx cavity size can be achieved in patients with syringomyelia associated with intradural arachnoid cysts.

### Cognition, FDG metabolism, and amyloid accumulation in relation to intracranial arachnoid cysts [^859ff74e]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The prevalence of patients with intracranial arachnoid cysts with a diameter of ≥ 2 cm was 21 (1%) in this population of 2292 patients referred for PET scans as part of an evaluation for dementia. This was marginally higher than the 0.5% reported in a meta-analysis by Morris et al. considering 15,559 patients without neurological and psychiatric symptoms but marginally lower than the 1.4% reported by Al-Holou et al. and the prevalence of 2.3% reported by Rabiei et al. who studied a population-based sample of people aged ≥ 70 years. This finding does not support the hypothesis that the prevalence of intracranial arachnoid cysts in a population of cognitively impaired individuals is higher than the prevalence in the background population. In agreement with previous reports, most (76%) identified intracranial arachnoid cysts were supratentorial and the most frequent location was the left temporal lobe (50%).

Our data did not confirm that supratentorial arachnoid cysts cause focal cognitive deficits detectable with a neuropsychological test battery in a group of patients referred for dementia evaluation. Most patients showed signs of non-lateralized cognitive dysfunction; only two patients (patient A and G) showed lateralized deficits from the hemisphere of the cyst. These deficits were, however, not in clear agreement with cyst location as the presumably impaired cerebral areas were the frontal lobes and the cysts were in the temporal lobes. Only two patients (patient E and J) had their cysts surgically treated but neither had a documented relief of symptoms. This contrasts with the findings in some previous studies but agrees with others as presented above. Still, it should be noted that subtle cognitive deficits caused by arachnoid cysts could be undetectable in this group of patients referred due to suspicion of dementia and that it, therefore, cannot be concluded from this study that a subgroup of arachnoid cyst patients with cognitive symptoms caused by the cysts does not exist nor that symptoms could not be detectable in a healthier population. Studies on different and larger populations would still be warranted to assess a possible causal relation to cognition in patients not affected by dementia.

### Incidental intracranial cysts in children [^6da2a4af]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

With increasing use of intracranial imaging, the diagnosis of benign intracranial cysts is becoming more frequent in the pediatric population. These lesions are usually incidentally discovered during the work-up of unrelated symptoms. Most do not require treatment and many do not even require imaging follow-up. When symptomatic, symptoms of these lesions are usually caused by local mass effect. Symptomatic lesions warrant neurosurgical evaluation, and may require surgical intervention in rare, well-selected cases. This article describes three common benign intracranial cysts found in the pediatric population: arachnoid cysts, choroid cysts, and pineal cysts.

### Outcomes of neuroendoscopy for suprasellar arachnoid cysts: a single center experiences [^79b86246]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Arachnoid cysts (AC) are intra-arachnoid, cerebrospinal fluid sacs between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane. They are not due to the division or proliferation of the arachnoid membrane but are typically congenital, arising from separations within the arachnoid membrane. Suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SAC) are believed to result from abnormal Lilliquist's membrane or cystic dilatation of the interpeduncular cisterna. Intracranial arachnoid cysts account for around 1% of all intracranial lesions.

The apparent increase in incidence is likely due to improved detection capabilities of modern imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) rather than an actual increase in the occurrence of these cysts. Some SAC symptoms are macrocrania, obstructive hydrocephalus, and visual and endocrine dysfunctions (hormone deficiency, precocious puberty).

Treating arachnoid cysts typically involves resection, shunting, or fenestration of the cyst. With the advancement of neuroendoscopy, the use of purely endoscopic fenestration for arachnoid cysts has gained popularity. This technique, favored for its minimally invasive nature, allows for the precise and comfortable management of these cysts. Technological improvements in neuroendoscopy have facilitated these less invasive approaches, making the procedures more patient-friendly and potentially reducing recovery times.

This study offers the most extensive findings on suprasellar arachnoid cysts. It aims to enhance the literature with insights into minimally invasive interventions and the practical applications of neuroendoscopy in their treatment.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^f8601159]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a recent systematic review of 26 glioependymal cysts, these lesions were mostly identified in intra-axial intraparenchymal and CPA locations, similar to what we found in our study. All surgical glioependymal cysts were operated on for neurological symptoms attributed to mass effect and were commonly found to have clear fluid (although there are descriptions of hemorrhage into the cyst). The neurologic outcomes were almost always an improvement in symptoms. Overall, our findings mirror that of previous case reports of glioependymal cysts, which have likely been limited by attempts at pathologically distinguishing these cysts from arachnoid cysts.

If glioependymal cysts make up a meaningful portion of symptomatic benign-appearing intracranial cysts, then understanding the mechanism of progression and development of mass effect is important. Classically, intracranial cysts have been theorized to progress through a "ball-valve" mechanism, as aquaporin expression has never been identified in arachnoid cysts. Fluid flow into arachnoid cysts was investigated by Tali et al. to determine whether intracranial cyst fluid had communication with surrounding CSF spaces. Through intrathecal contrast administration and MR cisternography, they found that 77% of cysts filled with contrast, suggesting a majority of these cysts had a connection to the CSF pathways of the brain. However, 5 patients in their cohort required surgical intervention; 3 of these cysts had no communication between the cyst lumen and surrounding CSF spaces on MR cisternography. These data bring into consideration an alternative mechanism for cyst formation, wherein non-communicating cysts may represent a unique pathological entity from arachnoid cysts with an alternative mechanism for generating mass effect. If non-communicating cysts harbor the capacity for fluid production, as we describe here in glioependymal cysts, this may explain the association between non-communicating cysts requiring surgical intervention to a greater extent.

### Neoplasms and tumor-like lesions of the sellar region: imaging findings with correlation to pathology and 2021 WHO classification [^1e16880d]. Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cyst

Arachnoid cysts (ACs) represent the most common off-midline extra-axial cysts and are usually located within the subarachnoid spaces, including the suprasellar cistern.

Also known as meningeal cysts, they are CSF filled lesions lined by a layer of flattened arachnoid cells. ACs are sometimes in communication with subarachnoid cisterns.

Most ACs are primary and due to meningeal development anomalies (embryonic endomeninges fail to merge and remain separated). On the other hand, inflammation, tumor, trauma, or hemorrhage may give rise to secondary ACs.

Although ACs are generally asymptomatic, some patients may experience a wide variety of symptoms related to the location and size of the lesion. Nevertheless, the most frequent clinical presentation is headache. Subdural hematoma may represent a rare complication of ACs after minor trauma.

On CT, uncomplicated ACs show CSF density and do not enhance. Intrathecal instillation of contrast agent (CT cisternography) may be helpful in documenting communication with the subarachnoid space. ACs also follow CSF signal on all MRI sequences (Fig. 15). They do not present diffusion restriction nor contrast enhancement. Suprasellar ACs may compress chiasm, pituitary stalk, and/or the third ventricle floor.

Fig. 15

Sagittal (A) and coronal (B) T2-, sagittal (C), and coronal (D) contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images demonstrate the presence of an intrasellar cystic lesion (arrows), displacing the pituitary gland to the left (dotted arrow).

Histological examination show a delicate fibrous tissue forming cyst wall (arachnoid laminar connective tissue) lined by an attenuated meningothelium. Stroma is edematous with lymphocytic infiltrate.

The main differential diagnosis is the epidermoid cyst which however shows higher signal than CSF on FLAIR sequence and diffusion restriction.

Asymptomatic ACs do not require treatment ("leave me alone" lesions). When treatment is required, surgical options include fenestration, endoscopic resection, marsupialization, or cysto-peritoneal shunting with a programmable valve.

### Intracerebral arachnoid cyst treated with ommaya reservoir implantation in a patient younger than two years [^e989c58b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Intracranial arachnoid cysts are rare cystic-appearing intracranial masses. In rarer cases, the arachnoid cysts originate from brain parenchyma, which is defined as intracerebral arachnoid cyst. Here, we present a patient younger than 2 years with massive intracranial arachnoid cysts (one of which was intracerebral arachnoid cyst), whose clinical symptoms included megacephaly and limb weakness. Ommaya reservoir implantation and repeated aspiration of the intracerebral cyst fluid were performed. The symptoms gradually improved, and the intracerebral arachnoid cyst gradually disappeared during 13 months of follow-up. The case highlights the potential of Ommaya reservoir implantation in the treatment of intracerebral arachnoid cyst, especially for young patients. We also reviewed the published literatures concerning the rare condition, including the mechanisms for its pathogenesis and enlargement.

### Arachnoid cyst is a risk factor for chronic subdural hematoma in juveniles: twelve cases of chronic subdural hematoma associated with arachnoid cyst [^ca057c4b]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) tends to occur in elderly patients with a history of mild head injury at a few months prior to the onset of symptoms. Intracranial arachnoid cyst is believed to be congenital and sometimes becomes symptomatic in pediatric patients. These two distinct clinical entities sporadically occur in the same young patient. Twelve of 541 cases of CSDH surgically treated in our institution had associated arachnoid cyst. The clinical and radiological characteristics of the cases of CSDH associated with arachnoid cyst were retrospectively analyzed and compared with those of CSDH without arachnoid cyst. Arachnoid cysts were located in the middle fossa (eight cases), convexity (two cases), and posterior fossa (two cases). Three cysts were less than 20 mm in diameter. The 12 patients with CSDH and arachnoid cyst (mean age 27.8 ± 19.7 years) were significantly younger (p < 0.001) than the patients with CSDH without arachnoid cyst (69.5 ± 13.7 years). Five of the 12 patients were pediatric cases (< 15 years old). The clinical symptoms were also significantly different. The most frequent symptom was headache followed by vomiting in the patients with arachnoid cyst, while gait disturbance and hemiparesis predominated in patients without arachnoid cyst. Hematoma evacuation through burr holes improved the symptoms in all patients with arachnoid cyst. We conclude that even a small arachnoid cyst can be a risk factor for CSDH after mild head injury in young patients and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure are common. Hematoma evacuation is adequate at first operation. If the preoperative symptoms persist, additional arachnoid cyst surgery should be considered. The present results also suggest that CSDH formation may be preceded by subdural hygroma caused by the rupture of arachnoid cyst.

### Familial arachnoid cysts [^b691373d]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are a relatively common incidental finding on neuroimaging studies of the brain. Although most cases are sporadic, there have been some reports of arachnoid cysts in several members of the same family. This report describes two additional families with three members affected in each one. Both families had members with arachnoid cysts in two consecutive generations. In one of the families, arachnoid cysts were associated with a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 16, an association not described previously. These descriptions suggest that in some cases arachnoid cysts may have a genetic basis.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^c9b0e9db]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Need for neuroimaging

The only role for neuroimaging in the diagnosis of headache is to confirm or exclude causes of secondary headache that are suspected on the basis of red flags in the medical history and/or physical examination. Otherwise, neuroimaging is not only rarely necessary in the diagnostic work-up of migraine but can be harmful, as it can involve exposure to ionizing radiation. When needed for investigation of possible secondary headache disorders, MRI is preferred to CT, as it offers a higher resolution and does not involve exposure to ionizing radiation. However, MRI can reveal clinically insignificant abnormalities (for example, white matter lesions, arachnoid cysts and meningiomas), which can alarm the patient and lead to further unnecessary testing.

Recommendations

Take a careful medical history, applying the ICHD-3 criteria.
Use validated diagnostic aids and screening tools, such as headache diaries, the three-item ID-Migraine questionnaire and the five-item Migraine Screen Questionnaire.
Consider differential diagnoses, including other primary headache disorders and secondary headache disorders.
Use neuroimaging only when a secondary headache disorder is suspected.

### Endoscopic management of intracranial cysts [^ec179a8c]. Neurosurgical Focus (2005). Low credibility.

Object

Endoscopic fenestration has been recognized as an accepted treatment choice for patients with symptomatic arachnoid cysts. The success of this procedure, however, is greatly influenced by individual cyst anatomy and location as well as the endoscopic technique used. This review was conducted to assess what variables influence the treatment success for different categories of arachnoid cysts.

Methods

Thirty-three consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic fenestration for treatment of an intracranial arachnoid cyst were identified from a prospective database. The surgical indications and techniques were reviewed, and surgical success rates and patient outcomes were assessed. Specific examples of each cyst category are included to illustrate the technical aspects of endoscopic cyst fenestration. Endoscopic fenestration of arachnoid cysts was successful when judged by cyst decompression, and symptom resolution was noted in 32 (97%) of 33 cases. The one patient with short-term treatment failure underwent a successful repetition of the operation. There were no surgery-related morbidities or deaths.

Conclusions

Arachnoid cysts are a relatively benign pathological entity that can be managed by performing endoscopically guided cyst wall fenestrations into the ventricular system or cerebrospinal fluid-containing cisterns. Proper patient selection, preoperative planning of endoscope trajectory, use of frameless navigation, and advances in endoscope lens technology and light intensity combine to make this a safe procedure with excellent outcomes.

### Clinical and imaging features of spinal extradural arachnoid cysts: a retrospective study of 50 cases [^c6d54ab5]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Spinal extradural arachnoid cysts (SEDACs) are thought to arise from leakage of CSF through a spinal dural defect. This study investigates the demographics and imaging spectrum of SEDACs at our academic institution and compares them with those reported in the literature.

Methods

Fifty cases with documented MRI diagnosis of SEDAC, Nabors criteria type I meningeal cyst (MC), were identified from retrospective review of imaging records between 1999 and 2020. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, cyst characteristics, and management outcomes were studied. Statistical analysis was performed to determine associations between maximum cyst size and presenting symptoms along with other imaging findings.

Results

In all 50 subjects, SEDACs were solitary (single) and sporadic (non-familial). The majority were incidental (62%), located posteriorly (92%) and laterally (80%) in the thoracic and thoracolumbar regions (34%, 30%). They were associated with mild mass effect upon the thecal sac (50%) and bone remodeling (92%). Among symptomatic SEDACs, back pain and radiculopathy were the most reported (68%). Larger cysts were located caudally in the spinal canal, and were associated with greater thecal mass effect, bone remodeling, and septations. Four out of six subjects who underwent surgical management had complete or partial remission. One had cyst recurrence.

Conclusion

In this largest series of SEDACs, most were discovered incidentally, stable over time, and located in the thoracic spine dorsal to the thecal sac. When symptomatic, back pain and radiculopathy were the most common presenting symptoms. Treatment with complete surgical excision may yield the best results for symptomatic lesions.

### Cognition, FDG metabolism, and amyloid accumulation in relation to intracranial arachnoid cysts [^8e3dcefb]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The majority of arachnoid cysts found in a population of cognitively impaired individuals referred for PET scans as part of a dementia evaluation were not symptomatic but seemed to be true incidental findings. FDG metabolism indicated possible affection in the form of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in two patients, while amyloid accumulation adjacent to the cysts was not detected. The largely negative findings suggest that most, but does not prove that all, arachnoid cysts in this population are asymptomatic.

Arachnoid cyst

Arachnoid cysts are the most common congenital intracranial cystic abnormality, occurring in 1% of all intracranial masses. They are intra-arachnoid CSF-filled sacs, which do not communicate with the ventricular system. Arachnoid cysts can be found at any age; however, 75% present in children. Men are more commonly affected than women. The majority of arachnoid cysts are supratentorial. Up to 50% are seen anterior to the temporal lobes in the middle cranial fossa. Approximately 10% are found in the suprasellar cistern and posterior fossa.

On MRI, arachnoid cysts appear as a sharply marginated extra-axial fluid collection, which is similar in signal with CSF on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images (Fig. 17). There is no post-contrast enhancement. The signal of arachnoid cysts is identical to CSF and suppresses completely on FLAIR (Fig. 17) No restricted diffusion is seen with these lesions.

### Intradural spinal arachnoid cyst resection: implications of duraplasty in a large case series [^4006b56c]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Optimal diagnosis and management strategies for intradural spinal arachnoid cysts (SACs) are still unresolved given the rare nature of this entity, with few large case series and virtually no statistical analyses of patient characteristics in the literature. Here, the authors studied a large patient cohort with these lesions to determine whether pre- or postoperative attributes could be used to aid in either diagnosis or prognosis. METHODS A chart review was completed at a single institution for the period from 2002 to 2016 to determine the preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes of 21 patients with exclusively intradural SACs. Patients were assessed for symptoms such as weakness, pain, sensory changes, bowel and/or bladder dysfunction, and gait changes. Postoperatively, patients were analyzed for symptom improvement, complication occurrence, and duration of follow-up. RESULTS Approximately two-thirds of the patients in this series had developed SACs idiopathically, and the mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 15 months among all patients. A slight majority (57%) underwent CT myelography in the course of diagnosis, and a quarter of the patients had a syrinx. There was a statistically significant association between location of the SAC and number of presenting signs and symptoms; that is, patients with cysts in the lumbosacral region had more symptoms than those with cysts at the cervical or thoracic levels (p = 0.031). Overall, outcomes were largely positive, with approximately 60%-70% of patients experiencing postoperative improvement in symptoms, with motor weakness showing the highest response rate (71%) and pain symptoms the least likely to subside (50%). In the cohort with preoperative pain, those who had undergone expansile duraplasty were significantly more likely to experience relief of their pain symptoms (p = 0.028), which may have been a result of the superior restoration of cerebrospinal fluid pathways allowing for more adequate reduction in compression. CONCLUSIONS In this large case series on intradural SACs, new light has been shed on aspects of both pre- and postoperative care for patients with these rare lesions. Specifically, the authors revealed that lumbosacral intradural SACs may be associated with a higher disease burden and that patients who undergo expansile duraplasty may have an increased likelihood of experiencing postoperative pain relief.

### Arachnoid cysts in children… [^72b26473]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Twenty-seven cases of intracranial arachnoid cysts in children aged 1 to 16 years have been studied with attention to diagnosis, pathologic findings, and surgical treatment. In nine patients, the cyst was located in the posterior fossa. In eight patients, there were other CNS or other organ system abnormalities. No specific symptom complex can be ascribed to arachnoid cysts in that the clinical manifestations are the result of their size and location, secondary complications, and remote effects. This is illustrated in the ten cases reported. Menezes AH, Bell WE, Perret GE. Arachnoid Cysts in Children. Arch Neurol. 1980; 37: 168–172.

### Dis (appearance) of an arachnoid cyst: a follow-up imaging perspective… [^60786dbc]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid –filled sacs that are responsible for 1% of all intracranial lesions. Although the etiology remains unknown, expert consensus suggests that ACs are developmental anomalies/congenital malformations. Patients with a diagnosis of AC are typically asymptomatic, even if the cyst increases in size. There is no consensus about the ideal age to repeat imaging and how long to radiographically monitor asymptomatic children who have an AC. This article aims to complement the case previously published by Leite et al about an infant with a postnatal diagnosis of an AC. This follow-up report describes the disappearance of the AC after 3 years. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an infant with imaging evidence of the appearance and spontaneous disappearance of an AC. This suggests that ACs may not always be evident at.

RESULTS

Clinical characteristics of patients with surgical intracranial cysts

A total of 16 adult patients with intracranial cysts were operated on at our institution between 2014 and 2024 (Figure 1A, Table 1). Ages ranged from 26–78 years old (mean 55.0). Nine patients were women (56.3%) and seven patients were men (43.7%). Cyst locations included: 5 suprasellar (31.3%), 5 supratentorial intraparenchymal (31.3%), 3 pineal (18.8%), 2 cerebellopontine angle (CPA) (12.5%), and 1 infratentorial intraparenchymal (6.3%). All patients presented with mass effect leading to compression of adjacent brain, cranial nerves, or obstructive hydrocephalus. Primary pre-operative neurological symptoms included: 6 patients with focal cranial nerve dysfunction (37.5%), 5 with headache (31.2%), 2 with seizure (12.5%), 1 with motor deficits (6.3%), 1 with cognitive changes (6.3%), and 1 with memory changes (6.3%). The mean maximal diameter of cysts was 3.9 cm (range 1.8–7.2 cm). All cases were treated with maximal safe cyst resection followed by fenestration to adjacent CSF spaces. All patients had improvement of neurologic symptoms postoperatively. One patient (6.3%) continued to experience seizures postoperatively, while the remaining 15 patients had complete symptom resolution (93.7%).

### Arachnoid cyst: middle ear mass diagnosis to consider… [^a2fa1f44]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The differential diagnosis of middle ear masses includes a wide array of typically benign diseases, with cholesteatoma as the leading entity. Other lesions frequently considered include glomus tumors, schwannomas, choristomas, and other vascular variants. Arachnoid cysts, despite being present in 4% of the population, are seldom considered.

1. Arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid filled spaces that usually form within the arachnoid membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. Most commonly, arachnoid cysts present in the middle cranial fossa. 1 Their presentation in the middle ear space has been described as typically due to erosion through the tegmen tympani. We present the case of a patient with a middle ear mass that ultimately was found to be an arachnoid cyst isolated to the tympanic segment of the fallopian canal.

We use this previously undescribed presentation to discuss the clinical and radiologic characteristics of this entity, as well as its treatment. Institutional review board approval was not required for this report. Clary MS, Walker R, Nicholas BD, Goodman JF, Kori G, Artz GJ. Arachnoid Cyst: Middle Ear Mass Diagnosis to Consider.

### Hydrocephalus in children with middle fossa arachnoid cysts [^ce75c7c8]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

The optimal management of children with middle fossa arachnoid cysts (MFACs) remains controversial. In this study the authors evaluated the relationship between two preoperative variables, hydrocephalus and nonspecific macrocephaly, in children undergoing fenestration of temporal arachnoid cysts and hydrocephalus-related shunt placement.

Methods

During a 16-year period, 40 children (30 boys and 10 girls) underwent treatment of MFACs. All but one patient experienced either worsening symptoms or progressive serial imaging-documented cyst enlargement. Hydrocephalus was present in six patients and nonspecific macrocephaly in another nine. The mean age at surgery was 66 months (range 1–201 months, median 36 months), and the mean follow-up duration was 54 months (range 6–83 months, median 39 months). All patients presenting with hydrocephalus required placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt as well as cyst fenestration, regardless of which procedure was performed first. Five patients with macroencephaly undergoing initial fenestration required subsequent VP shunt insertion. Complications of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion were typical.

Conclusions

Patients with hydrocephalus or macrocephaly are likely to require VP shunt placement in addition to cyst fenestration. Children with nonspecific macrocephaly may harbor a latent derangement of CSF circulation.

### A differential diagnosis in postural headache: herniation of a giant posterior fossa arachnoid cyst [^d3763b02]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The causes of postural headache are usually associated with low intracranial pressure. However, there are still rare causes of posture-related headaches that are not associated with low intracraninal pressure and caused by pathologic processes. Herein, we report a patient with giant posterior fossaarachnoid cyst herniating below the level of foramen magnum presenting with postural headache, which has not been described previously in the literature. Emergency physicians should be aware that posterior fossa arachnoid cysts should be considered one of the differential diagnoses in patients with postural headache.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^5800f162]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In some cases, benign-appearing intracranial cysts may become symptomatic through mass effect of cranial nerves or functional parenchymal tissue. Despite this documented association, the mechanism by which intracranial cysts generate mass effect is unclear. Benign cysts that follow CSF signal intensity on MR imaging have classically been categorized as arachnoid cysts; however, it has become clear that there are multiple possible etiologies for benign intracranial cysts. In this study, we highlight glioependymal cysts, also called neuroglial cysts, which are pathologically identified by a simple cuboidal inner wall of EMA-negative ependymal cells, as well as a surrounding layer of GFAP-positive glial cells. These immunofluorescence characteristics align with previous studies, which report that glioependymal cysts are EMA-negative and GFAP-positive, whereas arachnoid cysts are EMA-positive and GFAP-negative.

### Recovery of sensorineural hearing loss following operative management of a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst. case report [^e637f10a]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cysts are benign, intraarachnoid cysts filled with cerebrospinal fluid that are usually encountered in the middle cranial fossa. If present in the posterior fossa, they usually produce nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and vertigo. We report the rare presentation of a young girl with right-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus secondary to a right cerebellopontomedullary arachnoid cyst. The patient underwent a suboccipital retrosigmoid (retromastoid) craniectomy with fenestration of the arachnoid cyst. Subsequently, the patient experienced improvement in hearing with near-complete resolution of sensorineural hearing loss. To the authors' knowledge, postoperative near-complete resolution of hearing loss secondary to posterior fossa arachnoid cysts in a pediatric patient has not been previously reported. The authors also review the literature with respect to posterior fossa arachnoid cysts and discuss their clinical features, diagnosis, and management.

### Clinicopathology conference: 41-year-old woman with chronic relapsing meningitis [^fbf14e33]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion of Pathology and Diagnosis

NCC is caused by infection with T. solium, the pork tapeworm. The condition leads to single or multiple intraparenchymal, ventricular, and subarachnoid cysts. NCC is endemic to Central America, South America, Sub‐Saharan Africa, and Asia. 58 The hallmark of parenchymal NCC is the formation of a vesicular cyst that degenerates from a viable to a calcified form. During the viable stage, the parasite is thought to evade host defenses, and there is minimal to no immune response. 59 Cyst degeneration occurs when the immune system detects the parasite. The pathogen can no longer evade the immune system, and a robust granulomatous inflammatory response occurs, which can lead to significant neurological morbidity. 60, 61 The final, calcified stage contains a dead parasite and creates minimal inflammatory response. 58, 62 In subarachnoid NCC, the parasite can lack typical cystic structures, making it more challenging to identify on imaging. Subarachnoid NCC can also cause pronounced inflammation, which can be difficult to control and treat. 63, 64 Spinal NCC is a rarer manifestation of NCC, with extramedullary arachnoid disease constituting the majority of cases. 26 Intracranial disease is also evident in most cases, but our patient only had subtle leptomeningeal enhancement on brain MRI and no intraparenchymal or intraventricular lesions. 26 In retrospect, the cyst seen on the patient's lumbar spine MRI in 2015, and the enhancing intradural extramedullary lumbar nodule seen in 2017, likely represented degenerating cysts, although even after the diagnosis was made there was debate among neuroradiologists about whether the findings on MRI in 2015 represented a Taenia cyst versus arachnoid scarring. At the time, these were not identified as parasitic, given the lack of more typical brain cysts, as well as the larger clinical context of recurrent fever and constitutional symptoms, which are unusual features of NCC. 65, 66 Nevertheless, NCC should be considered in any patient with chronic meningitis who has spent time in an endemic area, even without typical MRI findings.

### Suprasellar arachnoid cyst resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^70070ac5]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is occasionally seen after hypothalamic injury or dysfunction, although it typically occurs in association with other endocrine disturbances. It is has never been described as a presenting feature of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst (SAC) in the pediatric population. The authors describe the case of an enlarging SAC resulting in SIADH as the only presenting feature, with an otherwise normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis. An SAC was diagnosed in utero in this 5-month-old girl who had a normal functioning hypothalamic-pituitary axis on presentation. Because of cyst enlargement and hydrocephalus, the patient was scheduled for surgery; however, preoperative labs revealed SIADH. After stabilizing the serum sodium concentration with fluid restriction and the administration of 3% sodium chloride, the patient underwent endoscopic cyst fenestration. Postoperatively, she had complete resolution of the SIADH. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as the presenting symptom of an SAC has not been previously described. In the aforementioned patient, the proposed mechanism for SIADH was enlargement of the suprasellar arachnoid cyst causing compression of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and thus overstimulating the secretion of arginine vasopressin, which resulted in SIADH. The association of SIADH with an SAC is reportable, as is the resolution of the SIADH via cyst fenestration. The authors suggest that SIADH is an uncommon presenting feature of SACs and that syndrome resolution is possible with cyst decompression.

### ACR-ASNR-SABI-SSR practice parameter for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the adult spine [^ac4277e0]. ACR/ASNR/SABI/SSR (2023). High credibility.

Spinal cord herniation — Spinal cord herniation is a rare but important cause of myelopathy, and if addressed in a timely fashion by surgery, symptoms are reversible. MRI helps demonstrate the location of the cord herniation through an associated dural defect, assess the degree of herniation, and determine if there are any cord signal changes, but the MRI appearance may not be pathognomonic because it may be difficult to distinguish from an arachnoid web or arachnoid cyst. CT myelography can play a complementary role in suspected spinal cord herniation to differentiate it from a thoracic web or arachnoid cyst, and a dorsal thoracic arachnoid web has a characteristic "scalpel" appearance that can be diagnosed on MRI or CT myelography.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a systemic disorder well-known for its association with intracranial aneurysms. Recently, intracranial arachnoid cysts have also been reported to be associated with ADPKD. We describe a father and daughter who each has a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst and asymptomatic ADPKD. To our knowledge, this is the first report of familial occurrence of arachnoid cysts in association with ADPKD.

### Spontaneous and asymptomatic rupture of an RCC with resolution of symptoms [^4276fe41]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The presenting symptoms of our patient were rather non-specific, with the bitemporal hemianopsia and subsequent endocrine features suggesting a lesion within the sella; however, imaging revealed a cyst with slight expansion into the suprasellar area. Given its enhancement, it was thought to be an RCC, arachnoid cyst or craniopharyngioma. Of note, the cyst on radiographic imaging did not have a fluid-fluid level, it was not off-midline and septations were absent. The lack of these characteristics, most seen in cystic macroadenomas, helped guide diagnosis towards RCC or craniopharyngioma.

RCCs and craniopharyngiomas develop from remnants of Rathke's pouch, a structure that ultimately contributes to the anterior pituitary gland. The difference between them lies in the fact that craniopharyngiomas contain solid components in addition to fluid, while RCCs only contain fluid. In either case, the remnants of Rathke's pouch give rise to a lesion which accumulates CSF over time and could present with symptoms given placement and compression of adjacent structures. Given the similarity in location, symptomatology of RCCs and craniopharyngiomas is virtually identical to that of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst (SAC). Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate clinical presentations of SACs versus RCCs/craniopharyngiomas. We experienced similar difficulty with our patient's suprasellar cyst, ultimately relying on imaging findings to help guide us, as RCCs are known to have a well-defined, homogeneous appearance on imaging. We believed the mass was an RCC based on the cystic, midline and homogenous appearance of it noted on MRI. Additionally, the appearance of a cyst without evidence of a mass leads us to prioritise the diagnosis of RCC over that of craniopharyngioma, which would reflect mass components. At 4-year follow-up, the infundibular stalk was now observed to be in the typical midline position, with a small, well-circumscribed isodense non-enhancing lesion significant for RCC residual capsule also noted on imaging.

### Anaplastic meningioma arising from a radiologically diagnosed arachnoid cyst: case report [^f69b0079]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

We report the first example of an anaplastic meningioma arising from an intracranial arachnoid cyst and discuss the diagnostic challenges of this case, including the useful role of genetic markers.

Clinical Presentation

A 72-year-old man presented with transient episodes of expressive dysphasia and focal motor seizures, superimposed on a 6-month history of worsening headaches and dizziness. His past history was significant for a previously drained left-sided chronic subdural hematoma and a radiologically diagnosed left middle fossa arachnoid cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging on admission showed variable wall thickening of the arachnoid cyst with mild mass effect on the left frontotemporal lobes.

Intervention

The patient underwent decompression of the arachnoid cyst and biopsy of the cyst wall. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies of the thickened portion initially suggested a metastatic carcinosarcoma, but fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic meningioma based on characteristic chromosomal deletions. The patient returned 2 months later with progressive disease, leading to his death 6 weeks later despite repeat surgery for tumor debulking.

Conclusion

Malignant transformation of meningothelial elements in arachnoid cysts is an exceptionally rare complication that poses considerable diagnostic challenges. Genetic markers may be particularly helpful in such cases.

### When is the radiology report of posterior fossa containing cyst / cystic-like CSF collection of clinical or surgical significance? [^529ef9ef]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The nomenclature characterizing posterior fossa (PF) extraventricular (EV) CSF collections in radiological reports can be quite variable, leading to uncertainty about the subsequent clinical course that may result in multiple follow-up imaging studies that may not be needed and occasionally to operative intervention that is not warranted. The important factor is the mass effect of the PF EV CSF collection on adjacent structures, the presence of hydrocephalus, and the likelihood of the CSF collection increasing in size over time.

Methods

The authors respectively reviewed the imaging database at Children's Hospital Los Angeles to identify all radiological reports from 2000 to 2015 indicating the presence of an EV CSF collection in the PF that was characterized as containing an arachnoid cyst, being cystic, or being an abnormal CSF collection.

Results

Of the 332 reports in 65 patients, the PF EV CSF collection was described as an arachnoid cyst or cystic in 306 with 20 different terms being used. In those patients who underwent multiple imaging studies, the PF EV CSF collection was often described differently in each report. Of this group, 47 (72%) patients did not undergo PF surgery. Eighteen (28%) patients did undergo PF surgery, of whom 14 had both hydrocephalus and brainstem displacement, 2 had brainstem displacement but no hydrocephalus, and 2 had neither brainstem displacement nor hydrocephalus and in retrospect did not benefit from PF surgery.

Conclusions

The terminology in radiology reports describing EV PF CSF collections is variable, is inconsistent, and does not correlate well with clinical management or the need for PF surgery. Significant brainstem displacement and hydrocephalus in the presence of EV PF CSF collection is highly correlated with the need for PF surgery. The incidence of a PF EV CSF collection increasing to become symptomatic becomes more remote the older the patient is at the time of diagnosis as compared with those that occur mainly in infancy. There are true EV CSF cysts in the PF, but the ones that are of consequence are those that exert pressure on the brainstem, obstruct CSF flow, or both. Calling any increased amount of CSF in the PF a "cyst" or "cystic" can cause uncertainty, leading to one or more subsequent imaging studies or, in rare cases, unwarranted operative intervention.

### Cognition, FDG metabolism, and amyloid accumulation in relation to intracranial arachnoid cysts [^87105e3c]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the present study, FDG-PET images revealed decreased cerebellar FDG uptake lateralized to the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the cyst in two (10%) patients (patient E and H). The decreased cerebellar FDG uptake could be interpreted as reflecting diaschisis resulting from the cyst's effect on nearby supratentorial brain parenchyma as no other explanation was obvious in these patients. This could indicate that arachnoid cysts can affect brain metabolism; however, further investigation is warranted. The observation generates an interesting hypothesis for prospective studies of diaschisis and arachnoid cysts.

We did not find support for accumulation of amyloid adjacent to the cyst as a sign of impaired interstitial clearance in any of the seven patients with PiB-PET. It is, thus, unlikely that arachnoid cysts in general affect clearance of metabolites such as amyloid from the interstitial compartment.

Strengths and limitations

A strength of the study is that it reflects a population with a well-defined indication for scanning and well-evaluated cognitive symptoms whereby detection bias was well-controlled. It has high external validity for cognitively impaired, elderly populations. However, the serious comorbidity of the present cohort does leave open the question of the significance of arachnoid cysts in a younger, healthier population as patients under evaluation of dementia already have focal or global cognitive deficits which could mask eventual symptoms related to a cyst. Notably, patients with dementia often have symptoms related to the temporal lobe where arachnoid cysts are found most frequently. Interpretation of cognitive deficits in our population was difficult and subtle cyst-related cognitive effects might be better identified in a healthier population. In addition, the small sample size caused a general lack of power with an associated risk of type 2 errors. We could not apply any statistical tests to evaluate the association between the location of the cysts and the findings on neuropsychological test. The small numbers also affected the assessment of the effect of surgery. Finally, neither patients nor the interviewers performing the tests had been blinded to presence of cysts. The data were obtained during regular evaluation for dementia which may have induced biases. However, knowledge of a potentially symptomatic cyst would primarily be biased towards positive findings, which was contrary to our findings.

### Long-term outcome of large sylvian arachnoid cysts: the role of surgery has been exaggerated [^f01b3cc2]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The surgical indications for some arachnoid cysts (ACs) are controversial. While surgical procedures can be effective when an AC is a definite cause of hydrocephalus or papilledema, most ACs do not cause any symptoms or signs. Some surgeons perform several procedures to treat ACs because of their large size. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of Galassi type III ACs between surgery and nonsurgery groups.

Methods

The medical records of 60 patients diagnosed with sylvian ACs (Galassi type III) who visited Seoul National University Children's Hospital from July 1990 to March 2018 were analyzed. The authors compared the outcomes between those treated with surgery and those not treated with surgery.

Results

Of the 60 patients, 27 patients had no symptoms, 19 patients had vague symptoms and signs associated with ACs, and the remaining 14 patients had definite AC-related symptoms and signs. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgery, and 22 patients underwent observation. Some operations were accompanied by complications. Among the 33 patients in the surgery group, excluding 5 with hydrocephalus or papilledema, 8 patients needed 18 additional operations. However, there were no patients in the nonsurgery group who needed surgical intervention during the follow-up period (mean 67.5 months), although the size of the AC increased in 2 patients. Changes in AC size were not correlated with symptom relief.

Conclusions

When patients with hydrocephalus or papilledema were excluded, there was no difference in the outcomes between the surgery and nonsurgery groups regardless of the size of the sylvian AC. Surgeons should be cautious when deciding whether to operate.

### A new classification for pathologies of spinal meninges-part 2: primary and secondary intradural arachnoid cysts [^cd803e05]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spinal intradural arachnoid cysts are rare causes of radiculopathy or myelopathy. Treatment options include resection, fenestration, or cyst drainage.

Objective

To classify intradural spinal arachnoid cysts and present results of their treatment.

Methods

Among 1519 patients with spinal space occupying lesions, 130 patients demonstrated intradural arachnoid cysts. Neuroradiological and surgical features were reviewed and clinical data analyzed.

Results

Twenty-one patients presented arachnoid cysts as a result of an inflammatory leptomeningeal reaction related to meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intrathecal injections, intradural surgery, or trauma, ie, secondary cysts. For the remaining 109 patients, no such history could be elucidated, ie, primary cysts. Forty-six percent of primary and 86% of secondary cysts were associated with syringomyelia. Patients presented after an average history of 53 ± 88 months. There were 122 thoracic and 7 lumbar cysts plus 1 cervical cyst. Fifty-nine patients with primary and 15 patients with secondary cysts underwent laminotomies with complete or partial cyst resection and duraplasty. Mean follow-up was 57 ± 52 months. In the first postoperative year, profound improvements for primary cysts were noted, in contrast to marginal changes for secondary cysts. Progression-free survival for 10 years following surgery was determined as 83% for primary compared to 15% for secondary cysts. Despite differences in clinical presentation, progression-free survival was almost identical for patients with or without syringomyelia.

Conclusions

Complete or partial resection leads to favorable short- and long-term results for primary arachnoid cysts. For secondary cysts, surgery can only provide clinical stabilization for a limited time due to the often extensive arachnoiditis.

### A population-based study of intracranial arachnoid cysts: clinical and neuroimaging outcomes following surgical cyst decompression in children [^64622ddc]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

If, when, and how children with arachnoid cysts should undergo surgery has been a matter of debate. In the present study the authors describe long-term clinical and neuroimaging results in children with intracranial arachnoid cysts, treated in accordance with the authors' policy of performing surgery in most of these cases.

Methods

The study included 48 pediatric patients (age < 16 years of age) who underwent surgery for treatment of an arachnoid cyst at Haukeland University Hospital between January 1987 and September 2004. Forty-one patients underwent cyst fenestration to the basal cisterns and posterior fossa. Long-term results were assessed retrospectively on the basis of medical and neuroimaging records. Additional information was obtained by means of a check-box questionnaire completed by the patients and their parents. At their follow-up examinations, 82% of the patients had no or insignificant complaints, 14% reported no improvement, and 4% noted a worsening of symptoms. In 56% of the patients with appropriate imaging for analysis, the cyst was no longer visible on neuroimaging studies. In 23%, the postoperative fluid volume was reduced to less than 50% of the original cyst volume, and in another 19%, the volume was reduced but was larger than 50% of the original. The cyst was unchanged in only 2%. There was a significant association between a volume reduction greater than 50% and clinical improvement. Three patients (6%), all with temporal cysts, had minor complications that led to additional surgery in one patient. No complications caused permanent disability. Eight patients (17%) underwent additional surgery due to suspected or demonstrated treatment failure.

Conclusions

Most children who underwent cyst fenestration via a craniotomy experienced a good long-term outcome with no severe complications.

### Intracranial arachnoid cyst rupture after mild TBI in children: have we underestimated this risk? [^671c28fc]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Case presentation

An 8-year-old boy complained of a weekly recurring left frontotemporal headache, occurring in the morning since the age of 8, with an intensity of five on the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and a sensation of tightening. The pain was responsive to common analgesics, and no triggering factors were detected. The patient had normal cognitive development for his age. A left temporal Galassi type II arachnoid cyst (figure 1) was diagnosed, and elective endoscopic surgery was planned; MRI of the brain was performed for surgical planning.

The patient suffered a mild TBI during a football match due to a head collision, without loss of consciousness or other signs of severity during the acute trauma phase. The headache intensified (VAS = 8) 30 days after the event, becoming continuous and refractory to analgesia and associated with vomiting and double vision.

On neurological examination, the patient had Glasgow score of 15, with no pupillary, language or motor changes but with left lateral rectus muscle paresis. MRI of the brain revealed a haemorrhage in the Galassi type III left temporal arachnoid cyst and an ipsilateral subdural haematoma (figure 2).

### Ruptured temporal lobe arachnoid cyst presenting with severe back pain [^40ab2973]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Arachnoid cyst is a common congenital anomaly in the pediatric population. The cysts are often asymptomatic, but they can cause headache and other symptoms. Occasionally a cyst may rupture after head trauma producing a subdural hematoma. The authors present the case of an 11-year-old boy who presented after a week of progressive and severe back pain radiating to the back of his thighs. Imaging revealed a spinal subdural blood collection at the L4-S1 level. This finding prompted further cephalad imaging of the spine and the brain, which revealed a sylvian fissure arachnoid cyst with intracystic hemorrhage and frontoparietal subdural hematoma. The child did not have headache at this time, although he had experienced chronic headaches since the age of 4 years. He was treated with a course of oral steroids, which immediately relieved his back and leg pain. Subsequent imaging showed resolution of the cranial and spinal subdural blood collections and diminished size of the arachnoid cyst. No surgical treatment was necessary.

### Cerebellopontine angle arachnoid cyst: a case of hemifacial spasm caused by an organic lesion other than neurovascular compression: case report [^cf2b19d7]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

A rare case of cerebellopontine angle arachnoid cyst manifesting as hemifacial spasm (HFS) is reported. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with 10-month history of left HFS. A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a well-demarcated area, hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, in the left cerebellopontine angle, without contrast enhancement, resembling an arachnoid cyst.

Methods

The cyst was excised with microneurosurgical technique and the facial, vestibular, and acoustic nerves were completely decompressed from the arachnoid wall.

Results

The postoperative course was uneventful, and the left HFS disappeared immediately. Histologically, the cyst wall was a typical arachnoidal membrane. Ten months after surgery, the patient is symptom free.

Conclusion

It is well-known that in approximately 10% of cases, trigeminal neuralgia can be caused by a space-occupying mass. However, the fact that HFS can also be caused by organic lesions as well as neurovascular compression is less well-known. Although the occurrence of tumor compression causing HFS has been previously recognized, cerebellopontine angle cysts have very rarely been described. The observation of a patient with a cerebellopontine angle arachnoid cyst causing HFS prompted us to review the literature relative to HFS caused by an organic lesion rather than neurovascular compression.

### Incidental findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e52a4b0d]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Some have suggested a subdivision of incidental brain findings by the perceived need and urgency of referral to a specialist. But the urgency of referral is difficult to gauge given the paucity of robust evidence about whether and how best to treat any of the asymptomatic incidental findings reported. The clinical urgency will vary according to the age and healthiness of the patient, and the perceived urgency may change over time as knowledge about the effects of treatment changes. This may explain why studies have varied — for example, some have classified arachnoid cysts as not requiring referral, w7 whereas others have referred people with these cysts for urgent clinical assessment. w4 A preferable pragmatic approach is to manage imaging results with a degree of urgency on the basis of the likely overall benefit to the study participant.

Apart from the harm that may arise from the lack of evidence on which to base the management of incidental brain findings, the detection of such findings can provoke considerable anxiety about a "possible abnormality" (which might be a false positive result) w13; involve a costly cascade of further investigations, with risks of complications (in the case of catheter angiography or brain biopsy); lead to costly medical opinions; and worry patients about the consequences of an untreated finding. For the patient, the discovery of an incidental brain finding may result in loss of their driving licence, life insurance, and even employment.

### Long-term endocrine outcome of suprasellar arachnoid cysts [^57b02964]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Due to their distinct location, suprasellar arachnoid cysts are known to cause a wide variety of problems, such as hydrocephalus, endocrine symptoms, and visual abnormalities. The long-term outcome of these cysts has not been elucidated. To find out the long-term outcome of suprasellar arachnoid cysts, a retrospective review of the patients was performed. The neurological and endocrine symptoms were thoroughly reviewed. METHODS Forty-five patients with suprasellar arachnoid cysts, with an average follow-up duration of 9.7 years, were enrolled in the study. A comprehensive review was performed of the results of follow-up regarding not only neurological symptoms but also endocrine status. The outcomes of 8 patients who did not undergo operations and were asymptomatic or had symptoms unrelated to the cyst were included in the series. RESULTS Surgery was most effective for the symptoms related to hydrocephalus (improvement in 32 of 32), but endocrine symptoms persisted after surgery (4 of 4) and required further medical management. More surprisingly, a fairly large number of patients (14 of 40; 1 was excluded because no pre- or postoperative endocrine evaluation was available) who had not shown endocrine symptoms at the time of the initial diagnosis and treatment later developed endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and growth hormone deficiency. The patients with endocrine symptoms detected during the follow-up included those in both the operated (n = 12 of 32) and nonoperated (n = 2 of 8) groups who had been stable during follow-up since the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS This study implies that patients with suprasellar arachnoid cysts can develop late endocrine problems during follow-up, even if other symptoms related to the cyst have been successfully treated. Hence, patients with these cysts need long-term follow-up for not only neurological symptoms but also endocrine abnormalities.

### Atypical presentation of arachnoid web causing paraparesis with absence of sensory symptoms [^59369da7]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

During this time, the patient reported only mild urinary changes, more likely attributed to his TURP procedure than as a part of cauda equina syndrome. Due to his shuffling gait, he received an initial diagnosis of Parkinson's disease from his neurologist. When the levodopa/carbidopa (Sinemet) he was prescribed produced equivocal results, he was then referred to a neuromuscular neurologist at an academic centre due to concern for possible amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is typically a painless, progressive neuromuscular disorder with weakness that eventually involves all the muscles of the cervical, lumbosacral and bulbar regions with accompanying unintentional weight loss. The progression of ALS is unrelenting, and it would be unusual for it to remain confined to a single region of the body after 1.5 years. Electromyography testing demonstrated acute and chronic denervation changes in L3–S1 myotomes, although these findings were relatively mild and out of proportion to the severity of his clinical picture.

After several visits to the neuromuscular clinic, the patient's disability had not progressed — an unusual scenario for ALS. In particular, he never displayed or developed any fasciculations or progressive muscle atrophy. This observation and atypical features, including severe back spasms, pain and mild urinary disturbances, prompted further work-up. Repeat spinal imaging, including a CT myelogram and a non-contrasted MRI of the thoracic spine, was ordered. When the imaging demonstrated a possible arachnoid cyst in the midthoracic spine (T7), which could potentially account for the patient's presentation, the patient was then referred for neurosurgical evaluation. Arachnoid cysts, such as webs, are intradural and extramedullary lesions of the spinal meninges. Cysts are readily identifiable on MRI as distinct hyperintense pockets within the meninges of the spinal cord, as compared with the more subtle indentation into the spinal cord of the scalpel sign.

### Shunt placement after cyst fenestration for middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts in children [^4a531b7a]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECT Some pediatric patients with middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and require shunt placement after a cyst fenestration. However, factors concerning increased ICP after fenestration followed by shunt placement have not been elucidated. This study evaluated factors that are associated with shunt placement following cyst fenestration in pediatric patients with middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts. METHODS Twenty-six pediatric patients with middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts who were surgically treated at a single institution between 2004 and 2013 were retrospectively identified. The surgical indications for middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts were as follows: 1) arachnoid cysts associated with symptoms such as headache and abnormally enlarging head circumference; 2) progressively expanding arachnoid cysts; and 3) large arachnoid cysts such as Galassi Type III. A cyst fenestration was performed as a first-line treatment, and shunt placement was required if symptoms associated with increased ICP were found following fenestration. The risk factors evaluated included age, sex, presenting symptoms, the presence of head enlargement, progressive cyst expansion, and subdural hematoma/hygroma. RESULTS Four patients (15.4%) required shunt placement after cyst fenestration. Younger age, abnormal head enlargement, and progressive cyst expansion before fenestration were significantly associated with the need for shunt placement following fenestration. Arachnoid cysts decreased in size in 22 patients (84.6%) after fenestration and/or shunt placement. The presence of symptoms was not associated with postoperative cyst size in this study. CONCLUSIONS In this study, younger age, abnormal head enlargement, and progressive cyst expansion were risk factors for shunt placement after cyst fenestration in pediatric patients with middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts. It is important to consider that cyst fenestration may not be effective because of a latent derangement of CSF circulation in patients with these risk factors.

### Craniocervical arachnoid cyst in a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome: a unique case: case report [^5fbf26e6]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Klippel-Feil syndrome, or brevicollis, is a complex congenital disorder caused by the improper segmentation of the cervical vertebrae. The authors present the very rare case of a patient with Klippel-Feil syndrome who presented with an intradural arachnoid cyst at the craniocervical junction. They also examine possible factors contributing to this association. A 46-year-old woman presented with complaints of progressively worsening headaches and dizziness of 18 months' duration. She also demonstrated mild bilateral upper-extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed fused cervical vertebrae and a dorsal intradural arachnoid cyst at the craniocervical junction, extending down to the fourth cervical level. Because of worsening myelopathy and the presence of brainstem compression, the patient underwent surgical excision of the arachnoid cyst, which was approached via a midline posterior suboccipital/upper cervical route. An endoscope was introduced through a gap between the occiput and fused upper cervical vertebrae, and the arachnoid cyst was widely fenestrated. Postoperatively, the patient has remained symptom free for more than 2 years with evidence of good radiological decompression. The authors report a unique association between craniocervical arachnoid cyst and Klippel-Feil syndrome. To their knowledge, no other cases of this association have been reported in the literature. Arachnoid cysts should be part of the differential diagnosis in the presence of worsening myelopathic symptoms or pain in patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome.

### Molecular characterization of benign intracranial glioependymal and arachnoid cysts suggest heterogeneous mechanisms of action [^38a829f2]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Benign-appearing intracranial cysts may become symptomatic due to mass effect and require surgical treatment. Mechanisms underlying cyst formation and growth remain poorly understood. This study identified 16 patients who underwent surgical treatment for benign intracranial cysts. Cyst wall pathologic samples (n = 8) were characterized as arachnoid or glioependymal cysts using H&E and immunofluorescence staining. Five samples (62.5%) were found to be glioependymal while three (37.5%) were arachnoid cysts. Cyst fluid examined in 4 cases resembled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and showed no significant differences in composition between pathological subtypes. Single-cell sequencing and RNA expression profile comparisons between glioependymal and arachnoid cysts revealed distinct cellular profiles. Analyses of the innermost cell layer (ependymal cells versus arachnoid cells) suggested differing mechanisms of pathogenesis. Glioependymal cysts harbored upregulated expression of sodium transporters and aquaporin channels, which suggests possible CSF-like fluid production whereas arachnoid cysts may be associated with mechanical fluid accumulation. Thus, intracranial cysts represent multiple unique pathologic entities with differing cell types and RNA expression profiles. Further study into mechanisms of glioependymal cyst formation may allow for targeted interventions to reduce fluid production and avoid surgery.

### Intracranial arachnoid cyst rupture after mild TBI in children: have we underestimated this risk? [^6aea7bc7]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The reported case demonstrated that mild TBI is a determinant for arachnoid cyst rupture. A case control study found that trauma occurring within 30 days may increase the risk of rupture of arachnoid cysts by up to 26.5-fold. A cyst size greater than 50 mm was also considered a risk factor for this event.

Concerning the estimation of this risk in children, it should be considered that natural recreational activity constitutes a permanent risk for the rupture of these cysts. This factor should be considered during surgical decision making for oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

After cyst rupture and haemorrhage, endoscopic surgery becomes technically difficult due to poor visibility and orientation within the cyst and poor visibility through the membranes, preventing safe fenestration.

Therefore, microsurgery with cyst fenestration to the interpeduncular and optic chiasmatic cisterns should be chosen.

Learning points

Arachnoid cyst may bleed.
Bleeding should be a severe complication.
Children are more susceptible to bleed due to major incidence of mild head trauma.
The haemorrhage treatment is aways by open surgery.

### Endoscopic fenestration of a cerebellopontine angle arachnoid cyst resulting in complete recovery from sensorineural hearing loss and facial nerve palsy [^3549310a]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Cerebellopontine angle arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic, but are frequently found incidentally because of increased use of neuroimaging. Nevertheless, as these cysts enlarge, they may compress surrounding structures and cause neurological symptoms. Patients may present with vague, nonspecific symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. Cranial nerve palsies, including sensorineural hearing loss and facial weakness, although rare, have also been reported in association with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts. Although surgery for these entities is controversial, arachnoid cysts can be treated surgically with open craniotomy for cyst removal, fenestration into adjacent arachnoid spaces, shunting of cyst contents, or endoscopic fenestration. Reversal of sensorineural hearing loss following open craniotomy treatment has been described in the literature in only 1 adult and 1 pediatric case. Improvement in facial weakness has also been reported after open craniotomy and arachnoid cyst fenestration. The authors report the first case of complete recovery from sensorineural hearing loss and facial weakness following endoscopic fenestration in a patient with a cerebellopontine angle arachnoid cyst.

### Optic nerve edema in pediatric middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts: report of 51 patients from a single institution [^7c76c809]. Pediatric Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Middle fossa arachnoid cysts (MFACs) are rare, congenital lesions that may rupture and cause symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. We sought to describe the presence of and factors associated with optic nerve edema in MFACs, focusing on the utility of ophthalmologic evaluations for guiding cyst management.

Methods

We reviewed clinical and radiographic information for all patients with MFACs with ophthalmologic evaluations at our institution. Headache, cranial nerve palsy, emesis, altered mental status, fatigue, and seizures were considered MFAC-related symptoms. Univariate and multivariable analyses evaluated factors associated with optic edema.

Results

Fifty-one patients between 2003 and 2022 were included. Cysts were a median volume of 169.9 cm³ (interquartile range: 70.5, 647.7). Evidence of rupture with subdural hematoma/hygroma occurred in 19 (37.3%) patients. Eighteen (35.3%) patients underwent surgery for their cyst and/or rupture-associated intracranial bleed. Eleven (21.6%) patients had optic edema; all were symptomatic and experienced cyst rupture. Ten of these patients received surgery. Postoperatively, optic edema resolved in 80% of cases. Cyst volume and symptoms were not associated with optic edema; however, patients with ruptured cysts, particularly those with traumatic rupture, were more likely to have optic edema and receive surgery (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

We found optic edema in 21.6% of evaluated MFACs, and this comprised of 57.9% of ruptured cases. Optic edema was not found in unruptured cysts. Cyst fenestration improved optic edema and patient symptoms. In conjunction with clinical history and neuroimaging, optic edema may help guide MFAC management, particularly in patients with cyst rupture.
