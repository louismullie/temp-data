## Question

For how long should CAP coverage be continued?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for how long CAP coverage should be continued. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether duration is driven by clinical stability rather than a fixed day count. Then, I should stratify by adults versus children, outpatient versus inpatient care, and non-severe versus severe disease. Next, I need to identify exceptions that warrant longer therapy by pathogen, host, or complications. Finally, I will synthesize this into a practical, stewardship-aligned algorithm and a concise summary, verifying against ATS 2025, ATS/IDSA 2019, and ACP 2021 guidance as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core principle. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a fixed duration, because high-quality guidelines emphasize stopping when patients achieve clinical stability, not merely when an arbitrary number of days elapses. Clinical stability typically means afebrile for at least 48 hours, no more than one abnormal vital sign, normal mentation, and ability to eat, and this milestone is the trigger to consider de-escalation, oral switch, and discontinuation when the minimum recommended duration is met [^115mo7Mi] [^1137eJC4] [^115qR2bM].

> Now, for adult outpatients with non-severe CAP, I need to check the most current durations. Wait, I initially thought all adults required at least 5 days, but the updated ATS 2025 guidance recommends less than 5 days with a minimum of 3 days once clinical stability is achieved, which is shorter than older paradigms, so I should verify this against the text, and yes, it explicitly states minimum 3 days when stable. In contrast, ACP 2021 still advises at least 5 days and to extend only if clinical stability criteria are not met, so when reconciling these, I should prioritize stability-based discontinuation while acknowledging that different panels set different minimums, with stewardship favoring the shortest effective course [^116JL4Ag] [^1137eJC4] [^115ZzQTE].

> For adult inpatients with non-severe CAP, let me verify whether the same minimum applies. The ATS 2025 panel similarly advises less than 5 days with a minimum of 3 days once clinical stability is achieved, which is a change from the older 2019 ATS/IDSA posture that generally anchored therapy at approximately 5 days conditional on stability, so I should note that many institutions are transitioning from a 5-day baseline to a 3–5 day, stability-triggered approach [^113DyKsv] [^114NQhP1].

> For adults with severe CAP, I should confirm whether the minimum increases. The ATS 2025 guideline recommends at least 5 days for severe CAP once clinical stability is achieved, and to individualize beyond that based on response. But wait, what if we could shorten in selected ICU patients; let me check biomarker-guided strategies. The ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT 2023 severe CAP guidance supports using procalcitonin to facilitate earlier discontinuation when the clinical trajectory supports it, which can safely reduce exposure when applied judiciously [^1137eJC4] [^111GPqVM].

> Next, I should review pediatric outpatients with non-severe CAP, where I recall robust recent trials. Let me double-check the noninferiority data. Multiple high-credibility meta-analyses and RCTs show that 3–5 days is non-inferior to 7–10 days for clinical cure and treatment failure, with the SAFER and SCOUT-CAP trials supporting 5 days and the CAP-IT trial showing 3 days can be non-inferior to 7 days; importantly, shorter courses reduce antibiotic resistance gene carriage in the microbiome, strengthening the stewardship rationale [^117Q6Lmr] [^111K2jcy] [^112jBvbp].

> Pediatric inpatient data are less abundant, so I need to be cautious. I should confirm whether 5–7 days is reasonable for uncomplicated cases when children stabilize quickly. Observational comparative effectiveness work suggests no difference in failure with 5–7 versus 8–14 days for uncomplicated hospitalized children, and expert reviews increasingly translate adult and pediatric outpatient evidence to propose about 5 days for most uncomplicated hospitalized children who meet stability criteria, though this remains an area where clinical judgment and local policy are important [^115Fxepd] [^112SQDPL].

> Hold on, I should verify the important exceptions that merit longer therapy regardless of the generic durations. Longer courses, often extending to 7–10 days or more, are warranted when specific pathogens are confirmed or strongly suspected, such as Legionella, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other nonfermenting gram-negatives, when complications exist like bacteremia, empyema, or lung abscess, or when host factors such as moderate-to-severe immunocompromise, structural lung disease, or severe COPD are present, and this has been codified in stewardship collaboratives and testing guidance that help identify these contexts [^116vBWn7] [^114CDjVB].

> I will now examine outcomes with shorter versus longer therapy to ensure I am not missing a safety signal. Multiple analyses show no increase in treatment failure, relapse, or mortality with short-course therapy in appropriate adult and pediatric populations, and in fact a 2020 meta-analysis in adults found lower mortality with courses of 6 days or fewer compared with 7 days or more, likely reflecting fewer adverse events and complications rather than superior efficacy, with pediatric meta-analyses showing similar cure and fewer adverse effects with shorter courses [^115vKX89] [^112bYRPQ] [^117Q6Lmr].

> But wait, I should also address real-world practice, because implementation often lags behind evidence. I need to check national data on durations and the effect of stewardship. In the United States, hospitalized adults with uncomplicated CAP still receive a median of roughly 9–10 total days, with more than 70 percent exceeding recommended durations, whereas targeted stewardship interventions, including education and prospective feedback, reduce median durations and intravenous days without harming outcomes, and statewide collaboratives like the Michigan HMS have demonstrated safe, large-scale reductions by embedding clinical stability criteria and excluding high-risk exceptions [^1142uEa4] [^1172UscL] [^115EUYz3] [^116vBWn7].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stability-anchored algorithm and double-check each step. Start by stratifying the patient by adult versus child, outpatient versus inpatient, and non-severe versus severe disease; initiate guideline-concordant empiric therapy; monitor daily for clinical stability using validated criteria such as those by Halm and colleagues; once stable and the minimum duration for the category is met, discontinue antibiotics; extend therapy only if clinical stability is not achieved or if exceptions such as specific pathogens, complications, or immunocompromise are present; document the clinical rationale when going beyond 7 days and consider biomarkers like procalcitonin in severe CAP to support earlier safe discontinuation [^115mo7Mi] [^116JL4Ag] [^113DyKsv] [^111e2FjV] [^1137eJC4] [^111GPqVM].

> Final answer summary, after verifying against the guidelines and trials: For adults with non-severe CAP managed as outpatients or inpatients, stop at 3–5 days once clinical stability is achieved, noting that ATS 2025 allows a minimum of 3 days whereas ACP 2021 advises at least 5 days and to extend only if not yet stable. For adults with severe CAP, treat for at least 5 days and longer only if clinical stability is delayed, with procalcitonin as an optional tool to support earlier discontinuation in appropriate trajectories. For children with non-severe outpatient CAP, use 3–5 days, supported by SAFER, SCOUT-CAP, and CAP-IT; for uncomplicated pediatric inpatients who stabilize promptly, about 5–7 days is reasonable though evidence is emerging. In all groups, extend to 7–10 or more days for Legionella, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas or other nonfermenters, bacteremia, empyema, lung abscess, or significant immunocompromise, and always tie decisions to clinical stability to minimize harms and resistance while maintaining efficacy [^116JL4Ag] [^1137eJC4] [^113DyKsv] [^111e2FjV] [^111GPqVM] [^117Q6Lmr] [^111K2jcy] [^115Fxepd] [^116vBWn7].

CAP coverage should be continued until the patient is clinically stable [^1137eJC4] and for at least **5 days** [^111e2FjV]. For non-severe cases, **3–5 days is sufficient** [^116JL4Ag] if stability is achieved [^113DyKsv]. Severe CAP or complications (e.g. bacteremia, empyema, MRSA, Pseudomonas) require **7–14 days based on clinical response**. Pediatric CAP is treated for 3–5 days [^112bYRPQ] if uncomplicated and stable, and 7–10 days if severe or complicated. Therapy should be individualized by severity, stability, and pathogen, with longer courses for slow response or complications [^115qR2bM].

## General principles guiding duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy for CAP is **primarily determined by**:

- **Clinical stability**: Resolution of vital sign abnormalities [^115mo7Mi], ability to tolerate oral intake, and normal mentation [^1137eJC4].

- **Severity of illness**: Non-severe vs. severe CAP [^111e2FjV].

- **Presence of complications**: Such as bacteremia, empyema, or infection with specific pathogens (e.g. MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [^114NQhP1] [^1137eJC4].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, immune status, and response to therapy [^115qR2bM] [^1137eJC4].

## Recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for CAP

### Adult patients

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-severe CAP (outpatient or inpatient) | 3–5 days | Short-course therapy is effective and safe [^116JL4Ag] if clinical stability is achieved [^113DyKsv] |
| Severe CAP (ICU or high severity) | ≥ 5 days (typically 7–10 days) | Longer duration due to severity [^111GPqVM] and risk of complications [^111e2FjV] |
| CAP with complications (e.g. bacteremia, empyema, MRSA, Pseudomonas) | 7–14 days | Extended duration [^1137eJC4] based on clinical response and pathogen-specific factors [^116vBWn7] |

---

### Pediatric patients

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated CAP (outpatient) | 3–5 days | Short-course therapy is effective [^112bYRPQ] and safe [^117Q6Lmr] |
| Severe or complicated CAP (inpatient) | 7–10 days | Longer duration due to severity and risk of complications [^112SQDPL] |

## Clinical stability criteria

Clinical stability is a **critical determinant for discontinuing antibiotic therapy** [^115mo7Mi]. Commonly used criteria include:

- Temperature ≤ 37.8°C (100°F) for ≥ 48 hours

- Heart rate ≤ 100 beats per minute

- Respiratory rate ≤ 24 breaths per minute [^115mo7Mi]

- Systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg

- Oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air

- Normal mental status

- Ability to tolerate oral intake [^1137eJC4]

Antibiotic therapy should continue until these criteria are met, with a **minimum of 5 days for adults and 3 days for pediatric patients** [^1137eJC4] [^112bYRPQ].

---

## Special considerations

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients may require longer antibiotic courses due to delayed clinical stability and increased risk of complications. Individualized assessment and close monitoring are **essential** [^114CDjVB].

---

### Antibiotic stewardship

Antibiotic stewardship programs play a **crucial role** [^115ZzQTE] in optimizing antibiotic use, preventing unnecessarily prolonged therapy [^1142uEa4], and minimizing antibiotic resistance [^116vBWn7]. Adherence to guidelines and **regular reassessment of clinical stability** are essential [^1172UscL].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Non-severe CAP**: 3–5 days if clinical stability is achieved [^116JL4Ag].

- **Severe CAP**: ≥ 5 days (typically 7–10 days).

- **Complicated CAP**: 7–14 days based on clinical response.

- **Pediatric CAP**: 3–5 days for uncomplicated cases; 7–10 days for severe or complicated cases.

- **Clinical stability**: Essential criterion for discontinuing antibiotic therapy [^115mo7Mi].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Critical for optimizing antibiotic use and reducing resistance [^115ZzQTE].

---

The duration of antibiotic therapy for CAP is **guided by clinical stability** [^1137eJC4], illness severity, and the presence of complications. Short-course therapy (3–5 days) is effective [^116JL4Ag] for **non-severe cases**, whereas severe or complicated cases require longer courses (7–14 days).

### Shorter versus longer-term antibiotic treatments for community-acquired pneumonia in children: A meta-analysis [^112bYRPQ]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of shorter versus longer durations of antibiotic treatment in children with CAP. We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL for relevant data. Randomized clinical trials comparing shorter (≤ 5 days) with longer-duration antibiotic treatments in children with CAP were selected.

Paired reviewers independently extracted data, and we conducted random-effects meta-analyses to summarize the evidence. Sixteen trials involving 12,774 patients treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics were deemed eligible. The results suggest that there are probably no substantial differences between shorter-duration and longer-duration antibiotics in clinical cure (odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 to 1.17; risk difference [RD] 0.1%; moderate certainty), treatment failure (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; RD 0.3%; moderate certainty), and relapse (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; RD 0.5%; moderate certainty).

Compared with longer-duration antibiotics, shorter-duration antibiotics do not appreciably increase mortality (RD 0.0%, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.1; high certainty) and probably have little or no impact on the need for change in antibiotics (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.47; RD 0.2%; moderate certainty), need for hospitalization (RD -0.2%, 95% CI -0.9 to 0.5; moderate certainty), and severe adverse events (RD 0.0%, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.2; moderate certainty).

For some outcomes, the evidence was limited, highlighting the need for further research.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: What is relevant and what is not [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria, and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for the management of community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Recent findings**: All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, and other atypical organisms. Clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* and Gram-negative pathogens.

- **Summary**: The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115WQTJY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite many advances in medical science, the mortality rate from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has changed little in the past four decades. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Newer information about the effect of pneumonia on comorbidity and underlying diseases, especially long term, suggests this is an important additional axis that differs from the traditional triangular concept of pathogen, host defense, and antibiotic treatment.

A number of clinical scoring systems have been developed to help physicians identify patients with CAP at risk of adverse outcomes. None of the criteria have been prospectively demonstrated to avoid late intensive care unit transfers or lower mortality, raising interest in the use of biomarkers such as procalcitonin. Quantitative bacterial genomic load represents a potentially important risk stratification.

Optimal antibiotic management appears to include the use of a macrolide, although the mechanism of benefit remains unclear. Attempts to improve CAP outcomes through setting measurable process of care standards are to be applauded, but it remains critical to ensure that these standards do not become the end in themselves, but rather that the entire process of care is improved.

### Guidelines and quality measures: Do they improve outcomes of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^1117WZg8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has a significant impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost of care. Guidelines play an important role in the management of this disease, and evidence supporting the positive effects of guidelines on outcomes in patients with CAP is substantial. However, evidence supporting many of the CAP quality indicators is low, and pay-for-performance measures do not seem to influence clinically important outcomes. Future CAP quality indicators should incorporate evidence-based interventions.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^115vKX89]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established: discrepancies exist between the different guidelines published at the time of writing. In 2007, IDSA/ATS included a minimum treatment of 5 days, provided the patient remains free of fever for 48–72 hours and without more than one criterion of clinical instability. Recently published updated guidelines keep the same recommendation.

The negative impact of the overuse of antibiotics is well known. In this regard, an increase in nasopharyngeal carriers of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been observed with the use of low-dose beta-lactams for more than 5 days in children. The unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of resistance, a higher number of adverse effects, worse adherence to treatment, and a higher cost.

Several studies have been published with the aim of evaluating the safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. In a recent meta-analysis involving five clinical trials with adults with mild-to-moderate CAP, researchers compared short 3 to 7 day regimens of antibiotics to 7 to 10 day regimens using the same types of antibiotic. The authors did not observe significant differences in terms of cure rate, mortality, and adverse effects. Surprisingly, a new meta-analysis comparing ≤ 6 day versus ≥ 7 day regimens observed a lower mortality rate in the shorter regimen group compared to the long regimen group (RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33–0.82), with similar cure and relapse rates.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^113YejwN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by a variety of pathogens, traditionally categorized as 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment for CAP is usually empirical, typically covering both types of pathogens. At the time of writing, there is no sufficient evidence to support this broad coverage. Limiting coverage could reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: Assess the efficacy and need for adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to January Week 2, 2005); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January Week 2, 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

- **Main results**: Twenty-four trials were included, encompassing 5015 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.54). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qR2bM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

- **Results**: The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

- **Conclusions**: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Do guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia improve the cost-effectiveness of hospital care [^114rz1eR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

There is growing pressure to demonstrate the value of practice guidelines. We have reviewed the evidence that guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) change practices and that the standardization of practices reduces costs and/or improves outcomes.

- **Barriers to implementation**: The most obvious barrier to implementation of the guidelines is a lack of knowledge about their content; equally important are the attitudes and behavior of professionals, patients, and their caregivers.
- **Potential benefits**: Guidelines may improve the outcome of CAP, provided that there is an association between variations in outcome and some specific processes of care. Conversely, when there is no such relationship, guidelines may reduce the cost of care without having an adverse effect on outcome.
- **Cost-effectiveness in hospitals**: The cost-effectiveness of CAP guidelines in an individual hospital depends on the systems available to identify patients with CAP and to measure the processes of care. There is good evidence that following the recommendations of the CAP guidelines does improve the cost-effectiveness of care and, therefore, that an audit of CAP may be worth the effort.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^116vBWn7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Patients eligible for a 5-day antibiotic duration were identified using previously published methods based on national guidelines. Briefly, patients expected to have a 5-day antibiotic duration were those who reached clinical stability (afebrile for ≥ 48 hours and having ≤ 1 vital sign abnormality) by hospital day 5 or were discharged by day 3 of hospitalization.

Because we were targeting patients whose eligibility for a 5-day duration was clear, we excluded patients infected by an organism that may require longer treatment (e.g. bacteremia, Legionella, Staphylococcus, or Pseudomonas species, or other nonfermenting gram-negative organisms) or a condition that may require longer treatment (e.g. moderate immune compromise [i.e. human immunodeficiency virus with CD4 cell count > 200/µL, recent chemotherapy, treatment with biologic agents, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency], structural lung disease, moderate or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

Because HMS began before the removal of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) terminology from national guidelines, CAP was defined based on the 2007 CAP guidelines, and patients who met criteria for HCAP (e.g. hospitalization within 90 days) were excluded. Patients who died, were transferred to the ICU during hospitalization, or who were missing critical data to calculate antibiotic duration were also excluded. See Supplementary Figure 2 for definitions and flow diagram.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^115HC8Uh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and need of adding antibiotic coverage for atypical pathogens in hospitalized patients with CAP, in terms of mortality and successful treatment.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2007); and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical antibiotic coverage to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently appraised the quality of each trial and extracted the data from included trials. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated, assuming an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis for the outcome measures.

- **Main results**: Twenty-five trials were included, encompassing 5244 randomized patients. There was no difference in mortality between the atypical arm and the non-atypical arm (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.56). The atypical arm showed an insignificant trend toward…

### ERS/ESICM/ESCMID/ALAT guidelines for the management of severe community-acquired pneumonia [^111GPqVM]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy, the ALAT/ERS/ESCMID/ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of procalcitonin levels to reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with severe CAP.

### Implementation of an evidence-based guideline to reduce duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^115EUYz3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). High credibility.

Patients with pneumonia often remain hospitalized after becoming clinically stable, and the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is a rate-limiting step for discharge. The purpose of this study was to determine whether implementing an evidence-based guideline could reduce the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and the length of stay for patients hospitalized with pneumonia.

- **Methods**: In a seven-site, cluster randomized clinical trial, we enrolled 325 control and 283 intervention patients who were admitted by one of 116 physician groups. Within each site, physician groups were randomly assigned to receive either a practice guideline alone (control arm) or a practice guideline implemented using a multifaceted strategy (intervention arm). The effectiveness of guideline implementation was measured by the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay. Differences in the rates of discontinuation and hospital discharge were assessed using proportional hazards models. Medical outcomes were evaluated at 30 days.

- **Results**: Intravenous antibiotic therapy was discontinued somewhat more quickly in the intervention group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.52; P = 0.06) than in the control group. Intervention patients were discharged more quickly, but the difference was not statistically significant (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.38; P = 0.11). Fewer intervention patients (55% [157/283]) than control patients (63% [206/325]) experienced medical complications during the index hospitalization (P = 0.04), with no differences in other medical outcomes.

### Guideline adoption for community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^111dvdRj]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America national childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline encouraged the standard evaluation and treatment of children who were managed as outpatients. Our objectives were to (1) increase adherence to guideline-recommended diagnostics and antibiotic treatment of CAP at five pediatric primary care practices (PPCPs) by using quality-improvement methods and (2) evaluate the association between guideline adherence and unscheduled follow-up visits.

- **Methods**: Immunocompetent children over 3 months of age with no complex chronic conditions and who were diagnosed with CAP were eligible for inclusion in this stepped-wedge study. Interventions focused on education, knowledge of colleagues' prescribing practices, and feedback sessions. Statistical process control charts were used to assess changes in recommendations and antibiotic treatment. Unscheduled follow-up visits were compared across time using generalized estimating equations that were clustered by PPCP.

- **Results**: CAP was diagnosed in 1,906 children. Guideline-recommended therapy and pulse oximetry use increased from a mean baseline of 24.9% to a mean of 68.0% and from 4.3% to 85.0%, respectively, over the study period. Among children over 5 years of age, but not among those who were younger, the receipt of guideline-recommended antibiotics, as compared with non-guideline therapy, was associated with an increased likelihood of unscheduled follow-up (adjusted odds ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval: 1.31–3.43).

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia during stewardship efforts and a coronavirus pandemic: An observational study [^117WPw8k]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most frequent infection diagnosis in hospitals. Antimicrobial therapy for CAP is depicted in clinical practice guidelines, but adherence data and effects of antibiotic stewardship measures are lacking.

- **Methods**: A dedicated antibiotic team identified CAP as a potential target for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) measures at a 1,000-bed, tertiary care, teaching university hospital in Norway from March until May for the years 2016 through 2021. The aim of the AMS program was to increase diagnostic and antimicrobial therapy adherence to national clinical practice guideline recommendations through multiple and continuous AMS efforts. Descriptive statistics were retrospectively used to delineate antimicrobial therapy for CAP. The primary outcomes were proportions that received narrow-spectrum beta-lactams and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.

- **Results**: Over the study period, 1,112 CAP episodes were identified. The annual proportion that received narrow-spectrum beta-lactams increased from 56.1% to 74.4% (p = 0.045). Correspondingly, the annual proportion that received broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy decreased from 34.1% to 17.1% (p = 0.002). Trends were affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Mortality and 30-day readmission rates remained unchanged. De-escalation strategies were frequently unutilized, and overall therapy duration exceeded clinical practice guideline recommendations substantially. Microbiologically confirmed CAP episodes increased from 33.7% to 56.2% during the study period.

- **Conclusion**: CAP is a suitable model condition for evaluating antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Short- versus prolonged-duration antibiotics for outpatient pneumonia in children [^112Qbqnr]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

To identify practice patterns in the duration of prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of ambulatory children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and to compare the frequency of adverse clinical outcomes between children prescribed short- versus prolonged-duration antibiotics, a retrospective cohort study was performed from 2010–2016. The study utilized the IBM Watson MarketScan Medicaid Database, a claims database of publicly insured patients from 11 states. It included children aged 1–18 years with outpatient CAP who filled a prescription for oral antibiotics (n = 121,846 encounters). Multivariable logistic regression was employed to determine associations between the duration of prescribed antibiotics (5–9 days vs. 10–14 days) and subsequent hospitalizations, new antibiotic prescriptions, and acute care visits. Outcomes were measured during the 14 days following the end of the dispensed antibiotic course.

The most commonly prescribed duration of antibiotics was 10 days (82.8% of prescriptions), and 10.5% of patients received short-duration therapy. During the follow-up period, 0.2% of patients were hospitalized, 6.2% filled a new antibiotic prescription, and 5.1% had an acute care visit. Compared with the prolonged-duration group, the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for hospitalization, new antibiotic prescriptions, and acute care visits in the short-duration group were 1.16 (95% CI 0.80–1.66), 0.93 (95% CI 0.85–1.01), and 1.06 (95% CI 0.98–1.15), respectively.

Most children treated for CAP as outpatients are prescribed at least 10 days of antibiotic therapy.

### New testing guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^114CDjVB]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review diagnostic testing recommendations outlined in the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline and the 2021 ATS guideline for non-influenza respiratory viruses.

Recent findings indicate that diagnostic testing in CAP with gram stain, lower respiratory and blood cultures, Streptococcal and Legionella urinary antigens are not routinely recommended unless identified as severe CAP or with risk factors for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Influenza virus testing remains a strong recommendation during periods of community viral spread. An additional 2021 ATS clinical practice guideline reviewed the use of molecular testing for non-influenza viral pathogens in adults with suspected CAP and recommended testing in those hospitalized with severe CAP and/or various immunocompromising conditions.

Diagnostic testing remains an important component of confirming and treating CAP. The CAP guideline includes recommendations surrounding diagnostic testing with lower respiratory gram stain and culture, blood cultures, Legionella and Pneumococcal urinary antigens, influenza viral testing, and serum procalcitonin. There is a strong recommendation to obtain influenza virus testing during periods of community spread. However, the use of other diagnostics such as gram stain, lower respiratory and blood culture, and urinary antigen testing depends on the severity of illness and whether a patient has been identified with specific risk factors.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113mKYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); however, rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose, and duration.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

- **Results**: A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%). Macrolides accounted for the majority of non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by…

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering combination therapy of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day and 250 mg PO daily thereafter, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily) is recommended for outpatients with CAP with comorbidities such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### A statewide collaborative quality initiative to improve antibiotic duration and outcomes in patients hospitalized with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia [^111rJW34]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Optimal antibiotic use is vital for effectively treating infections and protecting patients from antibiotic-associated adverse events, Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), and multidrug-resistant organisms. Pneumonia is the most common indication for inpatient antibiotic therapy and a major contributor to antibiotic overuse. Despite guidelines recommending a shorter antibiotic course, the majority of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) receive an excessive duration of therapy.

Several studies have demonstrated that antibiotic stewardship interventions can decrease excessive-duration antibiotic therapy for CAP, but data from large multihospital collaboratives are lacking. In 2017, the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS), a statewide collaborative quality initiative (CQI), began collecting data, sharing best practices, and benchmarking performance related to antibiotic duration for uncomplicated CAP. The resulting antibiotic use and patient outcomes from the first three years are described here.

### Impact of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on shortening the duration of therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^1172UscL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Initial management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services performance measure for a decade. We hypothesized that an intervention directed at the management of CAP, assessing areas not covered by the performance measures — such as treatment duration and antimicrobial selection after additional microbiology data are available — would further improve CAP management.

- **Methods**: We performed a single-center, prospective study to compare the management of adult inpatients with presumed CAP before (from 1 January 2008 through 31 March 2008) and after (from 1 February 2010 through 10 May 2010) an intervention. This intervention consisted of education and prospective feedback to teams regarding antibiotic choice and duration. The primary outcome measure was the duration of antibiotic therapy in the two periods.

- **Results**: There were 62 patients in the pre-intervention period and 65 patients in the intervention period. The duration of antibiotic therapy decreased from a median of 10 to 7 days (P < .001), resulting in 148 fewer days of antibiotic therapy. The median lengths of stay were similar in the two groups (4 vs. 5 days). A causative pathogen was identified less frequently during the intervention period (14% vs. 34%); however, antibiotics were more frequently narrowed or modified based on susceptibility results during the intervention period (67% vs. 19%). Fewer patients received duplicate therapy within 24 hours in the intervention period (90% vs. 55%).

- **Conclusions**: The duration of therapy for CAP was excessive at our institution and was decreased with a stewardship intervention.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens, with the exception of Legionella spp, is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardized tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically.

Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are re.

### Early clinical response in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: From clinical endpoint to clinical practice [^115mo7Mi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

National guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which includes community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) suggest criteria to define when a hospitalized patient with CAP has reached clinical stability. Clinical stability is a marker of a clinical response to therapy and is considered an early clinical outcome, while the time to complete symptom resolution and radiographic improvement are considered late outcomes.

The ATS and IDSA guidelines, published in 2001 and 2007, suggested two sets of criteria to define clinical stability in hospitalized patients with CAP. The definition of clinical stability in the 2001 guidelines was based on patient symptoms, such as cough and shortness of breath, along with signs of systemic response, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count. These criteria were initially reported by Ramirez et al. in 1995. The definition of clinical stability in the 2007 guidelines was based on a decrease under fixed thresholds of vital parameters, including temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, mental status, and oxygenation. These criteria were first reported by Halm et al. in 1998.

A study comparing the two sets of criteria concluded that both are equivalent and can be used to identify early clinical stability in hospitalized patients with CAP. The achievement of clinical stability is an opportunity to consider a switch to oral therapy and hospital discharge in patients initially hospitalized and treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111K2jcy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

- **Results**: The initial search retrieved 779 records, and after removing duplicates (238 records), we assessed 541 abstracts. We excluded 530 studies based on the abstracts, and 11 full texts were evaluated; finally, 4 studies were included in the analysis.

All of the included studies were double-blinded. Three studies were designed as noninferiority trials, and one as a superiority trial. In 3 out of 4 studies, the only antibiotic used was amoxicillin, and the fourth study treated patients with amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanate (5.3%), or cefdinir (3.9%).

Patients included in the studies were treated as outpatients. In every study, patients with suspected complicated pneumonia were excluded. The definition of pneumonia varied between the studies. Two studies required chest radiographs consistent with CAP to be included, while one made the diagnosis based on symptoms and signs. One study used a different approach: patients were diagnosed with pneumonia before their inclusion in the study. They were then randomized to further antibiotics or placebo on day 5. The initial diagnoses did not have any specific diagnostic criteria for CAP, and the randomization on the fifth day was done for those with early clinical improvement; therefore, it may have included milder pneumonia cases than the other included studies.

A total of 1573 children were included in the studies, of whom 784 belonged to the short-course and 789 to the long-course arms. The mean ages of children were between 28 and 36.8 months.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^1134gP1i]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Recent advances aimed at improving outcomes and reducing the CAP disease burden are summarized.

- **Recent findings**: Emerging data suggest that newer CAP risk stratification indices based on disease severity hold promise in predicting intensive care need. Additional evidence supports the role of procalcitonin and pro-adrenomedullin as biomarkers of disease severity and for guiding antimicrobial therapy. New diagnostic tools have greatly contributed to early diagnosis and better-targeted therapy. There is increasing recognition of the role of coinfections in CAP. In patients with severe disease, guidelines advise against monotherapy. Although the inclusion of coverage for atypical pathogens in non-severe CAP has been challenged, evidence suggests that such coverage is beneficial in patients with severe disease. The use of steroids as adjunctive therapy for CAP, however, is associated with complications and prolonged hospitalization. Updated prevention strategies include the approval of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for adults at risk.

Despite these developments, research aimed at further reducing CAP-related morbidity and mortality is required. Increasing global life expectancy is likely to expand the at-risk population; therefore, research directed at CAP prevention in view of changing demography is essential.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: What is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions.

In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States five years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults. It focuses on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection.

Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Q6Lmr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The main result of this meta-analysis on the duration of antibiotic courses in children treated for CAP as outpatients was that a short antibiotic course of 3–5 days was not inferior to a long course of 7–10 days, the recommendation in the currently available guidelines. The analysis included 4 RCTs from high-income countries with a total of 1,451 children aged ≥ 6 months. Treatment failure was defined as the need for retreatment or hospitalization within 1 month, and the rates were surprisingly similar: 7.9% and 8.0%, respectively. The RD between the arms was 0.1%, and the 95% CI was very narrow, confirming that the result for the primary outcome was reliable. In addition, there was no substantial heterogeneity between the 4 studies for reporting retreatments and hospitalizations within 1 month after starting primary antibiotics.

Adverse events, which constituted the secondary outcome of the analyses, were reported in 2 studies and did not differ between the short-course and long-course treatment arms. Adverse events rates were 62.1% and 61.8%, respectively. These adverse events, such as diarrhea and rash, were mild and often seen in children during antibiotic treatment. Two studies reported severe adverse events, observed in 0.3% of the cases, indicating that the short-course antibiotic therapy was safe. A previous meta-analysis stated that each additional day of antibiotic treatment increases the rates of antibiotic-related adverse effects. Two of the included studies also analyzed the effects of treatment duration on antibiotic resistance.

### Duration of antibiotic use among adults with uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in the United States [^1142uEa4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Previous studies suggest that the duration of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) often exceeds national recommendations and might represent an important opportunity to improve antibiotic stewardship nationally. Our objective was to determine the average length of antibiotic therapy (LOT) for patients treated for uncomplicated CAP in US hospitals and the proportion of patients with excessive durations.

- **Methods**: Records of retrospective cohorts of patients aged 18–64 years with private insurance and aged ≥ 65 years with Medicare hospitalized for CAP in 2012–2013 were used. Inpatient LOT was estimated as a function of length of stay. Outpatient LOT was based on prescriptions filled post-discharge based on data from outpatient pharmacy files. Excessive duration was defined as outpatient LOT > 3 days.

- **Results**: Inclusion criteria were met for 22,128 patients aged 18–64 years across 2,100 hospitals and 130,746 patients aged ≥ 65 years across 3,227 hospitals. Median total LOT was 9.5 days. LOT exceeded the recommended duration for 74% of patients aged 18–64 years and 71% of patients aged ≥ 65 years. Patients aged 18–64 years had a median (quartile 1-quartile 3) of 6 (3–7) days outpatient LOT, and those aged ≥ 65 years had 5 (3–7) days.

- **Conclusions**: In this nationwide sample of patients hospitalized for CAP, the median total LOT was just under 10 days, with more than 70% of patients having likely excessive treatment duration. Better adherence to recommended CAP therapy duration by improving prescribing at hospital discharge may be an important target for antibiotic stewardship efforts.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^114t41w2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards due to limited intensive care unit (ICU) beds or unrecognition of pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP in general wards.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a one-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatments within the first 24 hours were collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcomes, defined as a composite of treatment failure and in-hospital death. The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study.

- **Results**: A total of 94 patients were hospitalized with CAP, of which 50 (53.2%) were identified as having severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in severe CAP patients were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood cultures than those with non-severe CAP.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta-lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in fewer than 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning hospital discharge criteria, the IDSA 2007 guidelines recommend discharging patients as soon as they are clinically stable, have no other active medical problems, and have a safe environment for continued care. It is advised to avoid offering inpatient observation while administering oral therapy.

### The association of antibiotic duration with successful treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in children [^115Fxepd]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Low credibility.

National guidelines recommend 10 days of antibiotics for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acknowledging that the outcomes of children hospitalized with CAP who receive shorter durations of therapy have not been evaluated.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comparative effectiveness study of children aged ≥ 6 months hospitalized at The Johns Hopkins Hospital who received short-course (5–7 days) vs. prolonged-course (8–14 days) antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated CAP between 2012 and 2018 using an inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis. Inclusion was limited to children with clinical and radiographic criteria consistent with CAP, as adjudicated by two infectious diseases physicians. Children with tracheostomies; healthcare-associated, hospital-acquired, or ventilator-associated pneumonia; loculated or moderate to large pleural effusion or pulmonary abscess; intensive care unit stay > 48 hours; cystic fibrosis/bronchiectasis; severe immunosuppression; or unusual pathogens were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure, a composite of unanticipated emergency department visits, outpatient visits, hospital readmissions, or death (all determined to be likely attributable to bacterial pneumonia) within 30 days after completing antibiotic therapy.

- **Results**: Four hundred and thirty-nine patients met eligibility criteria; 168 (38%) patients received short-course therapy (median, 6 days) and 271 (62%) received prolonged-course therapy (median, 10 days). Four percent of children experienced treatment failure, with no differences observed.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^111XgpUc]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); however, rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose, and duration.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient and primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category and then stratified by age and sex.

- **Results**: A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%). Macrolides accounted for the majority of non-first-line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by a corresponding guideline.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: A critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States.

An expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions.

- **Recommendations welcomed** by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids.

- **Main criticisms** included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^113pECdX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death worldwide. Severe CAP refers to a group of patients who have severe disease with poor outcomes, requiring a higher level of care. Several criteria have been proposed to define severe CAP. Most reports define it simply as CAP that necessitates intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Initial treatment of CAP is usually empirical, as the microbial etiology cannot be predicted based on clinical presentation. Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy based on the location of care, with specific recommendations for outpatients, inpatients, and ICU-managed patients. Adherence to initial antibiotic selection guidelines is associated with improved survival and reduced duration of mechanical ventilation for patients with severe CAP in ICUs.

ICU admission policies and the availability of ICU beds vary widely across the world. The shortage of ICU beds is a daily problem in many hospitals, especially in under-resourced countries. Additionally, there is a category of severe CAP classified by the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) minor criteria that may be under-recognized, as patients may initially present with subtle findings. As many as 45% of patients with CAP who ultimately required ICU admission were initially admitted to a non-ICU setting. As a result, in many hospitals, a substantial number of patients with severe CAP might be managed mainly in general wards due to limited resources.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: Rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations concerning the diagnosis, optimal choice, timing, and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, as well as the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference for these issues. Furthermore, possibilities for future research in these topics will be discussed.

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even for critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

The diagnosis and management of CAP have remained largely unchanged for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based solely on observational studies and is challenged by two recent trials. In the coming years, improved diagnostic testing through low-dose computed tomography or ultrasound, and microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to significantly influence the choice and initiation of antibiotic therapy for hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing is anticipated to enhance antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence and will be challenging to improve.

### Community-acquired pneumonia guideline recommendations-impact of a consensus-based process versus systematic reviews [^112t2huR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines were developed using systematic reviews to inform every recommendation, as suggested by the Institute of Medicine Standards for Trustworthy Guidelines. Recent studies suggest that an expert consensus-based approach, called the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process, can produce recommendations that are concordant with recommendations informed by systematic reviews.

- **Purpose**: The goal of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the CORE process had it been used to develop the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines.

- **Methods**: Experts in CAP who were not on the guideline panel and had no knowledge of the guideline's systematic reviews or recommendations were recruited to participate in the CORE process, addressing the same questions asked by the guideline panel. Recommendations derived from the CORE process were compared to the guideline recommendations. Concordance of the course of action, strength of recommendation, and quality of evidence was determined.

- **Results**: Using a threshold of 70% of experts selecting the same course of action to make a recommendation, the CORE process yielded a recommendation for 20 of 31 (65%) questions. Among the 20 CORE-derived recommendations, 19 (95%) were concordant with the guideline recommendations (kappa agreement 0.88, 95% CI .64–1.00). There was less agreement among the strength of recommendations (58%) and quality of evidence (42%).

- **Conclusions**: If the CORE process had been used…

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nd7cJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children under 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages, the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country, and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the standard treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over traditional treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent the development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and commensal bacteria to antibiotics.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^11471zU6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Our study indicates that individualizing and reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), based on clinical stability criteria, is safe. This approach does not lead to a greater number of long-term complications or differences in systemic inflammation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116LD2BE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, especially concerning empiric antibiotic therapy in an inpatient setting with non-severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend administering combination therapy. This includes a β-lactam — options are ampicillin/sulbactam (1.5–3 g every 6 hours), cefotaxime (1–2 g every 8 hours), ceftriaxone (1–2 g daily), or ceftaroline (600 mg every 12 hours) — and a macrolide, either azithromycin (500 mg daily) or clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin (750 mg daily) or moxifloxacin (400 mg daily), is recommended for adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who do not have risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Decoding community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review and analysis of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical trials [^111uqdQZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening condition. Even though the disease is common, evidence on CAP management is often of variable quality, which may be reinforced by the lack of a systematic and homogeneous way of defining the disease in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Objectives**: This study aims to assess the diagnostic criteria and definitions of the term 'community-acquired' used in RCTs on CAP management.

- **Data sources**: Based on the protocol (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), a systematic search of Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for RCTs published or registered between 2010 and 2024.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: The study eligibility criteria included both completed and ongoing RCTs.

- **Participants**: Participants included adults hospitalized with CAP.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: Data were collected using a tested extraction sheet, as endorsed by the Cochrane Collaboration. After cross-checking, data were synthesized in both narrative and tabular forms.

- **Results**: A total of 7173 records were identified through our searches. After removing records that did not fulfill the eligibility criteria, 170 studies were included. Diagnostic criteria were provided in 69.4% of studies, and the term 'community-acquired' was defined in 55.3% of studies. The most frequently included diagnostic criteria were pulmonary infiltrates (94.1%), cough (78.8%), fever (77.1%), dyspnea (62.7%), sputum (57.6%), auscultation/percussion abnormalities (55.9%), and chest pain/discomfort (52.5%).

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^112jBvbp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The appropriate duration of therapy was identified as 5–7 days, based on clinical guidelines available during the study period. More recently, the SAFER, SCOUT-CAP, and CAP-IT trial results have become available, offering robust clinical evidence in favor of short course treatments (3–5 days). These randomized, multicenter trials enrolled children (N = 1485) with non-severe CAP. The SAFER trial was a blinded non-inferiority study completed in Canadian emergency departments, concluding that 5-day high-dose amoxicillin therapy was comparable to 10 days. In the United States, the SCOUT-CAP trial examined outpatient, urgent care, as well as emergency settings, corroborating SAFER results. Moreover, SCOUT-CAP offered the first evidence of reduced antibiotic selective pressure resulting from shorter courses by examining antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a post-hoc microbiome analysis. The trial concluded that 5-day treatment reported significantly lower levels of ARGs when compared to longer durations. The CAP-IT non-inferiority trial concluded that 3-day treatment was non-inferior to 7 days of amoxicillin. With results published in 2021/22, all three trials provide irrefutable clinical evidence that short-course should be the standard of care for non-severe pediatric CAP infection. Across multiple outcomes of interest, including treatment failure, hospitalization, and adverse events, short-course (3–5 days) treatments have been identified as equally safe and effective when compared to longer durations (7–10 days). Moreover, shorter durations of therapy increased year-on-year.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. In contrast, Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering atypical pathogens.

Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP [^111Z9J6W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diagnoses encountered in clinical practice and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines is inconsistent, and the erroneous diagnosis of CAP and misuse of antibiotics are prevalent in both inpatients and outpatients. This review summarizes interventions that may be promoted by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve outcomes for patients with CAP.

### Validation and clinical implications of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116PbZrw]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

The 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines defined severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and recommended intensive care unit (ICU) admission when patients fulfilled three out of nine minor criteria. These criteria have not been validated.

- **Methods**: All patients admitted to our hospital from 2004 to 2007 for CAP were reviewed retrospectively. Patients who fulfilled any IDSA/ATS major criteria for severe CAP at the emergency department (i.e. the need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors) were excluded. The predictive characteristics of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria were compared with those of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and the CURB-65 score for hospital mortality and ICU admission.

- **Results**: 1242 patients were studied (mean age 65.7 years, hospital mortality 14.7%). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the IDSA/ATS minor criteria were 0.88 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.91) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.88) for predicting hospital mortality and ICU admission, respectively. These were greater than the corresponding areas for the PSI and the CURB-65 score (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the minor criteria were 81.4%, 82.9%, 45.2%, and 96.3%, respectively, for hospital mortality, and 58.3%, 90.6%, 52.9%, and 92.3%, respectively, for ICU admission. The minor criteria were more specific than the PSI and more sensitive than the CURB-65 score for both outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: These findings support the use of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria to predict hospital mortality and ICU admission in patients with severe CAP.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^115PUtZU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

- **Study overview**: Table 2 presents the main results from both control and intervention groups. The overall mortality rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year per protocol were 8 (2.57%), 10 (3.22%), and 14 (4.50%), respectively. There were no significant differences in mortality after 1 year between the groups, even after adjusting for the Charlson comorbidity index (PP: OR adjusted 1.04, 95% CI 0.33–3.26, p = 0.94).

- **Admissions and cardiovascular events**:
	- The rate of new admissions per year was 27.01% in the control group compared to 25.52% in the intervention group (p = 0.84). Similar analyses across hospitals revealed no significant differences.
	- Figure 2 illustrates the 1-year survival analysis per protocol (Hazard ratio (95% CI) = 1.08 (0.36, 3.22), p = 0.89), showing no significant differences.
	- Cardiovascular events per year were 16 (10.74%) in the control and 23 (14.38%) in the intervention group (adjusted OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.71–2.77, p = 0.33) according to the per protocol analysis.

- **Data presentation details**: Data are expressed as averages (SD), medians (IQR), or n (%). Abbreviations include ITT for intention-to-treat and PP for per-protocol. Additional abbreviations: SD (Standard Deviation), IQR (Interquartile Range), OR (Odds Ratio), CI (Confidence Interval), and CV (Cardiovascular).

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^114dGdnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, covering both types of pathogens. No sufficient evidence supports this broad coverage, and limiting coverage may reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: The main objective was to estimate the mortality and proportion with treatment failure using regimens containing atypical antibiotic coverage compared to those with only typical coverage. Secondary objectives included the assessment of adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage (quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptogramins, or ketolides) to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included trials. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi-squared test.

- **Main results**: We included 28 trials encompassing 5939 randomized patients. The atypical antibiotic was administered as monotherapy.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^115xQSYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a prevalent condition that imposes a significant disease burden, particularly on children under five years, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP; however, increased antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and patient side effects. Numerous studies have investigated optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP, though many focus on hospitalized patients. This text updates our 2009 Cochrane Review, specifically addressing antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings, evaluating clinical, radiological, and bacteriological outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014), and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

- **Selection criteria**: We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, comparing antibiotics versus placebo or antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings for participants older than 12 years. However, no such studies were found.

### Management of community-acquired pneumonia in the home: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical position statement [^112XQgju]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

The number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) being treated at home is increasing for various reasons. These include the increased availability and cost-effectiveness of oral antibiotics that have proven effective, and consideration of patient and family preferences. However, there is still considerable variability in strategies for managing patients with CAP.

This American College of Chest Physicians position statement, cosponsored by the American Academy of Home Care Physicians, provides recommendations on different aspects of home care for patients with this condition. Recommendations are included for evaluation and diagnosis in the home environment, determining the site of care, and outlining an in-home management plan. The position statement also addresses issues related to patient and caregiver commitment to the plan, as well as recommendations for monitoring and follow-up.

These recommendations target immunocompetent adult patients with CAP who are at home or in other unskilled residential facilities. This includes previously healthy individuals, chronically ill individuals who choose not to go to the hospital, or hospitalized patients completing a hospital discharge plan. The recommendations consider the best course of action for the patient by incorporating the latest evidence with clinician judgment and patient preferences, while also considering available resources.

### Challenges for a broad international implementation of the current severe community-acquired pneumonia guidelines [^11471k5t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) remains one of the leading causes of admission to the intensive care unit, consuming a large share of resources and being associated with high mortality rates worldwide. The evidence generated by clinical studies in the last decade has been translated into recommendations according to the first published guidelines focusing on severe community-acquired pneumonia. Despite the advances proposed by the present guidelines, several challenges preclude the prompt implementation of these diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The present article discusses the challenges for the broad implementation of the sCAP guidelines and proposes solutions when applicable.

### A worldwide perspective of atypical pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia [^112AKf2X]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Controversy still exists in the international literature regarding the need to use antimicrobials covering atypical pathogens when initially treating hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In different regions of the world, monotherapy with a beta-lactam antimicrobial is common.

We sought to correlate the incidence of CAP due to atypical pathogens in different regions of the world with the proportion of patients treated with an atypical regimen in those same regions. In addition, we sought to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with CAP treated with and without atypical coverage.

A secondary analysis was performed using two comprehensive international databases. World regions were defined as North America (I), Europe (II), Latin America (III), and Asia and Africa (IV). Time to reach clinical stability, length of hospital stay, and mortality were compared between patients treated with and without atypical coverage.

- **Measurements and main results**: The incidence of CAP due to atypical pathogens from 4,337 patients was 22%, 28%, 21%, and 20% in regions I-IV, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with atypical coverage from 2,208 patients was 91%, 74%, 53%, and 10% in regions I-IV, respectively. Patients treated with atypical coverage had decreased time to clinical stability (3.7 vs. 3.2 days, p < 0.001), decreased length of stay (7.1 vs. 6.1 days, p < 0.01), decreased total mortality (11.1% vs. 7%, p < 0.01), and decreased CAP-related mortality (6.4% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.05).

The significant global presence of atypical pathogens in CAP and the advantages of using atypical coverage were evident in the significant improvements in clinical outcomes.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid diseases. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious diseases in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy and highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines. It also includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the guideline recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors, including resources, antimicrobial factors, and the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

- **Summary**: The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations, as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines, both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns about rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of the harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. Recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating the durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children have been described, translating the findings into our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

- **Recent findings**: There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

- **Summary**: Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.
