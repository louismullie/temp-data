## Question

management of henoch schonlein purpura

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA vasculitis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and baseline risk stratification. Then, I should verify the principles of supportive care and when to escalate. Next, I will examine the role of corticosteroids and reconcile conflicting evidence. After that, I need to stratify renal disease and map evidence-based therapy, including ACE inhibitors/ARBs and immunosuppressants. Then, I should consider special populations and refractory scenarios. Finally, I will outline follow-up, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and establish baseline risk, because management hinges on accurate classification and early detection of complications. The clinical tetrad of palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis/arthralgia, and renal involvement supports IgA vasculitis, and biopsy demonstrating IgA-dominant small-vessel vasculitis confirms the diagnosis when the rash is atypical or renal disease is suspected, aligning with EULAR/PRINTO criteria and SHARE recommendations [^113BsLP6]. I should double-check that routine labs are not diagnostic but are essential for risk stratification: CBC, renal function, urinalysis with microscopy, and blood pressure at baseline, with repeat urinalysis and blood pressure at least weekly for the first month and then periodically for 6 months given the risk of delayed nephritis [^117QXDQ3] [^117RKV1S]. Hold on, I should verify imaging indications: abdominal ultrasound is appropriate if intussusception is suspected, and renal ultrasound if obstruction or ureteritis is a concern, given rare but consequential urologic complications [^117QXDQ3] [^1111CKTy].

> Next, I should review supportive care, because most cases resolve spontaneously and overtreatment can cause harm. Supportive management includes rest during the acute phase, hydration, and analgesia with acetaminophen; NSAIDs can be used for joint pain if there is no significant GI bleeding or renal impairment, but I need to ensure caution given GI and renal risks in active disease [^117QXDQ3]. Wait, let me verify the role of steroids for symptomatic relief: short courses of oral prednisone can reduce the duration and severity of abdominal and joint pain, but they do not prevent nephritis and should not be used prophylactically, so I must avoid reflexive steroid initiation in uncomplicated cases [^114p11kM] [^117PwxZC].

> I will now examine the corticosteroid controversy, and I need to reconcile seemingly conflicting data. High-quality evidence shows no reduction in persistent kidney disease with early prednisone at onset, including a large RCT showing no difference in proteinuria at 12 months and an updated Cochrane review confirming no preventive benefit, so routine early steroids to prevent nephritis are not recommended [^115kzQTm] [^115mjmA2] [^117PwxZC]. But wait, what if steroids help acute morbidity? Observational and meta-analytic data suggest faster resolution of abdominal pain and fewer GI procedures with early steroids, and inpatient cohorts show reduced endoscopies and surgeries, so a short, carefully tapered course is reasonable for severe abdominal pain, significant GI bleeding, or disabling arthritis, acknowledging that this does not change long-term renal outcomes [^1111j3B3] [^112uZaRo] [^114p11kM]. Hold on, I should verify duration: many clinicians taper over 2–4 weeks to mitigate relapse risk, but evidence for optimal taper is limited, so I will individualize and avoid prolonged courses when possible [^113BaviG].

> Now, I need to stratify renal involvement, because prognosis and therapy depend on severity. Mild disease includes microscopic hematuria with or without proteinuria less than about 0.5 g/day per 1.73 m², moderate disease typically involves proteinuria exceeding 0.5–1 g/day without nephrotic syndrome, and severe disease includes nephrotic-range proteinuria, nephritic syndrome, or declining kidney function, with biopsy reserved for persistent proteinuria beyond roughly 3 months, nephrotic or nephritic syndrome, or rising creatinine to guide therapy and prognosis [^115moXyQ] [^114h3E9x]. I should confirm that chronic kidney disease risk is tightly linked to initial renal severity: patients with combined nephritic and nephrotic syndrome have markedly higher risks of ESRD than those with isolated urinary abnormalities, underscoring the need for aggressive management in severe phenotypes [^113n761P].

> For mild renal disease, let me think about conservative therapy first. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line to reduce proteinuria and intraglomerular pressure, and I should titrate to the maximally tolerated dose while monitoring potassium and renal function, reassessing proteinuria after 3–6 months to decide on further immunosuppression if proteinuria persists above about 1 g/day per 1.73 m² and GFR remains above 50 mL/min/1.73 m², per KDIGO-aligned guidance [^115moXyQ]. Wait, I should verify that this approach is extrapolated from IgA nephropathy due to shared pathobiology; yes, HSP nephritis and IgA nephropathy are related entities, so anti-proteinuric therapy and staged immunosuppression are reasonable parallels in the absence of HSP-specific trials [^114h3E9x].

> For moderate renal disease, I should confirm that a 6-month course of corticosteroids is suggested after a trial of ACEi/ARB if proteinuria remains above 1 g/day and kidney function is preserved, again extrapolated from IgA nephropathy protocols and KDIGO commentary, with close monitoring for relapse as steroids are tapered [^115moXyQ]. Hold on, I should verify that this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence; yes, it is a 2D suggestion, so shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are essential [^115moXyQ].

> For severe renal disease, I need to ensure timely, aggressive immunosuppression. High-dose IV methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral prednisone are standard, and for crescentic disease or nephrotic/nephritic presentations, cyclophosphamide is commonly added, although randomized data are limited and mixed, with one adult RCT showing no added benefit of cyclophosphamide over steroids alone and pediatric data constrained by small numbers, so I should weigh infection risk and fertility counseling carefully [^116hUxVh] [^11379PGm] [^1144UPeh]. Let me reconsider alternatives: mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus have emerging evidence and may achieve remission with potentially fewer infectious complications than cyclophosphamide, but long-term superiority is unproven and heterogeneity is high, so I will reserve these for selected cases or when cyclophosphamide is contraindicated, ideally in nephrology-led care [^115mjmA2] [^114ySzkF]. I should double-check that plasmapheresis is reserved for rapidly progressive crescentic disease or life-threatening systemic involvement, given very low-quality evidence and significant resource demands [^115mjmA2].

> But wait, what about biologics for refractory non-renal or renal disease? Rituximab has case-level evidence for steroid-dependent or multi-refractory HSP and HSP nephritis, including post-transplant recurrence, but high-quality trials are lacking, so I will consider it only after failure or intolerance of standard regimens and in expert centers [^112VqVwb] [^117YXPNx]. I need to ensure that expectations are tempered: responses are variable and durability uncertain, reinforcing the need for systematic data [^112VqVwb].

> Next, I should review special populations and organ-specific complications. Adults have more frequent and severe renal disease and may require more aggressive therapy and longer follow-up, so I should maintain a lower threshold for biopsy and intensified immunosuppression while applying the same general principles used in children, albeit with caution given the paucity of adult-specific RCTs [^114YvZxD] [^114839jZ]. For severe gastrointestinal involvement with ongoing bleeding or pain despite steroids, IVIG or plasma exchange can be considered in refractory cases, with small series suggesting benefit, though evidence is low quality and decisions should be individualized [^111Gmpmn] [^115xVSJU]. For diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or other pulmonary complications, I should escalate promptly to high-dose IV corticosteroids and consider cyclophosphamide in life-threatening scenarios, recognizing that data are limited to case series and expert opinion [^115mXSKV]. In post-transplant recurrence of HSP nephritis, early plasmapheresis has case-level support for reducing IgA burden and preserving graft function, but I must balance infectious risks and coordinate with transplant teams [^114VmqoC].

> I will now examine follow-up and monitoring, because delayed nephritis drives long-term morbidity. Even with normal initial urinalysis, I should continue urine checks and blood pressure monitoring for at least 6 months, as most nephritis declares within this window, and if urinalysis remains normal at 6 months, further follow-up can be relaxed, whereas any proteinuria or hematuria warrants extended nephrology follow-up [^117RKV1S]. Let me verify recurrence risks and triggers: recurrent HSP occurs in about 20–30% of children, with risk linked to renal involvement, allergic rhinitis, and possibly longer steroid durations, so I should counsel families and plan closer surveillance in high-risk profiles [^111rxnZT] [^113BaviG]. I should confirm that long-term renal prognosis is worst in those with nephritic-nephrotic presentations, where CKD and ESRD risks are substantially higher, guiding the intensity of early therapy and follow-up [^113n761P].

> Finally, I need to synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with guidelines and evidence. For all patients, provide supportive care and ensure close urinalysis and blood pressure monitoring for 6 months. Use a short steroid course for severe abdominal pain, significant GI bleeding, or disabling arthritis, but avoid steroids for prophylaxis against nephritis. Stratify renal disease: mild cases get ACEi/ARB with reassessment; moderate cases add a 6-month steroid course if proteinuria persists; severe cases receive pulse IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone plus cyclophosphamide, with consideration of MMF or tacrolimus in selected patients or when cyclophosphamide is unsuitable, under nephrology supervision. Throughout, individualize decisions, document shared decision-making where evidence is weak, and maintain vigilance for complications and recurrence, adjusting follow-up intensity accordingly [^117PwxZC] [^115moXyQ] [^113BsLP6].

---

The cornerstone of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA vasculitis) management is **supportive care** [^117QXDQ3] for most patients, with corticosteroids reserved for severe abdominal, joint, or skin symptoms [^111tCrJ4] [^114p11kM]. Routine early corticosteroids **do not prevent nephritis** [^11379PGm] and are not recommended for this purpose [^117PwxZC] [^117TaJ58]. For HSP nephritis, use ACE inhibitors or ARBs for proteinuria [^115moXyQ], and add immunosuppression (mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab) for persistent proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, or crescentic disease [^1144UPeh] [^117TaJ58] [^117YXPNx]. Monitor urine and blood pressure for at least 6 months [^117RKV1S] to detect delayed nephritis, and refer to nephrology for significant renal involvement [^notfound].

---

## General supportive care

Supportive care is the **foundation of HSP management** [^117QXDQ3], as most cases resolve spontaneously [^117TaJ58]. Key measures include:

- **Rest and hydration**: Encourage rest and adequate hydration during the acute phase [^112Qmv9x].

- **Analgesia**: NSAIDs or acetaminophen for joint and abdominal pain; avoid NSAIDs if renal impairment is present [^112Qmv9x].

- **Nutrition**: Maintain a normal diet unless gastrointestinal symptoms are severe [^notfound].

---

## Indications for corticosteroid therapy

Corticosteroids are indicated for **severe extrarenal manifestations** [^113BsLP6], including:

- **Severe abdominal pain**: Particularly with gastrointestinal bleeding or risk of intussusception [^114p11kM] [^116g8jeX].

- **Severe joint pain**: Significant arthritis or arthralgia impairing mobility [^114p11kM].

- **Severe skin involvement**: Extensive purpura or bullous lesions [^111bF7zL].

However, **routine early corticosteroids do not prevent nephritis** [^11379PGm] and are not recommended for this purpose [^117PwxZC].

---

## Management of renal involvement (HSP nephritis)

Renal involvement occurs in **20–60% of children** [^113n761P] and determines long-term prognosis [^114h3E9x]. Management is tailored to severity:

| **Severity** | **Clinical features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | Microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria (< 0.5 g/day) | - Supportive care <br/> - ACE inhibitors or ARBs if proteinuria persists [^115moXyQ] |
| Moderate | Proteinuria > 0.5 g/day, nephritic syndrome, or nephrotic syndrome without renal insufficiency | - Oral prednisone (1–2 mg/kg/day) for 4–6 weeks, then taper [^notfound] <br/> - ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^115moXyQ] |
| Severe | Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, crescentic nephritis, or renal insufficiency | - High-dose IV methylprednisolone pulses (30 mg/kg/day for 3 days) <br/> - Oral prednisone (1–2 mg/kg/day) for 4–6 weeks, then taper [^notfound] <br/> - Cyclophosphamide (oral or IV) for 6–12 weeks [^116BHfFu] <br/> - Consider plasmapheresis or rituximab in refractory cases [^114VmqoC] [^112VqVwb] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to detect **delayed nephritis** and guide management:

- **Urinalysis and blood pressure**: Check at least weekly for the first month, then monthly for 6 months [^117QXDQ3].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine and eGFR monitoring during follow-up [^notfound].

- **Long-term follow-up**: Continue for at least 6 months after resolution of symptoms to detect late renal involvement [^117RKV1S].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Referral to **pediatric nephrology** or rheumatology is indicated for:

- **Significant renal involvement**: Persistent proteinuria, nephritic or nephrotic syndrome, or renal insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Severe extrarenal involvement**: Refractory gastrointestinal or joint symptoms [^notfound].

- **Recurrent or chronic disease**: Multiple recurrences or persistent symptoms despite therapy [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Overall prognosis is **excellent**, with spontaneous resolution in most children [^117TaJ58]. Recurrence occurs in **10–40%** [^112VqVwb], usually within 6 months, and is more common with renal involvement or prolonged steroid use [^111rxnZT].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Supportive care**: First-line for most patients [^117QXDQ3].

- **Corticosteroids**: For severe abdominal, joint, or skin symptoms; not for nephritis prevention [^114p11kM] [^117PwxZC].

- **Renal involvement**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs for proteinuria; immunosuppression for moderate-to-severe disease [^115moXyQ] [^113BsLP6].

- **Monitoring**: Regular urinalysis and blood pressure for at least 6 months [^117RKV1S].

- **Referral**: For significant renal or refractory extrarenal involvement [^notfound].

---

Effective HSP management centers on **supportive care**, with corticosteroids for severe extrarenal symptoms and targeted immunosuppression for renal disease; regular monitoring and timely specialist referral are essential to optimize outcomes.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis is a rare kidney disease leading to chronic kidney disease in a non-negligible percentage of patients. Although retrospective studies suggest beneficial effects of some therapies, prospective randomized clinical trials proving treatment efficacy are still lacking. The dilemma of spontaneous recovery even in patients with severe clinical and histologic presentation and of late evolution to chronic kidney disease in patients with mild initial symptoms renders it difficult for clinicians to expose patients to treatment protocols that are not evidence-based. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of progression to chronic kidney disease in Henoch-Schönlein purpura patients could be achieved by designing prospective international multicenter studies looking at determinants of clinical and histopathological evolution as well as possible circulating and urinary markers of progression. Such studies should be supported by a database available on the web and a new histologic classification of kidney lesions. This paper reports clinical, pathologic, and experimental data to be used for this strategy and to assist clinicians and clinical trial designers to reach therapeutic decisions.

### Henoch-schonlein purpura [^1164gbRZ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to educate the reader about the one of the most common vasculitides of childhood: Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Although the disease has been described for over a century, the etiology has yet to be discovered. Adult-onset Henoch-Schonlein purpura is unusual, but through case studies, this review examines some of the common manifestations of this presentation of disease. Long-term outcome studies are still defining how this disease affects a small but significant percentage of patients afflicted with Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

Recent Findings

This article will summarize recent work in molecular biology and genetics evaluating predisposing factors in the development of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Further illustrations of the various complications of Henoch-Schonlein purpura will be reviewed. Recent long-term studies of outcomes of patients with renal disease from Henoch-Schonlein purpura will be summarized.

Summary

After reading this review, the clinician will be able to elucidate the manifestations of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, determine appropriate treatment of the disease, and, most importantly, give the patient information about long-term consequences of Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^114p11kM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on recent advances in the genetic susceptibility, pathogenesis and treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

Recent Findings

Recent work has advanced our understanding of the genetic susceptibility and pathogenesis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, but there are still significant gaps in our knowledge. Information concerning the most effective treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura has begun to emerge. Corticosteroid therapy reduces the duration and severity of abdominal and joint pain, but corticosteroids do not prevent the development of nephritis, or alter the natural history of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The most effective treatment for severe nephritis remains unclear despite multiple, mostly retrospective reports investigating a variety of drugs.

Summary

Despite recent progress, our understanding of the genetic susceptibility, pathogenesis and treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura remains incomplete. Further research is necessary in order to clearly define the genetic susceptibility and the pathogenesis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Multicenter clinical trials are needed to determine the most effective treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, particularly for patients with severe nephritis.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IgA vasculitis): rapid evidence review [^117TaJ58]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura, now called immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, is a systemic, immune complex-mediated, small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis characterized by nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura, arthritis, and abdominal pain. It is the most common vasculitis in children but can also occur in adults. Diagnostic testing is required only to exclude other etiologies of purpura, to identify renal involvement, and, if indicated, to determine its extent with biopsy. Imaging or endoscopy may be needed to assess organ complications. IgA vasculitis spontaneously resolves in 94% of children and 89% of adults, making supportive treatment the primary management strategy. However, a subset of patients experience renal involvement that can persist and relapse years later. Additional complications can include gastrointestinal bleeding, orchitis, and central nervous system involvement. Systematic reviews have shown that steroids do not prevent complications and should not be used prophylactically. However, randomized trials have demonstrated success with high-dose steroids, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate in treating glomerulonephritis and other complications. Long-term prognosis depends on the extent of renal involvement. Six months of follow-up is prudent to assess for disease relapse or remission.

### Prevention and treatment of renal disease in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a systematic review [^112XSPwR]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the benefits and harms of therapies used to prevent or treat renal involvement in Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Setting

Secondary and tertiary paediatric and paediatric nephrology services.

Subjects

Ten trials involving 1230 children aged less than 18 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Persistent proteinuria and/or haematuria.

Results

Meta-analyses of four trials showed no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease at 6 months (379 children; relative risk (RR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.11) and 12 months (498 children; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.62) in children given prednisone for 14–28 days at presentation of Henoch-Schönlein purpura compared with placebo or supportive treatment. In children with severe renal disease, there was no significant difference in the risk of persistent renal disease with cyclophosphamide compared with supportive treatment (one trial; 56 children; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.78) and with cyclosporin compared with methylprednisolone (one trial; 19 children; RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06).

Conclusions

Data from randomised trials for any intervention used to improve renal outcomes in children with Henoch-Schönlein purpura are very sparse except for short-term prednisone, which has not been shown to be effective.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in the treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111sr4C1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

To address this gap, our study presents the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis specifically to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in HSPN. By synthesizing data from multiple clinical trials, this study aims to provide robust evidence to guide clinical decision-making, enhance therapeutic precision, and ultimately improve renal outcomes in patients with HSPN. The novelty of this work lies in its focused assessment of TAC in HSPN — a critical but underrepresented area in nephrology research — thereby filling a significant void in the current literature and offering new insights into the management of this challenging condition.

### Effects of corticosteroid on Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a systematic review [^1111j3B3]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

No consensus exists among general pediatricians or pediatric rheumatologists regarding whether corticosteroid therapy ameliorates the acute manifestations of Henoch-Schönlein purpura or mitigates renal injury. Therefore, we sought to synthesize the reported experimental and observational data regarding corticosteroid use.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis based on a comprehensive review of the literature in the Medline database (1956 to January 2007) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. On the basis of reported outcomes among patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura who were treated at diagnosis with corticosteroids compared with patients treated with supportive care only, we calculated odds ratios for the resolution of abdominal pain, the need for surgical intervention secondary to severe pain or intussusception, the likelihood of Henoch-Schönlein purpura recurrence, and the development of transient or persistent renal disease.

Results

Of 201 articles retrieved from the initial literature search, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Corticosteroid treatment did not reduce the median time to resolution of abdominal pain but did significantly reduce the mean resolution time and increased the odds of resolution within 24 hours. Early corticosteroid treatment significantly reduced the odds of developing persistent renal disease. In addition, although the results were not statistically significant, the prospective data suggest reduced odds of both surgical intervention and recurrence.

Conclusions

Corticosteroids, given early in the course of illness, seem to produce consistent benefits for several major clinically relevant Henoch-Schönlein purpura outcomes.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura: recent advances [^114kzVmu]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Recent developments in relation to Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) include: a) a proposed new classification of childhood vasculitides including new classification criteria for HSP; b) the identification of various, potentially important, genetic polymorphisms in HSP that may be relevant in terms of predisposition to or protection from complications; c) evidence that prophylactic steroid at the onset of disease does not protect against renal or gastrointestinal complications but does seem to have beneficial effects in treating them.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis in children [^114h3E9x]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis in children, in whom prognosis is mostly dependent upon the severity of renal involvement. Nephritis is observed in about 30% of children with HSP. Renal damage eventually leads to chronic kidney disease in up to 20% of children with HSP nephritis in tertiary care centres, but in less than 5% of unselected patients with HSP, by 20 years after diagnosis. HSP nephritis and IgA nephropathy are related diseases resulting from glomerular deposition of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1. Although both nephritides present with similar histological findings and IgA abnormalities, they display pathophysiological differences with important therapeutic implications. HSP nephritis is mainly characterized by acute episodes of glomerular inflammation with endocapillary and mesangial proliferation, fibrin deposits and epithelial crescents that can heal spontaneously or lead to chronic lesions. By contrast, IgA nephropathy normally presents with slowly progressive mesangial lesions resulting from continuous low-grade deposition of macromolecular IgA1. This Review highlights the variable evolution of similar clinical and histological presentations among paediatric patients with HSP nephritis, which constitutes a challenge for their management, and discusses the treatment of these patients in light of current guidelines based on clinical evidence from adults with IgA nephropathy.

Introduction

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis, is one of the most prevalent forms of systemic vasculitis, with an incidence of approximately ten cases per 100,000 individuals annually. Although HSP can affect individuals of all ages, it predominantly occurs in children under the age of 10. Clinically, HSP is characterized by purpuric rashes, but its systemic nature often results in multi-organ involvement, including the joints, gastrointestinal tract, and, critically, the kidneys. Despite extensive use of immunosuppressants in HSPN, no prior systematic review has comprehensively assessed TAC in this setting, leaving clinicians with limited guidance on its benefits and risks.

Renal involvement, known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), is the most severe complication of the disease. It commonly manifests as hematuria with or without proteinuria, which may range from microscopic to gross presentations. Pathologically, HSPN is characterized by mesangial deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes, which activate the complement system and trigger glomerular inflammation, ultimately damaging the glomerular filtration barrier. This process leads to clinical manifestations such as hematuria, proteinuria, and, in severe cases, nephrotic syndrome or progressive renal dysfunction. In addition to immune complex deposition, T-cell–mediated immune dysregulation and podocyte injury contribute to disease progression. Importantly, HSPN — especially when associated with nephrotic-range proteinuria — significantly increases the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or even death. These risks highlight the urgent need for effective treatment strategies to prevent long-term renal impairment in affected patients.

Current treatment options for HSPN are largely extrapolated from therapeutic approaches for other glomerular diseases, such as lupus nephritis. Tacrolimus (TAC), a calcineurin inhibitor, has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional immunosuppressants like intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) in lupus nephritis management. TAC exerts its immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting T-cell activation, thereby reducing autoantibody production and subsequent immune-mediated kidney injury. Beyond its immunomodulatory properties, TAC may have direct nephroprotective effects, including the stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, prevention of podocyte apoptosis, and reduction of immune complex deposition within the glomeruli. Furthermore, TAC's potential steroid-sparing effect could mitigate the long-term adverse effects associated with corticosteroid therapy. Despite these promising mechanisms, the role of TAC in the treatment of HSPN remains underexplored, with limited and heterogeneous clinical trial data available.

### Incidence and risk factors for recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children from a 16-year nationwide database [^111rxnZT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Ours was the first study to describe the incidence of recurrent HSP, and added evidence of increased associations of recurrent HSP and allergic rhinitis, renal involvement, and steroid treatment for > 10 days. These results can be considered observations from real-world conditions. Patients with the aforementioned clinical features were suggested to receive longer periods of follow-up than previously suggested for the early identification and management of recurrent HSP. In those with a second HSP episode, perhaps 6 more months of monitoring is also suggested for the early recognition of a third HSP recurrence. Further study is needed to clarify the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of these associations.

### Use of wireless capsule endoscopy in the management of severe henoch-schonlein purpura [^113BENG4]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a multisystem vasculitis that primarily affects children. Characteristic symptoms include purpura of the lower extremities and buttocks, abdominal pain, arthralgias, and hematuria. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in approximately 50% of children and, although often self-limiting, can be significant. Wireless capsule endoscopy has been found to be safe and effective for children over 10 years of age. It is now the preferred imaging modality for evaluating gastrointestinal bleeding from the small intestine. Here we report an unusual case of chronic Henoch-Schonlein purpura vasculitis, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract, in which wireless capsule endoscopy was helpful in evaluating and directing treatment options.

### Interventions for preventing and treating kidney disease in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) [^11379PGm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To determine the benefits and harms of therapies used to prevent or treat kidney disease in Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP).

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of different agents (used singularly or in combination) compared with placebo or no treatment or another agent for the prevention or treatment of kidney disease in patients with HSP.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were identified from the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE using optimally sensitive search strategies combined with search terms for HSP.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing any intervention used to prevent or treat kidney disease in HSP compared with placebo, no treatment or other agents were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Ten studies (1230 children) were identified. There was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease at six months (3 studies, 379 children: RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.11) and 12 months (3 studies, 498 children: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.62) in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of HSP compared with placebo or supportive treatment. In children with severe kidney disease, there was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease with cyclophosphamide compared with supportive treatment (1 study, 56 children: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.78) and with cyclosporin compared with methylprednisolone (1 study, 19 children: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06).

Authors' Conclusions

Data from RCTs for any intervention used in improve kidney outcomes in children with HSP are very sparse except for short-term prednisone. There was no evidence of benefit of prednisone in preventing serious long-term kidney disease in HSP.

### Therapeutic advances in the treatment of vasculitis [^111tCrJ4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

HSP IgA vasculitis (Henoch–Schönlein purpura)

IgA vasculitis is the new term for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), and is the commonest systemic vasculitis in childhood. For the purposes of this review, however, we will use the term HSP since that is the term used in the paediatric classification criteria, and the one most paediatricians are familiar with. It is defined in the latest Chapel Hill nomenclature (2012) as: vasculitis with IgA1-dominant immune deposits affecting small vessels (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles); often involving skin, gastrointestinal tract and frequently causes arthritis; and associated with glomerulonephritis which is indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy. Classification criteria (Ankara 2008) are: palpable purpura in a predominantly lower limb distribution with at least 1 of 4 of: diffuse abdominal pain; any biopsy showing IgA deposition (mandatory criterion if rash is atypical); arthritis and/or arthralgia; haematuria and/or proteinuria. HSP has a variable and often relapsing course without specific laboratory findings, with a third of children having symptoms up to two weeks; another third up to 1 month; and recurrence of symptoms within 4 months of resolution in the remaining third. Henoch–Schönlein nephritis (HSN) accounts for 1.6–3% of all childhood cases of end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in the UK. Generally speaking, HSP is a more severe illness in adults than in children.

Therapeutic advances

There is a very poor evidence base to guide the management of HSP, particularly for those with the severe forms of HSP nephritis (HSPN), and thus very few true therapeutic advances. Early morbidity in the disease is due to GI involvement; late morbidity and the most important overall determinant of poor outcome is renal involvement. In children the management of HSP is mainly conservative because the extra renal manifestations are usually self-limited. Arthritis responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Severe skin lesions and gastrointestinal involvement could require a short course of an oral corticosteroid. Controlled studies have shown that corticosteroids do not prevent renal disease. Despite that, patients with severe renal involvement usually do require corticosteroids combined with other immunosuppressive agents, and sometimes anti-proteinuric and antihypertensive agents.

### Interventions for preventing and treating kidney disease in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) [^1169zjMc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood but may occur in adults. This small vessel vasculitis is characterised by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis or arthralgia and kidney involvement. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of different agents (used singularly or in combination) compared with placebo, no treatment or any other agent for: (1) the prevention of severe kidney disease in patients with HSP without kidney disease at presentation; (2) the prevention of severe kidney disease in patients with HSP and minor kidney disease (microscopic haematuria, mild proteinuria) at presentation; (3) the treatment of established severe kidney disease (macroscopic haematuria, proteinuria, nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome with or without acute kidney failure) in HSP; and (4) the prevention of recurrent episodes of HSP-associated kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 13 July 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions used to prevent or treat kidney disease in HSP compared with placebo, no treatment or other agents were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Thirteen studies (1403 enrolled patients) were identified. Risks of bias attributes were frequently poorly performed. Low risk of bias was reported in six studies (50%) for sequence generation (selection bias) and in seven (58%) for allocation concealment (selection bias). Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and of outcome assessment (detection bias) was at low risk of bias in three studies. Five studies reported complete outcome data (attrition bias) while eight studies reported expected outcomes so were at low risk of reporting bias. Eight studies evaluated therapy to prevent persistent kidney disease in HSP. There was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease any time after treatment (5 studies, 746 children: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32), or at one, three, six and 12 months in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of HSP compared with placebo or supportive treatment. There were no significant differences in the risk of persistent kidney disease with antiplatelet therapy in children with or without kidney disease at entry. Heparin significantly reduced the risk of persistent kidney disease by three months compared with placebo (1 study, 228 children: RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.55); no significant bleeding occurred. Four studies examined the treatment of severe HSP-associated kidney disease. Two studies (one involving 56 children and the other involving 54 adults) compared cyclophosphamide with placebo or supportive treatment and found no significant benefit of cyclophosphamide. There were no significant differences in adverse effects. In one study comparing cyclosporin with methylprednisolone (15 children) there was no significant difference in remission at final follow-up at a mean of 6.3 years (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.54). In one study (17 children) comparing mycophenolate mofetil with azathioprine, there was no significant difference in the remission of proteinuria at one year (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.03). No studies were identified which evaluated the efficacy of therapy on kidney disease in participants with recurrent episodes of HSP.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no substantial changes in conclusions from this update compared with the initial review. From generally low quality evidence, we found no evidence of benefit from RCTs for the use of prednisone or antiplatelet agents to prevent persistent kidney disease in children with HSP. Though heparin appeared effective, this potentially dangerous therapy is not justified to prevent serious kidney disease when fewer than 2% of children with HSP develop severe kidney disease. No evidence of benefit has been found for cyclophosphamide treatment in children or adults with HSP and severe kidney disease. Because of small patient numbers and events leading to imprecision in results, it remains unclear whether cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil have any roles in the treatment of children with HSP and severe kidney disease.

Introduction

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by non-thrombocytopenic purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. It affects approximately 1 in 5000 children annually and accounts for about half of all childhood vasculitides in the United States. Typically, HSP is self-limited requiring only supportive care, but more severe cases may require corticosteroid (CS) treatment. Rarely, a subset of these patients has persistent rash, arthritis, abdominal involvement, or renal disease despite treatment with CS, or has disease recurrence on CS tapering. Frequency of disease relapse is not well-documented in children, but may be as high 30–40%, often occurring within 1–2 months following diagnosis. CS remains the standard treatment for symptomatic HSP. A small subset of patients are unable to wean off CS and subsequently require long term CS or additional steroid-sparing agents for disease control.

### Different histological classifications for Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: which one should be used? [^113Y2TjH]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 5
Use of the ISKDC, the Oxford and other histological classifications for HSPN in different continents

The correlation between clinical aspects and histopathologic findings in HSPN has been the subject of several studies. Firstly, it was found that the presence, type and number of glomerular crescents in a biopsy specimen has a large role in the prognostic process, detecting a poorer outcome in patients with more than 50% of crescents, which was the basis for forming the ISKDC classification. However, as noted above, other studies did not confirm this finding, perhaps due to an uneven distribution of crescents, too small biopsy specimen, the possibility of spontaneous healing of histological lesions or the fact that patients with crescents were treated more aggressively. Tubulointerstitial lesions were found to positively correlate with a more severe outcome. Furthermore, chronic lesions alongside acute lesions were identified as predictors of poor prognosis, where the total biopsy score acquired with the modified SQC differentiated patients with a score of ≤ 10 points as patients with a favorable outcome and with a score of ≥ 11 as patients with a greater risk of renal deterioration.

What are the problems with the existing classifications of HSPN?

It is necessary to point out several issues regarding the existing classifications of HSPN. Of all the classifications most commonly used in clinical practice as well as for research purposes, it is not known which one predicts the renal outcome in IGAV/HSP and has the strongest association with unfavorable outcome. There are no studies that compare all the most frequently used classifications. This certainly has implications for defining the standardised management since histology is an important point in deciding whom to treat and with which medications. Lupus nephritis is, like HSPN, another inflammatory renal disease, but here the treatment strategies are based on histological classification. This is possible since the classification system in use is associated with severity of renal disease and renal outcome. Although the evidence for treatment of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis is limited and there is a need for further research, representative rheumatologists and nephrologists managed to reach a consensus.

### IgA vasculitis (henoch-Shönlein purpura) in adults: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects [^116LY648]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is an immune complex vasculitis affecting small vessels with dominant IgA deposits. Clinical manifestations mainly involve cutaneous purpura, arthralgias and/or arthritis, acute enteritis and glomerulonephritis. IgA vasculitis is more common among children than adults, with more severe disease in adults. Gastrointestinal and renal involvements represent the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in adults. Factors associated with long-term end-stage renal disease (ESRD) include baseline renal function impairment and baseline proteinuria > 1 or 1.5 g/day, and on renal biopsy degree of interstitial fibrosis, sclerotic glomeruli and fibrinoid necrosis. Management of IgA vasculitis in adults is rendered difficult for clinicians because of the absence of correlation between initial presentation and long-term renal outcome, and the possible occurrence of spontaneous remission in patients with severe presentation or, in contrast, possible evolution to ESRD in patients with mild symptoms. Treatment is often symptomatic because disease course is usually benign. Treatment of severe involvement, including severe gastrointestinal complications or proliferative glomerulonephritis, remains controversial, with no evidence that corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents improved long-term outcome. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials are thus needed to analyze the benefit-risk ratio of such treatments.

### Addition of cyclophosphamide to steroids provides no benefit compared with steroids alone in treating adult patients with severe henoch schönlein purpura [^116hUxVh]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Henoch Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is a common disease in children, usually associated with a good prognosis. In adults there are no prospective studies concerning its prognosis or treatment, especially in cases of severe visceral involvement. Here we compared steroid therapy without or with cyclophosphamide co-treatment in adults with severe HSP in a 12-month, multi-center, prospective, open-label trial that treated 54 adults with biopsy-proven HSP including proliferative glomerulonephritis and severe visceral manifestations. All received steroids; however, 25 were randomized to also receive cyclophosphamide. The primary endpoint that occurred in three patients in each group was complete disease remission defined as zero on the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score with no persistent or new clinical and/or biological vasculitis at 6 months. No patient had active visceral involvement. The secondary endpoints were renal outcome, deaths, and adverse events at 12 months. Renal function, proteinuria, safety data, incidence of diabetes, and severe infections were similar between the two groups. At the last follow-up, renal function remained stable. The small population size of our study does not permit definitive conclusions; however, we suggest that treatment of adults with severe HSP by adding cyclophosphamide provides no benefit compared with steroids alone.

### Successful outcome using rituximab as the only immunomodulation in henoch-schonlein purpura: case report [^111d3mCd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

In the current report, we describe a patient with moderate nephritis and severe skin Henoch Schönlein purpura (HSP) who has been treated with rituximab. Complete and sustained skin and renal remission resulted from the treatment. Thus, further studies are required to confirm the efficacy of rituximab as first-line treatment in HSP, and it might be an interesting new therapeutic option.

### Rituximab treatment for chronic steroid-dependent henoch-schonlein purpura: 8 cases and a review of the literature [^113pWkD5]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, RTX effectively reduced the number of hospital admissions and oral CS burden in children with less severe refractory HSP. RTX also helped most all children achieve clinical remission. RTX appears to be an effective and safe alternative for less severe but chronic CS dependent and immunomodulatory refractory childhood HSP. Future studies are needed to determine treatment initiation and duration recommendations.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^116qEfca]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this case series, we describe 6 patients meeting the classification criteria for HSP, who developed prolonged and relapsing symptoms and were successfully treated with azathioprine. None of these patients had classic renal involvement. The duration of treatment with azathioprine ranged from 7 to 21 months without a relapse of disease after discontinuing treatment.

The course of HSP is usually benign and self-limited, with only 1/3 of patients having recurrent disease. Since the disease is usually self-limited, typically no treatment is warranted. In the absence of renal disease, the initial episode usually lasts approximately 1 month. Recurrence of disease occurs most commonly in patients with nephritis or more severe symptoms at presentation. Treatment with glucocorticoids offers quick symptomatic relief and shortens the severity and duration of gastrointestinal, joint, and cutaneous symptoms Steroids are often used successfully in patients with limited oral intake due to their abdominal symptoms, a painful rash, or difficulty ambulating. However, treatment with glucocorticoids is controversial, as they do not appear to alter or improve the final outcome, including renal disease. There are currently no established evidence-based recommendations for glucocorticoid use in HSP, although they are often used in clinical practice.

Management options for recalcitrant disease that is poorly responsive to steroids or is steroid-dependent have not been defined, and only a few case series of patients managed with other medications have been reported. Azathioprine has been used with corticosteroids or other agents in cases of HSP nephritis (Table 2). Results were encouraging as this combination seemed to improve the clinical course of the nephritis, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed. Only one case of hemorrhagic bullous cutaneous HSP successfully treated with azathioprine has been reported in the literature. In addition, azathioprine has been used in cases of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition that histologically resembles HSP. Expert opinion favors the use of colchicine or dapsone as first line treatment for cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis. Efficacy of those agents is questionable, as the recommendations are based on case reports, while a randomized controlled trial failed to show efficacy of colchicine. Azathioprine is recommended as second line treatment by most authors for the treatment of cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis.

### Plasma exchange therapy for severe gastrointestinal involvement of henoch schönlein purpura in children [^115xVSJU]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this report is to evaluate the plasma exchange as a choice for the management of life-threating gastrointestinal system (GIS) involvement in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) when refractory to conventional therapies.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of HSP patients who had plasma exchange therapy due to massive GIS involvement. We reported age, gender, initial HSP presentation, etiological or triggering factors and disease course. Treatment modalities, side effects and their outcomes were noted.

Results

We reported 7 cases of childhood HSP with severe gastrointestinal involvement refractory to common immunosuppression with systemic steroid and cytotoxic therapy. All patients gave inadequate response to pulse methyl prednisolone or oral prednisolone therapy with ongoing GIS bleeding and severe abdominal pain. Therefore, pulse cyclophosphamide was added to the treatment. Two patients received additional intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Gastrointestinal manifestations continued and plasma exchange was performed. All patients improved after plasma exchange treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment of GI involvement in HSP with plasma exchange has been mainly based on case reports. According to our data, we propose that, plasma exchange may be a safe and efficient management choice in paediatric HSP patients with massive GIS involvement that are refractory to other therapies.

### Hemoperfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins for refractory gastrointestinal involvement in pediatric Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^111Gmpmn]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, unfavorable outcomes of GI involvement are also accompanied with limited therapy choices. To date, the mainstay of HSP management is generally supportive and symptomatic, like relief of pain, adequate hydration and full rest. Glucocorticoids are the most commonly used medicines when severe abdominal pain and joint symptoms exist. Evidence showed that early use of glucocorticoid benefits for controlling GI symptoms, but it does not appear to otherwise impact the clinical course. Moreover, there's still a part of HSP patients with refractory GI symptoms failed to achieve remission even by using glucocorticoid. Immunosuppressants, immunoglobulin G, hemoperfusion and other second-line therapies would then be considered. There is currently no consensus for the treatment of these patients. In another way, there's few guidelines or high-quality evidence on the management of steroid-resistant or dependent HSP with refractory GI symptoms, which were only mentioned in five series of small-sized studies. In 2013, the Chinese guidelines put forward that intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) and hemoperfusion (HP) might have beneficial effects on severe HSP during the acute phase with weak evidence support (Evidence grade V/E). Actually, based on several reports, compared with steroid and immunosuppressive agents, IVIG and HP are free of long-term side effects, which are preferred in patients with steroid-resistant or dependent GI complications in some centers. Furthermore, these therapies may especially suitable for those who are unable to intake medicine and food orally because of severe GI symptoms.

Given the obscure evidence of both IVIG and HP therapies, the aim of the study was not only to conclude the clinical features and outcomes of a large group of pediatric HSP patients with refractory GI symptoms but also compare the efficacy of IVIG and HP therapies in this population.

Evidence synthesis

A systematic literature review was performed with predefined criteria. Questions about interventions were framed in Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format. The population were children and young people (aged < 18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of IgAV. The intervention was a classification tool, monitoring or therapeuticmanagement. The comparison was any intervention compared with another. The outcome was related to the diagnosis, complications, duration or severity of symptoms. General concepts were used for the population ("pediatric", "paediatric", "child", "adolescen") and disease ("immunoglobulin A vasculitis", "IgA vasculitis", "IgAV", "Henoch Schonlein purpura", "HSP"). Concepts were combined using Boolean operators (AND, OR and NOT). Three bibliographic databases were searched; Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The process was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic reviews of interventions. The results were merged, and duplicates were removed. The articles were independently screened and for full-text review according to the eligibility criteria (table 2). Two members synthesised the literature and discussed areas of disagreement. Searching of reference lists was permitted. An evidence table and a narrative summary were produced.

Table 2
Eligibility criteria for the literature search

Generation and grading of recommendations

During the process of achieving group agreement, discussions took into account existing clinical practice and national or international guidelines were evidence was limited or lacking. The modified Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the strength of the recommendation, with grade 1 being a strong recommendation (depicted by 'we recommend'), and grade 2 being a weaker recommendation (depicted by 'we suggest'). The quality of evidence was graded A–D with grade A being high-quality evidence, grade B moderate-quality, grade C low-quality evidence from observational studies, or controlled trials with very serious limitations, grade D evidence was generally case studies or expert opinion. Studies were downgraded if there was evidence of bias, indirectness, imprecision or inconsistency of results and the strength of the recommendation could be adjusted taking into context of the balance of benefit or harms to patients. The final draft underwent a period of 4 weeks of open consultation prior to final endorsement.

Commentary notes that high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial in children, that cyclophosphamide is the only other agent with evidence of benefit based on a single RCT, and that cyclosporine may be effective for heavy proteinuria though long-term outcomes are not better than high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and nephrotoxicity limits its use.

### Different histological classifications for Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: which one should be used? [^116ojwP7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nephritis is the most important chronic complication of IgA Vasculitis (IgAV)/Henoch-Schönlein purpura (IGAV/HSP) and thus the main prognostic factor of this most common childhood vasculitis. Since the prognosis and treatment selection depends on the mode of interpretation of biopsy material, in this manuscript we have presented several issues related to the uneven application of different histological classifications in IgAV/Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN). The nephritis of IgAV/IGAV/HSP will be abbreviated as HSPN for this paper.

Main Body

In clinical practice we use different histological classifications for HSPN. It is not known which of these classifications best correlates with severity of renal disease and renal outcome in IgAV/IGAV/HSP. One of the major problem with existing histological classifications is that there is no consensus on the implementation of biopsy in the treatment of HSPN. There is a histologic classification system conventionally used in HSPN, of the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC). On the other hand there is the new classification system suggested for IgA nephropathy, the Oxford classification. The latter has been validated only in IgA nephropathy. There are also two further histologic classifications of Haas and Koskela that have been developed. Current treatment strategies in HSPN are not standardised nor predominantly based on histological classification.

Conclusion

One of the possible solutions to problems related to the application of different histological classification in HSPN is the implementation of multicenter multinational prospective studies with joint collaboration between pediatric rheumatologists, nephrologists and nephropathologists to correlate the clinical features and outcome with the classification systems as well among the classifications. This classification should be the basis for the construction of guidelines for the treatment of patients with HSPN.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^1155jYKe]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Although Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) can occur at any age from infancy to adulthood, it is overwhelmingly a disease of childhood. Indeed, HSP is the most common vasculitis syndrome affecting children. The clinical features of HSP have been well documented, and the diagnosis is generally not difficult. However, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of HSP. This article briefly reviews the clinical aspects of HSP and new information concerning therapy. The major focus of this review is recent information concerning abnormalities of immunoglobulin A1 glycosylation and the role of aberrantly glycosylated immunoglobulin A1 in the pathogenesis of HSP.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^112Qmv9x]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in children. The peak incidence is 3 to 10 years of age. The disease is characterized by the tetrad of palpable purpura, arthritis/arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal manifestations. Most cases recover spontaneously, and care is usually supportive, including bed rest, hydration, and pain relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen. Although corticosteroid use is controversial, it may result in accelerated resolution of symptoms; however, long-term use is usually limited due to adverse events. Rarely, a subset of these patients has persistent rash, arthritis or abdominal involvement despite treatment with glucocorticoids or has recurrent disease during glucocorticoid tapering. There is a paucity of literature regarding therapy of such recalcitrant patients without renal involvement, although there are a handful of case reports using methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, azathioprine, colchicine and dapsone. In this case series, we report the successful use of azathioprine as a disease modulator in 6 patients (Table 1) with recalcitrant disease, without significant renal involvement, from two academic medical centers.

### A case of henoch-schonlein purpura with dilated coronary arteries [^116ZJNfe]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) is one of the most common vasculitides of childhood, with an incidence of 10–20 cases per 100,000 children. It occurs most often between the ages of three and 15 years old. HSP is more common in males than females and occurs most often between autumn and spring, frequently following an infectious trigger such as beta-hemolytic streptococcus. The pathogenesis is thought to involve a dysregulated immune response that results in an inflammatory state with IgA and C3 deposition in small vessel walls.

Clinical criteria for diagnosis, as defined in 2006 by the European League Against Rheumatism and the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society, requires palpable purpura along with one of the following: predominant IgA deposition on biopsy, arthritis or arthralgia, renal involvement (hematuria/proteinuria), or abdominal pain. The diagnosis can be made on history and physical exam alone, as no specific laboratory test or imaging is diagnostic.

Apart from management of glomerulonephritis when present, treatment is focused on supportive care with occasional use of steroids for severe intestinal involvement or persistent arthritis. Mortality is less than 1% with long-term outcomes dependent on the extent of kidney involvement.

Few reports of HSP with cardiac involvement are described in children and none with coronary artery dilation. Rather, Kawasaki Disease (KD) is the most common cause of acquired cardiac disease in children in the developed world. Diagnosis of KD is characterized by 5 days of fever, and four criteria among: bilateral conjunctival injection, oropharyngeal mucous membrane changes, peripheral extremity changes, polymorphous rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy > 1.5 cm. Up to 25% of untreated patients develop coronary artery aneurysms, although the mechanism is unknown. Incomplete, or "atypical" KD, which presents with 5 days of fever but less than four of the above criteria, can also result in coronary involvement and is often an elusive diagnosis. Surveillance of coronary arteries is standard of care, with serial echocardiograms performed during the acute and convalescent phases. Treatment of coronary involvement in the acute phase often includes high-dose aspirin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or infliximab. Coronary dilation can also be seen in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA); however, unlike KD, the dilation is not usually treated and tends to self-resolve.

While reported in KD and SJIA, there have been no reports of dilated coronaries in HSP. Here, we present the first reported case of HSP with dilated coronary arteries.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^116toH9h]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

While HSP is typically a self-limited disease, our cases all demonstrated persistent or recurrent symptoms. It is unlikely the resolution of symptoms in these patients was simply due to the natural course of the disease and was more likely due to the effects of azathioprine. Azathioprine appeared to be an effective steroid-sparing medication, allowing all steroid-dependent patients to be successfully tapered off of steroids. No official guideline is available for treatment duration, and this case series does not establish the optimal duration of azathioprine treatment. However, once symptoms are controlled, it appears that discontinuation of therapy may be attempted empirically after complete disease remission has been achieved for 6–15 months.

Our experience with the use of azathioprine has also been favorable in 4 additional cases not reported here. These include 2 cases with persistent skin and renal disease responding to treatment but without enough follow up time, one case of relapsing skin disease responsive to treatment with azathioprine but without significant follow up time to be reported, and one patient with relapsing skin disease and renal involvement in which azathioprine successfully achieved remission. Only in one case with persistent skin and renal involvement did azathioprine 1 mg/kg fail to achieve renal symptom control and was discontinued within 2 months.

In summary, this case series demonstrates improved symptom control, steroid-sparing effect, and induction of remission with azathioprine in patients with recalcitrant HSP without renal disease. No patient had any adverse events associated with azathioprine therapy. Randomized controlled trials comparing the different therapeutic options for these type of patients are needed in the future.

### A case of henoch-schonlein purpura temporarily improved by hemodialysis [^1149Qs4g]. The Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

We report a case of Henoch-Schonlein purpura that occurred in an adult patient with end-stage renal disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). The patient's skin lesions clearly decreased in number during HD, but not during CAPD. This finding has not been previously reported.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether steroids reduce the incidence and severity of nephropathy in henoch-schonlein purpura (HSP) [^115kzQTm]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term prognosis of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is predominantly determined by the extent of renal involvement. There is no consensus as to whether treatment with prednisolone at presentation can prevent or ameliorate the progression of nephropathy in HSP.

Methods

Children under 18 years of age with new-onset HSP were randomly assigned to receive prednisolone or placebo for 14 days. The primary outcomes were (a) the presence of proteinuria at 12 months (defined as urine protein: creatinine ratio (UP: UC) > 20 mg/mmol) and (b) the need for additional treatment (defined as the presence of hypertension requiring treatment or renal biopsy anomalies or the need for treatment of renal disease) during the 12 month study period.

Results

352 children were randomised. Of those patients with laboratory UP: UC results available at 12 months, 18/123 (15%) patients on prednisolone and 13/124 (10%) patients on placebo had UP: UC > 20 mg/mmol. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with UP: UC > 20 mg/mmol at 12 months between the treatment groups (OR (prednisolone/placebo) = 1.46, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.14, n = 247), even after adjusting for baseline proteinuria and medications known to affect proteinuria (adjusted OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.82, n = 247). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the time needed for additional treatment between the two groups (hazard ratio (HR) (prednisolone/placebo) = 0.53, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.59, n = 323).

Conclusions

This is the largest trial of the role of steroids in children with HSP. We found no evidence to suggest that early treatment with prednisolone reduces the prevalence of proteinuria 12 months after disease onset in children with HSP.

### Vasculitis: kids are not just little people [^1142YCbS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Cutaneous vasculitis, inflammatory destruction of blood vessels, can present with a wide range of clinical and pathologic findings across a number of heterogeneous conditions. Although some vasculitides are present in both children and adults, some important differences exist in clinical presentation, etiology, management, and prognosis in childhood vasculitis versus adult vasculitis. Cutaneous vasculitis is rare in children, and most childhood vasculitides, of which Henoch-Schönlein purpura is the most common, histologically are small vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In children, infectious etiologies are more common than in adults. Childhood cutaneous vasculitis is most often self-limited with a good prognosis, and treatment is mainly supportive. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Corticosteroids may improve clinical outcomes during hospitalization for Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^112uZaRo]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the effect of corticosteroid exposure on clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with new-onset Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP).

Patients and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children discharged with an International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification code of HSP between 2000 and 2007 by using inpatient administrative data from 36 tertiary care children's hospitals. We used stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the relative effect of time-varying corticosteroid exposure on the risks of clinical outcomes that occur during hospitalization for acute HSP.

Results

During the 8-year study period, there were 1895 hospitalizations for new-onset HSP. After multivariable regression modeling adjustment, early corticosteroid exposure significantly reduced the hazard ratios for abdominal surgery (0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17–0.91]), endoscopy (0.27 [95% CI: 0.13–0.55]), and abdominal imaging (0.50 [95% CI: 0.29–0.88]) during hospitalization.

Conclusions

In the hospital setting, early corticosteroid exposure was associated with benefits for several clinically relevant HSP outcomes, specifically those related to the gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease.

### A case series on recurrent and persisting IgA vasculitis (henoch schonlein purpura) in children [^113VoUFJ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The current case-series has identified areas of unmet needs in children with recurrent or persisting IgAV. This includes a long wait from presentation to diagnosis and treatment, lack of evidence regarding treatment choices in this population, and a high disease-burden. Further research and high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed to further assess children with an atypical IgAV disease course.

### Azathioprine therapy for steroid-resistant Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a report of 6 cases [^116RnEuD]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A small percentage of children with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) develop a chronic form of the disease that often requires prolonged corticosteroid therapy. Disease modifying anti-rheumatic agents (DMARDs) or biologics have been successfully used to treat those refractory cases. Azathioprine is a DMARD that has been reported to be effective in HSP nephritis and in adult cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, a condition with cutaneous histology similar to HSP.

Case Presentation

A description of 6 cases with relapsing HSP without significant renal involvement, treated with azathioprine are reported. All 6 cases met the classification criteria for the diagnosis of HSP, had relapsing symptoms despite corticosteroid use, were successfully treated with azathioprine and were tapered off of corticosteroids. The duration of azathioprine therapy ranged from 7–21 months and no adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Azathioprine is effective in controlling prolonged relapsing symptoms of HSP, allowing earlier discontinuation of corticosteroids. This report shows that azathioprine can be included in the therapeutic options for relapsing HSP and is the first case series in the literature of azathioprine use in HSP without significant renal involvement.

### European consensus-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of immunoglobulin A vasculitis-the SHARE initiative [^113BsLP6]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

IgA vasculitis (IgAV, formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is the most common cause of systemic vasculitis in childhood. To date, there are no internationally agreed, evidence-based guidelines concerning the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of IgAV in children. Accordingly, treatment regimens differ widely. The European initiative SHARE (Single Hub and Access point for paediatric Rheumatology in Europe) aims to optimize care for children with rheumatic diseases. The aim therefore was to provide internationally agreed consensus recommendations for diagnosis and treatment for children with IgAV.

Methods

Recommendations were developed by a consensus process in accordance with the EULAR standard operating procedures. An extensive systematic literature review was performed, and evidence-based recommendations were extrapolated from the included papers. These were evaluated by a panel of 16 international experts via online surveys and subsequent consensus meeting, using nominal group technique. Recommendations were accepted when ⩾80% of experts agreed.

Results

In total, 7 recommendations for diagnosis and 19 for treatment of paediatric IgAV were accepted. Diagnostic recommendations included: appropriate use of skin and renal biopsy, renal work-up and imaging. Treatment recommendations included: the importance of appropriate analgesia and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use and non-renal indications for CS use, as well as a structured approach to treating IgAV nephritis, including appropriate use of CS and second-line agents in mild, moderate and severe disease along with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and maintenance therapy.

Conclusion

The SHARE initiative provides international, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of IgAV that will facilitate improvement and uniformity of care.

### Stenosing ureteritis in a 7-year-old boy with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: a case report and review of the literature [^1111CKTy]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract obstruction resulting from Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is an extremely rare urologic entity. If the genitourinary system is involved, it is primarily in the form of a focal proliferative glomerulonephritis. Stenosing disease has received little attention in the literature and treatment options are limited. Despite early intervention renal loss may be inevitable.

Case Report

A 7-year-old African American male presented with renal failure secondary to bilateral sclerosing ureteritis 1 month after initial presentation with HSP. There was significant disease progression and he required multiple procedures, ultimately bilateral ureterocalycostomies and a left nephrectomy.

Discussion

HSP is an immune-mediated necrotizing vasculitis. It can affect any organ system; however, in the genitourinary system, focal proliferative glomerulonephritis is a common manifestation, occurring in 20–90% of cases [8]. Extrarenal manifestations are rare.

Conclusion

Ureteritis and obstruction may be late occurrences, but should be considered in all patients presenting with a history of HSP and new-onset flank pain, acute renal failure, or anuria. Families and patients should be counseled that renal impairment may be a consequence of stenosing ureteritis. Management of these patients can be complicated but surgical correction must be considered in the treatment algorithm once the disease has stabilized.

### Risk of long term renal impairment and duration of follow up recommended for henoch-schonlein purpura with normal or minimal urinary findings: a systematic review [^117RKV1S]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The duration of follow up to assess the risk of long term renal impairment in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) without nephritic or nephrotic syndrome or renal failure on diagnosis remains undetermined.

Aims

To undertake a systematic review of the literature to assess whether the risk of long term renal impairment without renal involvement on diagnosis could be estimated and to determine the time period when renal involvement is very unlikely after the diagnosis of HSP.

Methods

Search of studies of unselected children with HSP, and available information on urinary findings, renal involvement, and long term renal function follow up. Studies of selected children with HSP nephropathy at diagnosis were excluded.

Results

Twelve studies of 1133 children were reviewed. The follow up period ranged from 6 weeks to 36 years. Proteinuria and/or haematuria, which occurred in 34.2%, of which only one fifth were in association with nephritic or nephrotic syndrome, developed in 85% of cases within 4 weeks of the diagnosis of HSP, in 91% within 6 weeks, and in 97% within 6 months. Permanent renal impairment never developed after normal urinalysis; it occurred in 1.6% of those with isolated urinary abnormalities, and in 19.5% of those who developed nephritic or nephrotic syndrome.

Conclusion

No long term renal impairment occurred after normal urinalysis. Even if urinalysis is normal at presentation, the testing should be continued for six months. There is no need to follow up after the first six months those whose urinalysis remains normal.

### Hemoperfusion and intravenous immunoglobulins for refractory gastrointestinal involvement in pediatric Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a single-center retrospective cohort study [^114c2oi8]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

At present, the managements of refractory HSP patients remain variable, including steroid, immunosuppressants, IVIG and HP. The efficacy of steroid or various immunosuppressive agents have been explored worldwide, but IVIG or HP therapy was rarely mentioned. In 2013, Chinese guidelines put forward the role of IVIG and HP in relieving severe GI symptoms of HSP, mainly utilized in patients with steroid-resistant or -dependent severe complications, including necrotizing dermatitis, severe GI and neurological symptoms. To our knowledge, it is the first retrospective comparison of IVIG and HP therapies in HSP with refractory GI symptoms. Our results exhibited that GI symptoms were all relieved after five times of HP on average, and 82.35% were relieved after one dose of IVIG. Rises in WBC paralleled the increase risk for HSP, while both IVIG and HP were verified effective in reducing WBC significantly. However, the absence of immunological panels after treatment made it difficult for comparing immunological indexes, hence further attempt was required for comparing the immunological changes of two therapies.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of prednisone in early henoch schönlein purpura [^116g8jeX]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is the most common systemic vasculitis of childhood. There is considerable controversy over whether children with HSP should be treated with corticosteroids. The goal of this study was to investigate whether early corticosteroid administration could reduce the rate of renal or gastrointestinal complications in children with HSP.

Methods

Forty children with HSP, seen in the emergency room of a tertiary-care, paediatric centre, entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. The treatment group (n = 21) received oral prednisone, 2 mg/kg/day for one week, with weaning over a second week, while the placebo group (n = 19) received an identical appearing placebo. Co-primary outcomes were the rate of renal involvement at one year and the rate of acute gastrointestinal complications. Co-primary outcomes were analysed using Fisher's Exact test.

Results

At one year, there was no difference in the rate of renal involvement (3/21 prednisone group vs. 2/19 placebo group, P = 1.0). There was also no statistically significant difference in the rate of acute gastrointestinal complications (2/21 prednisone group vs. 3/19 placebo group, P = 0.7). Two children in the placebo group did experience intussusceptions compared with none in the prednisone group (P = 0.2).

Conclusions

Early prednisone therapy in HSP does not appear to reduce the risk of renal involvement at one year, or the risk of acute gastrointestinal complications. There may be a reduced risk of intussusception. The routine, early use of prednisone in uncomplicated HSP cannot be recommended at this time.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children: not only kidney but also lung [^115mXSKV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

HSP is one of the most common small-vessel vasculitis in children. It is generally a self-limiting disease in which the most feared complication is renal involvement.

Although rare, lung involvement in patients with HSP could be asymptomatic and should be investigated in order to diagnose potential lung involvement, due to a disease progression to a more severe clinical presentation, such as DAH. TLCO could be performed early in patients with HSP to evaluate the presence of pulmonary involvement even in the absence of symptoms, in order to perform more investigations and to begin the appropriate supportive treatment immediately. Indeed the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity tests is lower in children with HSP during the acute phase of the disease and normal during resolution of the disease.

In patients with DAH, the most common clinical findings are cough, hemoptysis, epistaxis, dyspnea, tachypnea, chest pain and shortness of breath through to acute respiratory failure that could require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Limited data are available for the prevention and treatment of lung involvement in HSP. It was observed that oral corticosteroids are not sufficient for the prevention of DAH, but they could reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. No guidelines regarding the treatment of DAH are so far available. Because of the disease progression and the common associated renal involvement, we suggest to treat every pulmonary complication with intravenous methylprednisolone, avoiding to wait an eventually life threatening complication as DAH. However, the best treatment for lung involvement in HSP is still a matter of debate and needs further researches.

Immunosuppressive treatment (azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) is indicated in presence of respiratory failure.

The limits of our article are that it is a narrative review and it is based almost on case reports or small case series. So, further multicentre studies on lung involvement in HSP are essential in order to define a diagnostic protocol, the best therapeutic strategies and their duration and the long-term outcomes.

### Incidence and risk factors for recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children from a 16-year nationwide database [^115Kng6D]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Result

Recurrent rate and incidence

We identified 1002 patients aged < 18 years with a first diagnosis of HSP (index episode; Table 1; 50.8% females). Nearly 59.5% had HSP before 6 years of age, nearly one-fifth had recurrent events (secondary HSP), and nearly 10% ≥ 3 episodes of HSP. Recurrent HSP patients were predominantly male and younger aged (second recurrent HSP episode before 6 years of age). Furthermore, the third HSP episode occurred in higher proportions of individuals aged 7–12 years.

Table 1
Henoch-Schönlein Purpura and recurrent events (N = 1002)

Abbreviations: HSP Henoch-Schönlein Purpura

The incidence of the first HSP episode was 9.61per 100,000 person-years (male incidence, 4.82; female incidence, 4.79). The highest incidence (5.45 per 100,000 person-years) of first HSP was among the youngest age group (0–6 years).

The incidence of patients with secondary (recurrent) HSP was 7.05 per 100 person-years (male incidence, 8.29; female incidence, 4.96). The highest incidence (11.03 per 100 person-years) of recurrent HSP was among the youngest age group (0–6 years), and the lowest (2.87 per 100 person-years) was among the oldest age group (13–18 years).

Average time of steroid usage

Among the 1002 HSP patients, 342 (40.8%) used steroids during the first HSP episode. The average period of steroid use during the first HSP episode was 6.90 days. Among the 77 patients with a second HSP episode, 43 (55.8%) received steroid therapy. The average period of steroid use during the second HSP episode was 10.09 days. Finally, among the 27 patients with a third HSP episode, 20 (74.1%) used steroids. The average period of steroid use during the third episode was 16.30 days. The percentage and duration of steroid use in each episode was listed in Additional file 2: Table S2.

### Clinical outcomes, when matched at presentation, do not vary between adult-onset henöch-schönlein purpura nephritis and IgA nephropathy [^112k3zGr]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Henöch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is considered a systemic form of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Although these are different pictures of a single disease, there are no studies directly comparing long-term outcomes of these two clinical entities. To clarify this, we studied 120 patients with biopsy-proven HSPN and 1070 patients with IgAN. The primary outcome was the composite of a doubling of baseline serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease, or death. Secondary outcomes included the individual renal outcomes or the rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. In the unmatched cohort, patients with HSPN had more vasculitic symptoms, more favorable histologic features, and were more commonly treated with steroids than patients with IgAN. The risk of reaching the primary outcome was significantly lower in HSPN patients than patients with IgAN (hazard ratio, 0.67). The 1:2 propensity score matching gave matched pairs of 89 patients with HSPN and 178 patients with IgAN, resulting in no differences in baseline conditions. In this matched cohort, there were no significant differences in reaching the primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups. Thus, after adjustment by propensity score matching, clinical outcomes did not differ between HSPN and IgAN, suggesting the two forms of the same disease have a similar prognosis.

### Common seasonal pathogens and epidemiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura among children [^111xBYkw]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

We included 9790 children (median age, 5 years [IQR, 4–8 years]; 5538 boys [56.4%]) hospitalized with a diagnosis of HSP between January 2015 and March 2023. Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics of Hospitalizations of Children With Henoch-Schönlein Purpura, January 2015 to March 2023

Abbreviation: NPI, nonpharmaceutical intervention.

We found a significant decrease in the incidence of HSP associated with the implementation of the SARS-CoV-2–related NPIs in March 2020 (immediate change, −53.6%; 95% CI, −66.6% to −40.6%; P < .001), followed by a significant increase after the lifting of the NPIs since April 2021 (progressive change, 37.2%; 95% CI, 28.0%-46.3%; P < .001) (Figure 1 A and Table 2). These results were similar for all age groups (≤ 5, 6–10, and 11–17 years). In comparison, the monthly incidence of acute pyelonephritis per 100 000 children (NPI implementation: –2.6; 95% CI, –6.2 to 1.0; NPI lifting: –1.6; 95% CI, –4.2 to 1.0) was stable, suggesting that the national surveillance system or hospital admission capacities did not change over the study period (Figure 1 B and Table 2).

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113eJD3b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis — cryoglobulinemia is often found in many conditions that result in vasculitis; it arises from immunoglobulins that precipitate when body temperature decreases and is associated with cold-induced urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, pernio (chilblains), Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Schamberg vasculitis (pigmented purpura), and hepatitis B and C infection. Presentations can include livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and purpura in cold-exposed areas with occasional necrosis, and in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia there is palpable purpura with petechiae of the lower extremities producing a "cayenne pepper" appearance with brawny edema of the lower legs. Classification is by immunoglobulin type; type I is usually associated with a monoclonal gammopathy (IgM > IgG > IgA or light chain).

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura: another COVID-19 complication [^112y44mr]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Whether affecting children or adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) can have multi-organ involvement mediated by an inflammatory cascade. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is one of the key components of the inflammatory cascade that can lead to endothelial injury and inflammation. IgA vasculitis or Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) has been rarely reported in the context of COVID-19. In this report, we highlight a case of HSP occurring 2 days after diagnosis of COVID-19 in a 16-year-old boy, who presented with palpable purpura of the lower extremities and buttocks, diffuse abdominal pain, hemoptysis, and hematochezia. He was treated with oral prednisolone with rapid clinical improvement.

### Different histological classifications for Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: which one should be used? [^1133BFZQ]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, limited number of children with HSPN and relatively short periods of follow-up increase the need for multicenter multinational prospective studies with joint collaboration between pediatric rheumatologists and nephrologists. It is necessary to raise awareness of the fact that IGAV/HSP can cause renal complications on the long term, even years after episode of purpura or following resolution of urinary abnormalities. Since, patients with IGAV/HSP without renal complications at diagnosis are followed by pediatric rheumatologists or nephrologists, shared efforts are needed to prevent these patients from being lost during the follow-up and to avoid overlooking the kidney disease. It is therefore very important for future studies to observe patients for a long period of time and at regular intervals to include those who have a silent and subtle, insidious progression of the disease as well as patients with relapses. Of great significance remains the need to include in studies early stage patients to detect the risk factors for progression of disease and for chronic renal failure, and to avoid confounding factors caused by treatment and selection bias by including patients with severe renal impairment. Particular attention needs to be devoted to strengthening the cooperation of pediatric rheumatologists, pediatric nephrologists and nephropathologists in different centers aiming at facilitating international exchange of knowledge and data. Consequently, it is of crucial importance that pediatric rheumatologists are also involved in validation of histological classifications in children with HSPN.

Given the fact that not insignificant proportion of the total number of patients with IGAV/HSP will develop renal impairment, we hope that the efforts for finding proper histological classification in HSPN will result in success as has been the case with lupus nephritis.

### Seizures, renal failure and acute respiratory failure: not your typical case of henoch-schonlein purpura [^1167bE8a]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 30-year-old Caucasian woman with no prior medical history presented with pedal oedema, arthralgias and abdominal pain with diarrhoea, following a respiratory infection. She had mild abdominal tenderness along with a purpuric rash on the extremities and was anaemic. Following initial workup for anaemia and rash, her condition deteriorated with renal impairment, respiratory failure and seizures necessitating ventilatory support, dialysis and steroids. Serologies were negative, and skin biopsy showed leucocytoclastic vasculitis without vascular IgA deposition, and renal biopsy showed subendothelial, mesangial deposits of IgA with C3 indicative of Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). She was treated with steroids, haemodialysis and on 6-month follow-up recovered renal function. We present the case to illustrate that HSP, though rare in adults, can present with multiorgan failure, with renal, pulmonary and central nervous system involvement, and the need for early diagnosis and prompt treatment for rapid clinical recovery.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^113UHvhR]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results: Geographic variability, gender, subspecialty, practice setting and clinical experience were all found to significantly affect the choice of treatment for HSP. Geographic location showed the greatest variability, followed by subspecialty. For example, in cases of severe gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the administration of high-dose Methylprednisolone IV at 30 mg/kg/day for three days, followed by tapering was more common in North America compared to Asia and Europe (p = 0.043). For mild GI symptoms, pediatric rheumatologists were less likely to choose NSAIDs compared to general pediatricians (p = 0.024) and preferred hydration and rest (p = 0.024). Practice setting influenced treatment choices, with hospital-based physicians favoring IV steroids for severe GI and renal involvement more than clinic-based physicians (p = 0.032). Gender was shown to have a limited impact, with minor differences noted in specific GI treatments. Clinical experience primarily affected steroid tapering duration, with more experienced physicians favoring shorter tapering periods (p = 0.03).

Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first international study to assess real-world treatment approaches to IgA vasculitis in children. The study reveals significant variability in the treatment preferences for IgAV, affected primarily by geographic location and subspecialty, with lesser contribution of clinical setting, years of practice and gender. These findings highlight the need to develop standardized, evidence-based clinical guidelines to the treatment approach for IgAV, in order to reduce variability and improve the care of children with IgA-Vasculitis.

### Successful treatment of recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in a renal allograft with plasmapheresis [^114VmqoC]. American Journal of Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Acute and severe cases of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) nephritis have been treated with plasmapheresis (PA) in both adults and children. It has been used either alone or with steroids, antiplatelets or cytoxic drugs. Generally, renal function has been shown to improve when PA is utilized. The role of PA in recurrent HSP after renal transplantation is unclear and has not been well described in the literature. We report a 29-year-old female with HSP who developed end-stage renal disease and subsequently underwent a renal transplantation with eventual loss of the allograft 5 years later due to recurrent HSP nephritis. Retransplantion was performed and the patient developed active HSP nephritis in her second allograft within a week after transplantation. In an effort to preserve her allograft, four cycles of PA were performed. Her proteinuria resolved and renal biopsies afterwards demonstrated marked reduction in mesangial IgA deposition. We conclude that PA may be useful in recurrent HSP nephritis, especially when used early. The risk of additional immunosuppression caused by PA needs to be considered. More studies need to be done to evaluate the efficacy of PA in this setting as well as to define the optimal treatment regimen.

### Interventions for preventing and treating kidney disease in IgA vasculitis [^115mjmA2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

IgA vasculitis (IgAV), previously known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is the most common vasculitis of childhood but may also occur in adults. This small vessel vasculitis is characterised by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis or arthralgia and kidney involvement. This is an update of a review first published in 2009 and updated in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of different agents (used singularly or in combination) compared with placebo, no treatment or any other agent for (1) the prevention of severe kidney disease in people with IgAV with or without kidney involvement at onset, (2) the treatment of established severe kidney disease (macroscopic haematuria, proteinuria, nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome with or without acute kidney failure) in IgAV, and (3) the prevention of recurrent episodes of IgAV-associated kidney disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 2 February 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions used to prevent or treat kidney disease in IgAV compared with placebo, no treatment or other agents were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model, and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Twenty studies (1963 enrolled participants) were identified; one three-arm study has been assessed as two studies. Nine studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation (selection bias), and nine studies were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment (selection bias). Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and outcome assessment (detection bias) was at low risk of bias in four and seven studies, respectively. Nine studies reported complete outcome data (attrition bias), while 10 studies reported expected outcomes, so were at low risk of reporting bias. Five studies were at low risk of other bias. Eleven studies evaluated therapy to prevent persistent kidney disease in IgAV with or without kidney involvement at presentation. There was probably no difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease any time after treatment (5 studies, 746 children: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32) or at one, three, six and 12 months in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of IgAV compared with placebo or supportive treatment (moderate certainty evidence). There may be no differences in the risk of any persistent kidney disease with antiplatelet therapy (three studies) or heparin (two studies) in children with or without any kidney disease at study entry, although heparin may reduce the risk of proteinuria by three months compared with placebo or no specific treatment (2 studies, 317 children: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73). One study comparing montelukast with placebo found no differences in outcomes as assessed by severity scale scores. Nine studies examined the treatment of severe IgAV-associated kidney disease. In two studies (one involving 56 children and the other involving 54 adults), there may be no differences in efficacy outcomes or adverse effects with cyclophosphamide compared with placebo or supportive treatment. In two studies, there may be no differences in the numbers achieving remission of proteinuria with intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (65 children evaluated) or tacrolimus (142 children evaluated). In three small studies comparing cyclosporin with methylprednisolone (15 children), MMF with azathioprine (26 children), or MMF with leflunomide (19 children), it is unclear whether the treatment had any effect on the numbers in remission or the degree of proteinuria between treatment groups because of small numbers of included participants. In one study comparing plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone with cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone, there may be no difference in the numbers achieving remission. One study compared fosinopril with no specific therapy and reported fosinopril reduced the number of participants with proteinuria. No studies were identified that evaluated the efficacy of therapy on kidney disease in participants with recurrent episodes of IgAV.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no substantial changes in conclusions from this update compared with the initial review or the previous update despite the addition of five studies. From generally low to moderate certainty evidence, we found that there may be little or no benefit in the use of corticosteroids or antiplatelet agents to prevent persistent kidney disease in children with IgAV in participants with no or minimal kidney involvement at presentation. We did not find any studies which evaluated corticosteroids in children presenting with IgAV and nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome, although corticosteroids are recommended in such children in guidelines. Though heparin may be effective in reducing proteinuria, this potentially dangerous therapy is not justified to prevent serious kidney disease when few children with IgAV develop severe kidney disease. There may be no benefit of cyclophosphamide compared with no specific treatment or corticosteroids. While there may be no benefit in the efficacy of MMF or tacrolimus compared with IV cyclophosphamide in children or adults with IgAV and severe kidney disease, adverse effects, particularly infections, may be lower in MMF or tacrolimus-treated children. Because of small patient numbers and events leading to imprecision in results, it remains unclear whether cyclosporin, MMF or leflunomide have any role in the treatment of children with IgAV and severe kidney disease. We did not identify any studies which evaluated corticosteroids.

### Different histological classifications for Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: which one should be used? [^113n761P]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Main text

Renal manifestations in IGAV/HSP

Renal involvement occurs in a variable proportion (20–60%) of children suffering from IGAV/HSP. Vast majority of children with IGAV/HSP (97%) develop features of renal involvement within 6 months of disease onset, but sometimes HSPN may occur later. The renal disease spectrum ranges from urinary abnormalities (including hematuria or/and proteinuria) through nephritic and nephrotic syndrome to chronic renal failure. Renal involvement is typically mild and manifested only by pathological urine findings. The greatest number of patients with HSPN, about 50% of them, develop simultaneous hematuria and proteinuria. Nephritic or nephrotic syndrome occurs in about 20% of HSPN patients. Chronic renal failure in children was noted to occur in a wide range of proportions of patients, from 1 to 15%. Patients with both nephritic and nephrotic syndrome have the highest risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD): more than 50% of them will develop long-term renal impairment, compared to about 5% of patients with urinary abnormalities (hematuria and/or proteinuria).

### Incidence and risk factors for recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children from a 16-year nationwide database [^113BaviG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common systemic vasculitis in children. The incidence of HSP in children is approximately 6–22 per 100,000 person-years, which is higher than that in adult (3.4–14.3 per 100,000 person years). Most HSP symptoms, such as temporarily palpable purpura, gastrointestinal (GI) pain, and joint pain, are self-limited; however, intestinal obstruction, central nervous system involvement, and severe nephritis can also occur. The prognosis of HSP is generally good, but recurrence is common among children (recurrence rate, 2.7%–66.2%). Various predictors for recurrence, including greater joint and gastrointestinal involvement at diagnosis, history of infection, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, steroid treatment, and renal manifestations, have been identified but they are inconsistent.

Glucocorticoids used for HSP treatment do not prevent renal disease; therefore their use is controversial. However, early treatment with glucocorticoids in HSP children may reduce the intensity or mean resolution time of joint or abdominal pain. Additionally, glucocorticoids should be tapered slowly to prevent the relapse of symptoms. Although previous literature has mainly focused on the risk factors for renal involvement and long-term complications in patients with HSP, no standard protocol or long-term follow-up studies are available to clarify the impact of steroid on the clinical course or subsequent recurrence of HSP.

Furthermore, the few studies that focused on the average time to second episode of recurrence revealed discrepant results (range, 1–13.5 months). Little is known regarding the third episode of recurrent HSP, and the long-term disease-free rate. However, these data are important in the decision making for adequate follow-up time. To clarify these aspects, data from a nationwide, population-based claims database, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), were used to investigate the mean duration between first and second HSP episodes, risk factors for recurrence, and the real-world use of steroids in patients with HSP.

### Henoch-Schönlein's purpura in adults versus children / adolescents: a comparative study [^114YvZxD]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the possible differences in etiological and clinical factors between children/adolescents (≤ 20 years) and adults (> 20 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP).

Methods

A retrospective-cum-prospective study of consecutive patients with HSP who presented to our teaching hospital over 5 years. Patients were classified as having HSP according to the criteria proposed by Michel et al and the ACR criteria.

Results

102 patients (43 of all patients being male and 59 female) were classified as having HSP; 20 of the patients were adults (mean age 32.1 ± 11.7 years) and 82 were children/adolescents (mean age 6.2 ± 2.6 years). We were unable to identify any precipitating event in 40% of the adults and 37% of the children/adolescents. The frequency of previous drug treatment and of previous upper respiratory tract infection was similar in both groups. At symptom onset, palpable purpura was the chief clinical manifestation in both groups. However, renal involvement, in all its aspects, was more frequent and severe in adults. Adults also had a higher frequency of diarrhoea (with or without occult blood) and leucocytosis, but a lower frequency of thrombocytosis. The frequency of joint manifestations, nausea, vomiting, malena/hematochezia and intussuseption was equal in both groups. Adults required more aggressive therapy, and had a longer hospital stay (10.2 vs. 4.3 days). The outcome was relatively worse in adults, with complete recovery in 18 adults (90%) compared to 81 children/adolescents (98.8%) after a mean ± SD follow up of 2.8 ± 1.7 and 2.4 ± 1.3 years, respectively.

Conclusion

In adulthood, HSP is a more severe clinical syndrome, with a higher frequency of diarrhoea and renal involvement. Adults also require aggressive treatment more frequently and have a longer hospital stay.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura complicated by cardiac involvement: case report and review of the literature [^112PNatw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Involvement of the kidneys in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) occurs in approximately 50% of patients with HSP, with varying severity. In general, disease outcome is favorable for adolescents. However, severe courses with vasculitis impairing multiple organ systems in addition to the kidney, including brain, heart, and intestine, may occur. This involvement, often manifesting more subtly, requires alertness for diagnosis and escalation of immunosuppressive therapy for treatment. We report a case of severe HSP nephritis with cardiac involvement in a young man. Cardiac involvement was noted initially on an electrocardiogram and visualized by using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. HSP remission was induced with aggressive cytotoxic therapy, consisting of cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m² every 4 weeks) in addition to high-dose prednisolone. The case presentation is followed by a review of the literature for manifestations, treatments, and outcomes in patients with HSP complicated by cardiac involvement.

### Skin rash and microscopic hematuria in a 10-year-old caucasian male [^115e7p7g]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is an acute, systemic, vasculitis with IgA-dominant immune deposits. With the emphasis on educational value of HSP, which is the most common form of vasculitis in children, we report an actual case from a 10-year-old boy.

Method

The patient presented with the chief complaint of a skin rash. His illness history, family medical history, physical examination, and relevant laboratory findings were summarized, followed by a question and possible answer format discussion.

Results and Conclusion

With the significant elevation of red blood cells in his urine and moderate to severe deposition of IgA in kidney biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with HSP nephritis. Renal symptoms, such as proteinuria and hematuria, are mostly the last to develop and determine the long-term prognosis in HSP patients. The patient is currently undergoing steroid treatment, which is the primary intervention for HSP as it spontaneously resolves in most of affected children.

BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods/design

As a diagnostic accuracy study our Petechiae in Children (PiC) study adheres to the STARD criteria for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies. The gold standard test against which our outcomes are measured is quantitative PCR (qPCR) for N. meningitidis DNA in a sterile body site (blood or CSF). Or confirmation of an invasive bacterial infection through positive culture or qPCR of a bacterial pathogen.

Study registration

The PiC study was registered at(trial registration: NCT03378258) on the 19th of December 2017. At the time of registration 24 patients had been recruited to the PiC study which opened on the 22nd of November 2017.

Objectives

The co-primary outcomes are the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) of:
POCT for (i) N. meningitidis DNA and (ii) PCT in the diagnosis of MD in children with fever and NBR
POCT for PCT in the diagnosis of Invasive bacterial infection

Secondary objectives:

### Hemorrhagic bullous lesions in Henoch-Schönlein purpura: a case report and review of the literature [^111bF7zL]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common vasculitis in childhood characterized by purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain and renal involvement. However, bullous HSP is a rare cutaneous manifestation, and a few cases have been reported.

Case Presentation

Herein, we report a 15-year-old male with bullous HSP who presented with severe abdominal pain and hemorrhagic bullous lesions over his lower extremities. He was treated with corticosteroid, after which the symptoms improved dramatically. No recurrence was noted after follow-up, though scarring was present. We also reviewed the literature related to bullous HSP and identified 39 cases, most of whom were treated with corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware of the atypical types of HSP, including bullous HSP. Most patients with bullous HSP have a good prognosis.

### Atypical presentation of Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^1172BGok]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common form of vasculitis found in the pediatric population. The most common presenting complaint for children with HSP is a purpuric rash on the lower extremities. Many other organ systems beyond the skin can be involved for children with HSP. We report a case of a 7-year-old girl with HSP who presented with status epilepticus and onset of rash 2 weeks after her initial symptoms.

### Recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura with bullous rash and pulmonary nodules [^116XYhu7]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura is an IgA-mediated leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving small vessels. It affects approximately 10–20 children per 100,000 each year, with recurrence in approximately one-fifth to one-fourth of cases. The characteristic initial presentation of palpable purpura with a lower extremity predominance is typically followed by gastrointestinal manifestations, renal involvement, and/or joint pain.

While not common, HSP can also present with bullous rash, with an estimated prevalence of less than 2% in pediatric HSP patients. Similarly rare, the prevalence of HSP with pulmonary involvement is approximately 0.8 to 5%. The combination of both bullous rash and pulmonary nodules in a single patient diagnosed with HSP has not been reported in the literature to date. Treatment with corticosteroid is effective in HSP patients with these atypical manifestations.

The prognosis of IgA vasculitis (also known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is determined by renal or other organ involvement. We conducted a retrospective study to identify the initial features of 106 children with IgA vasculitis and their association with unfavorable outcomes. Location of purpura above the waist and an altered urinalysis at diagnosis predicted a more aggressive course of disease.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in the treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ySzkF]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity was observed in certain outcomes, including urinary protein (I² = 93%) and Scr (I² = 69%). To explore the sources of heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses by type of control treatment and patient age. The results demonstrated that the efficacy of TAC in reducing urinary protein and Scr levels remained consistent across different control treatments (CTX vs. MMF) and age groups (< 8 years vs. ≥ 8 years), with no significant subgroup differences detected. These findings suggest that the observed heterogeneity is likely attributable to clinical variations such as differences in disease severity, treatment protocols, and patient characteristics across studies, rather than a true inconsistency in TAC efficacy. Clinically, this supports the robustness and generalizability of our findings, indicating that TAC may be effective across a broad range of patient populations and treatment settings. Nevertheless, future meta-regression analyses incorporating additional covariates (e.g. baseline proteinuria, TAC dosage, treatment duration) are warranted to further elucidate potential sources of heterogeneity and optimize individualized treatment strategies.

Although the funnel plot appeared symmetrical, the relatively small number of studies (n = 7) may limit statistical power, the consistent directionality of results across multiple outcomes supports a preliminary inference of tacrolimus efficacy in HSPN. Future studies with larger sample sizes are essential. The variability in study designs and quality also restricted the ability to perform detailed subgroup analyses. Additionally, the lack of long-term follow-up data limits conclusions regarding the sustained efficacy and safety of TAC in HSPN.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides the first robust evidence emphasizing TAC's superior efficacy over traditional therapies like CTX and MMF in HSPN, with a manageable safety profile. These findings suggest that TAC could be a valuable adjunct to steroids in HSPN treatment, potentially offering a more effective therapeutic option. However, further high-quality, large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are necessary to confirm these findings and establish definitive clinical guidelines for TAC use in HSPN.

Introduction: Tuberculosis is a major public health problem worldwide. It is one of the main causes of infectious disease and mortality, especially in developing countries, Peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis is the second most common presentation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children especially in developing countries, tuberculosis was found to be a triggering factor of Henoch–Schönlein purpura in paediatric patients. Traditionally, cervical lymphadenitis has been the most common site (60–80%). Given the varied differential diagnoses of lymphadenopathies in paediatrics, PTL is an ongoing challenge for a timely diagnosis and management. Here, we report an unusual case of Henoch–Schönlein purpura associated with peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis in a young Libyan female child

BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is one of the most common systemic vasculitis in childhood, which often invades the skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, joints, kidneys, a ccounting for an incidence of about 6–24/100,000 per year. HSP occurs to males more than to females, and the ratio between boys and girls is approximately 1.4:1. It is commonly observed in preschool and school-age children, and its peak incidence is observed between 2 and 6 years age-group, and 90% of the patients below10 years age. Among them, about 50 to 75% of children had GI symptoms, and may also have refractory abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and may be accompanied by complications such as intestinal obstruction, intussusception and intestinal perforation and others in some severe cases, which in turn affected the early prognosis and remains difficult to treat. About 20 to 60% of the patients have renal involvement, which is known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), and the severity of renal involvement affects the long-term prognosis of children with HSP. The manifestations of HSPN vary from asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria to nephritis syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renal biopsy is recommended if proteinuria occurs in children with HSPN.

After adjusting for age, gender, and medical comorbidities, increased associations of renal involvement, underlying allergic rhinitis, and longer steroid therapy with the recurrence of HSP were still noted (Table 3). At the end of the 16-year cohort, patients without allergic rhinitis had less recurrent episodes than those with underlying allergic rhinitis (89.4% and 81.9% were free of recurrence, respectively; P = 0.026; Fig. 3a). A second HSP episode occurred in 93.3% patients without renal involvement and 72.0% patients with renal involvement(Fig. 3b). Patients with only the first HSP episode were further stratified into five subgroups according to the initiation and duration of steroid therapy (Fig. 4). Percentages of patients without second HSP were 88.1% for the non-steroid group, 94.7% for the subgroup with steroid initiation within 14 days of diagnosis and steroid duration < 10 days, 85.0% for the subgroup with steroid initiation at ≥ 14 days after diagnosis and steroid duration < 10 days, 55.3% for the subgroup with steroid initiation at ≥ 14 days after diagnosis and steroid duration ≥ 10 days, and 25.0% for the subgroup with steroid initiation within 14 days of diagnosis and steroid duration ≥ 10 days (Fig. 4). Longer-term steroid use was associated with recurrent HSP regardless of early (< 14 days) or late (≥ 14 days) steroid initiation (P < 0.001, log-rank test).

### Effect of intraocular anti-VEGF on cystoid macular edema associated with henoch-schonlein purpura-a case report [^111G4DE7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To report a bilateral cystoid macular edema associated with Henoch-Schonleinpurpura.

Case presentation

A 21-year-old man presented a bilateral, painless, and bilateral blurred vision for 5 weeks with visual acuity (VA) of 6/12 on the right eye and 6/48 on the left. FA and OCT showed bilateral cystoid macular edema, and the fundus photograph showed retinal hemorrhages. Using intravenous dexamethasone could reduce macular edema, but it reoccurred shortly after switching to oral prednisone. Repeated intraocular injection of anti-VEGF in both eyes was performed and VA improved to 6/6 on the right eye and 6/7.5 on the left with the regression of edema after 6 months follow-up.

Conclusions

Intraocular anti-VEGF might be an alternative choice to glucocorticoid in cases of bilateral cystoid macular edema associated with Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

Table 4
Previously published cases treated with RTX for severe refractory HSP

CS corticosteroid, GI gastrointestinal, HSP Henoch-Schonlein purpura, RTX rituximab

Since that first report, others have reported on the use of RTX treatment for chronic HSP (Table 4). In 2011, Pillebout et al. reported a successful outcome using RTX as the only immunomodulation in a 22-year-old patient who had severe recurrent skin manifestations and HSP nephritis (HSPN) on renal biopsy. In 2013, Kostik et al. reported a case of 7-year-old girl with a severe relapsing HSP who presented initially with skin and gastrointestinal symptoms and responded to CS, heparin, and plasma exchange, but later had HSPN WHO type IV, refractory to CS, CTX, MMF, low molecular weight heparin, and dypiridamol. The patient then dramatically responded to RTX and was able to taper CS, requiring CTX and AZA for maintenance. Unfortunately, 2.5 years later, the patient had deteriorating kidney function and subsequent treatment with RTX was not effective. Also in 2013, Tosounindou et al. reported a 61 year old female with HSP who had intractable gastrointestinal (GI) involvement treated with repeat courses of RTX used to maintain remission over 9 years. RTX use for refractory HSPN was also reported in 2013 by El-Husseini et al. in a 27-year-old man who had drug induced HSPN and had previously failed to respond to CS, CTX, and plasmapheresis. His renal and extra-renal symptoms improved after RTX treatment. Similarly, Ishiguro et al. reported a 68-year-old woman who had purpura nephritis associated with nephrotic syndrome who failed standard treatment with CS and intravenous CTX with complete remission following RTX treatment. In 2014, Pindi Sala presented a case of 49-year-old woman who developed HSP 8 years after kidney transplant for segmental glomerular hyalinosis, while being on tacrolimus and AZA. The vasculitis involved skin and the sciatic peroneal nerve branch. She was CS dependent as she had four relapses. Successful outcome was observed during two years of follow-up after RTX treatment. In 2016, Bellan et al. described a 57-year-old woman who had recurrent HSP flares and moderate proteinuria since first diagnosis 20 years prior. She had renal pathology confirming IgA nephropathy and persistent purpuric rash with proteinuria despite treatment with cyclophosphamide. She had complete remission off all medications following RTX treatments, and at time of study publication remained in remission 8 years following last RTX. While RTX use for severe refractory HSP is well-reported (Table 4), its use in children with non-life threatening HSP, but chronic CS dependent disease refractory to CS sparing immunomodulatory DMARD agents, has been less well explored.

### Treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura glomerulonephritis in children with high-dose corticosteroids plus oral cyclophosphamide [^116BHfFu]. American Journal of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP) is a common childhood vasculitis with manifestations in numerous organ systems, including glomerulonephritis. Patients with more severe HSP-associated glomerulonephritis may develop chronic renal failure. Currently, no widely accepted treatment protocols exist for patients with significant renal involvement.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical courses of 12 children (mean age 9 years) with HSP glomerulonephritis treated with high-dose corticosteroids plus oral cyclophosphamide. All patients had nephrotic-range proteinuria, and all had significant histopathologic changes on biopsy, including crescentic nephritis in 10 patients. Treatment consisted of either intravenous pulse methylprednisolone or oral prednisone followed by oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks, along with either daily or alternate-day oral prednisone. Prednisone was tapered following completion of cyclophsophamide.

Results

Serum albumin rose significantly after treatment from 2.8 ± (SD) 0.5 to 3.7 ± 0.4 g/dl (p < 0.001), and there was a concurrent reduction in proteinuria, as reflected by decreasing serial protein-to-creatinine ratios: from 6.3 ± 4.4 to 0.8 ± 0.8 (p = 0.002). Renal function remained normal in all patients. Hypertension developed during treatment in 10 patients, all but 1 of whom were normotensive at last follow-up, 35 ± 17 months following biopsy.

Conclusions

We conclude that treatment of children with HSP nephritis with high-dose corticosteroids plus oral cyclophosphamide is safe and, as in nephrotic syndrome, appears to significantly reduce proteinuria which is a known risk factor for the development of renal insufficiency in HSP. Further studies with larger numbers of patients should be conducted to confirm this finding.

### Gangrenous appendicitis in a child with henoch-schonlein purpura [^111ZyrAo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is common feature of Henoch-Schonlein purpura, which may mimic appendicitis, leading to unnecessary laparotomy. Accordingly, the diagnosis must be confirmed by ultrasonography or computed tomography scan before laparotomy is performed. The authors report a case of simultaneous occurrence of Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and gangrenous appendicitis in an 18 year-old boy. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain, cramps, and mild dehydration. He also complained of small reddish purple on his lower limbs, bilateral knee pain, low-grade fever, as well as bloody stools. The symptoms subsided completely. Eight days later, he returned with nonbloody, nonbilious emesis, abdominal cramps, and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed to rule out an intussusception but demonstrated appendiceal dilatation with a possible appendicolith without any evidence of intussusception. A laparotomy was undertaken, and appendectomy was performed for gangrenous appendicitis. Simultaneous occurrence of Henoch-Schonlein purpura and acute appendicitis is rarely observed. Clinical features of the patients may mislead the clinicians, resulting in delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. The use of ultrasonography and computed tomography scan would confirm the diagnosis before surgery.

BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, HP can reduce glucocorticoid dosage and the rate of renal involvement in children with severe HSP with GI involvement. The mechanism may be related to the fact that HP can effectively remove IL-6, TNF-α, MDA in HSP children. But the treatment of HP is costly and invasive, limiting clinical use. However, HP treatment has no obvious complications, which is one of the safe and effective methods for the treatment of severe HSP with GI involvement, especially those with GI complications, high risk of kidney involvement and restriction of glucocorticoid usage during the acute phase. Nevertheless, its long-term efficacy should be further clarified in larger sample size by prospective randomized controlled clinical trials.

Statistical analysis

Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 18.0 software for descriptive and contingency tables (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, Illinois). Pearson's chi-squared tests were used for comparisons of categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to investigate average differences in age at HSP diagnosis and/or recurrence. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios and adjust for other covariates. The event was the date of HSP recurrence. Censoring points were the end of follow-up or the date of withdrawal from the registry. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Mackay Memorial Hospital (IRB no: 17MMHIS022e).

The mean time between the first and the second HSP episodes was 9.21 months. b, among patients with second HSP, 47.0% of patients remained free of the third HSP episode. The average time from the second to the third HSP episode was 6.77 months

Influence of age, clinical course, and steroid on the incidence of secondary HSP

Table 2 lists the hazard ratios for recurrent HSP obtained from univariate Cox proportional analysis. Compared with patients aged < 6 years, patients aged 7–12 years were more likely to have a second HSP episode. Recurrent HSP episodes were more likely to occur in those with underlying allergic rhinitis and renal involvement during the first HSP episode. Compared with patients who did not use steroids, patients who underwent steroid therapy for 14 days after the HSP diagnosis (late initiation) were more likely to have HSP recurrence. Furthermore, patients who used steroids for > 10 days had a higher likelihood of experiencing a second HSP episode. Joint pain and gastrointestinal symptoms during the first HSP course were not associated with a second HSP episode. Income levels and other comorbidities had no significant impact on the incidence of secondary HSP.

### Predictive factors of relapse in adult with Henoch-Schönlein purpura [^115dNcop]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2012). Low credibility.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is an IgA-mediated small vessel vasculitis with a predominant cutaneous involvement. We assessed adult patients with HSP to identify the clinical and histopathological features and evaluate predictive factors of relapse. We reviewed the records of 29 adult patients with HSP who presented at our department between 2002 and 2009. Adult HSP was confirmed by skin biopsy showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis and direct immunofluorescence showing IgA deposit. Among the 29 patients (15 men, 14 women; mean age 36.2 years old), renal involvement was initially found in 22 patients (75.9%). They were divided into 2 groups according to the presence or absence of relapse. We compared clinical and histopathologic differences between 15 patients with relapse and 14 patients without relapse. By univariate analysis, older age at onset, persistent rash, abdominal pain, hematuria, and underlying disease at the onset of HSP are significantly related to relapse. Among the histopathological variables, severity of leukocytoclasis and absence of IgM deposit on the vessel walls are significantly associated to relapsing disease (P < 0.05). Our results are significant, because, they may help to understand the predictive factors related to relapses of HSP in adults. Further studies are necessary to identify whether more aggressive treatment in adults with HSP with these predictive factors can prevent relapse and severe renal sequelae.

Conclusions

Streptococcal infection is the most frequent trigger for childhood HSP and does not aggravate renal pathological damage; the possible elimination of streptococcal infection helps relieve the relapse/recurrence of HSP.

### Incidence and risk factors for recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura in children from a 16-year nationwide database [^111Mtu3C]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Our study showed a significantly increased association between steroid use for > 10 days regardless of early initiation and the risk of recurrence. Steroids might have some treatment effects on HSP through their anti-inflammatory ability. Although early steroid therapy can ameliorate acute abdominal symptoms and mitigate short-term morbidity, previous literature revealed conflicting results on the association between corticosteroid treatment and recurrence. Pamela et al. reported a non-significant protective effect of corticosteroids on recurrence rate. However, Trapani et al. and Calvo-Rio et al. observed an opposite finding that emphasized an increased association between early corticosteroid use and the risk of relapse. In Trapani's case series of 150 patients, steroids were prescribed only in patients with a severe presentation, including 16 patients with severe abdominal and 3 patients with severe nephropathy. Their results of increased association might be explained by the fact that patients prescribed with corticosteroids had a more severe disease manifestation, which is a risk factor for recurrence. Currently, steroid therapy is suggested only in patients with nephritis and severe GI symptoms (dosage, 1–2 mg/kg/day). One might argue that our results of elevated recurrence rates in those with steroid use for > 10 days were associated with their disease severity. However, this may only partly explain our result because not all recurrences were associated with more severe clinical courses, such as renal involvement. Shin et al. also pointed out that there is a distinct group of multiple recurrent non-renal HSP. Our findings indicate that the risk of recurrence might be associated with a longer duration of steroid use in certain patients. Thus, we hypothesized the mechanism that the longer use of steroid might indicate an "over-prescribing" of steroid, which might interfere with the clinical course, including the chance of recurrence. To date, there is no optimal recommendation for the duration of treatment. Expert opinions have suggested that steroids should be tapered slowly by < 25% per week to prevent relapse, thus, the overall duration of steroid treatment may easily exceeds 10 days and generally requires 4 weeks. Since the optimal duration and timing of steroid administration remains unanswered, further prospective randomized trials are needed to elucidate this possible underlying mechanism between longer-term steroid use and HSP recurrences.

### Recurrence and graft loss after kidney transplantation for henoch-schonlein purpura nephritis: a multicenter analysis [^112RfWsz]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The actuarial risk at 5 years for clinical recurrence of Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and graft loss caused by recurrence of -HSPN after renal transplantation was reported in 1994 to be as high as 35% and 11%, respectively. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate, in a large cohort of patients with a long-term follow-up, whether these rates have changed.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients from six transplant centers in Belgium and France with strict diagnostic criteria of HSPN and a potential post transplant follow-up of ≥ 3 years were included.

Results

Forty-three patients were included. Patient survival is excellent: 98%, 95%, and 95% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Overall graft survival rates were 84%, 66%, and 56% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Clinical recurrence in a first kidney transplant occurred in five patients. Three patients lost their first graft due to HSPN recurrence 19 to 96 months after transplantation, two of whom had systemic signs of the illness. Actuarial risk for clinical recurrence in a first graft is 2.5% and 11.5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Actuarial risk for graft loss caused by recurrence in a first graft is 2.5% and 7.5% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Severity of the disease at presentation and type of immunosuppression after transplantation did not affect recurrence.

Conclusions

We found that recurrence rates of HSPN after transplantation are lower than previously reported. The actuarial risk of graft loss from recurrence in a first graft is 7.5% at 10 years.

### Different histological classifications for Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis: which one should be used? [^113qUZqf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

An important problem of classifications for HSPN is that they have not been validated in (sufficiently large numbers of) children or have been validated only in IgA nephropathy. For example, in the recommendations for updating the Oxford Classification the working group clearly accentuated the necessity of inclusion of larger number of children to avoid inadequate statistical power due to the limited number of patients reaching end points. To date only few studies compared clinical and histological features between adults and children with HSPN, and showed that there are differences between these age groups. Although HSPN in adults is a rare disease, a recent study showed that renal pathological chronicity was more serious in adults than in children: approximately 30% of adults with HSPN develop chronic renal failure.

Findings from research on IgA nephropathy have been applied also to patients with HSPN. For instance, due to shared clinical, immunological and histological findings between the two diseases, it has been suggested that the Oxford classification can be used in classifying HSPN and it has been used in clinical practice. Although these two diseases share similar features, there are also clinicopathological differences that are not only the mere presence of extrarenal clinical signs in IGAV/HSP. The most important differences in the clinical presentation of the two diseases are age and clinical signs. While IGAV/HSP has a peak incidence in the age between 4 and 7 years, and HSPN is predominantly seen in childhood, this range for IgA nephropathy is between 15 and 30 years. HSPN patients more often present as nephrotic or nephritic syndrome, whereas in IgA nephropathy such initial presentation is rare. Furthermore, HSPN frequently has an acute onset and course while IgA nephropathy is usually chronic progressive renal disease that gradually leads to renal failure. The risk of ESRD is higher in children with HSPN than in children with IgA nephropathy. Histologically, it should be noted that necrotizing changes and fibrin deposits in the glomerulus as well as endocapillary proliferation and crescents formation are more common in HSPN than in IgA nephropathy. Pathohistological changes in IgA nephropathy are predominantly found in mesangium and gradually lead to glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. The main mechanisms of damage in HSPN are glomerular endothelial lesions that may heal or progress to fibrosis with scarring and chronic kidney damage. Although the similarities between HSPN and IgA nephropathy are numerous, differences in clinical manifestation, course of the disease and renal damage mechanisms raise the question of the efficacy of uniform treatment of these two conditions and the possibility of a different therapeutic response to the same treatment. Therefore, all classifications for IgA nephropathy need to be validated in children with HSPN if we intend to apply them in clinical practice or trials.

### Applicability of the 2006 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for the classification of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. An analysis based on 766 patients with cutaneous vasculitis [^115BKZNM]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

In 2006 the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) proposed new classification criteria for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). We aimed to establish the applicability of these criteria in patients with primary cutaneous vasculitis (CV). We also compared these criteria with previously established classification criteria for HSP.

Methods

A series of 766 (346 women/420 men; mean age 34 years) consecutive unselected patients with CV was assessed. One hundred and twenty-four of them with secondary CV or with CV associated with other well defined entities were excluded from the analysis. The 2006 EULAR criteria for HSP were tested in the remaining 642 patients with primary CV. Two sets of criteria for HSP were used for comparisons: a) the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR-1990), and b) the ACR modified criteria proposed by Michel et al. in 1992 (Michel-1992).

Results

451 (70.2%) of 642 patients were classified as having HSP according to the EULAR-2006 criteria, 405 (63.1%) using the ACR-1990 criteria, and 392 (61.1%) by the Michel-1992 criteria. However, only 336 patients (52.3%) met at the same time the EULAR-2006 and the ACR-1990 criteria, and only 229 patients (35.7%) fulfilled both the EULAR-2006 and Michel-1992 criteria. It is noteworthy that only 276 (43%) patients met the three set of criteria. Children fulfilled all the sets of criteria more commonly than adults (215 [66.6%] of 323 vs. 61 [19%] of 319, respectively; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

According to our results, the EULAR-2006 criteria show low concordance with previous sets of classification criteria used for HSP.

### Successful treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura-associated hematochezia in a child with hemophilia A: a case report [^1149HVUW]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The challenges in the hemophilic children are different from those in adults. Early and long-term prophylaxis in children with hemophilia is the most effective method of forestalling bleeding and either preventing or reducing joint damage, and increasing the patients' quality of life and life expectancy. Hemophilia A is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of coagulation FVIII. Such patients, if not optimally treated, encounter recurrent bleeding episodes causing cumulative damage and, commonly, arthropathy. Coagulation FVIII, as a coagulation replacement factor, has been used to treat and prevent hemophilia A for decades. It can prevent hemophilia A patients from bleeding symptoms, joint dysfunction and abnormal, massive postoperative bleeding caused by the disease. FVIII is an important coagulation factor in the endogenous coagulation pathway. As a cofactor of coagulation factor IXa, FVIII participates in the activation of coagulation factor X and forms an endogenous coagulation pathway. Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the serious complications of hemophilia. The most common cause of abdominal bleeding in hemophilia is gastrointestinal mucosal bleeding. Diagnostic imaging is necessary to differentiate between various causes of abdominal bleeding. At this time, prophylactic dosing is mostly based on the Swedish regimen of 25 IU/kg thrice weekly or every other day in pediatric patients.

HSP is a systemic vasculitis involving small blood vessels, most notably the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and glomeruli, accompanied by arthralgia or arthritis. While the exact cause of HSP remains unknown, several studies have reported infections and imbalance of immune and genetic factors as causes of HSP. HSP can lead to severe complications, such as intussusception, gastrointestinal bleeding, or end-stage renal disease, although it is considered a self-limiting disease. Treatment of HSP includes controlling the acute symptoms and influencing factors of prognosis, such as acute joint pain, abdominal pain and renal damage.

Symptomatic or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, such as rectal bleeding, melena, and hematemesis, is observed in 50% of children with HSP. Glucocorticoids can quickly relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and shorten the duration of abdominal pain. Corticosteroids, given early in the course of illness, seem to produce consistent benefits for gastrointestinal bleeding, in children suffering from HSP. Remarkably, our patient also had congenital malrotation of the intestine, which could increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Henoch-Schönlein purpura… [^117QXDQ3]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis that affects small blood vessels mainly in the skin, intestines, and kidneys. Symptoms can begin in children, most commonly between the ages of 4 and 7 years, soon after an upper respiratory tract infection or a streptococcalpharyngitis. Children may also develop abdominal pain that can be quite severe. Children younger than 2 years with HSP are more likely to develop edema, which is a result of leaky small blood vessels in the skin. Kidney involvement can also cause edema, hematuria, or proteinuria.

Blood tests to check the number of white blood cells, platelets, and the presence of any bacteria Abdominal ultrasound to look for intussusception Urinalysis to check for hematuria and proteinuria Stool samples to check for blood in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment Treatment is usually supportive. Unlike for other vasculitis diseases, corticosteroids have not been shown to change the disease course. However, corticosteroids may shorten the length of severe abdominal pain. Children with HSP may be hospitalized if their abdominal pain is too severe to control at home, if they have gastrointestinal bleeding, if joint pain prevents them from walking, or if their kidney function worsens with a change in urine output.

Further evaluation Although their overt symptoms usually last for 3 to 12 weeks, children diagnosed as having HSP need to be followed up by their doctor even after their symptoms have resolved. Pediatricians may ask to see these children for 3 to 6 months after their initial symptoms, more often at first. Pediatricians will check children's urine for hematuria and proteinuria until these results are normal and stable. They may also check blood pressure at these visits, since this can be affected by HSP. Topic: VASCULITIS Punnoose AR, Lynm C, Golub RM. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura. JAMA. 2012; 307:
