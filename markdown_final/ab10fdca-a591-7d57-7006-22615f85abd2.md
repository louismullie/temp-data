## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement about Hirschsprung disease is incorrect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and sex distribution. Then, I should verify the strength of association with Down syndrome. Next, I will examine the genetic architecture, especially RET's role. After that, I need to check how recurrence risk varies by segment length. Finally, I will synthesize and identify the incorrect option with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and sex ratio. Multiple sources consistently state Hirschsprung disease has a male predominance of about 4:1, which means it is more common in boys than in girls, not the other way around, so statement B claiming it is more common in girls is immediately suspect and likely incorrect.

> Wait, let me verify the Down syndrome association before I jump ahead. Several references confirm a strong association between Hirschsprung disease and Down syndrome, with Down syndrome being the most common chromosomal abnormality seen in HSCR cohorts, so statement A is correct and should not be the answer [^8ea7b3ac] [^8ea7b3ac].

> I will now examine the genetics. RET is repeatedly identified as the major susceptibility gene, with both coding and noncoding RET variants contributing to disease risk across short- and long-segment forms, and oligogenic models including RET-dependent modifiers explain much of the inheritance pattern, so statement C is accurate [^e5898225] [^683581c5].

> Next, I should review recurrence risk by segment length. Familial and population studies show that recurrence risks to siblings are substantially higher when the proband has long-segment disease compared with short-segment disease, reflecting the greater genetic load and penetrance in long-segment HSCR, so statement D is correct [^8f888c57] [^2b8880ca].

> Hold on, I should double-check that I'm not missing a nuance about sex distribution in familial cases. Even in familial cohorts, while the male-to-female ratio may be less extreme than in sporadic short-segment disease, males still predominate, and no credible source supports a female predominance in HSCR, reinforcing that statement B is the incorrect statement here [^ec585612] [^2d2842bb].

> Putting this together, statements A, C, and D are supported by the literature, whereas statement B contradicts the established male predominance and is therefore the incorrect statement. The answer is B [^2d2842bb] [^8f888c57].

---

The incorrect statement is **B. It is more common in girls than in boys**. Hirschsprung disease is **more common in boys**, with a male-to-female ratio of about 4:1, especially in short-segment disease [^2d2842bb] [^8f888c57]. Statements A, C, and D are correct: Down syndrome is the most common associated chromosomal abnormality [^2d2842bb], RET is the major susceptibility gene [^2b8880ca], and recurrence risk is higher for long-segment disease than for short-segment disease [^8f888c57].

---

## Epidemiology and sex distribution

Hirschsprung disease shows a **male predominance**, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 4:1 in short-segment disease [^2d2842bb] [^8f888c57]. This ratio approaches 1:1 in long-segment disease, but overall the disease remains more common in boys than in girls [^8f888c57]. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.

---

## Association with Down syndrome

Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the **most common chromosomal abnormality associated with Hirschsprung disease**, occurring in about 10% of patients with Hirschsprung disease [^2d2842bb] [^8ea7b3ac]. This association is well-documented and clinically significant, making statement A correct.

---

## Genetic susceptibility and RET gene

The RET proto-oncogene on chromosome 10q11 is the **major susceptibility gene** for Hirschsprung disease [^2b8880ca]. Mutations in RET, both coding and non-coding, are implicated in a significant proportion of cases, particularly in long-segment disease [^2b8880ca]. Thus, statement C is correct.

---

## Recurrence risk and segment length

Recurrence risk in Hirschsprung disease is influenced by the length of the aganglionic segment. Long-segment disease carries a **higher recurrence risk** than short-segment disease, reflecting the greater genetic burden and complexity of inheritance [^8f888c57]. Therefore, statement D is correct.

Postoperative management of Crohn's disease — implementation considerations and risk factors: Risk stratification schemes to classify patient's risk of endoscopic recurrence after surgically induced remission are not well-defined, and risk factors typically associated with risk of recurrence 6–12 months after surgically induced remission include older age at surgery (older than 50 years), nonsmoking, longstanding disease (more than 10 years), and first surgery for a short segment of fibrostenotic disease (< 10–20 cm). Risk factors typically associated with high risk of recurrence 6–12 months after surgically induced remission include 2 or more prior surgeries, penetrating or perianal disease, smoking, young age at surgery, with long segment of small bowel resection; however, these risk factors may not be additive. In patients at low baseline risk of recurrence, who are also receiving postoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis, fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g may also rule out endoscopic recurrence. Normal C-reactive protein (CRP) in asymptomatic CD in surgically induced remission is not able to rule out endoscopic recurrence accurately.

### Hirschsprung's disease in down syndrome: an opportunity for improvement… [^8ea7b3ac]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Down Syndrome is the most common abnormality associated with Hirschsprung's Disease. It has been suggested that patients with DS have worse outcomes following treatment of HD, however the literature is controversial. This study aims to compare the nationwide diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of patients with and without DS and HD. Results: There were 481 patients identified with a diagnosis of HD, of which 45 also had DS. Patients with DS were older at both the time of first rectal biopsy and time of index operation. Patients with DS were more likely to have a delayed diagnosis of HD past 30 days of life. Patients with DS patients were just as likely to undergo operative treatment for HD and there were no differences observed in the type of treatment, including stoma placement.

Overall hospital length of stay was longer in the DS cohort. Patients with DS were also more likely to have a concomitant diagnosis of a congenital cardiac defect, wound infection, necrotizing enterocolitis, as well as other infections during hospital admission. When excluding any patient with a congenital cardiac condition other than atrial/ventricular septal defect, those with DS were still more likely to have delayed HD diagnosis and experienced higher infection rates. The overall mortality rate for patients with DS was four times higher than those without DS. Conclusion: In this nationwide cohort of patients with Hirschsprung's disease, patients who also had Down Syndrome experienced delays in diagnosis, more hospital complications, and higher mortality.

These findings support earlier suspicion and diagnosis of HD in a patient population that is already know to carry a strong association with the disease. February 2022; 149:

### Fine mapping of the 9q31 Hirschsprung's disease locus [^8f888c57]. Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR; aganglionic megacolon) is a congenital disorder characterised by the absence of enteric ganglia along a variable length of hindgut. There is significant ethnic variation in the incidence of the disease, and it is most often found among Asians (2.8 per 10,000 live births; Amiel and Lyonnet; Torfs). Non-familial HSCR has a complex pattern of inheritance and manifests with low, sex-dependent penetrance and variability in the length of the aganglionic segment, according to which patients are classified into short segment (S-HSCR; 80%), long segment (L-HSCR; 15%), and total colonic aganglionosis (TCA 5%). The male:female ratio (M:F) is ≈4:1 among S-HSCR patients and ≈1:1 among L-HSCR patients. HSCR presents mostly sporadically although it can be familial (5–20% of cases), where the recurrence risks to sibs vary from 1.5 to 33% depending on the gender and the length of the aganglionic segment in the proband, and the gender of the sibling (Badner et al.).

### Segregation at three loci explains familial and population risk in Hirschsprung disease [^2b8880ca]. Nature Genetics (2002). Medium credibility.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), the most common hereditary cause of intestinal obstruction, shows considerable variation and complex inheritance. Coding sequence mutations in RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3 and SOX10 lead to long-segment (L-HSCR) and syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the transmission of the much more common short-segment form (S-HSCR). We conducted a genome scan in families with S-HSCR and identified susceptibility loci at 3p21, 10q11 and 19q12 that seem to be necessary and sufficient to explain recurrence risk and population incidence. The gene at 10q11 is probably RET, supporting its crucial role in all forms of HSCR; however, coding sequence mutations are present in only 40% of linked families, suggesting the importance of noncoding variation. Here we show oligogenic inheritance of S-HSCR, the 3p21 and 19q12 loci as RET-dependent modifiers, and a parent-of-origin effect at RET. This study demonstrates by a complete genetic dissection why the inheritance pattern of S-HSCR is nonmendelian.

### Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease: current techniques and limitations [^bfe422db]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In an aging population with a rising incidence of peripheral artery disease, endovascular therapy is a favorable alternative to open surgical bypass. As a minimally invasive approach, endovascular therapy incurs less physiologic stress and periprocedural complications. Balloon angioplasty and stenting have been the predominant tools in peripheral endovascular therapy. The mechanisms of endovascular therapy have evolved beyond pneumatic dilation and forcing plaque against vessel wall with angioplasty and stenting. Technology has broadened to adjunctive local treatments with pharmaceutical agents coating balloons or eluting from stents, atherectomy to remove intimal and medial plaque, and more recently, intravascular lithotripsy to fracture and modify plaque. These technologies have performed well in curated clinical trials and in the real world for short-segment disease. Despite the excellent outcomes of treatment for short-segment occlusive disease, post-procedural patency of endovascular treatment for long-segment, highly calcified lesions remains challenging in the femoropopliteal region. The development of drug-coated balloons and stents brings the hope of improved patency. However, the results are incrementally better at best and are not superior to surgical bypass. In addition, there is controversy regarding the long-term mortality risk. With numerous devices and techniques as well as differing magnitudes of peripheral artery disease, it will be difficult to practically have a study to answer all questions regarding endovascular treatment of the femoropopliteal artery. This review examines current endovascular techniques for de novo and recurrent femoropopliteal arterial occlusive disease, as well as the applicability of intravascular ultrasound and optimal stenting strategies for long-segment disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^8c72a87b]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 13–14 (elective segmental resection): An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of diverticulitis episodes, and a discussion of elective segmental resection for patients with a history of diverticulitis should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits, including quality of life; patients should understand that surgery reduces, but does not eliminate, diverticulitis risk, and that chronic gastrointestinal symptoms do not always improve with surgery. The benefit of an elective segmental colectomy is a reduced risk of recurrent diverticulitis and surgery can also improve a patient's quality of life, with elective resection resulting in improved quality of life at 5-year follow-up compared with conservative management; however, elective segmental colectomy does not eliminate risk, with 5-year recurrent diverticulitis rates of 15% after elective surgery versus 61% with nonoperative management. Although colectomy often does not improve ongoing symptoms, in 2 studies, 22%–25% of patients had ongoing abdominal pain after surgery, and in an observational study long-term rates of emergency surgery and/or death were low (5%) after complicated diverticulitis managed without surgery, with elective resection not associated with reduced rates of emergency surgery or death.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the management of Crohn's disease after surgical resection [^ca47defd]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline — postoperative Crohn's disease (CD) management highlights high recurrence risk and scope: Nearly one-half of patients with CD will require bowel resection within the first 10 years of disease, and one-fourth will require at least another resection within 5 years of index surgery; clinical and endoscopic recurrence can occur in the neoterminal ileum in as many as 90% of patients within 12 months of surgical resection. Endoscopic recurrence is defined as a Rutgeerts' score of ≥ i2 on ileocolonoscopy and the presence and severity of endoscopic recurrence is a strong predictor of clinical and surgical recurrence. Recommendations address postoperative pharmacological prophylaxis and endoscopic monitoring in patients with an ileocolonic anastomosis who are asymptomatic without macroscopic evidence of CD after surgical resection, and they are not applicable to patients with small-bowel anastomoses not accessible by colonoscopy, those with residual disease following surgical resection, or those with perianal disease. The AGA process for developing these guidelines follows the standards set by the US Institute of Medicine and used the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, with quality of evidence a key factor alongside the balance between benefit and harm, patients' values and preferences, and resource utilization; risk factors for postoperative recurrence include penetrating disease, cigarette smoking, and multiple prior resections.

### Risk factors for postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease with emphasis on surgical predictors [^d01c5acd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A novel technique for restoring intestinal continuity has been proposed by Kono et al. The Kono-S anastomosis is an antimesenteric, functional EEA. The principals of constructing the Kono-S configuration consist of dividing the mesentery near the bowel wall in order to have minimal devascularization and denervation, dividing the bowel with linear staplers, then suturing the stapled lines of proximal and distal stump to form a supporting column, performing a longitudinal enterotomy at the antimesenteric site in the proximal and distal segments (1 cm from supporting column) and creating the anastomosis with transverse suturing of the two compartments. Preliminary data from 187 patients in USA and Japan, with a median follow up of 32 and 65 months, respectively, indicate that this wide-lumen type of anastomosis has low recurrence rates.

To date, none of the anastomotic configurations is considered a risk factor for POR. Nevertheless, new data are needed, especially from randomized studies evaluating all kinds of anastomotic configuration, including the novel Kono-S technique.

Extent and margins of the resection

It was considered for many decades that aggressive surgery, trying to resect not only macroscopically, but also microscopically involved bowel, was fundamental for reducing POR rates. This trend had an obvious impact on the risk of short-bowel syndrome related to CD. The randomized controlled trial by Fazio et al published in 1996 was a landmark that changed the surgical practice for CD patients. Surgical recurrence was the primary endpoint for patients divided randomly into two groups: 75 patients had limited resection margins (2 cm from macroscopically diseased bowel), whereas 56 patients had wide margins (12 cm). The patients with limited resection margins did not have a significantly greater POR rate, even if histological findings demonstrated microscopic disease. At present, it is widely accepted that a clear macroscopic margin of 2 cm is adequate for patients who undergo intestinal resection.

The length of resected bowel is not consistently correlated with POR rate. The literature provides conflicting data, since some authors consider that wide resections (when necessary according to preoperative disease extent) are related with higher POR rates, whereas others do not. In spite of this inconsistency, the ECCO has declared extensive bowel resection of > 50 cm to be a predictive factor for POR.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^80b1d211]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — when to refer for surgery and common indications: Surgery may be considered for symptomatic CD localized to a short segment of bowel, and surgery is required to treat emergent complications. A resection of a segment of diseased intestine is the most common surgery for a patient with CD. Indications include intractable hemorrhage, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess, dysplasia or cancer, or medically refractory disease; the most common indication for intestinal resection is small bowel obstruction from a fibrostenotic stricture, with penetrating CD as the second most common. Although resection is the most definitive treatment for a stricture, strictureplasty is an option as a bowel‑preserving measure in patients at risk for short bowel syndrome; multidisciplinary management and early surgical consultation are appropriate.

### Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis: a comprehensive review [^80ba2a8d]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk factors and recurrence

The most well-established risk factor for the development of HAEC is that of trisomy 21. The incidence of HAEC in patients with HSCR and trisomy 21 is around 50% when compared with 29% in the non-trisomy 21 patients. It is thought that the intrinsic immune defects in cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and derangements in humoral response in infants with trisomy 21 may explain their higher HAEC risk. Current evidence suggests that patients with trisomy 21 experience more severe HAEC episodes.

Additional risk factors implicated in the development of HAEC include male sex, delay in HSCR diagnosis, family history of HSCR, and other congenital abnormalities. Moreover, Elhalaby et al. postulated that a single HAEC episode can lead to alterations in the intrinsic intestinal immunity via chronic mucosal changes that lead to an increased risk for future episodes. Although longer HSCR is also postulated to be associated with recurrent HAEC, current evidence has been conflicting, yet HAEC appears to be more common in patients with aganglionic segments longer than the sigmoid. In fact, a recent meta-analysis showed that preoperative enterocolitis, malnutrition, hypoproteinemia, and respiratory infection were risk factors for both postoperative HAEC and for recurrent HAEC. In addition, it reported that length of aganglionic segment greater than 30 cm was associated with postoperative HAEC, while short-segment HSCR was a protective factor against both postoperative and recurrent HAEC. Additional data have shown that the length of resection is associated with the postoperative risk of HAEC, across all HSCR variants, as well as with long-term outcomes and quality of life in patients with HSCR. In a 28-year experience with total colonic HSCR, the type of pull-through was not associated with the incidence of HAEC, which has been noted in other studies as well. Risk factors associated with postoperative HAEC include anastomotic leak, stricture, fistula, and bowel obstruction or ileus. Interestingly, older age at surgery has been associated with shorter HAEC-free interval postoperatively, but not with a higher incidence.

### Long-term outcomes after endoscopic treatment for Barrett's neoplasia with radiofrequency ablation ± endoscopic resection: results from the national Dutch database in a 10-year period [^c80d7624]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Recurrences were categorised in three grades: (1) LGD in a normal appearing cardia (9/38; 24%); (2) recurrent BE with dysplasia/EAC (24/38; 63%); and (3) advanced EAC that exceeded boundaries for curative endoscopic treatment (5/38; 13%) (table 3, online supplemental figure S2). Patients in category 1 underwent treatment (n = 1) or surveillance without progression (n = 8). All patients in category 2 underwent successful endoscopic treatment and CE-BE was re-established in all. Of the five patients with progression to advanced EAC (5/1154, 0.4%, annual risk 0.1% (95% CI 0.1 to 0.3)), four patients underwent surgery (T1bN1; T1bN1, T1N2, T1bN0), of which three patients later died from metastasised disease. A single patient had metastasised disease without intraluminal recurrence at the moment recurrence was diagnosed. Three of the five patients were identified at baseline as complicated cases with BE segment > 10 cm, severe reflux oesophagitis and/or multifocal neoplasia (online supplemental table S4). In total, 8 patients (8/1154; 0.7%) had a worse disease stage during FU than at baseline staging.

Table 3
Recurrences

Recurrence occurred median 31 monthsafter CE-BE (figure 3). The majority of recurrences developed in the tubular oesophagus (24/38; 62%); either in short segment BE (median C1M2) or in small BE islands, always within the extent of the initial BE segment (online supplemental figure S3). The remaining 38% (14/38) occurred at the cardia. All recurrences in categories 2 and 3 were detected as endoscopic abnormalities (recurrent BE and/or visible lesion). No recurrent HGD/EAC was diagnosed solely on random biopsies.

### Genetic counseling for congenital heart disease-practice resource of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^6213fadd]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2022). High credibility.

CHD recurrence risk counseling — variant assessment and empiric risk: If a pathogenic monogenic cause of isolated CHD is identified, a thorough assessment of the variant and data supporting its pathogenicity should be reviewed, and reduced penetrance and variable expressivity should be emphasized to patients/families when appropriate. If a potential monogenic cause of familial isolated CHD is identified and there is evidence suggesting its possible involvement, segregation testing can be considered for affected family members, with counseling on reclassification possibilities and that the variant may remain a VUS, and patients/families should be encouraged to check in with their team every few years for updates. In the absence of a genetic etiology, empiric risks can be used as a baseline and modified based on other factors, with clear communication that this is only an estimate and that a family's true risk may be higher or lower based on population data and other risk factors present.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^51e3b6f0]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update — management principles and patient counseling: Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course, and in patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively, rather than routinely, in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, while antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation, and an elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes; instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis.

### Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis: a comprehensive review [^b36a1207]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Prevention

Some studies have advocated for prophylactic interventions such as routine rectal washouts, especially in young infants at higher risk of HAEC and in case of anticipated delays in surgical treatment, since reduction of fecal stasis and bacterial load limits colonic distention. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported a reduced incidence of HAEC with routine postoperative irrigations but no difference in the incidence of HAEC with the use of prophylactic probiotics. A Cochrane systematic review also showed no difference in the recurrence of HAEC with probiotics when compared with placebo but emphasized the need for well-designed and sufficiently powered randomized clinical trials to clarify the true efficacy of probiotics. A study of 34 consecutive children undergoing primary transanal rectosigmoidectomy showed that the incidence of HAEC postoperatively was only 6% with the use of routine anal dilations for 3 months postoperatively. Another study compared postoperative weekly calibrations by the surgeon versus daily dilations by the parents and found no difference in outcomes. On the contrary, a study from Ireland reported no reduction in the development of HAEC with the prescription of routine anal dilations. Similarly, a study from China showed no difference in the risk of developing HAEC with anal dilations preoperatively, but it reported a shorter operative time in short-segment (aganglionosis limited to the proximal rectum) or typical-segment disease (aganglionosis from anus to the rectosigmoid junction or distal sigmoid); of note, the American Pediatric Surgical Association has recently defined short-segment HSCR as aganglionosis up to the sigmoid colon-descending colon junction and long-segment HSCR as aganglionosis from sigmoid colon-descending colon junction up to the cecum. Diverting stoma can be considered for patients with HSCR with severe congenital heart disease due to their compromised physiology and impaired tolerance to HAEC episodes. Modalities for prevention of HAEC remain elusive and would contribute greatly to reducing the morbidity that patients with HSCR and their families experience.

### Short-term and long-term risk of recurrent vascular event by cause after ischemic stroke in young adults [^ae0d1b8f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Risk of Recurrent Vascular Event by Cause of Stroke

The cumulative risk of any recurrent event for atherothrombotic stroke was 11.5% (95% CI, 2.8%-20.3%) in the short term and 22.7% (95% CI, 10.6%-34.7%) in the long term. The short-term cumulative risk was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.0%-8.9%) for likely atherothrombotic stroke, 7.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-11.2%) for small vessel disease, 5.0% (95% CI, 2.0%-8.0%) for cardioembolic stroke, 8.5% (95% CI, 3.7%-13.3%) for rare causes of stroke, 13.2% (95% CI, 7.6%-18.7%) for CeAD, 8.8% (95% CI, 1.4%-16.2%) for multiple-cause stroke, and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.1%-4.9%) for cryptogenic stroke. The long-term cumulative incidence was 12.7% (95% CI, 7.3%-18.1%) for likely atherothrombotic stroke, 14.9% (95% CI, 8.7%-21.2%) for small vessel disease, 12.5% (95% CI, 6.9%-18.1%), for cardioembolic stroke, 14.7% (95% CI, 8.3%-21.0%) for rare causes of stroke, 14.8% (95% CI, 8.9%-20.7%) for CeAD, 17.2% (95% CI, 5.4%-29.0%) for multiple-cause stroke, and 5.8% (95% CI, 3.0%-8.5%) for cryptogenic stroke. The incidence rate per 100 person-years after an atherothrombotic stroke decreased from 23.2 (95% CI, 15.7–35.9) in the first 6 months to 2.7 (95% CI, 1.2–4.2) between 2 and 5 years. The rate per 100 person-years decreased from 11.2 (95% CI, 7.6–14.8) to 1.3 (95% CI, 0.8–1.9) for likely atherothrombotic stroke, from 15.3 (95% CI, 11.0–19.5) to 1.3 (95% CI, 0.7–1.9) for small vessel disease, from 10.4 (95% CI, 7.2–13.6) to 1.4 (95% CI, 0.9–2.2%) for cardioembolic stroke, from 18.4 (95% CI, 13.1–23.8) to 1.0 (95% CI, 0.5–1.6) for rare causes of stroke, from 29.9 (95% CI, 23.3–36.5) to 0.3 (95% CI, 0.0–0.6) for CeAD, from 6.1 (95% CI, 4.1–8.1) to 0.5% (95% CI, 0.3–0.8) for cryptogenic stroke, and from 19.4 (95% CI, 11.1–27.7) to 1.9 (95% CI, 0.6–3.1) for multiple-cause stroke (Figure 3).

### NASPGHAN clinical report on postoperative recurrence in pediatric Crohn disease [^042cc126]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Postoperative recurrence in Crohn disease — anastomosis type shows no effect on recurrence after ileocolic resection, while stapled side-to-side anastomosis has a lower anastomotic leak risk than end-to end or hand-sewn anastomosis. Intestinal anastomosis type (stapled vs hand sewn) was previously thought to influence the risk of recurrence; however, a randomized multicenter trial demonstrated no effect of anastomosis type on recurrence risk after ileocolic resection, and stapled side-to-side is associated with fewer leaks.

Crohn's disease (CD) stricture endoscopic dilation — The typical indication is a "limited, short-segment (< 5 cm) stricture in the absence of associated penetrating disease (eg, abscess, fistula)". Efficacy and safety are reported as "The technical success of endoscopic stricture dilation is about 90%, and complications (eg, perforation, hemorrhage) occur in 2% to 4% of cases". Durability is limited: "repeat endoscopic dilation is required in 41% to 73% of patients followed for up to 5 years", with "recurrence rates… higher at anastomotic sites in comparison to nonanastomotic sites". Candidates with "strictures < 5 cm in length… have been associated with the best long-term outcome", and "Steroid injection of the stricture during dilation is typically not helpful". Long-term need for surgery persists: "Within 2 to 5 years after endoscopic dilation of primary or anastomotic strictures, surgical intervention is required in about one-third of patients".

### Long-term results and risk factor analysis for recurrence after curative endoscopic therapy in 349 patients with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and mucosal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus [^30738e03]. Gut (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Endoscopic therapy is increasingly being used in the treatment of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and mucosal adenocarcinoma (BC) in patients with Barrett's oesophagus. This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence.

Design

Prospective case series.

Setting

Academic tertiary care centre.

Patients

Between October 1996 and September 2002, 61 patients with HGIN and 288 with BC were included (173 with short-segment and 176 with long-segment Barrett's oesophagus) from a total of 486 patients presenting with Barrett's neoplasia. Patients with submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded.

Interventions

Endoscopic therapy.

Main Outcome Measures

Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate, tumour-associated death.

Results

Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients, photodynamic therapy in 55, and both procedures in 13; two patients received argon plasma coagulation. The mean follow-up period was 63.6 (SD 23.1) months. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 337 patients (96.6%); surgery was necessary in 13 (3.7%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients (21.5%); 56 died of concomitant disease, but none died of BC. The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84%. The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection, long-segment Barrett's oesophagus, no ablative therapy of Barrett's oesophagus after CR, time until CR achieved > 10 months and multifocal neoplasia.

Conclusions

This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe, with an excellent long-term survival rate. The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up.

### Risk factor burden and long-term prognosis of patients with premature coronary artery disease [^189cd0eb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

For the primary objective, the cumulative percentage of patients developing a first, second, and third recurrent ischemic event was estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method with follow‐up censored at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of the first event type (treating other first events as competing risks) was also presented. The average rates of recurrence of the composite end point and individual components were calculated by fitting a log‐linear Poisson model, and expressed as the number of new cardiovascular events divided by the number of patient‐years of follow‐up (number of events per 100 patient‐years) with 95% CI, for the overall population and stratified by sex. For the log‐linear Poisson model, the outcome variable was the patient‐level count of new cardiovascular events during follow‐up. To adjust for differential follow‐up, the model included an offset term equal to the logarithm of the years of follow‐up for each patient. For estimating the event rate in the overall cohort, the model included only an intercept parameter, which was estimated by maximum likelihood. The resulting point estimate and 95% confidence limits were exponentiated and multiplied by 100 to provide the estimated recurrence rate per 100 patient‐years. The third set of analyses assessed associations of prespecified patient characteristics and risk factors evaluated at time of CAD diagnosis, with the rate of future ischemic event recurrence. These variables were age, sex, body mass index, ethnic group, chronic inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors, presentation, estimated glomerular filtration rate, LDL‐C level, triglyceride levels, multivessel disease, treatment with statin at discharge, and type of treatment (PCI or CABG). Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess associations with the rate of first recurrent event, and negative binomial log‐linear regression was used for rate of multiple event recurrences. For the Cox proportional hazards models, the outcome variable was the time to first MACE event recurrence. In patients without an event, time to event was censored at end of follow‐up or 10 years if earlier. Associations with the predictor variables were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) for first MACE event recurrence. For the negative binomial log‐linear regression, the outcome variable was the count of the number of recurrent MACE events per patient. To adjust for differential follow‐up, the model included an offset term equal to the logarithm of the years of follow‐up for each patient. Associations with predictor variables were expressed as rate ratios for recurrent MACE events. For both multivariable regression models, the variables included as independent variables were identified a priori on the basis of clinical relevance.

### Long-term outcome of surgically treated Crohn's colitis: a prospective study [^f719ca60]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although bowel-sparing techniques have been published for treatment of Crohn's disease of the small bowel because of its relentless nature, extent of resection in Crohn's colitis is still a topic of debate. This study was designed to prospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients with isolated Crohn's colitis to identify patients that may benefit from initial more aggressive resection.

Methods

We identified 179 patients with Crohn's disease operated on for primary colonic disease. They were divided into segmental colectomy, total abdominal colectomy, and total proctocolectomy groups, based on their initial operation. They were further characterized by extent and location of colonic involvement. Long-term outcome variables evaluated included colonic and small-bowel surgical recurrences, postoperative complications and long-term sequelae, long-term need for medical therapy, and need for permanent fecal diversion.

Results

Fifty-five patients underwent segmental colectomy, 49 total abdominal colectomy, and 75 total proctocolectomy. Patients with diffuse colonic involvement were significantly less likely to undergo segmental colectomy than total abdominal colectomy (P < 0.0001) or total proctocolectomy (P < 0.0001). Patients with distal involvement or pancolitis were significantly less likely to undergo segmental colectomy than total abdominal colectomy (P < 0.0001) or total proctocolectomy (P < 0.0001). Overall there were 31 patients (24.4 percent) with surgical Crohn's recurrences during follow-up: 19 (38.8 percent) in the segmental colectomy, 8 (22.9 percent) in the total abdominal colectomy, and 4 (9.3 percent) in the total proctocolectomy group. There was a significant difference in time to recurrence between the three groups by log-rank test (P = 0.017). Segmental colectomy patients had a significantly shorter time to first recurrence than total proctocolectomy patients (P = 0.014). After adjusting for extent of disease, the segmental colectomy group had a significantly greater risk of surgical recurrence than the total proctocolectomy group (P = 0.006). Total proctocolectomy patients were significantly less likely to be still taking medications one year after the index operation than total abdominal colectomy patients (P = 0.003) and segmental colectomy patients (P = 0.0003). During follow-up, patients with isolated distal disease were significantly more likely to require a permanent stoma than patients with isolated proximal disease (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

A more aggressive approach should be considered in patients with diffuse and distal Crohn's colitis. Total proctocolectomy in the properly selected patients is associated with low morbidity, lower risk of recurrence, and longer time to recurrence. Patients after total proctocolectomy are more likely to be weaned off all Crohn's-related medications. Long-term rate of permanent fecal diversion is significantly higher in patients with distal disease.

### Risk and timing of recurrent ischemic events among patients with stable ischemic heart disease, non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^e480fa34]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to compare differences in risk and timing of recurrent ischemic events among patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Methods

We performed an individual data pooled analysis of 5 randomized controlled all-comer trials including a total of 8,859 patients and investigated the risk and timing of recurrent ischemic events among patients with SIHD (n = 3,543), NSTE-ACS (n = 3,364), and STEMI (n = 1,952) throughout 2 years of follow-up.

Results

At 2 years, all-cause mortality was higher among patients with STEMI (6.4%) and NSTE-ACS (6.1%) compared with those with SIHD (4.2%) (STEMI vs SIHD: hazard ratio [HR] 1.40, 95% CI 1.09–1.78, P = 0.007; NSTE-ACS vs SIHD: 1.40, 95% CI 1.13–1.73, P = 0.002). In a landmark analysis, the risk of mortality among patients with STEMI compared with those with SIHD was confined to the first 30 days after PCI (HR 6.19, 95% CI 3.15–12.16, P < .001) but was similar between 30 days and 2 years (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76–1.33, P = 0.974) (Pinteraction < .001). Conversely, patients with NSTE-ACS had a higher risk of mortality compared with those with SIHD both within the first 30 days (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.08–4.47, P = 0.031) and beyond (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.07–1.67, P = 0.012) (Pinteraction < .001). A similar pattern in the differential timing of events was observed for cardiac death. Beyond 30 days, the risk of myocardial infarction was comparable in patients with STEMI and SIHD, whereas the risk in patients with NSTE-ACS was increased (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.23–2.21, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Whereas patients with NSTE-ACS are at increased risk for death at any time after PCI, the mortality of STEMI patients is higher during the first 30 days after PCI but not thereafter compared with patients with SIHD.

### ACG clinical guideline: epidemiology, risk factors, patterns of presentation, diagnosis, and management of colon ischemia (CI) [^444f55d8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Colon ischemia (CI) management — stricture care and acute treatment are outlined as follows: Colon stricture after an episode of CI may be asymptomatic or even resolve over months to years, and surgery is indicated only when an ischemic stricture produces symptoms; in such cases, segmental resection is adequate, with transendoscopic dilation an alternative to surgery, although an unproven one. Chronic segmental CI is a more controversial indication for surgery and decisions to abandon medical therapy must be individualized for each case. Recurrent CI is uncommon, resection of the involved segment is usually curative but does not necessarily protect against recurrent CI elsewhere, and there are no published data on the frequency of such recurrence following surgery for recurrence. Treatment of CI depends upon disease severity at presentation; the overwhelming majority of patients will require simple conservative measures including fasting, intravenous fluids, and correction of underlying conditions. If patients have moderate or severe disease, broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage should be instituted along with surgical evaluation, and surgery should be consulted promptly for patients with peritoneal signs or colon necrosis.

### Management and outcomes for long-segment Hirschsprung disease: a systematic review from the APSA outcomes and evidence based practice committee [^2a46cc7d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long-Segment Hirschsprung Disease (LSHD) differs clinically from short-segment disease. This review article critically appraises current literature on the definition, management, outcomes, and novel therapies for patients with LSHD.

Methods

Four questions regarding the definition, management, and outcomes of patients with LSHD were generated. English-language articles published between 1990 and 2018 were compiled by searching PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A qualitative synthesis was performed.

Results

66 manuscripts were included in this systematic review. Standardized nomenclature and preoperative evaluation for LSHD are recommended. Insufficient evidence exists to recommend a single method for the surgical repair of LSHD. Patients with LSHD may have increased long-term gastrointestinal symptoms, including Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), but have a quality of life similar to matched controls. There are few surgical technical innovations focused on this disorder.

Conclusions

A standardized definition of LSHD is recommended that emphasizes the precise anatomic location of aganglionosis. Prospective studies comparing operative options and long-term outcomes are needed. Translational approaches, such as stem cell therapy, may be promising in the future for the treatment of long-segment Hirschsprung disease.

Implications for future research

Providing accurate estimations of the long-term prognosis of patients with HD, recognizing those at a high risk of poor outcomes, and providing these patients with targeted transitional care is of great importance for better recovery and quality of life for the whole group of patients with HD. Future research should involve multicenter studies with standardized outcome indicators, follow-up durations and intervals and should help design evidence-based transitional care for these patients. A more in-depth analysis of the prognosis of patients with HD from the stratification of the length of aganglionosis bowel segment, patients' age and gender, and surgical procedure is also necessary.

2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI coronary revascularization guideline — Radial artery access is recommended in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention who have acute coronary syndromes or stable ischemic heart disease to reduce bleeding and vascular complications, and patients with acute coronary syndromes also benefit from a reduction in mortality rate. A short duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous revascularization in patients with stable ischemic heart disease is reasonable to reduce the risk of bleeding events, and after consideration of recurrent ischemia and bleeding risks, select patients may safely transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and stop aspirin after 1 to 3 months of dual antiplatelet therapy. For ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction with nonculprit disease, staged percutaneous intervention of a significantly stenosed nonculprit artery is recommended in select patients to improve outcomes, whereas percutaneous intervention of the nonculprit artery at the time of primary percutaneous coronary intervention may be considered in stable patients with uncomplicated revascularization of the culprit artery, low-complexity nonculprit artery disease, and normal renal function; in contrast, percutaneous intervention of the non-culprit artery can be harmful in patients in cardiogenic shock. For diabetes with multivessel coronary artery disease, revascularization decisions are optimized by the use of a Heart Team approach, and patients with diabetes who have triple-vessel disease should undergo surgical revascularization; percutaneous coronary intervention may be considered if they are poor candidates for surgery. For surgical revascularization decisions, calculation of a patient's surgical risk with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score should be included, whereas the usefulness of the SYNTAX score calculation is less clear because of the interobserver variability in its calculation and its absence of clinical variables.

Post-intervention follow-up after EVT — clinical guidance and uncertainties: "In summary, the natural history of stenotic lesions from EVT remains uncertain, and the benefits of intervention based on duplex findings alone not yet established". Accordingly, "patients undergoing EVT should have serial clinical follow-up, including simple hemodynamic measurements, at clinical intervals appropriate for the indication for intervention and the extent of disease treated", and "those treated for CLI, and with long-segment occlusions should be monitored more closely than those treated for claudication". The "role of duplex imaging in late patency is currently uncertain although useful in determining whether recurrent symptoms are due to stenosis or occlusion and to localize lesions, which might alter the treatment plan", and "Continued use of duplex may also help to clarify its role further, especially when correlated with clinical presentation, angiographic findings, and ultimate outcome". The text also notes that "selective prophylactic reintervention after SFA stenting might be reasonable. At this time, however, no such data exist".

### Hirschsprung disease: common and uncommon variants [^f6ab192f]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-term outcomes for short-segment HSCR are generally favorable, but complications are not uncommon and postoperative vigilance is paramount. One US-based study found that 17% of patients were re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of pull-through procedure, including 9% with HAEC. Within 2 years of pull-through, 10% of patients required a reoperation. Several guidelines exist for the evaluation and management of the patient with HSCR who is not doing well after pull-through surgery. Guidelines also exist for the early diagnosis and treatment of HAEC, a major cause of disease-related mortality in patients with HSCR. So far studies have found no benefit to the use of prophylactic Botoxor probioticsfor the prevention of HAEC. Rectal irrigation, often in combination with antibiotics, is currently the only effective remedy for HAEC.

### Management of critical limb ischemia [^be9a5d15]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a clinical syndrome of ischemic pain at rest or tissue loss, such as nonhealing ulcers or gangrene, related to peripheral artery disease. CLI has a high short-term risk of limb loss and cardiovascular events. Noninvasive or invasive angiography help determine the feasibility and approach to arterial revascularization. An endovascular-first approach is often advocated based on a lower procedural risk; however, specific patterns of disease may be best treated by open surgical revascularization. Balloon angioplasty and stenting form the backbone of endovascular techniques, with drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons offering low rates of repeat revascularization. Combined antegrade and retrograde approaches can increase success in long total occlusions. Below the knee, angiosome-directed angioplasty may lead to greater wound healing, but failing this, any straight-line flow into the foot is pursued. Hybrid surgical techniques such as iliac stenting and common femoral endarterectomy are commonly used to reduce operative risk. Lower extremity bypass grafting is most successful with a good quality, long, single-segment autogenous vein of at least 3.5-mm diameter. Minor amputations are often required for tissue loss as a part of the treatment strategy. Major amputations (at or above the ankle) limit functional independence, and their prevention is a key goal of CLI therapy. Medical therapy after revascularization targets risk factors for atherosclerosis and assesses wound healing and new or recurrent flow-limiting disease. The ongoing National Institutes of Health-sponsored Best Endovascular Versus Best Surgical Therapy in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (BEST-CLI) study is a randomized trial of the contemporary endovascular versus open surgical techniques in patients with CLI.

### Prospective study of long-term results and prognostic factors after conservative surgery for small bowel Crohn's disease [^7fe443b9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Several bowel-sparing techniques have been proposed for treating patients with CD, but there have been no prospective studies analyzing risk factors and long-term outcome. We prospectively evaluated safety and long-term efficacy of conservative surgery for patients with complicated CD.

Methods

From 1993–2007, 393 of 502 consecutive patients underwent surgery for complicated CD of the small bowel. Those with colonic involvement were excluded. The Student t test, chi(2) test, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and Cox proportional hazard model were used to analyze postoperative complications and long-term outcome.

Results

A total of 865 jejunoileal segments underwent 318 small bowel resections and 367 strictureplasties (either classic or nonconventional). There were no deaths; the complication rate was 5.6%, and the cumulative 10-year recurrence rate was 35%. None of the prognostic factors were correlated with postoperative complications. Younger age, an upper jejunoileal location, stricturing behavior, and small-bowel wall thickening 12 months after surgery showed hazard ratios of 2.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1–5.4; P = 0.03), 2.5 (95% CI, 1.3–4.7; P = 0.004), 2.2 (95% CI, 1.1–4.1; P = 0.01), and 4.5 (95% CI, 2.3–8.6; P = 0.000), respectively. Immunomodulator therapy failed to reduce long-term surgical recurrence.

Conclusions

Young patients with extended and stricturing disease are at high risk for disease recurrence after surgery. Bowel wall thickening was a reliable prognostic factor for these patients. Conservative surgery is safe and effective in treating patients with jejunoileal CD and should be considered as the first-line surgical treatment, preventing the risk of short bowel syndrome caused by repeated resections.

Earlier endoscopic surveillance at 6 months with escalation if recurrence is found led to lower endoscopic recurrence at 18 months compared with no routine 6‑month re‑evaluation, supporting prophylactic strategies rather than treatment only after recurrence.

Rectal cancer total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is addressed with conditional recommendations; in this guideline, a TNT approach is conditionally recommended, with risk factors for disease recurrence including clinical T4 or N2 stage, low (< 5 cm) tumors, threatening of the CRM, or presence of extramural vascular invasion as determined by MRI. For patients with lower risk disease, preoperative chemoradiation or short-course RT is recommended, while a TNT approach is conditionally recommended to improve tolerability of therapy, acknowledging a lower level of evidence in this setting and possible risk of overtreatment. For patients with clinical factors that portend increased recurrence risk, TNT is conditionally recommended with moderate-quality evidence. If a TNT approach is considered, addition of 3 to 4 months of FOLFOX or CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy is consistent with evidence, and this guideline allows for addition of FOLFOX or CAPOX chemotherapy to be given either before or after chemoradiation or after short-course RT. For patients with threatened CRM or other high-risk features, delivery of RT or chemoradiation before FOLFOX or CAPOX chemotherapy may improve the extent of downstaging, although absence of high-quality data precludes recommendation of a specific sequence. Possible risks of TNT include delaying local treatment and potential over-treatment, in particular, for patients with stage II disease without other risk factors for increased recurrence.

### Recurrent glomerular disease after kidney transplantation [^ee847365]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With improving short-term kidney transplant outcomes, recurrent glomerular disease is being increasingly recognized as an important cause of chronic allograft failure. Further understanding of the risks and pathogenesis of recurrent glomerular disease enable informed transplant decisions, along with the development of preventive and treatment strategies.

Recent Findings

Multiple observational studies have highlighted differences in rates and outcomes for various recurrent glomerular diseases, although these rates have not markedly improved over the last decade. Emerging evidence supports use of rituximab to treat recurrent primary membranous nephropathy and possibly focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), whereas eculizumab is effective in glomerular diseases associated with complement dysregulation [C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)].

Summary

Despite the potential for recurrence in the allograft, transplant remains the optimal therapy for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to primary glomerular disease. Biomarkers and therapeutic options necessitate accurate pretransplant diagnoses with opportunities for improved surveillance and treatment of recurrent glomerular disease posttransplant.

### Stapled anopexy for short segment hirschprungs disease in adults [^1d332b0e]. Colorectal Disease (2004). Low credibility.

Traditional treatment of short segment Hirschprungs disease in adult consists of major resectional procedures, often with the use of a temporary stoma. Patients with this disease may have significant morbidities that increase their risk of post-operative morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to minimize the procedural related morbidity, we describe the application of the stapled anopexy technique to treat short segment Hirschprungs disease.

### Primary urethral reconstruction: the cost minimized approach to the bulbous urethral stricture [^bae3e691]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Treatment for urethral stricture disease often requires a choice between readily available direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) and highly efficacious but more technically complex open urethral reconstruction. Using the short segment bulbous urethral stricture as a model, we determined which strategy is less costly.

Materials and Methods

The costs of DVIU and open urethral reconstruction with stricture excision and primary anastomosis for a 2 cm bulbous urethral stricture were compared using a cost minimization decision analysis model. Clinical probability estimates for the DVIU treatment arm were the risk of bleeding, urinary tract infection and the risk of stricture recurrence. Estimates for the primary urethral reconstruction strategy were the risk of wound complications, complications of exaggerated lithotomy and the risk of treatment failure. Direct third party payer costs were determined in 2002 United States dollars.

Results

The model predicted that treatment with DVIU was more costly (17,747 dollars per patient) than immediate open urethral reconstruction (16,444 dollars per patient). This yielded an incremental cost savings of $1,304 per patient, favoring urethral reconstruction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that primary treatment with urethroplasty was economically advantageous within the range of clinically relevant events. Treatment with DVIU became more favorable when the long-term risk of stricture recurrence after DVIU was less than 60%.

Conclusions

Treatment for short segment bulbous urethral strictures with primary reconstruction is less costly than treatment with DVIU. From a fiscal standpoint urethral reconstruction should be considered over DVIU in the majority of clinical circumstances.

### 2024 ACC / AHA / AACVPR / APMA / ABC / SCAI / SVM / SVN / SVS / SIR / VESS guideline for the management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^4c7a0ae4]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease claudication — evidence on endovascular therapy, supervised exercise therapy (SET), and surgery indicates that symptom improvement after endovascular treatment is related to vessel patency, with long-term patency greater in aortoiliac than femoropopliteal segments, and patency is reduced by adverse lesion and patient factors. In aortoiliac disease, the CLEVER trial reported improved walking time for endovascular therapy plus supervised exercise versus medication alone at 6 months, and the ERASE trial found that after 1 year both combined therapy and supervised exercise alone improved walking distance and health-related quality of life (QOL), with greater gains in the combined-therapy group; however, the long-term comparative effectiveness of endovascular revascularization versus SET and of medical therapy versus SET with or without revascularization is unknown. In femoropopliteal disease, multiple randomized controlled trials demonstrated short-term efficacy of endovascular treatment versus SET or medical therapy, with benefit that diminishes by 1 year, and two systematic reviews reported improvements in walking performance and QOL. Selection of a revascularization approach is individualized based on patient goals, anatomy, perioperative risk, and anticipated benefit; surgical procedures are usually reserved for individuals without adequate benefit from nonsurgical therapy, with favorable anatomy for a durable surgical result, and with acceptable perioperative risk, and assessment of perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk is an important consideration.

### KDIGO 2022 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease [^0c8dcc3f]. Kidney International (2022). High credibility.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and kidney transplantation — recurrence and donor considerations indicate that after transplantation, '32% having recurrent disease at a median time of 1.5 months after transplantation in 1 particular study'. In contrast, 'the recurrence rate of FSGS after transplantation is significantly low in genetic forms of the disease, with some studies reporting no individuals exhibiting recurrent disease after a kidney transplant'. Accordingly, 'genetic testing in adults with FSGS for whom a kidney transplant is planned may provide prognostic information on transplant outcomes' and 'genetic testing in living related donors is important to advise on the risk of subsequent development of kidney disease after transplantation'. In individuals of recent African ancestry, 'the presence of APOL1 genetic risk variants have been found to be associated with an increased odds of developing FSGS', and 'APOL1 high-risk donor kidneys fail at higher rates than non-risk kidneys' (APOL1 apolipoprotein-L1).

### Analysis of the causes of redo pull-through for recurrent constipation and the risk factors affecting the prognosis of the Hirschsprung's disease: a single-center retrospective study and systematic review [^d836ee01]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Patients of HSCR who undergo PT surgery often experience short- or long-term postoperative complications, necessitating redo-PT procedures. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of the causes and prognostic factors associated with redo-PT for recurrent constipation. A dataset of 360 cases was compiled from referenced sources and our institution. The analysis identified RA (52.50%) and MO (32.67%) related issues as the primary causes of redo-PT for recurrent constipation. Gender, age, causes of redo pull-through, or surgical approach showed no significant correlation to the prognosis of redo-PT patients in our center. The laparoscopic approach demonstrated superior cosmetic outcomes compared to laparotomy, as evidenced by significantly lower SCAR scores, without compromising surgical efficiency. This study provides valuable insights into the causes and prognostic factors of redo-PT in HSCR patients with recurrent constipation. These findings hold potential to improve the clinical management and therapeutic outcomes for these patients.

Several studies on redo-PT were identified that did not meet our selection criteria. The exclusion of these articles was primarily based on their specific research focus and methodological characteristics. A few studies focused on technical aspects of re-operative surgical approaches or postoperative rehabilitation outcomes. These specific research orientations, while valuable in their respective contexts, did not contribute directly to our investigation of etiological factors and classification framework development, thus warranting their exclusion from our primary analysis. By systematically categorizing the reasons for redo-PT into RA, AA, and MO, our findings showed that RA (52.50%) and MO (32.67%) were the predominant causes of redo-PT, aligning with previous studies.

RA was the leading cause of recurrent constipation requiring redo-PT, primarily due to incomplete resection of aganglionic bowel segments. Despite efforts to ensure adequate removal of aganglionic segments and proper anastomosis with ganglionated segments during the initial pull-through, residual aganglionosis and transition-zone pull-throughs can still occur. While preserving as much normal bowel as possible benefits function, it also increases the risk of RA. The incomplete preoperative assessments of HSCR may contribute to inadequate intraoperative resection of affected intestinal segments. This highlights the need for careful consideration of biopsy and resection lengths during PT surgeries in HSCR treatment centers. Addressing these factors could improve intraoperative resection precision and reduce the risk of postoperative recurrent constipation.

### The association between short-term postoperative complications and bowel function after surgery for Hirschsprung disease [^ef6b8e7a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings indicate that long-segment disease is a risk factor affecting long-term postoperative bowel function, which has been confirmed in previous studies. Compared with short-segment HSCR, long-segment HSCR has a longer colon resection time, heavier surgical trauma, and may lead to high tension at the anastomotic site, causing high-risk damage to the dentate line. As a result, the complete sensation is disrupted, including the ability to suppress defecation and the impulse to control defecation. Additionally, patients with long-segment HSCR often experience more excessive traction and anal dilatation, potentially subjecting the sphincter to greater trauma. These factors contribute to the poorer functional intestinal outcomes often observed in patients with long-segment HSCR.

Furthermore, our study demonstrated that formula feeding was associated with poorer bowel function outcomes in HSCR patients compared to breastfeeding. Previous studies have established that there are substantial differences in the gut microbiome composition between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Breastfed infants have a higher abundance of bifidobacteria in their gut microbiota compared to formula-fed infants. These bacteria contribute to intestinal mucosal barrier protection by inhibiting pathogen activity, while also regulating the intestinal immune system and increasing the production of immunoglobulin sIgA. Additionally, breast milk contains bioactive compounds, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and breast milk oligosaccharides (MOS), which are not present in formula milk. These compounds contribute to nutrient digestion and absorption, immune protection, and antimicrobial defense. It can be seen that breastfeeding has advantages over formula feeding in terms of gut microbiota and immune function, which may be the main reason for the difference in bowel function between the two.

### Culprit and nonculprit recurrent ischemic events in patients with myocardial infarction: data from SWEDEHEART (Swedish web system for enhancement and development of evidence-based care in heart disease evaluated according to recommended therapies) [^c2568d76]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

At the index infarction, no major differences were identified between patients with subsequent NCL compared with CL recurrent infarctions on baseline characteristics. When analyzing clinical factors available for the treating clinician at the index MI, multivessel disease and male sex were associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing an NCL‐related re‐MI. Also, a longer time delay between the index infarction and the re‐MI increased the likelihood of the recurrent infarction being classified as an NCL. The risk of experiencing an NCL versus CL reinfarction at 1 year showed a similar relationship to that after the full 8‐year follow‐up (data not shown). This suggests that the higher risk of NCL reinfarctions was not affected by the unequal higher initial risk, which is coherent with STEMI, 19 the higher risk of procedural MIs early after an index MI, or dual‐antiplatelet treatment usually limited to the first year after MI. 20

In the PROSPECT study, patients with high‐risk lesions exhibited an overall higher morbidity (by Framingham risk score), more extensive CAD, and a higher likelihood of NCL reinfarctions. 21 Clinical and angiographic characteristics had a poor predictive value for identifying recurrent ischemic events from untreated plaques. The potential of identifying coronary plaque vulnerability with intravascular ultrasonographic imaging laid the groundwork for the ongoing PROSPECT II study, with the aim to establish the utility of intravascular ultrasonographic imaging and near‐infrared spectroscopy to identify plaques prone to future ischemic events. When we evaluated clinical factors possibly associated with type of recurrent infarction, index MI multivessel disease was the strongest predictor of NCL re‐MIs. Although coronary plaque phenotype has been strongly associated with NCL recurrent ischemic events 8, 22, 23 and, therefore, suggests a potential clinical benefit of a more extensive and comprehensive characterization of plaques, these techniques are not extensively available in most countries. Information on the extent of CAD or the presence of multivessel disease is readily available from the index MI catheterization and, thus, likely useful for the prediction of reinfarctions not related to the CL.

A better understanding of long‐term disease progression and whether reinfarctions occur in previously treated lesions or in new or progressive lesions may have an impact on decisions on type and duration of medical treatment after an initial MI. Secondary prevention after MI is indicated to prevent the patient from stent‐related adverse events in the short to medium term and also to prevent atherothrombotic events from nontreated lesions long term and overall coronary disease progression.

### Effect of coexisting vascular disease on long-term risk of recurrent events after TIA or stroke [^a4a9952f]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

We found that the subgroup of patients with large artery disease (TOAST classification) were at high risk of ischemic events, consistent with previous findings. However, the current absolute risk of ischemic events (10-year risk of coronary events of 16.1% and 10-year risk of recurrent ischemic stroke of 26.3%) was lower than previously reported (10-year risk > 20% and > 30%, respectively). We also found that stratification by presence of coexisting cardiovascular disease identified individuals at higher risk of coronary events, with 10-year risk ranging from 9.5% in patients without coexisting cardiovascular disease to 33.5% in those with. The suggestion that carotid stenosis should be considered as a coronary heart disease equivalent (defined as 10-year risk ≥ 20%)was based mainly on data from trials of endarterectomy performed in the 1980s and early 1990s, which reported risks of coronary events of more than 20% over 10 years. The risk of MI after TIA/stroke has declined over time, but only one recent study reported the risk in patients with TIA/stroke due to large artery disease, with an annual risk of 0.8%, although prevalence of coronary artery disease was lower (11%) than in our cohort (30%) and mean follow-up was only 2.1 years. We found that most coronary events occurred in the subset of patients with large artery disease who had prior coexisting cardiovascular disease.

### Assessing recurrence risk following acute venous thromboembolism: use of algorithms [^c09b3005]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a chronic disease, associated with a significant rate of recurrence, lower in patients with events provoked by transient risk factors and higher in unprovoked cases. Short-term treatment is indicated for provoked VTE, long-term treatment should be considered for unprovoked. The aim of this review is to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence and the decisional algorithms available to guide patients' management.

Recent Findings

To identify patients who carry a high recurrent risk and require long-term treatment, three algorithms have been proposed: the HERDOO2, the Vienna prediction model, and the DASH score. All identify male sex and elevated D-dimer levels as important risk factors for recurrence. However, important differences among the models should be outlined: in the HERDOO2 model, D-dimer levels are measured during anticoagulation and not after its withdrawal; furthermore, it indicates age greater than 65 as a risk factor for recurrence, whereas the DASH score attributes a higher risk to age less than 50. The Vienna model is complex for routine use.

Summary

Further studies are needed to clarify these discrepancies. A management study based on D-dimer levels after anticoagulation withdrawal is ongoing and could indicate a simple way to safely manage these patients.

### Population variation in total genetic risk of Hirschsprung disease from common RET, SEMA3 and NRG1 susceptibility polymorphisms [^057984c0]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

The risk of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is ∼15/100 000 live births per newborn but has been reported to show significant inter-individual variation from the effects of seven common susceptibility alleles at the RET, SEMA3 and NRG1 loci. We show, by analyses of these variants in 997 samples from 376 HSCR families of European ancestry, that significant genetic risk can only be detected at RET (rs2435357 and rs2506030) and at SEMA3 (rs11766001), but not at NRG1. RET rs2435357 also showed significant frequency differences by gender, segment length of aganglionosis and familiality. Further, in combination, disease risk varied > 30-fold between individuals with none and up to 6 susceptibility alleles. Thus, these polymorphisms can be used to stratify the newborn population into distinct phenotypic classes with defined risks to understand HSCR etiology.

### Residual short-segment distal inflammation has No significant impact on the major relapse of extensive ulcerative colitis [^6e8217d3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mucosal healing is a treatment target for patients with ulcerative colitis. However, the relevance of proactive treatment for residual inflammation limited to the distal colon is unclear.

Materials and Methods

Patients with ulcerative colitis who had extensive colitis in clinical remission and underwent colonoscopy were retrospectively enrolled and followed up for 2 years. Patients with complete endoscopic remission (CER; Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] of 0) and those with short-segment distal inflammation (SS; active inflammation only in the sigmoid colon and/or rectum with a proximal MES of 0) were compared for the incidence of minor (only symptomatic) and major (need for induction treatments or hospitalization) relapses.

Results

A total of 91 patients with CER and 54 patients with SS were identified and 63 relapses (47 minor and 16 major) were analyzed. Univariate analysis showed that minor relapses were significantly more frequent in the SS group than in the CER group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25–3.97), but major relapses were not more frequent in the SS group than in the CER group (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.65–4.83). Multivariable analysis showed that SS was the only risk factor significantly associated with minor relapse (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.31–4.36). When the SS group was stratified by MES of 1 vs 2/3, minor relapses were significantly more frequent in the subgroup with MES of 2/3 than in the CER group, whereas the incidence of major relapse remained similar.

Conclusions

Residual short-segment distal inflammation is not a risk factor for major relapses as long as endoscopic remission is achieved in the proximal colon. Therefore, reactive but not proactive treatment may be appropriate for such lesions.

### The incremental value of angiographic features for predicting recurrent cardiovascular events: insights from the Duke databank for cardiovascular disease [^f102cb2e]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Identifying patient subgroups with cardiovascular disease (CVD) at highest risk for recurrent events remains challenging. Angiographic features may provide incremental value in risk prediction beyond clinical characteristics.

Methods

We included all cardiac catheterization patients from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease with significant coronary artery disease (CAD; 07/01/2007–12/31/2012) and an outpatient follow-up visit with a primary care physician or cardiologist in the same health system within 3 months post-catheterization. Follow-up occurred for 3 years for the primary major adverse cardiovascular event endpoint (time to all-cause death, myocardial infarction [MI], or stroke). A multivariable model to predict recurrent events was developed based on clinical variables only, then adding angiographic variables from the catheterization. Next, we compared discrimination of clinical vs. clinical plus angiographic risk prediction models.

Results

Among 3366 patients with angiographically-defined CAD, 633 (19.2%) experienced cardiovascular events (death, MI, or stroke) within 3 years. A multivariable model including 18 baseline clinical factors and initial revascularization had modest ability to predict future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events (c-statistic = 0.716). Among angiographic predictors, number of diseased vessels, left main stenosis, left anterior descending stenosis, and the Duke CAD Index had the highest value for secondary risk prediction; however, the clinical plus angiographic model only slightly improved discrimination (c-statistic = 0.724; delta 0.008). The net benefit for angiographic features was also small, with a relative integrated discrimination improvement of 0.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.03–0.08).

Conclusions

The inclusion of coronary angiographic features added little incremental value in secondary risk prediction beyond clinical characteristics.

### The role of primary surgical procedure in maintaining intestinal continuity for patients with Crohn's colitis [^23ff18bb]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluates surgical procedures for Crohn's colitis. The risk of recurrence and how it interacts with future avoidance of permanent stoma and quality of life (QoL) is studied.

Background

Segmental and subtotal colectomy are widely used surgical options in isolated Crohn's colitis. It is not clear which procedure offers the best outcomes.

Methods

Patients undergoing index resection for isolated colonic Crohn's disease (CD) from 1995 to 2009, were identified from a prospectively maintained CD database. Patients were categorized into subtotal colectomy or segmental groups. Demographics, disease characteristics, operative details, morbidity, stoma formation, recurrence requiring surgery and QoL data were extracted. Recurrence and stoma free survival was calculated for each group and independent risk factors for recurrence and stoma formation identified.

Results

One hundred and eight patients (49 segmental, 59 subtotal) underwent primary colectomy with anastomosis. Segmental colectomy patients had significantly reduced recurrence free survival (P = 0.032) but not stoma free survival P = 0.62 on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, the presence of perianal sepsis (P = 0.032) and > 1 medical comorbidity (P = 0.01), but not segmental colectomy, were associated with reduced SFS. There was no difference in Cleveland Global Quality of Life (P = 0.88), or Short Form Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire scores between groups (P = 0.92).

Conclusions

Using a strictly defined cohort of patients, we were unable to identify segmental resection as an independent risk factor for recurrence or stoma formation and no reduction in QoL scores to suggest an adverse effect of recurrence was observed. Segmental colectomy affords good function, and our data supports the practice of a conservative approach with anastomosis in anatomically linked CD.

Conclusions

The functional outcomes of patients with HSCR after TEPT in our institution are considered relatively good. Moreover, the VBM and constipation risk after TEPT might be affected by sex and post-operative complications, respectively, while the age at TEPT performed might not be associated with any functional outcomes. Further multicenter studies with a larger sample size are necessary to clarify and confirm our findings.

### HIV infection and long-term residual cardiovascular risk after acute coronary syndrome [^97c0f46c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Other cardiovascular primary end points were: (1) target lesion revascularization, defined as any repeat PCI or bypass surgery of the initial culprit lesion for recurrent angina, or ischemia; (2) target vessel revascularization, defined as any clinically driven repeat PCI or bypass surgery of the entire target vessel; and (3) target vessel failure, defined as a composite end point of cardiac death, MI, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization. Therefore, we could ascertain whether the recurrent ischemic event was related to the initial culprit lesion (target lesion revascularization) or to a new coronary lesion on another segment or artery. Myocardial infarction (MI) was defined as the presence of at least 2 of the following: ischemic symptoms, elevation in cardiac enzymes (troponin I or T) at least twice their upper normal limits, and new ECG changes compatible with MI. 21 Secondary end points included an episode of HF requiring hospitalization, stable angina, silent myocardial ischemia (defined as the presence of objective evidence of myocardial ischemia during ischemic tests [treadmill testing, stress echocardiography, and/or single‐photon emission computed tomography] in the absence of chest discomfort reported by the cardiologist at each visit), supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias (reported by the cardiologist at each visit), peripheral vascular disease (including any endovascular surgery or dilatation for carotid or limb diseases), and venous thromboembolic disease requiring hospitalization.

Smoking status and newly diagnosed hypertension and diabetes mellitus were systematically evaluated during the entire follow‐up. Fasting lipid parameters including low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were proposed to be evaluated at each local laboratory during each prespecified visit. Information on the use of stress testing (including exercise ECG, single‐photon emission computed tomography, and dobutamine stress echocardiography) and echocardiography including left ventricular ejection fraction measurement were collected during the entire follow‐up.

### Differential risk of disease progression between isolated anastomotic ulcers and mild ileal recurrence after ileocolonic resection in patients with Crohn's disease [^0f24bdff]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

It is standard of care to perform ileocolonoscopy within a year of ileocolonic resection for Crohn's disease (CD) and to guide management decisions based on the Rutgeert score (RS). The modified RS subdivides i2 into lesions confined to the anastomosis (i2a) or > 5 aphthous lesions in the neoterminal ileum (i2b). There is uncertainty, however, if i2a lesions incur an increased risk of disease recurrence. The primary aim of this study was to compare the rates of endoscopic progression between i2a and i2b when compared with i0-i1.

Methods

This was a retrospective, single-center study including patients with CD who had an ileocolonoscopy ≤ 12 months after ileocolonic resection with primary anastomosis and who had > 1 year of documented clinical follow-up after the index endoscopic evaluation. All consecutive eligible patients between 2004 and 2014 were included in the study. Demographic, disease, and treatment data were collected. Patients with i3 or i4 at index colonoscopy were excluded from further analyses. Outcomes included endoscopic progression and recurrent surgery. For patients with RS of i0 to i2, endoscopic progression was predefined as progression of the RS in subsequent colonoscopies to i3 or i4. Recurrent surgical interventions were defined as re-resection or stricturoplasty of the previous ileocolonic anastomosis.

Results

Two hundred seven CD patients (median age, 36 years [interquartile range, 26–48]) had an ileocolonoscopy ≤ 12 months after ileocolonic resection. At index colonoscopy, 95 patients (45.9%) had an RS of i0, 31 (14.9%) i1, 40 (19.3%) i2a, 25 (12.1%) i2b, 10 (4.8%) i3, and 6 (2.9%) i4. One hundred ninety-one patients had an RS of i0 to i2 and were included in the analyses for recurrent surgery. One hundred forty-nine patients had a second endoscopic evaluation and were included in the analysis for the primary outcome of endoscopic disease progression. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed and found the hazard ratio (HR) of endoscopic progression to be significantly higher with i2b lesions when compared with i0 or i1 (HR, 6.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.38–16.2; P = 0.0008). Patients with i2a did not have significantly higher rates of endoscopic progression when compared with i0 or i1 (HR, 2.30; 95% CI, .80–6.66; P = 0.12). Likewise, patients with i2b lesions had higher risk of needing recurrent surgery when compared with i0 or i1 (HR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.10–12.1; P = 0.034), whereas patients with i2a lesions were not found to have a significantly elevated risk of recurrent surgery (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, .35–5.77; P = 0.62).

Conclusion

Endoscopic lesions limited to the ileocolonic anastomosis (RS i2a) in patients with CD undergoing colonoscopy within 1 year of their resection were not associated with a significantly higher rate of progression to more severe disease, whereas those in the neoileum (RS i2b) were. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Risk factor burden and long-term prognosis of patients with premature coronary artery disease [^50a34685]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Of 5 patients with premature CAD, 1 died within 10 years of follow‐up. These young individuals also had multiple recurrences of events, especially atherosclerotic progression leading to stable angina or recurrent MIs. With almost 10 events per 100 patient‐years, including recurrent MI or death, patients with premature CAD display worse outcomes than those reported in patients > 50 years of age, even including higher‐risk groups. 23, 24 Such a pejorative prognosis highlights the need for more aggressive primary and secondary prevention, with appropriate smoking cessation strategies and low LDL‐C target goals in young patients at risk. Of importance, more than half of patients continued smoking despite early CAD; this observation is consistent with the findings of the Partners YOUNG‐MI registry, which displayed a clear association with subsequent mortality. 25 This also demonstrates the need for specific trials to test innovative strategies, like early PCSK9 inhibitors, as soon as premature CAD is diagnosed, for these individuals with a life‐long atherosclerotic burden. Attention should also be given to risk enhancers, such as biomarkers like lipoprotein (a), which are hereditary and can also lead to premature cardiovascular disease. 26, 27 Extended dual antiplatelet therapy duration is another path requiring evaluation, in this population with a low bleeding risk with early recurrent ischemic events. The other unmet need is a specific consideration of these individuals in scientific guidelines, to provide a specific cardiovascular risk assessment and to guide intensive therapies for which they are currently rarely eligible. 28, 29, 30 In a recent evaluation of the recent 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood cholesterol guidelines in DDCD, we found that < 50% of patients admitted for a first MI before the age of 55 years would have been eligible for primary prevention statins before this event, in comparison with 75% to 85% of older patients with MI. 31 The major explanation is the important contribution of age in the risk stratification by the 10‐year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score. 32

### Radiation therapy for rectal cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline focused update [^41574f0f]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2024). High credibility.

KQ2 — appropriate neoadjuvant regimens for operable rectal cancer: Preoperative chemoradiation using a dose of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions reduces local recurrence risk versus postoperative treatment, and a preoperative dose of 5000 to 5040 cGy using 180 to 200 cGy per fraction has been adopted and validated. For nonoperative management candidates, the primary tumor can receive a sequential or simultaneous integrated boost up to 5600 cGy, noting that a median dose of 5400 cGy was used in the OPRA study. Preoperative short-course RT of 2500 cGy in 5 fractions to the pelvis reduces the relative risk of local recurrence by > 50%. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) improved pathologic complete response rates, metastasis-free survival, and disease-free survival in high-risk disease; PRODIGE 23 used sequential mFOLFIRINOX for 6 cycles, long-course chemoradiation, resection, and adjuvant FOLFOX, with 3-year DFS and 7-year overall survival improved for TNT, and both arms received adjuvant FOLFOX. RAPIDO compared short-course RT followed by CAPOX or FOLFOX with chemoradiation and optional adjuvant chemotherapy, with improved 3-year disease-related treatment failure for the short-course RT arm. STELLAR evaluated short-course RT followed by CAPOX before surgery versus long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery, and 3-year overall survival was improved for the TNT arm.

### Therapeutic apheresis rescue mission: recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in renal allografts [^868b075b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Recurrent idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) after renal transplantation can lead to a rapid failure of the allograft. A circulating, nonimmunoglobulin factor appears to be important in the pathogenesis of this complication in many cases. Between 30% and 50% of transplant recipients with FSGS develop recurrent disease. Three major risk factors for recurrence have been identified: short duration of native kidney disease, history of recurrence with previous kidney transplant, and pediatric aged recipients. Although no properly controlled trials have been conducted, plasmapheresis has emerged as one of the important treatment modalities for this entity. Retrospective studies prior to the routine use of plasmapheresis showed graft loss rates as high as 80%, a rate much higher than that seen in more recent series managed with plasmapheresis. Duration and intensity of treatment of plasmaphersis have not been studied rigorously, but in most case series, plasmapheresis was continued until a clear diminution of proteinuria was seen. The benefit of other adjuvant therapies for this condition remains unclear, but also may play a role in the treatment of this entity.

### The role of the lumbar paravertebral muscles in the development of short-term residual pain after lumbar fusion surgery [^6bcc9960]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design.

A retrospective real-world study.

Objective.

Using machine learning models to identify risk factors for residual pain after PLIF in patients with degenerative lumbar spine disease.

Summary of Background Data.

Residual pain after PLIF is a frequent phenomenon, and the specific risk factors for residual pain are not known.

Materials and Methods.

Between June 2018 and March 2023, 936 patients with lumbar degenerative disease who underwent PLIF surgery were recruited. Group A (n = 501) had < 7 days of VAS ≥ 3 pain within 1 month post-PLIF, whereas group B (n = 435) had ≥ 7 days. Imaging outcomes included PMI, MMI, MMD, lumbar lordosis (LL), and LL improvement rate. Functional outcomes were assessed by VAS. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the potential risk of short-term postoperative pain. Risk factors were identified using machine learning models and predicted whether residual pain would occur.

Results.

A total of 435 (46.5%) patients experienced residual postoperative pain. Independent risk factors included surgical segment, PMI, MMI, and depression level. The Random Forest Model model had an accuracy of 95.7%, a sensitivity of 96.4%, a specificity of 94.1%, and an F1 score of ~95.2% for predicting recurrent pain, indicating high reliability and generalizability.

Conclusions.

Our study reveals risk factors for the development of residual pain after PLIF. Compared to the pain group, the non-pain group had better paravertebral muscles, good psychological level, lower surgical segment and LL improvement rate. These factors may represent targets for preoperative and perioperative optimization as a means to minimize the potential for residual pain after PLIF.

### Hirschsprung disease… [^2d2842bb]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder of intestinal motility affecting approximately 1 in 5, 000 live births, with a 4: 1 male predominance. No single underlying cause has been identified, with both sporadic and familial cases reported. Most often HSCR is an isolated finding, but 20% of cases are associated with a chromosomal abnormality or with other congenital anomalies of the cardiac, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and/or nervous systems. Also, a variety of syndromes pose an increased risk of HSCR, including Down syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIA, and congenital hypoventilation syndrome, among others. Most cases are linked to the RET receptor tyrosine kinase locus, and others to loci such as SEMA1 and NRG1. Nonmendelian inheritance operates, with the cumulative risk of disease proportional to the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms.

The characteristic lack of enteric ganglia in myenteric and submucosal plexuses arises from a defect in neural crest cell migration during fetal. Comments.

### Identification of long noncoding RNA candidate disease genes associated with clinically reported copy number variants in congenital heart disease [^a4904c54]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common congenital malformations, with a birth prevalence of 1% worldwide. In 60% to 75% of CHD cases, the genetic cause of the disease is unknown. Copy number variants (CNVs), which are subchromosomal variations in the number of copies of DNA segments ranging in size from 1000 base pairs to several megabases (Mb), account for 3% to 10% of the pathogenic causes of isolated CHD. Some recurrent CNVs are associated with a specific type of CHD, including 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (also known as DiGeorge syndrome, a ~3 Mb microdeletion affecting TBX1, a T‐box transcription factor required for normal development of the second heart field), Williams–Beuren syndrome (deletion of 7q11.23 that leads to the haploinsufficiency of nearly 25 genes, including the ELN gene that codes for elastin, important for blood vessel elasticity and associated with aortic and pulmonary stenosis)and 1p36 deletion syndrome (the most common terminal deletion syndrome with cardiac findings that include congenital heart defects and cardiomyopathy). In addition to these clinical syndromes, CNVs are linked with a considerably greater risk of nonsyndromic CHD. Nonetheless, many distinct CNVs are observed in patients who have the same CHD diagnosis, and often, their contribution to CHD pathogenesis remains unclear. The precise mechanisms by which CNVs lead to nonsyndromic CHD are still largely unknown, necessitating further investigation into their functional impact and the underlying biological pathways involved.

### Competing risks of cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular death during long-term follow-up after acute coronary syndromes [^96855eea]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with unstable angina (UA) and non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) differ from those with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in important ways; as a group, they are older and more likely to have both cardiovascular and other comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have mostly demonstrated that all‐cause mortality is greater for patients with STEMI than for those with UA/NSTEMI over the first 2 to 3 months after the event, but over long‐term follow‐up, all‐cause mortality is higher for patients with UA/NSTEMI compared with STEMI and for older patients compared with younger patients. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 However, these studies were unable to reliably capture cause of death and, as such, are unable to determine the contributions of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality to overall mortality in post–acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients.

The relative incidence of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death is of particular interest in the design and interpretation of cardiovascular clinical trials. Failure to account for the competing risk of noncardiovascular death can lead to overestimates of event rates observed, and noncardiovascular death rates affect sample size as patients are effectively "censored" at the time of death. 17, 18 The relative likelihood of cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular death after initial presentation with ACS is likely to change over time and to differ among patients who present with STEMI and UA/NSTEMI, given differences in baseline characteristics, but this has not been well defined over a prolonged follow‐up period. Further delineation of the long‐term frequencies of cardiovascular versus noncardiovascular death following ACS may inform the design and conduct of future cardiovascular outcomes trials that commonly incorporate cardiovascular death into the composite primary outcome and may help patients and physicians prioritize multiple competing comorbidities.

### Myocardial viability testing: all STICHed up, or about to be REVIVED? [^a38fd7b3]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Ischaemia

Myocardial hibernation is triggered by recurrent episodes of inducible ischaemia, and the reversal of hibernation depends on two factors; the ability to remove the stimulus (inducible hypoperfusion/ischaemia) and a myocardial substrate that has the capacity to recover (viability). It follows that functional recovery is most likely to occur in territories with both inducible ischaemia and viability. This hypothesis is supported by some observational data, such as the greater diagnostic accuracy of both elements via a biphasic response on DSE, compared to the demonstration of contractile reserve alone, and was also shown in the CHRISTMAS trial. However, much remains unknown about the interaction between ischaemia and viability in predicting both clinical outcomes and treatment effects.

As patients with ILVD typically have extensive and severe coronary disease, they might be expected to exhibit a large ischaemic burden on functional testing. However, as hibernation itself is an adaptive response to mitigate the effects of ischaemia, the ability to demonstrate the latter stages of the ischaemic cascade (such as inducible contractile dysfunction) may be limited, depending on the method of testing used. Another practical limitation is the difficulty of assessing ischaemia in thinned and/or partially scarred myocardial segments. By way of example, despite the requirement for significant coronary disease to meet inclusion criteria, 36% of patients who underwent ischaemia testing in STICH exhibited no inducible ischaemia.

As for patients with stable CAD and normal left ventricular function, an increasing burden of inducible ischaemia is associated with poorer outcomes in ILVD. In observational series, the benefits of revascularization appeared greater in those with more extensive ischaemia. However, as with viability, treatment effect cannot be separated from clinician bias in the treatment assignment. Clinicians may hesitate to offer revascularization to frailer patients with other medical conditions that increase the procedural risk or reduce the chance of benefit, despite the presence of extensive ischaemia. Observational studies will often fail to capture important details that allow appropriate risk adjustments to be made in outcome analyses. The COURAGEand ISCHEMIAtrials have, using more robust methods, excluded a prognostically important treatment benefit of revascularization in patients with extensive ischaemia and normal left ventricular function, though the follow-up of ISCHEMIA remains short when considered against STICH.

### Current and future state of the management of Hirschsprung disease [^683581c5]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The relatively low risk of 1 in 120 despite having a high-risk genetic profile, as well as the incomplete penetrance, indicates that other environmental and epigenetic factors likely contribute to the complex phenotype of this disease. Although significant progress has been made identifying genetic risk factors and new mutations that lead to HSCR, there remains a significant knowledge gap. It is unknown why the majority of patients with a high-risk genetic profile do not develop the disease, why some patients have short-segment disease while others have total colonic involvement, why some present within the first 48 hours of life while others develop symptoms later in childhood, or why some patients develop HAEC.

Epigenetic changes likely contribute to the incomplete penetrance observed in HSCR. Epigenetic regulation modifies gene expression and thus phenotype without altering the nucleotide sequence or genetic profile. Alterations in DNA methylation and histone modification can turn particular genes on or off. DNA hypermethylation silences genes while hypomethylation upregulates gene expression. Similarly, histone proteins have residues that can be altered via methylation/demethylation, acetylation/deacetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, which subsequently affects the structure of chromatin and thereby regulates gene expression. RET is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor expressed by enteric neural crest-derived cells, whose activation promotes NCC proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation into enteric neurons. RET coding mutations account for 15%–35% of patients with sporadic HSCR and 50% of familial cases. Additionally, non-coding RET mutations are common and account for approximately two-thirds of sporadic cases. Epigenetic regulation may also play a role, as RET expression has been shown to be regulated by DNA methylation in the peripheral white blood cells from patients with HSCR. Furthermore, the protein complex HOXB5 alters chromatin configuration, which could result in decreased RET expression and HSCR. Since there have been so many genes implicated in HSCR, epigenetic analysis is very complicated. However, emerging technologies in single-cell epigenetics, including CUT&Tagand ATAC-seq, may help elucidate critical epigenetic changes that contribute to disease phenotype.

### Posttreatment surveillance in patients with prolonged disease-free survival after resection of colorectal liver metastasis [^5cb884b7]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Follow-up in the centre of the current study is performed during 5 years for all patients after resection of CRLM, which is advised in the ASCRS and NCCN guidelines. Preferably cancer surveillance should only be performed in those patients benefiting from it. In order to decide in which patients follow-up is desirable, accurate prediction of outcome after metastasectomy is needed. Many efforts to determine prognosis of patients with CRLM have been made, of which the CRS is mostly practised. Less evidence is available to predict the likelihood of late disease recurrence, which is demonstrated by the fact that patients with initially poor prognostic factors can still be cured from CRLM. A study by Tan et al. showed that the currently used risk scores for CRLM have little predictive value in 3-year survivors of CRLM with regards to the disease-specific survival and therefore are not suitable to decide whether long-term follow-up is appropriate. In the current study, the nodal status of the primary CRC showed to be the only significant prognostic factor with respect to developing late disease recurrence. The DFI was nonsignificant in multivariable analysis but showed a trend towards significance. The interval between resection of the primary tumour and occurrence of CRLM has been used in most CRS, as a DFI of less than a year increases the chance of developing recurrent disease shortly after hepatectomy.–The results in this study indicate an opposite effect in patients with 3 years of DFS, as patients with a short interval (< 12 months) between the primary CRC and the occurrence of CRLM had a favourable outcome in this particular group of patients. Although counterintuitive, this finding might not be illogical. In many studies, a short DFI is described as a risk factor for early recurrence and a surrogate for aggressive tumour behaviour, inherently. Moreover, this means that if patients with a short DFI develop recurrences, it is more likely that these will occur in the period shortly after partial hepatectomy rather than after a period of 3 years. This study showed that in the period thereafter, patients with a short DFI had a lower risk of developing recurrence, because it is unlikely that patients with initially aggressive tumour behaviour will develop recurrences after remaining disease-free for such a significant period of time. Consequently, patients with a prolonged DFI have a decreased risk in the period shortly after surgery but remain at higher risk of recurrence for an expanded period. Considering the more latent tumour behaviour in patients with a prolonged DFI, this might not be implausible. Although patient selection, rather than tumour biology, also could explain the observed effect, this finding might be of interest when considering long-term surveillance in patients with CRLM and therefore should be validated in an external cohort of patients.

### Risk factor burden and long-term prognosis of patients with premature coronary artery disease [^9980651f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Factors Associated With Time to First Recurrent Ischemic Event

The factors associated with subsequent events following premature CAD onset are displayed in Table 2. Women with premature CAD were at a higher risk of a subsequent ischemic event compared with men (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03–1.28; P = 0.01). Among traditional risk factors, baseline diabetes mellitus was the only variable independently associated with a first ischemic recurrence. Although infrequently observed, chronic inflammatory disease was strongly associated with a first ischemic recurrence (adjusted HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.23–2.11; P < 0.001). Baseline chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min), multivessel disease, and absence of revascularization after a first event were also associated with poor outcomes.

Table 2
Factors Associated With Time to First Ischemic Recurrence

Factors Associated With the Rate of Multiple Recurrent Events

The factors associated with the rate of multiple recurrent events are displayed in Table 3. Baseline diabetes mellitus, kidney impairment, and multivessel disease were associated with increased rates of multiple ischemic events. The absence of revascularization at the time of index diagnosis was also associated with the occurrence of multiple ischemic events.

Table 3
Factors Associated With Multiple Ischemic Recurrences

Evolution of Cardiovascular Risk Factors After Diagnosis of Obstructive CAD

Across different time points of follow‐up, 31.7% to 37.2% of patients continued smoking after premature CAD onset (Figure 3). Although most of these ongoing smokers were active smokers at baseline, > 10% of patients who had never smoked before reported smoking during each interval assessed. LDL‐C was rarely within latest guideline recommendation in this young population, with 89.3% of patients having LDL‐C ≥ 70 mg/dL during the first year after CAD diagnosis and 84.3% having at least one LDL‐C value ≥ 70 mg/dL between 5 and 10 years after diagnosis. Only half of patients had a level of LDL‐C within 100 mg/dL along follow‐up (Figure S2 and Table S2). Eventually, the cumulative incidence of new‐onset diabetes mellitus in patients without history of diabetes mellitus at baseline was 16% (95% CI, 15%−18%) within 10 years after premature CAD onset (Figure 4).

### A review of genetic mutation in familial Hirschsprung's disease in south Africa: towards genetic counseling [^ec585612]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) represents a complex disorder of signaling molecules, resulting from the effects of at least 9 known susceptibility genes. Affected families carry 200 times higher risk, but genetic counseling via pedigree analysis is difficult and the significance of genetic variations is unclear. This study evaluated a set of patients affected by HSCR with familial recurrence to evaluate factors of greatest value in genetic counseling.

Patients and Methods

One hundred twenty patients with HSCR (including 18 kindreds) were screened for genetic variations of the 2 major susceptibility genes (RET and endothelin B receptor [EDNRB]) and compared with 60 control samples (20 per ethnic group). Familial recurrence patterns were studied for patient sex, pattern of recurrence, presence of associated syndromic features, and genetic features of major susceptibility genes. Polymerase chain reaction and HEX-SSCP analysis were performed on DBA extracted from blood/microdissected tissue samples. SSCP variants were validated and automated sequencing techniques performed on polymerase chain reaction products showing conformational variants in acrylamide gel.

Results

Familial cases had a male-female ratio of 1.5:1, male-to-male transmission (n = 10; 2 father to son), female-to-male transmissions (n = 4; 3 female carriers, female-to-female (n = 4; 2 mother to daughter), and 1 paternal RET deletion-female with very long segment aganglionosis. Increasing gene penetrance occurred in 3 pedigrees. An increased incidence of long segment HSCR was noted in families with recurrence and appeared important. No consistent mendelian trends or specific genetic sites were observed, but 3 suggested autosomal dominant and recessive in a further 3. Identified genetic variations included deletions, frame shifts, and missense mutations, as well as a number of significant single nucleotide polymorphism variations. Transmitted RET mutations occurred in 5 (30%) of 16 kindreds. Splice RET mutation plus variants of exon 17 (973L) affected 2 children with identical total colonic aganglionosis. In a 3-generation family, variations in RET exons 6, 13, and 18 (928) affected 3 male children with increasing penetration to recur as total intestinal aganglionosis in a grandchild.

Conclusions

Mendelian transmission appears mediated by the RET proto-oncogene. EDNRB mutations suggest haplotypic gene-gene interaction. Genetic counseling remains a challenge in HSCR because of its multfactorial etiology.

### The use of hormonal therapy with radiotherapy for prostate cancer: analysis of prospective randomised trials [^2264b446]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with prostate cancer are usually divided into risk groups in order to determine their chance of recurrence and appropriate therapy. Although there are many methods to define the risk groups, they all separate patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk categories. Recurrences after therapy can be defined as local (prostate only), regional (lymph nodes) or distant (bone metastasis).

Low-risk patients do extremely well with treatment and have a low risk of a recurrence locally, regionally or distantly. It is generally accepted that these patients do not benefit from the addition of hormonal therapy, although hormonal therapy in low-risk patients has not been formally tested. Intermediate-risk patients have a greater potential for local-regional recurrences and distant recurrences. High-risk patients confront a significant risk of distant recurrence. While local-regional failure can occur in high-risk patients, distant disease is the main problem for these patients.

In this article, we will discuss prospective randomised trials demonstrating that intermediate-risk patients benefit from short-term androgen deprivation and high-risk patients benefit from long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD). These observations suggest that short-term androgen deprivation reduces the risk of a local-regional recurrence, while LTAD is effective in treating systemic disease.

### Nonfatal myocardial infarction and long-term outcomes in coronary artery disease [^2cee71f0]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Therapies may reduce short-term rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) without a detectable effect on mortality. We sought to estimate the long-term clinical implications of nonfatal MI occurring within the first 3 and 6 months after initial cardiac catheterization.

Methods

We included consecutive patients with significant coronary artery disease (≥ 75% stenosis in ≥ 1 epicardial segments) undergoing diagnostic catheterization between January 1, 1999, and September 30, 2006. Landmark analyses were performed for patients surviving at 3- and 6-month follow-up. At these times, patients were divided into groups based upon occurrence of a nonfatal MI subsequent to catheterization.

Results

Among 14,890 patients alive at 3 months (669 with MI and 14,221 without an MI), having an MI during the initial 3-month period was a significant predictor of reduced 4-year survival (77.1% vs 83.5%, hazard ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21–1.63, P < .001), survival free of MI (68.4% vs 78.5%, hazard ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.32–1.71, P < .001), and survival free of MI or revascularization (59.7% vs 68.5%, hazard ratio 1.34, 95% CI 1.19–1.51, P < .001). Adjusted hazard ratios were similar for patients surviving to 6 months (804 with MI and 13,842 without an MI).

Conclusions

Nonfatal MIs occurring within the first 3 and 6 months after diagnostic catheterization are associated with a significant increase in the risk for subsequent clinical events. Clinical studies with limited follow-up periods may underestimate the long-term value of therapies that reduce early MI rates as downstream benefits continue to accrue over time.

### Severe metabolic alkalosis and recurrent acute on chronic kidney injury in a patient with Crohn's disease [^e30665ea]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Short bowel syndrome is a rare and devastating complication in chronic inflammatory bowel disease following functional or anatomic loss of extensive segments of the small intestine. The incidence is estimated at 2–3 per million. The most common causes of short-bowel syndrome in adults include Crohn's disease, mesenteric ischemia, trauma, radiation enteritis and recurrent intestinal obstruction. The clinical characteristics of short bowel syndrome are defined by malabsorption, diarrhea, steatorrhea, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and malnutrition. Patients are at risk to develop short bowel syndrome if the length of viable small intestine is less than 200 cm. Under such conditions the absorptive capacity and intestinal adaptation is profoundly compromised and often necessitates total parenteral nutrition. With the advent of new immunosuppressive regimens intestinal transplantation has become the main therapeutic option in patients with irreversible intestinal failure. Current 1-year graft survival rates are as high as 80–90%.

### Evaluating long-term construct stability in metastatic spine cancer patients with carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone instrumentation [^31c8884b]. Neurosurgical Focus (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Metastatic spine disease significantly impacts the oncological population, often requiring surgical intervention to address spinal instability. Traditional constructs, including titanium-based long-segment instrumentation and short-segment cement augmentation, have been the mainstay in managing these patients. Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (CFR-PEEK) hardware and shorter-segment instrumentation have demonstrated benefits of improved surveillance, earlier recurrence detection, and shorter operative time. This study evaluated the long-term experience of a single center with CFR-PEEK constructs in patients with metastatic spine disease. It also investigated the clinical durability of short-segment constructs and evaluated the necessity of cement augmentation in maintaining construct stability.

Methods

This retrospective, single-center study included patients with metastatic disease to the spine who underwent surgical fixation using CFR-PEEK hardware between 2021 and 2024. Inclusion criteria required perioperative radiation therapy and a minimum of 6 months of radiographic follow-up. Patients were stratified into short-construct (n = 13) and long-construct (n = 7) groups based on the number of vertebral levels spanned. Subgroup analysis of cement-augmented versus nonaugmented short constructs was performed. Variables analyzed included preoperative scores (American Spinal Injury Association grade, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, Spine Instability Neoplastic Score, and epidural spinal cord compression grade), estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and postoperative outcomes. Radiographic failure and revision surgery rates were primary endpoints. Statistical analyses were conducted using nonparametric methods.

Results

At 14 months of mean follow-up time, no radiographic failures or revision surgeries were observed within the 20 patients included in this study. Patients in the long-construct group had more vertebral levels involved (2.00 vs 1.15, p = 0.024), lower preoperative Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (58.57 vs 76.15, p = 0.01), and more frequent use of mixed constructs with titanium rods (p = 0.007). Short constructs demonstrated equivalent durability without the routine need for cement augmentation. Within the short-construct cohort, cement augmentation was associated with longer hospital stays (8.8 vs 3.63 days, p = 0.008) but did not reduce failure rates.

Conclusions

CFR-PEEK instrumentation demonstrates excellent durability and stability in metastatic spine disease, even in patients receiving perioperative radiation therapy. Short-segment instrumentation demonstrates comparable durability to long-segment constructs while reducing operative risks and hospitalization duration. While cement augmentation has traditionally been used to enhance construct strength, the findings in this study suggest that its routine use may not be necessary in short-segment constructs; however, larger studies are needed to better understand long-term outcomes, optimize construct selection, and identify factors influencing hardware failure in this high-risk population.

### Hirschsprung disease: common and uncommon variants [^99ace25a]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-segment and total colonic HSCR

Though the definition of long-segment HSCR varies in the literature, the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence Based Practice Committee defines long-segment disease as aganglionosis from sigmoid colon-descending colon junction up to the cecum with ganglion cells present in the colon, or in other words, aganglionosis that extends above the sigmoid colon but does not involve the entire colon. This is in contrast to total colonic HSCR, which is defined as aganglionosis of the entire colon and less than 5 cm of distal small intestine and small intestinal HSCR which is defined as aganglionosis involving greater than 5 cm of small intestine(table 1).

Table 1
Recommend nomenclature for common and uncommon variants of Hirschsprung disease

About 15% of HSCR is long-segment. In contrast to short-segment HSCR, contrast enema is less accurate in predicting the transition zone for long-segment and total colonic aganglionosis and the rectosigmoid ratio may be normal in these variants. Instead, a microcolon or a comma-shaped colon may be seen. Optimum timing of pull-through surgery for long-segment HSCR is complex and depends on several factors. In many cases, intestinal diversion is needed as rectal irrigations may not be effective for decompressing long-segment HSCR. Most surgeons recommend a temporary ileostomy and full-thickness colonic mapping if ganglion cells cannot be identified proximal to the splenic flexure. In operations for long-segment HSCR, blood supply to the pull-through segment is an important consideration. Disease extending to the descending colon requires mobilization of the splenic flexure and may require ligation of the left colic artery. Disease extending to the transverse colon or ascending colon may require ligation of the middle colic artery or right colic artery, respectively. Furthermore, de-rotation of the colon is required to prevent obstruction of the distal duodenum and twisting of the mesentery around the ileocolic artery. In all of these scenarios, special care must be taken to preserve the marginal artery which will supply the pull-through segment.

Sensitivity Analyses

A total of 41 patients (5%) experienced > 1 adverse event over time. Sensitivity analyses were performed to calculate the cumulative 3.2‐year risk of experiencing multiple adverse events by the number of lesions (≥ 3 or 2 versus 1 lesion) using an unadjusted and multivariable adjusted Cox‐based intensity‐elapsed time model. The mean cumulative incidence of multiple adverse events by the number of lesions was significantly higher for patients with ≥ 3 lesions (log‐rank test P = 0.0001) (Figure S2). Apart from the risk of experiencing a first adverse event, having ≥ 3 lesions (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.20–2.36, P = 0.003) was also associated with an increased cumulative risk of experiencing > 1 adverse event during 3.2 years of follow‐up. Other relevant indicators of an increased cumulative risk were age, prior MI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and smoking (Table S1 shows full model results).

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: clinical outcomes and risk of recurrence [^f88ac562]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is underdiagnosed and an important cause of myocardial infarction (MI), especially in young women. Long-term cardiovascular outcomes, including recurrent SCAD, are inadequately reported.

Objectives

This study sought to describe the acute and long-term cardiovascular outcomes and assess the predictors of recurrent SCAD.

Methods

Nonatherosclerotic SCAD patients were prospectively followed at Vancouver General Hospital systematically to ascertain baseline, predisposing and precipitating stressors, angiographic features, revascularization, use of medication, and in-hospital and long-term cardiovascular events. Clinical predictors for recurrent de novo SCAD were tested using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models.

Results

The authors prospectively followed 327 SCAD patients. Average age was 52.5 ± 9.6 years, and 90.5% were women (56.9% postmenopausal). All presented with MI; 25.7% had ST-segment elevation MI, 74.3% had non-ST-segment elevation MI, and 8.9% had ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Precipitating emotional stressors were reported in 48.3% and physical stressors in 28.1%. Fibromuscular dysplasia was present in 62.7%, connective tissue disorder in 4.9%, and systemic inflammatory disease in 11.9%. The majority (83.1%) were initially treated medically, with only 16.5% or 2.2% undergoing in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, respectively. The majority of SCAD patients were taking aspirin and beta-blocker therapy at discharge and at follow-up. Median hospital stay was 3.0 days, and the overall major adverse event rate was 7.3%. Median long-term follow-up was 3.1 years, and overall major adverse cardiac event rate was 19.9% (death rate: 1.2%; recurrent MI: 16.8%; stroke/transient ischemic attack: 1.2%; revascularization: 5.8%). Recurrent SCAD occurred in 10.4% of patients. In multivariate modeling, only hypertension increased (hazard ratio: 2.46; p = 0.011) and beta-blocker use diminished (hazard ratio: 0.36; p = 0.004) recurrent SCAD.

Conclusions

In our large prospectively followed SCAD cohort, long-term cardiovascular events were common. Hypertension increased the risk of recurrent SCAD, whereas beta-blocker therapy appeared to be protective.

### Abstract… [^e5898225]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Hirschsprung's disease occurs in one out of 5, 000 births. 1 The disease is caused by the failure of ganglion cells to migrate cephalocaudally through the neural crest during weeks four to 12 of gestation, 2 causing an absence of ganglion cells in all or part of the colon. Varying lengths of the distal colon are unable to relax, causing functional colonic obstruction over time. Epidemiology The cause of Hirschsprung's disease is multifactorial, and the disease can be familial or develop spontaneously. 2 It is more common in boys than girls. 1 Approximately 3 to 5 percent of male siblings and 1 percent of female siblings of children with short-segment disease also have the disease. 5 However, the risk is substantially higher in siblings of children with total colonic involvement.
6. Eight genomes have been associated with Hirschsprung's disease 1, 2; however, most cases are not considered familial.

Current research is focusing on the RET proto-oncogene on chromosome 10q11.
2. 2, 7 Hirschsprung's disease associated with this gene has been linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia, type IIA. 7 Research on the value of screening for this mutation to determine the risk of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type IIA, is ongoing. 3, 8, 9. Hirschsprung's disease also can be associated with neurologic, cardiovascular, urologic, and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with the disease, accounting for approximately 10 percent of patients.

1 Other conditions that have been linked to Hirschsprung's disease include congenital deafness, hydrocephalus, diverticulum of the bladder, Meckel's diverticulum, imperforate anus, ventricular septal defect, renal agenesis, cryptorchidism, Waardenburg's syndrome, neuroblastomas, and Ondine's curse. 3, 4. A "transition zone" may be visible on a contrast enema radiograph; however, the aganglionic colon will extend beyond this point in about 10 percent of patients.

### Preface: concepts and controversies in Hirschsprung disease [^b1195abf]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

With this foundation in place, we move on to a review on the current management of short segment HSCR. Dr Etskovitz's article discusses established preoperative management while addressing current controversies such as the optimal timing for surgical reconstruction. The commonly performed surgical procedures are discussed, along with data regarding early outcomes. Dr Cheng and Dr Wood dive into the less-common features of the disease, summarizing the definition and nuanced management of long-segment and total colonic HSCR. They also discuss the management of patients with total intestinal aganglionosis and those with megarectum due to delayed diagnosis.

Despite meticulous surgical technique, pull-through procedures carry the risk of serious complications. Drs Rialon and Langer instruct us on technical pitfalls that can occur during surgical reconstruction and the associated early and late complications that result. They offer practical tools and advice to avoid these errors and improve surgical outcomes. Dr Ziogas and colleagues then give an eloquent overview of the dreaded complication of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC). Their article discusses the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), which is rooted in intestinal dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and impaired mucosal immunity. They review the diagnostic criteria and current management, while commenting on the continued search for reliable prevention.

Much of the care of patients with HSCR remains controversial due to disease heterogeneity and limited data. Should patients with delayed diagnosis undergo multistage procedures? Do all transition zone pull-throughs need to be redone? How should sphincter dysfunction (both native non-relaxing and surgically damaged) be managed? Dr Xu and colleagues explore these controversies and many more, offering evidence-based recommendations, where possible. Perhaps most controversial are the conditions which clinically resemble HSCR but do not meet the diagnostic criteria. Dr Onishi and Dr Satoshi's article educates us on these allied disorders of HSCR in terms of presentation, diagnostic criteria, and management options.

Perioperative complications for patients with HSCR are now far less common, but long-term intestinal dysfunction and diminished quality of life remain a major concern. Drs Pakarinen and Mutanen guide us through the incredibly important topic of long-term outcomes in these patients. They explore concerns regarding genitourinary dysfunction, infertility, and persistent obstructive symptoms through the lens of quality of life. They also discuss associated conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis risk, presentation, and initial management — patients with Trisomy 21 and congenital malformations, prior history of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, long-segment disease, and those with obstructive symptoms are at increased risk of developing Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis. The presentation can range from mild nonspecific symptoms to abdominal distention, fever, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, vomiting, lethargy, and septic shock. Early recognition and prompt intervention with hydration, antibiotics, and rectal irrigations are the mainstay of management, and Gosain et al developed a guideline for diagnosing and grading of Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (probable, definite, severe) based on clinical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings and proposed a guideline for management based on the diagnostic grading.

Figure 1
Illustration of various techniques for pull through procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease. Ganglia are depicted as yellow dots. (A) The Swenson procedure achieves end-to-end anastomosis by resecting the aganglionic bowel down to the sphincters. (B) The Duhamel procedure involves creating a retrorectal reservoir to connect ganglionic bowel to the rectum while preserving part of the aganglionic rectum. (C) The Yancey-Soave procedure creates a submucosal tunnel for the pull through of the ganglionic bowel while sparing the aganglionic rectal muscular cuff.

The challenge of the deep pelvic dissection posed by the original Swenson procedure was first addressed by a modification proposed by Dr Duhamel in 1956. Like the Swenson, the Duhamel procedure removes the aganglionic bowel but suspends dissection at the level of the peritoneal reflection, thereby avoiding a deep pelvic dissection. A retrorectal anastomosis is created between the ganglionic proximal bowel and aganglionic rectal pouch, which is performed by incising the posterior wall of the rectal pouch and pulling the ganglionic bowel through the presacral space to the rectal incision to create an end-to-side anastomosis(figure 1B). Initially, the Duhamel technique involved leaving a pair of clamps at the anastomosis with the handles externalized via the baby's anus for several weeks. The modern Duhamel procedure is performed using bowel stapling devices.

There are many advantages to the Duhamel pull through including the absence of pelvic dissection reducing the risk of damage to pelvic structures, and the large anastomosis reducing the risk of stricture formation. However, this is the only reconstructive technique that places the anastomosis in the pelvis, which increases the risk of pelvic infections; though this complication has been documented with other techniques. Notably, the creation of a reservoir for stool may decrease the risk of postoperative fecal incontinence, which is particularly beneficial for patients with longer segment disease. Unfortunately, many patients develop fecal stasis in the aganglionic pouch causing dilation and chronic fecal impaction. Thus, the intraoperative goal is to keep the rectal stump as short as possible while making the anastomosis between the pulled through colon and the aganglionic rectum as wide as possible, as outcomes are best for patient with small rectal pouches that empty well.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) postoperative therapy after complete resection without preoperative imatinib — the guidelines recommend postoperative imatinib for patients at intermediate or high risk of recurrence (category 1), and the panel recommends that postoperative imatinib for at least 36 months should be considered for patients with high-risk GIST. In the ACOSOG Z9001 study, risk stratification was based only on tumor size and postoperative imatinib improved RFS in patients with GIST 3 cm or larger; however, it was statistically significant in patients with intermediate (6 cm or greater and less than 10 cm) and high risk (greater than 10 cm) of recurrence. In the SSGXVIII/AIO study, risk stratification was based on tumor size, site, mitotic count, and rupture; survival benefit was seen in patients with high risk of recurrence (mitotic index of > 5 mitoses/50 HPF, size > 5 cm, non-gastric location, and tumor rupture). Risk stratification after surgical resection should be based on tumor mitotic rate, size, and location; for completely resected disease without preoperative imatinib, postoperative imatinib is recommended for intermediate or high-risk disease (category 1), while observation can be considered for completely resected, low-risk disease.
