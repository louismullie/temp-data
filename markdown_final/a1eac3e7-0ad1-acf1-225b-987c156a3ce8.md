## Question

Why is stool so sticky

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why stool is sticky. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "sticky" means in clinical and physiologic terms. Then, I should verify the key components of stool that confer adhesiveness, especially mucus and water content. Next, I will examine how transit time and the microbiome shape consistency. After that, I should review common causes of sticky stool, including mucous diarrhea, steatorrhea, and medications. Finally, I will consider red flags, diagnostic implications, and practical management, making sure I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality sources where possible.

> Let me first confirm what patients mean by "sticky". In practice, "sticky" typically reflects increased mucus, a softer, adherent consistency, or visible coating that clings to toilet surfaces, which aligns with descriptions of mucous or greasy stools and with the Bristol Stool Form Scale categories that capture soft, mushy, or unformed stools rather than hard, dry pellets, so I should keep BSS types 5–7 in mind when interpreting this complaint [^114tAd6N] [^113dGVDL].

> Now, I need to check the main adhesive components. Mucus is the primary contributor to stickiness; the colonic mucus barrier is a gel rich in mucins that lubricates and protects the epithelium, and its quantity and quality are dynamically regulated by the microbiome and diet, so changes in mucus production or composition can make stool visibly mucous and sticky [^116sAtDF]. Water content also matters; stool consistency is fundamentally determined by the amount of non-bound "free" water, with more water yielding softer, stickier stools that take the shape of the container, which is why diarrheal stools are described as sticky in both clinical and surveillance contexts [^115TLApB] [^111RDGSK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causation without considering transit and microbiota. Faster colonic transit reduces water absorption and increases mucus delivery, producing softer, stickier stools, whereas slow transit leads to desiccation and hard, lumpy stools; stool consistency correlates with microbiome richness and composition, suggesting transit-mediated shifts in microbial metabolism and mucus handling contribute to stickiness [^1169on4N] [^113x3KtV]. I should confirm that BSS types 6–7 map to faster transit and higher water activity, which they do in physiologic studies and clinical use [^1169on4N] [^114tAd6N].

> Next, I should review common reasons stool becomes sticky. Mucous diarrhea from infections or inflammation increases mucus and softness, making stools adherent; classic examples include shigellosis and other invasive bacterial diarrheas, and guidelines emphasize recognizing mucoid stools in the evaluation of infectious diarrhea and dysentery, which fits the "sticky" descriptor patients use [^117PgWKs] [^1147dqkc]. Steatorrhea from fat malabsorption produces greasy, oily stools that float and are difficult to flush, which patients often describe as sticky; I need to remember to ask about oil droplets, foul odor, and flushing difficulty to surface this phenotype [^115a3yt6]. But wait, what if medications are the driver? Opioids, iron, and sevelamer can alter consistency and color, and patients may perceive these changes as stickiness, so I should double-check the medication list and timing [^117MEGfi] [^112xvgCB] [^113N26eu].

> I will now examine red flags and diagnostic implications. New-onset sticky, mucous, or greasy stools, especially with blood, fever, weight loss, or nocturnal symptoms, warrant targeted testing for infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or malabsorption; guidelines recommend stool studies for dysentery or severe disease and advise considering ova and parasites in the right epidemiologic context, while also reminding us that routine O&P testing is low yield without risk factors [^1147dqkc] [^116QZx9f]. Persistent watery, mucous, or greasy diarrhea beyond 4 weeks merits a structured evaluation for chronic diarrhea causes, including microscopic colitis, celiac disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, with history-guided testing and judicious use of endoscopy and labs [^115TLApB] [^116Si5YT].

> Let me consider management principles, and I should confirm I'm aligning with evidence. For acute mucous or watery diarrhea, oral rehydration is foundational, and antidiarrheals can be used selectively once invasive infection is excluded; for chronic symptoms, normalize stool consistency toward BSS 3–4 when feasible using fiber, osmotic agents, or antidiarrheals as indicated, and address underlying causes such as celiac disease, EPI, or IBS with targeted therapy [^1126Ddg7] [^113dGVDL] [^116Si5YT]. For steatorrhea, I need to ensure fat intake is moderated and enzyme replacement is initiated if EPI is present, while also checking for and treating secondary causes like SIBO or celiac disease that perpetuate fat malabsorption and sticky stools [^116Si5YT].

> In summary, I should double-check that my synthesis is coherent: stool stickiness arises from increased mucus, higher free water content due to faster transit, and altered microbial metabolism, with common clinical drivers including mucous diarrhea from infection or inflammation, steatorrhea from malabsorption, and medication effects. Recognizing these patterns, using BSS to quantify consistency, and applying guideline-based testing and treatment allows me to both explain why stool is sticky and to intervene safely and effectively [^116sAtDF] [^1169on4N] [^114tAd6N] [^1147dqkc] [^116Si5YT].

Sticky stool is most often due to **excess mucus** from inflammation or infection [^116sAtDF], **malabsorption of fats** (steatorrhea) [^115a3yt6], or **rapid transit** causing incomplete water absorption [^1169on4N]. Common causes include **IBS**, **IBD**, **celiac disease**, **pancreatic insufficiency**, **bacterial infections** (e.g. Shigella) [^117PgWKs], and medications such as **orlistat** or **metformin**. Persistent sticky stool warrants evaluation for underlying disease, especially if accompanied by red flags (blood, weight loss, anemia) [^112Rbjc6].

---

## Physiological factors influencing stool consistency

Several **physiological factors** contribute to stool consistency, including:

- **Water content**: The colon absorbs water, and the amount of free water determines stool form [^115TLApB]; more water yields softer, stickier stools [^1169on4N].

- **Mucus content**: Mucus lubricates and protects the intestinal lining; excess mucus increases stickiness [^116sAtDF].

- **Fat content**: Normally, dietary fats are absorbed; malabsorption increases fecal fat, causing greasy, sticky stools that float and are hard to flush [^115a3yt6].

- **Transit time**: Rapid transit reduces water absorption, yielding softer, stickier stools [^1169on4N].

---

## Common causes of sticky stool

Sticky stool can result from **various conditions**, including:

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal infections | - Shigella [^117PgWKs] <br/> - Campylobacter <br/> - Salmonella <br/> - Giardia [^116Si5YT] | Inflammation and mucus production |
| Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) | - Crohn's disease <br/> - Ulcerative colitis | Chronic inflammation, mucus, and fat malabsorption |
| Malabsorption syndromes | - Celiac disease <br/> - Pancreatic insufficiency <br/> - Bile acid malabsorption | Fat malabsorption (steatorrhea) [^115a3yt6] |
| Functional gastrointestinal disorders | - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [^112Rbjc6] | Altered motility and mucus production [^116sAtDF] |
| Medications | - Orlistat <br/> - Metformin <br/> - Antibiotics | Altered fat absorption or gastrointestinal motility |
| Dietary factors | - High-fat diet <br/> - Excessive alcohol | Increased fat content or altered digestion |

---

## Clinical significance and diagnostic implications

Persistent sticky stool may indicate **underlying pathology** and warrants evaluation:

- **Infectious diarrhea**: Mucous or sticky stools with blood suggest bacterial infection (e.g. Shigella) [^117PgWKs] and warrant stool testing [^1147dqkc].

- **Malabsorption**: Greasy, sticky stools suggest fat malabsorption [^115a3yt6]; evaluate for celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, or bile acid disorders [^116Si5YT].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Chronic sticky stools with abdominal pain, weight loss, or blood suggest IBD and require colonoscopy with biopsy [^114CnLju].

- **Functional disorders**: IBS may present with mucus and altered stool form; diagnosis is symptom-based after excluding organic disease [^116mMFZM].

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring medical evaluation

Seek medical evaluation if sticky stool is accompanied by any of the following **red flags**:

- Blood in stool or rectal bleeding [^116Fio8C]

- Unintentional weight loss

- Persistent abdominal pain or cramping

- Anemia or fatigue

- Fever or signs of infection

- Recent travel or antibiotic use

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** includes:

- **History**: Diet, medications, travel, family history, and symptom duration [^116Si5YT].

- **Physical examination**: Abdominal and rectal exam [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, liver function, thyroid, celiac serology, stool studies (culture, ova/parasites, C. difficile, fecal fat) [^1147dqkc].

- **Imaging/endoscopy**: Colonoscopy with biopsies if IBD or microscopic colitis is suspected [^117835uS].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Infections**: Targeted antibiotics if indicated; rehydration [^1126Ddg7].

- **Malabsorption**: Dietary modification, enzyme replacement, treatment of underlying cause [^116Si5YT].

- **IBD**: Anti-inflammatory medications, immunosuppressants, or biologics [^notfound].

- **IBS**: Dietary changes, antidiarrheals, and symptom control [^notfound].

---

Sticky stool reflects **excess mucus, fat, or water** and can signal infection, malabsorption, inflammation, or functional disease. Persistent symptoms or red flags warrant **targeted evaluation** to identify and treat the cause.

### Keeping the cecum clean: a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trial of loperamide as part of preparation for colonoscopy [^113DXFnK]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Coating of the cecum with sticky bile causes a problem with inspection of the mucosa during colonoscopy.

Purpose

This study aimed to see whether 4 mg of loperamide taken after colonoscopy preparation would delay the passage of bile and improve the quality of cecal preparation.

Patients

Patients undergoing office colonoscopy were included. Patients with incomplete colonoscopies or right colectomy were excluded.

Study Design

This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial.

Intervention

Either 2 placebo capsules or 2 loperamide capsules were taken after gut lavage, as soon as the passage of liquid stool ceased. Cecal photographs were scored in a blinded fashion.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcomes measured were the quality of cecal preparation on a scale of 1 to 5 and overall preparation on a scale of 1 to 4.

Results

Ninety-eight patients took loperamide (50 men, 48 women) and 102 took placebo (57 men, 45 women). Mean ages of the loperamide group were: men, 61.9 ± 11.9 years, and women, 61.8 ± 10.0 years; and mean ages of the placebo group were: men, 62.5 ± 12.1 years, and women, 58.6 ± 9.8 years. Over 90% of patients used a polyethylene glycol-based preparation. Thirteen of 102 (12.7%) placebo cases had a dirty or coated cecum (score 4 or 5). In the loperamide group, this number was 2 of 98 (2.0%; p = 0.0041). Nineteen placebo cases (18.6%) had an overall fair/poor preparation in comparison with 9 of the loperamide group (9.2%; p = 0.0543). Days to first bowel movement were 2.4 ± 1.1 for loperamide and 2.5 ± 1.7 for placebo (p = 0.7224). Fifty-eight percent of loperamide patients had polyps, and 74% of these patients had multiple polyps; 67% of placebo patients had polyps, but only 54% of these patients had multiple polyps (vs loperamide, p = 0.0183).

Conclusion

Judicious use of loperamide can significantly improve the quality of cecal preparation and may increase polyp yield.

### A "rare" case of melena in a 3-year-old [^116zMWmW]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Melena is a potential sign of life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleeding; however, there are numerous substances ingested resulting in a stool appearance similar to melena. Examples of such substances include black licorice, bismuth subsalicylate, and iron supplements. We report a case of a well-appearing 3-year-old Vietnamese girl presenting to our emergency department after 2 episodes of "black, sticky" stool. The cause of her "melena" was determined after father revealed that she had ingested 2 bowls of pork blood soup during the preceding 12 hours. This case highlights the need for a careful dietary history and cultural considerations in children presenting with what may appear to be melena.

### Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners? [^116sAtDF]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

The gastrointestinal tract is often considered as a key organ involved in the digestion of food and providing nutrients to the body for proper maintenance. However, this system is composed of organs that are extremely complex. Among the different parts, the intestine is viewed as an incredible surface of contact with the environment and is colonised by hundreds of trillions of gut microbes. The role of the gut barrier has been studied for decades, but the exact mechanisms involved in the protection of the gut barrier are various and complementary. Among them, the integrity of the mucus barrier is one of the first lines of protection of the gastrointestinal tract. In the past, this 'slimy' partner was mostly considered a simple lubricant for facilitating the progression of the food bolus and the stools in the gut. Since then, different researchers have made important progress, and currently, the regulation of this mucus barrier is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community. Among the factors influencing the mucus barrier, the microbiome plays a major role in driving mucus changes. Additionally, our dietary habits (ie, high-fat diet, low-fibre/high-fibre diet, food additives, pre- probiotics) influence the mucus at different levels. Given that the mucus layer has been linked with the appearance of diseases, proper knowledge is highly warranted. Here, we debate different aspects of the mucus layer by focusing on its chemical composition, regulation of synthesis and degradation by the microbiota as well as some characteristics of the mucus layer in both physiological and pathological situations.

### Fly control to prevent diarrhoea in children [^1156xp7s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Baseline characteristics of participants

The baseline diarrhoea incidence during the month at the start of the study was 0.4 episodes per child per month in both groups.

Studied outcomes

The study monitored fly density with standard sticky fly‐papers, which were hung in areas of the compounds where fly resting sites were either suspected or identified through faecal deposits. The number of flies stuck to the papers after 24 hours was noted as outcome. The study also reported the incidence of diarrhoea in children less than five years of age residing in the intervention and control villages. The study personnel conducted weekly interviews with mothers, who reported the days on which their child/children had diarrhoea during the week being studied. Diarrhoea incidence was derived by the authors from the daily diarrhoea data, and they considered two days free of diarrhoea as an indicator of the end of an episode.

Excluded studies

We excluded 36 studies after full‐text assessment for the reasons outlined in the ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table.

Risk of bias in included studies

Figure 3 shows a summary of the 'Risk of bias' assessments.

'Risk of bias' summary: review authors' judgements about each 'Risk of bias' item for each included study.

Allocation

Randomization was done by picking names of villages from a hat during a meeting. There was no allocation concealment.

Blinding

There was no blinding of the participants or the personnel. Due to the nature of the interventions and the outcomes, it is unclear how non‐blinding could have biased the results.

Incomplete outcome data

During the course of the study, 186 children reached five years of age, 24 died, and 145 moved away from the study area. Moreover, some other families moved into the villages and children were born. Due to the nature of the outcomes studied (diarrhoea in children was noted every week to calculate incidence), it is unclear how this may have biased the results.

Selective reporting

A published protocol was not available, but the expected outcomes were reported.

Other potential sources of bias

No other potential sources of bias.

Effects of interventions

See: Table 1

We could not pool data or perform meta‐analyses due to inclusion of just one study. We have provided a narrative synthesis of the Chavasse 1999 findings.

### How to use the bristol stool chart in childhood constipation [^112PZ4n5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Constipation in children is common and is a frequent cause for healthcare attendances in both primary and secondary care. The Bristol Stool Chart has become ubiquitous as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of constipation, but many clinicians may not be aware of its origins or strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we outline the history and rationale behind the development of the Bristol Stool Chart and how it should be used in childhood constipation.

### Adapting and evaluating a rapid, low-cost method to enumerate flies in the household setting [^115zy6mn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in developing countries. Over 700,000 deaths worldwide were attributable to diarrheal disease in 2013, and 50% of deaths of children < 5 years from diarrhea occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in 2011. Most diarrheal pathogens are transmitted through the fecal–oral route. Interventions therefore focus on the separation of human waste from the environment through the provision of clean water, latrine improvement, and proper hygiene. However, flies are also an important, yet sometimes overlooked, vector for transmission of diarrheal-disease-causing pathogens within households. Intervention studies have demonstrated that reductions in fly activity due to trapping, spraying, or improved sanitation can reduce diarrhea by 22–42%.–

Flies land on feces, food, and household surfaces that humans are in contact with daily. Filth flies in the families Muscidae (houseflies), Sarcophagidae (flesh flies), and Calliphoridae (bottle flies) all thrive when living in close proximity to humans. These flies take advantage of breeding and feeding opportunities in human waste, especially when feces are not safely contained. Studies consistently show that these flies can carry microorganisms and deposit them with their mouth or legs when landing on surfaces.–In one German study, researchers tested wild-caught flies from 12 species for pathogenic and nonpathogenic microorganisms. Every fly tested transmitted at least two species of bacteria when landing on blood agar plates. Many pathogens known to cause clinical diarrhea have been detected on flies, including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia.–

There is no standardized method for measuring fly densities in the household setting. Methods and reported implementation details vary widely between studies, and researchers often do not clearly justify their methods. Most methods were developed to provide a tool to judge whether farms and other food producers met minimum hygiene requirements for their industry. These tools are now used in industrial settings as well as community health research (e.g. assessing the impact of fly control interventions in low-income settings). Measurement methods exploit fly behavior, such as an attraction to food or animal waste or the tendency to land on straight edges. Techniques reported in the literature include bucket traps baited with fly attractants, sticky tape or sticky paper traps, and counting flies that land on a specialized grill.–The ideal fly enumeration method should be fast, inexpensive, and portable while providing an accurate measurement of fly density.

### Fecal microbiota transplantation: just a fancy trend? [^1145mKXR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

The risks and advantages of the administration of fecal material of healthy people to patients are heavily debated. In adults, recurrent Clostridium difficile has become an accepted indication. In addition to all of the possible indications, many other questions need to be answered before pediatric indications and recommendations can be established. Optimal donor selection, fresh versus frozen stools versus capsules containing only microbiota, volume, and route of administration are just a few examples of the areas with missing data to allow in formulating recommendations for fecal microbiota or fecal material administration in children. A careful but not-too-complex regulation is the first priority in order to minimize the risk of administration of fecal slurry from unselected donors at home without medical supervision.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for irritable bowel syndrome, more specifically with respect to classification, ACG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that Bristol stool scale categorizes stool appearance into the following types:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Type 1|- Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass)|
|Type 2|- Sausage-shaped but lumpy|
|Type 3|- Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface|
|Type 4|- Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft|
|Type 5|- Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily)|
|Type 6|- Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool|
|Type 7|- Watery, no solid pieces (entirely liquid).|

### Mild dehydration: a risk factor of constipation? [^111fnCGG]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Constipation defined as changes in the frequency, volume, weight, consistency and ease of passage of the stool occurs in any age group. The most important factors known to promote constipation are reduced physical activity and inadequate dietary intake of fibres, carbohydrates and fluids. Fluid losses induced by diarrhoea and febrile illness alter water balance and promote constipation. When children increase their water consumption above their usual intake, no change in stool frequency and consistency was observed. The improvement of constipation by increasing water intake, therefore, may be effective in children only when voluntary fluid consumption is lower-than-normal for the child's age and activity level. In the elderly, low fluid intake, which may be indicative of hypohydration, was a cause of constipation and a significant relationship between liquid deprivation from 2500 to 500 mL per day and constipation was reported. Dehydration is also observed when saline laxatives are used for the treatment of constipation if fluid replacement is not maintained and may affect the efficacy of the treatment. While sulphate in drinking water does not appear to have a significant laxative effect, fluid intake and magnesium sulphate-rich mineral waters were shown to improve constipation in healthy infants. In conclusion, fluid loss and fluid restriction and thus de-or hypohydration increase constipation. It is thus important to maintain euhydration as a prevention of constipation.

### Interventions to improve sanitation for preventing diarrhoea [^1151cLek]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Diarrhoea amongst individuals, whether or not confirmed by microbiological or clinical examination.

The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of diarrhoea is three or more loose or fluid stools (that take the shape of the container) in a 24‐hour period (WHO 1993). However, we defined diarrhoea and an episode in accordance with the case definitions used in each study. We excluded studies that had no clinical outcomes, for example studies that reported only on microbiological pathogens in the stool. Where data are provided, we extracted and analysed data from the studies describing the method of diarrhoea surveillance and reporting, as well as persistent diarrhoea, the appearance of dysentery or blood in stool, and hospital admission or clinical visits in response to diarrhoea.

Secondary outcomes

Mortality (all‐cause or diarrhoea‐related).
Persistent diarrhoea (episodes continuing for 14 days or longer).
Dysentery (bloody diarrhoea).
Hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea (inpatient or outpatient).
Adverse events (harmful effects of an intervention).

Studies that did not report on one of the above primary or secondary outcomes were excluded. If a study mentioned that they collected data for one of the above outcomes but did not report data for the outcome directly (for example, if the study used diarrhoea information to calculate a larger child health index), then we contacted the study authors to attempt to obtain the relevant outcome results from them and only excluded the study if we were unable to obtain outcome results for at least one of the primary or secondary outcomes.

2 Introduction

2.1 Definition

Diarrhoea may be defined in terms of stool frequency, consistency, volume or weight. Patients' concept of diarrhoea often focuses around stool consistency. Indeed, faecal consistency is determined by the water-holding capacity of the stool (ie, the amount of non-bound 'free' water), and this perhaps best defines the concept of diarrhoea. However, quantification of this in clinical practice may prove difficult, hence utility of the Bristol stool chart is recommended — type 5 and above (see online supplementary material).

In the past, stool weights were used (≥ 200 g/day), but this can be misleading as stool weights vary greatly and 'normal' stool volumes can exceed this value, particularly when non-Western diets are encountered. Hence stool weights are not recommended as a measure of diarrhoea.

Further potential for confusion arises from the discrepancy between the medical and 'lay' concepts of diarrhoea, and this needs to be clarified at the initial appraisal. Faecal incontinence in particular is commonly misinterpreted as diarrhoea, while symptoms relating to functional bowel disease can be difficult to distinguish from organic pathology on the basis of history alone.

There is no consensus on the duration of symptoms that define chronic as opposed to acute diarrhoea. However, most groups including this GDG accept that symptoms persisting for longer than 4 weeks suggest a non-infectious aetiology and merit further investigation.

A recent report suggests that both increased frequency and altered consistency is indicative of organic aetiology. Thus a pragmatic definition incorporates these elements: chronic diarrhoea is the persistent alteration from the norm with stool consistency between types 5 and 7 on the Bristol stool chart and increased frequency greater than 4 weeks' duration.

2.2 Prevalence

Chronic diarrhoea is one of the most common reasons for referral to a gastroenterology clinic. Prevalence rates in Western populations are difficult to estimate, partly through population differences but also through difficulties in definition. In two population surveys, Talley et al reported a prevalence of 'chronic diarrhoea' of between 7% and 14% in an elderly population, a proportion of which is likely to include patients with motility disorders (ie, 'functional bowel disease'). Using a definition based on excessive stool frequency without the presence of abdominal pain, estimates of the prevalence of chronic diarrhoea in a Western population are 4–5%.

The trials examined a composite endpoint which defined responders by IBS-related abdominal pain and stool consistency measures. Patients were monthly responders if they met both of the following criteria:

experienced a ≥ 30% decrease from baseline in abdominal pain for ≥ 2 weeks during the month following 2 weeks of treatment
had a weekly mean stool consistency score < 4 (loose stool) for ≥ 2 weeks during the month following 2 weeks of treatment

More patients receiving XIFAXAN were monthly responders for abdominal pain and stool consistency in Trials 1 and 2 (see Table 8).

ª Confidence Interval

ᵇ The p -value for the composite endpoint for Trial 1 and 2 was < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively.

Trial 3 - Results

In TARGET 3, 2,579 patients were scheduled to receive an initial 14-day course of open-label XIFAXAN followed by 4 weeks of treatment-free follow-up. At the end of the follow-up period, patients were assessed for response to treatment. Patients were considered a responder if they achieved both of the following:

≥ 30% improvement from baseline in the weekly average abdominal pain score based on the daily question: " In regards to your specific IBS symptoms of abdominal pain, on a scale of 0–10, what was your worst IBS-related abdominal pain over the last 24 hours? 'Zero' means you have no pain at all; 'Ten' means the worst possible pain you can imagine".
at least a 50% reduction in the number of days in a week with a daily stool consistency of Bristol Stool Scale type 6 or 7 compared with baseline where 6 = fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; 7 = watery stool, no solid pieces; entirely liquid.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

Abstract

Background

Diarrhoea is a major contributor to the global disease burden, particularly amongst children under five years in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). As many of the infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are transmitted through faeces, sanitation interventions to safely contain and manage human faeces have the potential to reduce exposure and diarrhoeal disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of sanitation interventions for preventing diarrhoeal disease, alone or in combination with other WASH interventions.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Chinese language databases available under the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI‐CAJ). We also searched the meta Register of Controlled Trials (m RCT) and conference proceedings, contacted researchers, and searched references of included studies. The last search date was 16 February 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs, non‐randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before‐and‐after studies (CBAs), and matched cohort studies of interventions aimed at introducing or expanding the coverage and/or use of sanitation facilities in children and adults in any country or population. Our primary outcome of interest was diarrhoea and secondary outcomes included dysentery (bloody diarrhoea), persistent diarrhoea, hospital or clinical visits for diarrhoea, mortality, and adverse events. We included sanitation interventions whether they were conducted independently or in combination with other interventions.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligible studies, extracted relevant data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, described results narratively, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses.

Main results

Fifty‐one studies met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 238,535 participants. Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta‐analysis, including 17 cluster‐RCTs and 33 studies with non‐randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions: (1) providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation, (2) improving participants' existing sanitation facility, or (3) behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions.

Providing access to any sanitation facility

Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster‐RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low‐certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non‐randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants).

Sanitation facility improvement

Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster‐RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low‐certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non‐randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants).

Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided)

Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster‐RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non‐randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations.

Any sanitation intervention

A pooled analysis of cluster‐RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low‐certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Non‐randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non‐randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow‐up times for children under five years.

There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all‐cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants).

Authors' conclusions

There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness.

(A) Picture demonstrating the hydrostatic enema system ready for application. Assembly of the urinary catheter, cortical connector, 3‐way stopcock, and syringe, filled with NaCl 0.9%. (B) Picture of enema administration. The enema is demonstrated on a term infant doll. (C) Picture of enema administration. The enema is performed on an extremely low birth weight infant on its seventh day of life (birth weight: 730 g, gestational age at birth 24 + 6).

The feeding regimen was consistent across groups, beginning with an initial oral intake of approximately 20 mL/kg/day. On the first day of life, infants received 12 oral feedings, ideally of mother's milk; if unavailable, human donor milk or Aptamil Prematil HA® was provided. Parenteral nutrition was administered at 80–100 mL/kg/day on Day 1 and adjusted daily based on oral intake. Once infants achieved a minimum oral intake of 80 mL/kg/day, feeds were fortified with 4% fortifier Frauenmilchsupplement. Daily intake was gradually increased by 15–30 mL/kg, according to the protocol and depending on tolerance, until reaching a target volume of 140–160 mL/kg/day, providing an enteral calorie intake of approximately 120–150 kcal/kg/day. Doctors and nurses assessed and adjusted the type and volume of both oral and parenteral nutrition daily during rounds to meet each infant's needs.

The primary outcome was the protocol's safety, assessed by the rate of GI complications (NEC, FIP, MPS), morbidity, and mortality. NEC was diagnosed at a Bell stage of ≥ IIA.FIP was diagnosed according to radiological and histological findings, but mostly intraoperative findings. The diagnosis of MPS was made in the absence of stool passage for ≥ 72 h.

For the secondary outcome, the protocol's effectiveness, several stool and nutritional parameters were assessed at six points in time: Days 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 20 of life. The first and last MPs (last thick, black sticky stool, no transitional stool) and the total number of stool passages were evaluated. To assess the nutritional outcome, the number of patients having reached full enteral nutrition (120 mL/kg/day), the need for parenteral nutrition, and the last day of parenteral nutrition were looked at.

In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow-up times for children under five years. There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness.

### Clinicopathologic conference: a four-year-old child with digital clubbing [^116KwNem]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary involvement

The presence of clubbing raises concern for pulmonary involvement. This includes underlying pulmonary disease such as cystic fibrosis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or causes of diffuse lung disease. Diffuse lung disease is further characterized as being either intrinsic lung disease (e.g. idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, aspiration syndromes), associated with systemic disease (e.g. connective tissue diseases, metabolic storage diseases), or found in infancy (e.g. due to inborn errors of surfactant metabolism).

Our patient was Caucasian, which could raise suspicion for cystic fibrosis, a condition more common in this racial group. However, she lacked other signs to suggest cystic fibrosis, such as thick or sticky stools or poor growth. Results on a sweat chloride test were indeterminate, but CFTR gene sequencing did not support the presence of a pathologic mutation.

Pulmonary AVMs can result in digital clubbing. Such AVMs can be the result of direct communication between the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins. This is most often due to congenital malformations. Sometimes, pulmonary AVMs can be acquired, such as in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, also known as Rendu‐Osler‐Weber syndrome). They may also be acquired in trauma, metastatic carcinoma, or infections.

Lastly, diffuse lung disease was excluded as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest did not show parenchymal lung disease.

Cardiac involvement

Cyanotic heart lesions have been associated with clubbing. For example, there is a case report of a child with unilateral finger clubbing. This child was ultimately found to have an absent aortic arch and was relying on a patent ductus arteriosus for blood supply. There is also evidence in the literature of patent ductus arteriosus being associated with PHO. While PHO is considered a primary cause of clubbing, it is worth mentioning here that clubbing as the finding of a patent ductus arteriosus should not reassure the clinician that another entity, such as PHO, is not involved. These conditions are not associated with fever, however, lowering our initial suspicion for a primary cardiac cause in this patient. Additionally, her chest radiographic was not concerning for cardiomegaly.

Chronic constipation — tests for medical causes: In the absence of other symptoms and signs, only a complete blood cell count is necessary (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Unless other clinical features warrant otherwise, metabolic tests (glucose, calcium, sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone) are not recommended for chronic constipation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A colonoscopy should not be performed in patients without alarm features (eg, blood in stools, anemia, weight loss) unless age-appropriate colon cancer screening has not been performed (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Recognizing and defining occasional constipation: expert consensus recommendations [^113PDBZJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Constipation is a common problem, affects 15% of the population, and is often self-diagnosed and self-managed. Over the past 3 decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding and management of chronic constipation, with the emerging recognition that occasional constipation (OC) is another subtype that falls outside current classifications. The purpose of this review was to describe the process of developing and proposing a new definition for OC based on expert consensus and taking into consideration the multifactorial nature of the problem such as alterations in bowel habit that include stool frequency and difficulty with stool passage, perception of the sufferer, duration of symptoms, and potential responsiveness to treatment. Leading gastroenterologists from 5 countries met virtually on multiple occasions through an online digital platform to discuss the problem of OC and recommended a practical, user-friendly definition: "OC can be defined as intermittent or occasional symptomatic alteration(s) in bowel habit. This includes a bothersome reduction in the frequency of bowel movements and/or difficulty with passage of stools but without alarming features. Bowel symptoms may last for a few days or a few weeks, and episodes may require modification of lifestyle, dietary habits and/or use of over-the-counter laxatives or bulking agents to restore a satisfactory bowel habit". Prospective studies are required to validate this definition and determine OC prevalence in the community. This review highlights current knowledge gaps and could provide impetus for future research to facilitate an improved understanding of OC and development of evidence-based management guidelines.

Together, our results demonstrate a profound association between stool consistency and all major readouts of gut microbiota composition. As increased colon transit time has been linked to enhanced proteolytic fermentationand associated production of potentially deleterious metabolites, the observed negative correlation between BSS-assessed passage rate and microbiome richness as reported here challenges the currently dominating view of high richness being directly associated to host health. Furthermore, we here identify gut microbial compositional differences with stool consistency on community scale and genus level and evaluate a hypothesised biological mechanism of how transit time might shape the gut microbiota through selective pressure on microbial life-strategies. Although longitudinal studies combining stool score records and direct transit time measurements are necessary to consolidate the observed correlations and proposed hypotheses, the strength of the associations between BSS and species richness, enterotypes and community composition emphasise the crucial importance of stool consistency assessment and confounder analysis in gut microbiota research and clinical studies.

Taking an appropriate history

Patients cannot be helped without an accurate history being taken.
Taking a history of GI symptoms is a skill that must be learnt.
Tools such as a Bristol Stool Chart can often clarify exactly what patients mean.
Specialist units find that symptom questionnaires completed by the patient before the consultation often help clarify which issues are really troubling the patient.

Taking a history needs to elicit:
What was bowel function like before the cancer emerged?
How have the symptoms changed over time?
Are key features indicative of reversible underlying pathology present, for example, Steatorrhoea? Nocturnal waking to defecate? Rapid progressive worsening of symptoms? Rapid weight loss? Has the patient noticed any masses?
Patients and clinicians alike often miss the presence of intermittent steatorrhoea — ask: Is there an oily film in the lavatory water? Is the stool ever pale/putty-like/foul smelling/difficult to flush/floating?
A very clear definition of what a patient means when they use specific terms — for example, 'diarrhoea'/'loose stool' — what type on the Bristol Stool Chart?; 'frequency' — true bowel opening or tenesmus and incomplete evacuation?
Is there a consistent impact of a specific component of diet on their symptoms, especially Fibre: how much are they eating — too much/too little? Fat: does this promote type 6–7 stool/steatorrhoea? Lactose-containing foods? Gluten-containing foods? Alcohol intake?
Is there an association between the start of specific medication or increase in its dose and their symptoms — for example, metformin, proton pump inhibitor, β-blockers?

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

Diarrhoea

For the 50 studies that measured diarrhoea as an outcome, 18 used the WHO's definition (passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day or more than usual for the individual) for the case definition of diarrhoea (Characteristics of included studies table). Other studies defined diarrhoea as: softer than usual, one to five stools per day; watery, one to five stools per day; softer than usual, five to 10 stools per day; watery, five to 10 stools per day; watery more than 10 stools per day; or dysentery (Ahmed 1993 BGD), three or more soft liquid stools within 12 hours or a single soft or liquid stool with blood, pus, or mucous (Abalkhail 1995 KSA), three or more loose/watery stools in a 24‐hour period or having a stool with blood or mucous (Briceño 2015 TAN; Cameron 2013 INA; Mertens 1992 SRI; Patil 2014 IND), at least three loose or watery stools within 24 hours or at least one stool with blood (Luby 2018 BGD; Null 2018 KEN), the passage of three or more liquid or semi‐liquid stools in a 24‐hour period or the passage of at least one liquid or semi‐liquid stool with blood or mucous (Hashi 2017 ETH), occurrence of loose, unformed bowel movements at twice the normal frequency (infants, one to two stools per day; and older children, one stool per day) (Butz 1990 USA), passage of at least three liquid, watery mucoid stools with or without blood during the past 24 hours.

### Microscopic colitis: pathophysiology and clinical management [^113EWrwC]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Microscopic colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon that frequently causes chronic watery diarrhoea that might be accompanied by abdominal pain, nocturnal diarrhoea, urgency, and faecal incontinence. These symptoms lead to poor quality of life and increased health-care costs. Diagnosis relies on histological examination of multiple biopsy samples from the colonic mucosa, which often show no or only few abnormalities on endoscopy. Two major histological subtypes can be distinguished-collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis-but incomplete and variant forms with fewer characteristic features have been reported. Here we summarise the latest evidence on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk factors, and discuss established and novel therapeutic options for clinical remission. Finally, we propose an updated treatment algorithm. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify the natural history of microscopic colitis, supported by validated criteria for the assessment of disease activity.

### Factors associated with consultation behaviour for primary symptoms potentially indicating colorectal cancer: a cross-sectional study on response to symptoms [^1118wjD4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC): the burden of illness

Internationally, CRC is diagnosed in over one million persons annually (9.4% of all cancer diagnoses) and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer related death. On average, 50% of CRC cases are living five years following diagnosis. Survival rates for CRC are inversely related to stage at diagnosis with early staged-localised CRC 5-year survival rate at 90% compared to approximately 10% for distant metastatic CRC. The rate of early detection is relatively low with approximately 40% of CRC patients diagnosed at a localised stage.

Primary symptoms and clinical presentation of CRC

Rectal bleeding and change in bowel habit are common potential symptoms of CRC experienced in the population. Past studies have estimated 37–84% of all CRCs present with rectal bleeding. Change in bowel habit, broadly termed as diarrhoea or constipation, generally refers to a change in frequency of defecation, consistency of stool, shape of stool or difficulty in evacuation. Change in bowel habit is the symptom most associated with patient delay in presentation and presents in approximately 48–77% of CRCs, with increased frequency of defecation/diarrhoea accounting for the largest proportion of cases.

### Stool consistency is strongly associated with gut microbiota richness and composition, enterotypes and bacterial growth rates [^1169on4N]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent efforts undertaken to characterise the healthy colon microbiota, many parameters potentially affecting microbial composition and metabolic capacity remain underexplored. The identification of such confounding factors, including diet, history of antibiotics intake, and inflammation status, is essential to define the boundaries of a healthy gut ecosystem and, hence, to identify robust disease markers in clinical microbiome association studies.

Transit time is a key determinant of the gut microbial habitat, affecting nutrient and water absorption along the intestine as well as setting the pace of luminal microbial population clearance during egestion. As direct measurement of transit time is often impractical or mildly invasive, it has generally been neglected in microbiome studies so far. However, stool consistency as categorised by the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) scores has been put forward as a proxy for colonic transit rate, allowing assessment of its impact even when applying home-based sampling protocols. The use of the BSS is widespread in clinical studies and has been advised for the assessment of constipation and diarrhoea in functional bowel disorders. The BSS classifies human faeces into seven consistency categories, with highest scores corresponding to loose stools and fast transit, while lower scores stand for hard stools and longer colon transit times. Each consistency category reflects differences in moisture content of faecal material, with decreased water activity — associated with prolonged intestinal transit — limiting microbial growth through reduced nutrient mobility and hampered enzymatic activity. Hence, BSS categorisation summarises the impact of two major — and obviously related — selective forces shaping the gut ecosystem: rate of intestinal transit and water activity.

Here, we used self-reported BSS scores combined with 16S rDNA Illumina amplicon profiles of faecal samples of 53 healthy volunteers to assess potential associations between microbiota composition and stool consistency. In a healthy Western population, more than half of the stools passed are predicted to belong to the central BSS categories 3 and 4. However, increased occurrence of harder stools has been reported to be more common among women. Hence, in order to increase chances of sampling a more uniform distribution of stools over all BSS categories, we limited inclusion to female volunteers.

### Evaluation and treatment of patients with constipation [^1139rLft]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on constipation:

- **Definition**: Constipation is a symptom-based disorder defined as fewer than 3 bowel movements per week.
- **Pathophysiology**: Constipation is caused by pelvic floor dysfunction, slow colonic transit, metabolic disorders (hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism), medications (opiates, CCBs, antipsychotics), neurological disorders (diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury), IBS, and primary colonic disorders (strictures, cancer, anal fissure, proctitis).
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of constipation in the US is 16%.
- **Disease course**: Anomalous regulation of neuromuscular components within the colon and anorectum, and disruption in the corresponding ascending and descending pathways in the brain-gut axis result in infrequent bowel movements, excessive straining, a sense of incomplete evacuation, failed or lengthy attempts to defecate, digital manipulation to evacuate stools, abdominal bloating, and hard consistency of stools.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Chronic constipation decreases QoL and ability to function; however, only approximately 25% of patients consult physicians or use medications to manage associated symptoms.

To explore the etiological spectrum of diarrhea and its epidemiological characteristics in diarrhea symptoms surveillance cases younger than 5 years from 2009 to 2013 in Gansu province, northwest China. Systematic diarrhea symptoms surveillance were conducted in 27 sentinel sites in Gansu province and outpatients with three or more loose, watery, or sticky pus stools per day were defined as surveillance cases. All stool specimens were tested for Rotavirus, Human calicivirus, Adenovirus, and Astrovirus. Totally, 1,119 cases (51.54%) were identified as any enteric virus. The average isolation rate of Rotavirus was 51.13%, Astrovirus was 10.84%, Adenovirus was 6.94%, and Human calicivirus was 6.60% (P < 0.01). Rotavirus was identified with the highest frequency among these enteric pathogens except in 2011, with a notable downward trend over time (P < 0.01). Rotavirus A was the most proportion in rotavirus, G3P[8] and G9P[8] were the most common combination. Rotavirus mixed Human calicivirus infections was the most common mixed infected patterns. Viral-positive rate was higher among children aged group of 0–12 and 13–24 months (P < 0.01, respectively). The isolation rates of four enteric viral pathogens showed a similar distinct seasonal variation with a higher rate in spring, autumn, and winter months. Rotavirus was the major epidemiological viral pathogen in diarrhea symptom surveillance cases in Gansu province, northwest China, during period 2009–2013. Seasonal and age-related variations were observed in enteric viral pathogen isolation rate. The comprehensive and continuous surveillance is needed to identify the prevalence of different enteric viral pathogens.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

### Altered gut microbial functional pathways in people with irritable bowel syndrome enable precision health insights [^113naonn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

When collecting their stool samples, individuals also respond to an extensive questionnaire allowing them to detail their lifestyle, health history, and health conditions. Lifestyle questions relevant to the current study include use of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) medication, recent use of antibiotics, and use of disease-specific medication (i.e. antidiarrheals or laxatives/stool softeners). Health history is also collected, resulting in hundreds of self-reported phenotypes which include IBS, IBS-C, IBS-D, and IBS-M, as well as all the disease phenotypes listed in Supplementary Table 1. Symptom and condition questions relevant to the current study include abdominal pain, bloating, stool classification according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and all questions required for the Rome IV Questionnaire.

Briefly, the BSFS is an ordinal scale of stool consistency ranging from the hardest (Type 1) to the softest (Type 7). Types 1 and 2 are considered to be abnormally hard stools (indicative of decreased gut transit time) while Types 6 and 7 are considered abnormally loose/liquid stools (indicative of increased gut transit time). Type 3, 4 and 5 are therefore generally considered to be the most 'normal' stool form (indicative of average gut transit time).

The Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire consists of six questions, beginning with "In the last 3 months, how often did you have pain anywhere in your abdomen?" The answers to these questions are scored and yield a classification of "IBS-C", "IBS-D", "IBS-M", "IBS-U" (for unclassified), or "FALSE" for individuals who do not meet the criteria for any IBS classification.

Results

General Condition of Rats in Each Group

Observations revealed that rats in the control group showed normal weight gain with no other notable changes. In contrast, rats in the model groups exhibited progressively yellowed, dry, and fragile fur, lethargy, increased urination (as evidenced by wet bedding), and sticky or loose stools following model establishment. These symptoms were alleviated to varying degrees in the low-, medium-, and high-dose JBLJQF groups, as well as in the positive drug groups.

Regarding joint swelling, all model groups exhibited significant swelling compared to the control group after modeling. However, after 5 days of treatment, joint swelling in all treatment groups except the benzbromarone group gradually decreased, showing significant differences compared to the model group (P < 0.05). See Figure 1.

### Does bariatric surgery improve faecal incontinence? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bHutK]. Obesity Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Though our conclusion regarding FI severity is limited by the heterogenous data, some insights can be gained from the included studies. The largest study that assessed quality of life after FI, Elias et al. looked at 208 men and women and found a statistically significant improvement in lifestyle, coping and behaviour and embarrassment after bariatric surgery. Though we did not demonstrate a significant result, the results trended towards improvement in FI severity after bariatric surgery. Larger, standardized studies are needed to further elucidate this potential correlation.

We were not able to assess the pathophysiological factors that may be driving the reduction in FI after bariatric surgery. The literature suggests that obesity may increase intra-abdominal pressure and deplete the anal sphincter's ability to remain continent. This evidence is particularly present in women, and thus reduced intra-abdominal and thus anal sphincteric pressure may explain the findings of our systematic review. However, our study showed that there is an improvement in FI after bariatric surgery independent of weight loss. We postulate that there are hidden factors driving the benefit of bariatric surgery on FI in women and gastric bypass patients.

We did not find an improvement in FI for men, or for patients undergoing other operations other than Roux-en-Y or one anastomosis gastric bypass. There were a small number of men and surgical procedures outside of gastric bypass in our study, so the study was perhaps not powered to detect these changes. In these patients, there may also be factors that are counteracting the benefits seen in women and bypass patients. Stool consistency is also an important determinant of continence. Elias et al. found a significant change in stool towards a looser consistency (p = 0.04) in men and women after bariatric surgery. Diet is another important factor. Dietary changes after bariatric surgery can work both to promote FI by loosening stool and improve FI through increasing stool bulk, so the relationship is difficult to investigate systematically. It could be that looser stool or diet changes affecting intestinal function counteract some of the benefits of bariatric surgery on FI, at least in some populations.

### Undiagnosed microscopic colitis: a hidden cause of chronic diarrhoea and a frequently missed treatment opportunity [^117835uS]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a prevalent (comparable to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) but treatable cause of chronic, non-bloody, watery diarrhoea.
The colon is macroscopically normal in most patients with MC; diagnosis thus requires histological examination of colonic biopsies.
MC is less familiar to physicians (particularly in primary care) than other causes of chronic diarrhoea and may be misdiagnosed because of symptomatic overlap with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), downward pressure not to refer patients for colonoscopy and low adherence to biopsy guidelines.
The UK National Health Service recommends colonoscopy when faecal calprotectin is ≥ 100 µg/g, based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for inflammatory bowel diseases; however, faecal calprotectin is < 100 µg/g in over 50% of patients with active MC.
In most cases it is possible to distinguish between IBS and MC by taking a thorough history, though a more pragmatic approach is to refer patients for colonoscopy with biopsy to assess MC if they have chronic (> 4 weeks), mainly watery diarrhoea.
A large, hidden burden of undiagnosed and untreated MC likely exists in the UK population owing to systemic misdiagnosis of MC as IBS.
Pathways for the management of MC in the UK are unclear and need to be clarified so that they can be amended and standardised where necessary.

Patient selection for C. difficile laboratory testing — Clinicians can improve laboratory test relevancy by only testing patients likely to have C. difficile disease, including not routinely performing testing on stool from a patient who has received a laxative within the previous 48 hours, and laboratories can improve specificity by rejecting specimens that are not liquid or soft (ie, take the shape of the container). A cited study used a clinical definition of ≥ 3 diarrheal bowel movements (type 6 or 7 stool on the Bristol Stool Chart) in the 24 hours preceding stool collection, found that 36% of patients failed to meet this definition, and noted laxative use in 19% within the previous 48 hours.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic innovations, and multimodal therapeutic strategies for slow transit constipation [^111XXTDU]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fecal desiccation in STC patients exhibits distinctive pathological features and clinical significance. The underlying mechanism is primarily attributable to delayed colonic transit, resulting in prolonged stool retention (typically exceeding 72 h), during which continuous water absorption reduces fecal water content below critical levels, yielding characteristically hard, lumpy stools (Bristol types 1–2). Such pathological changes in stool consistency may precipitate a spectrum of complications: (1) mechanical injury (e.g. anal fissures, hemorrhoids); (2) neuroreflexive inhibition of defecation; and (3) psychogenic fear of defecation. These complications, through a pain-inhibition cycle, further exacerbate colonic dysfunction and significantly impair quality of life, thereby representing key therapeutic targets in the clinical management of STC.

Defecatory difficulty in STC is characterized by distinct pathophysiological features. The core manifestation is the need for prolonged straining and Valsalva maneuvers during defecation, often accompanied by compensatory abdominal muscle tension and autonomic symptoms (e.g. diaphoresis, facial flushing). This arises from ineffective colonic propulsive activity, necessitating increased intra-abdominal pressure to facilitate stool passage. Chronic aberrant defecatory patterns may induce pelvic floor muscle decompensation, manifesting as: (a) pelvic floor muscle fatigue; (b) rectoanal dyssynergia; and (c) sensations of incomplete evacuation and rectal fullness. This vicious cycle of dysmotility, structural alteration, and functional impairment is a critical driver of disease progression and a focal point for therapeutic intervention.

Fecal incontinence — risk factors and multifactorial causes: Maintaining continence depends on the complex interplay of multiple factors, including anal sphincter and pelvic floor musculature, rectal reservoir function (eg, capacity and compliance), stool consistency, and neurologic function (eg, colonic transit and motility, mental cognition, and sensorimotor function). Although conditions that alter these factors may result in FI, the cause of FI may be multifactorial, and the relative contribution of each factor may be difficult to ascertain. Independent risk factors for FI identified in population-based studies include older age, smoking, obesity, limited physical activity, white race, neurologic disease, diabetes mellitus, frequent and loose stools, and having multiple chronic comorbidities. FI is more prevalent among those with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or concomitant constipation.

### Faecal incontinence in adults [^111e7Crm]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Faecal incontinence, which is defined by the unintentional loss of solid or liquid stool, has a worldwide prevalence of ≤ 7% in community-dwelling adults and can markedly impair quality of life. Nonetheless, many patients might not volunteer the symptom owing to embarrassment. Bowel disturbances, particularly diarrhoea, anal sphincter trauma (obstetrical injury or previous surgery), rectal urgency and burden of chronic illness are the main risk factors for faecal incontinence; others include neurological disorders, inflammatory bowel disease and pelvic floor anatomical disturbances. Faecal incontinence is classified by its type (urge, passive or combined), aetiology (anorectal disturbance, bowel symptoms or both) and severity, which is derived from the frequency, volume, consistency and nature (urge or passive) of stool leakage. Guided by the clinical features, diagnostic tests and therapies are implemented stepwise. When simple measures (for example, bowel modifiers such as fibre supplements, laxatives and anti-diarrhoeal agents) fail, anorectal manometry and other tests (endoanal imaging, defecography, rectal compliance and sensation, and anal neurophysiological tests) are performed as necessary. Non-surgical options (diet and lifestyle modification, behavioural measures, including biofeedback therapy, pharmacotherapy for constipation or diarrhoea, and anal or vaginal barrier devices) are often effective, especially in patients with mild faecal incontinence. Thereafter, perianal bulking agents, sacral neuromodulation and other surgeries may be considered when necessary.

Diagnosis of chronic constipation

The duration and characteristics of the patient's symptoms must be assessed to distinguish chronic from transient constipation. Transient constipation is easily recognized by history, indicating constipation started at a time of change in dietary habits, mobility or lifestyle. Secondary constipation, as a consequence of other factors (Table 1), should be identified and treated accordingly.

Diagnostic resources

Rome III criteria

The Rome III classification system is widely recognized as the only standardized symptom-based diagnostic criteria for functional GI disorders (FGIDs), including chronic constipation (Table 2). Other definitions of chronic constipation are consistent with the Rome III criteria but are less quantitative and more subjective. Although clinicians are aware of the Rome criteria, these are used principally for research purposes and are not widely applied in clinical practice, with the possible exception of IBS. However, the Rome Foundation diagnostic algorithm project has recently published a new set of clinical algorithms for FGIDs, including chronic constipation, which make active use of the Rome criteria for diagnostic and therapeutic management (discussed in section entitled Review of currently available guidelines, recommendations and algorithms).

Table 2
Rome III criteria for chronic constipation

Bristol Stool Form Scale

The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS)is a useful visual aid that was designed to assist in the evaluation of patients with constipation. Using simple visual descriptors, it illustrates the common stool forms and consistency on a 7-point scale. It has been validated in a number of studies and has been found to be easily understood by patients, enabling them to recognize and thus classify the stool type that most closely represents their own experience. The form of the stool depends on the time that it spends in the colon; therefore, the BSFS is a quick and reliable indicator of transit time. It is particularly useful in patients with self-reported constipation who do not have infrequent bowel movements, to establish that hard or lumpy stools are, indeed, present.

2.3 Difficulties in establishing guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea

Reported change in stool frequency or form is characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and indeed forms part of the definition of the condition, which relies on symptom-based criteria and negative physical examination. Although stool weight does not usually increase in IBS, as symptom reporting forms the basis for the diagnosis and stool weight is rarely performed early in the course of investigation, considerable overlap between functional bowel disease and true 'diarrhoea' occurs. As IBS may affect 10–13% of the population, there is clearly the potential for inappropriate investigation of patients reporting diarrhoeal symptoms. Conversely, new onset of diarrhoea may reflect serious organic disease such as colonic neoplasia. It is this wide diagnostic potential given similar reported symptoms that makes the introduction of specific guidelines difficult.

The broad range of conditions which lead to diarrhoea also make it difficult to be too prescriptive with regard to the investigative pathways that should be adopted. Diarrhoea may result from: (a) colonic neoplasia; (b) inflammation; (c) small bowel inflammation; (d) small bowel malabsorption; (e) maldigestion due to pancreatic insufficiency; or (f) motility disorders, and it can be difficult to separate these on clinical grounds alone. The decision on whether to focus investigations on any one of these areas remains largely a matter of clinical judgement although, as will be discussed, the prevalence and potential seriousness of certain conditions (eg, colonic neoplasia) necessitates their exclusion early in the investigative scheme.

A further problem in the development of these guidelines has been the large number of investigative methods reported, particularly with regard to malabsorption. This reflects the failure of any single test to become established as the standard and, indeed, many of the available methods have not found a wide acceptance because of inadequate sensitivity, specificity or ease of use. Moreover, there is considerable variation in protocols and analytical methods between laboratories that leads to poor reproducibility of results. It is also unclear what place some of these tests (some of which were devised prior to the advent of endoscopy) hold in the current investigative scheme that incorporates access to small bowel and colonic histology. To circumvent this somewhat, we propose in figure 1 an outline algorithm for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea based on clinical differential diagnosis. This will be used to guide the text in this document.

Methods

Clinical samples

The 374 human subjects analysed here were from two cohorts. Cohort 1: stool samples of 194 HIV-1 infected individuals not on active antiretroviral therapy, who visited the out-patient clinic at the Amsterdam Medical Center in 1994 and 1995, as part of a study on unexplained diarrhoea. Criteria for inclusion in the study were proven HIV-1 infection and being aged 18 years or older. Cohort 2: Stool samples of 85 HIV-1 positive and 95 HIV-1 negative men having sex with men (MSM) as part of the ACS, a prospective cohort study among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM, initiated in 1984. Studies were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Center, the Netherlands (MEC 07/182). Written informed consent of each participant was obtained at enrolment of both cohorts.

VIDISCA library preparation and sequencing of human faecal samples

At collection, faecal samples were suspended 1:3 in broth containing penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Sample suspension (150 µl) was transferred to a reaction tube and centrifuged (10 min at 5000 g) to pellet solid matter and cellular debris. Supernatant was treated with 20 µl TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C (to remove naked DNA). Nucleic acids were extracted using the Boom methodand reverse transcription was done using non-ribosomal hexamer primers designed to avoid mammal rRNA sequences. This was followed by second strand synthesis and a cleanup via phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Library preparation for the two cohorts varied from this point, since two different sequencing technologies were used. For cohort 1 standard VIDISCA library preparation was carried out. Briefly, double-stranded DNA was digested with Mse1 restriction enzyme, and sequencing adapters were ligated to sticky ends. Libraries were amplified before size selection of fragments between 200 and 600 bp, quantification, and pooling. Sequencing was then done on an IonTorrent PGM instrument. For cohort 2, double-stranded DNA was fragmented to an average length of 400–500 bp, sequencing adapters were ligated, and libraries were amplified before sequencing with Illumina MiSeq instruments (150 bp paired end). Sequence reads associated with this study have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under study accession.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome Subtypes

Irritable bowel syndrome is categorized as one of four subtypes according to the predominant stool pattern: IBS-D, IBS with constipation, IBS with a mix of both diarrhea and constipation, or IBS unclassified. Of these, IBS-D has the highest prevalence, affecting up to 40% of adults diagnosed with IBS. Internationally, 1.2% of individuals experience IBS-D, and, like IBS overall, there is a slight preponderance of females compared with males (1.3% vs. 1.0%).

Patients with IBS-D pass Bristol Stool Form Scale type 6 or type 7 stools (loose, mushy, watery) during more than 25% of bowel movements and types 1 and 2 stools (hard, lumpy, pellet-like) less than 25% of the time (Fig. 1). Rome IV diagnostic criteria specify that stool texture should be assessed on days with abdominal pain to enable greater precision in differentiating the IBS subtype.

Because the symptoms of IBS-D may overlap with those of other conditions, such as EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, disaccharidase deficiencies, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and infections, diagnosis is not always straightforward. However, the initial classification of diarrhea as watery (indicative of IBS), fatty or/greasy (indicative of EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of inflammatory bowel disease) can begin to narrow the differential diagnosis (Table 2).

### Dietary intake and symptom severity in women with fecal incontinence [^111CrzUz]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Dietary advice is typically part of the first line of treatment for women with FI; however, data on the contribution of diet intake and modifications on FI symptoms are lacking. In this ancillary analysis of a large multicenter randomized trial, we sought to assess the relationship between dietary intake and bowel symptoms in women with FI. Although an association between FI severity and dietary fat/fiber intake was not found, weak associations were noted between greater FI frequency and increasing fat intake. The findings of this study add to the limited data on dietary intake in women with FI and may suggest a role for dietary assessment in the evaluation of women with FI.

The associations found between bowel symptoms and fat intake were weak and of unclear clinical significance; however, they are not surprising. In qualitative studies that examine self-care practices of women with FI, women report that they commonly modify their fat intake to control FI symptoms. Mechanistically, a high fat diet could cause FI by causing stools to be too hard or too liquid, both of which are independent risk factors for FI in large epidemiological studies. Fat intake has also been shown to decrease gastrointestinal motility and negatively affect the function of the neurons in the enteric nervous system. Although these studies suggest that dietary fat might be able to alter stool consistency and/or gastrointestinal motility and potentially contribute to FI, existing studies investigating the diet of women with FI are limited. Even though the current findings add to the available data on the relationship between dietary fat and FI, additional studies are needed to examine this relationship more robustly.

There was no association between dietary fiber intake and FI severity within our cohort. Prior studies have suggested that there might be an inverse relationship between dietary fiber intake and development of FI; however, others have not reported an association between intake of food with varying amounts of fiber and FI severity. It is possible that given that the dietary fiber intake amongst our cohort was very low with a narrow distribution, there was a limited ability to detect a correlation. Our cohort, though, is similar to other reported cohorts of women with FI with lower-than-average fiber consumption. Prior studies reporting on diet intake of women with FI found a mean daily dietary fiber intake of 13–15 g, which is similar to our cohort. Thus, prospective intervention studies that assess the impact of varying intakes in dietary fiber are likely needed to fully assess the relationship between dietary fiber and FI severity.

### Shigellosis [^117PgWKs]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Shigellosis is a clinical syndrome caused by invasion of the epithelium lining the terminal ileum, colon, and rectum by Shigella species. Although infections occur globally, and in people of all ages, endemic infections among children aged 1–4 years living in low-income and middle-income settings constitute most of the disease burden. The versatile manifestations of these highly contagious organisms range from acute watery diarrhoea to fulminant dysentery characterised by frequent scant bloody stools with fever, prostration, and abdominal cramps. A broad array of uncommon, but often severe, intestinal and extraintestinal complications can occur. Despite marked reductions in mortality during the past three decades, there are roughly 164000 annual deaths attributable to shigellosis. Intercontinental dissemination of multiresistant shigella strains, facilitated by travellers and men who have sex with men, has prompted new recommendations for antibiotic therapy. Awareness of disease burden and the emerging threats posed by shigella have accelerated interest in development of shigella vaccines, many of which are being tested in clinical trials.

### Functional bowel disorders [^116mMFZM]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Employing a consensus approach, our working team critically considered the available evidence and multinational expert criticism, revised the Rome II diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders, and updated diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder (FBD) requires characteristic symptoms during the last 3 months and onset ≥ 6 months ago. Alarm symptoms suggest the possibility of structural disease, but do not necessarily negate a diagnosis of an FBD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are best identified by symptom-based approaches. Subtyping of IBS is controversial, and we suggest it be based on stool form, which can be aided by use of the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Treatment of FBDs is based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance. Alterations in diet, drug treatment aimed at predominant symptoms, and psychotherapy may be beneficial.

### Disaccharide digestion: clinical and molecular aspects [^115sDzh2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Sugars normally are absorbed in the small intestine. When carbohydrates are malabsorbed, the osmotic load produced by the high amount of low molecular weight sugars and partially digested starches in the small intestine can cause symptoms of intestinal distention, rapid peristalsis, and diarrhea. Colonic bacteria normally metabolize proximally malabsorbed dietary carbohydrate through fermentation to small fatty acids and gases (ie, hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide). When present in large amounts, the malabsorbed sugars and starches can be excreted in the stool. Sugar intolerance is the presence of abdominal symptoms related to the proximal or distal malabsorption of dietary carbohydrates. The symptoms consist of meal-related abdominal cramps and distention, increased flatulence, borborygmus, and diarrhea. Infants and young children with carbohydrate malabsorption show more intense symptoms than adults; the passage of undigested carbohydrates through the colon is more rapid and is associated with detectable carbohydrates in copious watery acid stools. Dehydration often follows feeding of the offending sugar. In this review we present the clinical and current molecular aspects of disaccharidase digestion.

### When the cause of death does not exist: time for the WHO to close the ICD classification gap for medical aid in dying [^114VBDBu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Outstanding questions

In medicine (including cause of death statistics), the phenomenon where some conditions and events are perceived by the affected individuals to be so serious that they justify the wish to die is neither new nor uncommon. Conventional suicides also involve personal reasons and motivations for a wish to die and acting upon them. The unique aspect of MAID is that a doctor acknowledges and recognises these motivations, writes a prescription for a lethal drug, and in cases of VAE, even administers the fatal substance. In particular, symptom- and function-oriented MAID cases due to conditions that do not lead to natural death in the foreseeable future, are central to the topic in medical ethical discussions worldwide. In order to be able to follow future developments and trends in MAID, the motivational backgrounds for these cases should be recorded as reliably and accurately as possible. Thus, if the WHO creates the ICD classification for AS and VAE, additional "MAID sub-codes" should further enhance data collection to accurately code the cause of death. As recently proposed, these sub-codes would have to contain easy-to-handle symptom- and function-oriented categories, e.g. MAID due to: multi-morbidity (including factors such as severe gait disturbance, urinary and/or stool incontinence), severe neurologic-related conditions, chronic pain, and mental disorders or dementia (see Table 2). The cause of death statistics would then be able to reflect the actual reasons for the vast majority of these deaths.

### Investigation and management of stool frequency and consistency associated with SGLT1 inhibition by reducing dietary carbohydrate: a randomized trial [^112r4kaS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment with licogliflozin, a dual sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT)1/2-inhibitor, is associated with increased stool frequency and loose stools, attributed to SGLT1 inhibition. To investigate the effect of carbohydrate content and supplements on licogliflozin-induced stools, a randomized, open-label, two-part (N = 24/part), three-period crossover study was carried out in overweight or obese adults. Significantly higher (P < 0.01) change from baseline in 3-day total number of bowel movements was observed following 3 days of licogliflozin treatment (50 mg q.d.) together with a 50% carbohydrate meal compared with a 25% and 0% carbohydrate meal. The number of stools with Bristol Stool Chart score of 6 or 7 was also significantly lower following a 0% carbohydrate meal. Supplementation with psyllium 6 g or calcium carbonate 1 g had no effect on stool changes following treatment. Licogliflozin was generally safe and well-tolerated. Loose stool associated with licogliflozin treatment and ingestion of meals can be managed by reducing the carbohydrate content of meals taken with licogliflozin.
