## Question

Preventing UTIs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about prevention strategies for urinary tract infections (UTIs), organized by population and intervention, with explicit reasoning and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and scope, including what counts as recurrent UTI and which populations we must cover. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis and its trade-offs. Next, I will examine non-antibiotic options such as methenamine, cranberry, probiotics, and vaginal estrogen, and I need to check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain. After that, I should review special populations like catheter users, children, and neurogenic bladder. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned algorithm and highlight knowledge gaps that require caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and definitions so I don't drift into off-label or unsupported territory. Recurrent UTI in nonpregnant adult women is typically defined as at least two symptomatic UTIs in 6 months or three in 12 months, with at least one culture-confirmed episode to establish infectious etiology, and this is the core population addressed by contemporary guidelines and most trials, which I should keep front and center as I weigh options [^1175RXfj]. I need to ensure I separate uncomplicated cystitis from complicated phenotypes, catheter-associated infection, and pyelonephritis because prevention strategies diverge substantially across these entities, and guidelines explicitly limit some recommendations to recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in women without complicating factors [^114xto5v].

> Now, I will examine antibiotic prophylaxis, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal use. High-quality evidence and guidelines support that continuous or postcoital low-dose antibiotics reduce recurrence by roughly 70–80% during prophylaxis, with nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, and trimethoprim among commonly used agents, yet benefits wane after cessation and resistance emerges, so shared decision-making is essential [^1124xoE5] [^1166XZJb] [^114rAos1]. Wait, I should double-check the magnitude: pooled estimates show antibiotics reduce recurrence risk to about 0.26 relative to placebo, which is a large absolute benefit, but the AnTIC trial in CISC users also demonstrated increased resistance in urinary isolates on prophylaxis, reinforcing the need to limit duration and reassess periodically [^1124xoE5] [^115xMvaN]. I need to ensure I counsel on adverse effects such as candidiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms and consider agent selection in the context of local resistance patterns and patient-specific risks [^115xMvaN].

> Next, I should review methenamine hippurate as a non-antibiotic alternative, and I need to check whether it truly achieves non-inferiority to antibiotics. Contemporary randomized data suggest methenamine is non-inferior to daily antibiotics for preventing symptomatic UTIs in women with rUTI, with a favorable safety profile, though some analyses note higher asymptomatic bacteriuria rates that may warrant clarification in practice [^114fumZP] [^116G8LKp]. Let me verify older syntheses: Cochrane and subsequent reviews indicate benefit particularly in patients without renal tract abnormalities, whereas efficacy is limited in neuropathic bladder or structural disease, so patient selection matters and I should confirm normal urinary tract anatomy before recommending it long term [^111ZLxTm] [^111zDG7f]. I should confirm that standard dosing is 1 g twice daily and that acidification of urine improves formaldehyde release, while also reminding myself that methenamine is not active in alkaline urine, which can limit effectiveness in some settings [^114fumZP].

> I will now examine cranberry products, and wait, let me verify the most recent high-quality synthesis because earlier reviews conflict. The 2023 Cochrane update with 50 trials and 8857 participants shows that cranberry products probably reduce symptomatic UTIs in women with rUTI, in children, and in people susceptible after interventions, with a pooled risk ratio around 0.70, but show little to no benefit in elderly institutionalized adults, pregnant women, or those with neuromuscular bladder dysfunction, so expectations must be calibrated by population [^113sxAFg]. Hold on, I should reconcile this with older negative reviews: earlier updates were null overall, likely due to heterogeneity, low adherence, and variable product potency, which the 2023 review acknowledges while still finding a modest but real signal in defined subgroups, so I should recommend standardized products with known proanthocyanidin content and counsel on adherence and tolerability [^117QGVuZ] [^113sxAFg].

> Let me consider probiotics next, and I should confirm whether route and strain specificity change outcomes. Systematic reviews of oral probiotics have not shown a consistent reduction in UTI recurrence, and a Cochrane review concluded no significant benefit versus placebo, so I should be cautious not to overstate their role as monotherapy [^113dwGy3]. But wait, what if vaginal delivery of specific Lactobacillus strains changes the equation? A recent randomized trial in premenopausal women found that vaginal Lactobacillus, alone or combined with oral probiotics, reduced recurrence and delayed time to first UTI compared with placebo, suggesting route and strain selection may be pivotal, though replication is needed and current guideline bodies still call for more robust data before routine endorsement [^1142P7i8] [^113VmDTJ]. I should also note that pediatric meta-analyses have been largely negative for oral probiotics, reinforcing that any benefit is likely population- and strain-specific rather than universal [^111XA1Us].

> I need to check the role of vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women, because microbiome shifts with hypoestrogenism increase UTI susceptibility. Guidelines and reviews consistently support topical vaginal estrogen as an effective non-antibiotic strategy to reduce rUTI in postmenopausal patients, with biologic plausibility grounded in restoration of Lactobacillus-rich vaginal flora and improved uroepithelial defenses, and this should be offered when not contraindicated [^116LonYk] [^1171guRo]. Hold on, I should verify formulation preferences: low-dose vaginal estrogen creams, tablets, or rings are acceptable, and systemic absorption is minimal with proper use, which helps mitigate systemic risks while targeting the urogenital niche [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with catheter-associated UTI, and I must be careful not to conflate CAUTI prevention with rUTI strategies. The cornerstone is minimizing catheter use, maintaining a closed system, and prompt removal; routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for catheter insertion, maintenance, or removal, and antimicrobial-coated catheters have not shown consistent benefit to be adopted universally, so device stewardship and aseptic technique remain paramount [^116XmmBw] [^113G2cVE]. Hmm, wait a minute, I recall a meta-analysis suggesting benefit of prophylaxis at catheter removal; I should double-check that nuance. Indeed, a 2013 meta-analysis found reduced symptomatic UTI after short-term catheter removal with antibiotic prophylaxis, but guidelines still advise against routine prophylaxis given resistance concerns and modest absolute benefit, so if considered, it should be reserved for carefully selected high-risk patients after shared decision-making [^113zMkff] [^116XmmBw].

> For children, I should confirm that routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not advised for febrile UTI or VUR in most cases, as high-quality evidence and AAP guidance do not show a reduction in febrile recurrence and highlight resistance risks, so prevention should focus on constipation management, bladder dysfunction treatment, and hygiene rather than chronic antibiotics [^112uqQgp] [^115AfYaL]. Let me reconsider if any subgroup benefits exist; older reviews suggested possible small benefits in select contexts, but methodological limitations and evolving resistance patterns support a conservative approach and emphasize non-antibiotic measures first [^114CBQQK].

> For neurogenic bladder, I need to ensure I don't extrapolate methenamine or standard prophylaxis data. Evidence for methenamine is limited and mixed in neuropathic bladder, and intravesical bacterial interference with low-virulence E. coli has shown uncertain benefit with high attrition and strict protocols, so prevention should prioritize optimal bladder management, timely catheterization, and infection control rather than routine antimicrobial prophylaxis [^111ZLxTm] [^117QdkhU]. Hold on, I should verify that no guideline endorses routine antibiotics solely for neurogenic bladder UTI prevention; current guidance emphasizes individualized risk assessment and stewardship rather than blanket prophylaxis [^notfound].

> I will now examine behavioral and lifestyle measures, and I need to ensure I don't overstate their evidence base. Increased fluid intake, double voiding, and post-coital urination are reasonable and low-risk, though high-quality randomized evidence is limited; nonetheless, they align with pathophysiologic principles of dilution and clearance and are commonly included in care plans, particularly for women with sexual activity–associated recurrences [^111kzGSH]. Let me verify that guidelines endorse these as adjuncts rather than substitutes for evidence-based prophylaxis when recurrences are frequent, which they do, reinforcing a layered approach tailored to triggers and patient preference [^116LonYk].

> Next, I should review emerging and investigational strategies, and I must be transparent about availability and certainty. Vaccines against uropathogenic E. coli have demonstrated efficacy in reducing recurrences and are used in several countries, but they are not currently available in the U.S. and remain investigational here pending regulatory review, so they should not be offered outside trials or approved jurisdictions [^113tkP6K]. Bacteriophage therapy and mannoside anti-adhesion compounds are promising but still under evaluation, and guidelines suggest they may play a future role in stewardship-focused prevention paradigms, so I should frame them as future options rather than current standards [^113tkP6K] [^113w9t1z].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned algorithm and I should double-check that it aligns with major guidelines. First, confirm the diagnosis of rUTI and exclude complicating factors; then implement behavioral measures and address modifiable risks. In premenopausal women with sexual activity–linked recurrences, offer postcoital antibiotic prophylaxis; in those with recurrences unrelated to intercourse, consider continuous low-dose prophylaxis or methenamine, with periodic reassessment every 3–6 months. In postmenopausal women, prioritize vaginal estrogen and consider methenamine or cranberry as adjuncts. Throughout, discuss benefits, harms, resistance risks, and patient preferences, and avoid routine antibiotics in catheter-associated contexts, reserving any exceptions for carefully selected scenarios after shared decision-making [^1135gTkJ] [^1166XZJb] [^114fumZP] [^113sxAFg] [^116LonYk] [^116XmmBw].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and uncertainties so we don't overstate conclusions. Many prevention trials are small, heterogeneous, and at risk of bias, and contemporary guideline panels have struggled to issue strong recommendations for several non-antibiotic strategies due to low-to-moderate certainty evidence, which means clinicians should present balanced options and monitor outcomes closely while contributing to evidence generation where possible [^1122dnZP] [^113JtMm9]. I need to ensure that my counseling emphasizes that no single strategy works for all patients, that recurrence reduction is the typical goal rather than complete elimination, and that ongoing reassessment is essential to minimize antibiotic exposure and resistance while preserving quality of life [^1175RXfj].

UTI prevention centers on **behavioral measures** (adequate hydration, frequent voiding, post-coital voiding, and front-to-back hygiene) [^111kzGSH] and **evidence-based non-antibiotic options** (cranberry products [^113sxAFg], methenamine hippurate [^114fumZP], and vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women) [^116LonYk]. Antibiotic prophylaxis is reserved for recurrent UTIs when non-antibiotic strategies fail, with nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin as first-line agents [^notfound]; monitor for resistance and adverse effects [^112aSQ97]. Probiotics have limited evidence and are not routinely recommended [^113dwGy3]. Prevention should be individualized, with shared decision-making to balance efficacy, safety, and resistance risk [^1171guRo].

---

## Behavioral and lifestyle modifications

Behavioral strategies are foundational and **low risk**:

- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake reduces UTI risk by flushing bacteria from the urinary tract [^111kzGSH].

- **Voiding frequency**: Regular emptying and post-coital voiding help prevent bacterial ascent [^notfound].

- **Hygiene**: Wiping front-to-back and avoiding irritants (e.g. harsh soaps) reduce contamination [^notfound].

- **Sexual activity**: Post-coital antibiotics are effective for sex-associated rUTIs [^1135gTkJ].

---

## Non-antibiotic pharmacologic interventions

Several non-antibiotic options have supportive evidence:

| **Intervention** | **Evidence summary** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Cranberry products | - Moderate-quality evidence reduces rUTIs in women and children [^113sxAFg] <br/> - Limited benefit in elderly or catheterized patients | Consider for rUTIs, especially in women and children [^113sxAFg] |
| Methenamine hippurate | - Non-inferior to antibiotics in women with rUTIs [^116G8LKp] <br/> - Releases formaldehyde in acidic urine | Consider for rUTIs, especially to reduce antibiotic exposure [^116G8LKp] |
| Vaginal estrogen | Reduces rUTIs in postmenopausal women by restoring vaginal flora [^116g6a3W] | Recommended for postmenopausal women with rUTIs [^116LonYk] |
| Probiotics | - Limited and inconsistent evidence [^113dwGy3] <br/> - Some trials suggest benefit when combined with antibiotics [^111XA1Us] | Not routinely recommended; consider only in select cases [^notfound] |

---

## Antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective but should be used selectively because of resistance and adverse effects [^1124xoE5]:

- **Indications**: Recurrent UTIs (≥ 3/year) despite non-antibiotic measures [^111tZGmw].

- **Agents**: Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or fosfomycin are first-line [^notfound].

- **Regimens**: Continuous daily or post-coital dosing [^1135gTkJ].

- **Duration**: 6–12 months, with reassessment after 3 months [^1135gTkJ].

- **Risks**: Antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, and C. difficile infection [^115xMvaN].

---

## Special populations

- **Postmenopausal women**: Vaginal estrogen is effective; consider methenamine or antibiotics if recurrences persist [^111tZGmw].

- **Catheterized patients**: Avoid routine prophylaxis; focus on catheter management and aseptic technique [^116XmmBw] [^116UX4AG].

- **Children**: Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely recommended; address underlying risk factors [^112uqQgp].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Vaccines**: Under investigation; not yet widely available [^113tkP6K].

- **Bacteriophages**: Promising but still experimental [^113tkP6K].

- **Mannosides**: Potential anti-adhesion agents under study [^113tkP6K].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

- **First-line**: Behavioral measures and non-antibiotic options (cranberry, methenamine, vaginal estrogen) [^115Ba668].

- **Second-line**: Antibiotic prophylaxis if non-antibiotic measures fail [^111tZGmw].

- **Individualization**: Tailor strategies to patient preferences, risk factors, and resistance patterns [^1175RXfj].

---

UTI prevention should start with behavioral measures and non-antibiotic options, reserving antibiotics for recurrent cases. Individualized care and shared decision-making are essential to balance efficacy, safety, and resistance risk [^1171guRo].

### Lactobacillus rhamnosus PL1 and Lactobacillus plantarum PM1 versus placebo as a prophylaxis for recurrence urinary tract infections in children: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^111qtWnr]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in children. In children < 7 years of age, the prevalence of one episode of symptomatic UTI has been estimated at 3–7% in girls and 1–2% in boys, whereas 8–30% of them will have one or more episodes of UTI. The use of some probiotics appears to reduce the risk of recurrence of UTIs. Since the effects of probiotics are strain-specific, the efficacy and safety of each strain has to be assessed. The main aim of this study is to determine whether probiotics (containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus PL1 and Lactobacillus plantarum PM1) therapy are effective in preventing UTI in children compared to placebo.

Method

A superiority, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial is being conducted. One hundred and six patients aged 3 to 18 years with recurrent UTIs in last year (defined as: ≥ 2 episodes of UTI with acute pyelonephritis/upper UTI; or 1 episode of UTI with acute pyelonephritis and ≥ 1 episodes of UTI with cystitis/lower UTI; or ≥ 3 episodes of UTI with cystitis/lower UTI) or children with ≥ 1 infection in the upper urinary tract and ≥ 1 of recurrent UTIs risk factors (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, constipation, bladder dysfunction, myelomeningocele, sexual activity in girls) will be randomly assigned to receive a 90-day prophylaxis arm (probiotic containing L. rhamnosus PL1 and L. plantarum PM1) or a 90-day placebo arm. The primary outcome measure will be the frequency of recurrence of UTI during the intervention and in the period 9 months after the intervention.

Discussion

The findings of this randomised controlled trial (RCT), whether positive or negative, will contribute to the formulation of further recommendations on prevention of recurrent UTIs in children.

Trial registration number

NCT03462160, date of trial registration 12th March 2018.

### Can vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections? [^113VmDTJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a burden to patients and the health care economy. Vaginal probiotics and supplements have gained significant attention in mainstream media and lay press as a non-antibiotic alternative. We performed a systematic review to determine whether vaginal probiotics are an effective means of prophylaxis for rUTI.

Methods

A PubMed/MEDLINE article search was performed from inception to August 2022 for prospective, in vivo use of vaginal suppositories for the prevention of rUTIs. Search terms included: vaginal probiotic suppository (34 results), vaginal probiotic randomized (184 results), vaginal probiotic prevention (441 results), vaginal probiotic UTI (21 results), and vaginal probiotic urinary tract infection (91 results). A total of 771 article titles and abstracts were screened.

Results

A total of 8 articles fit the inclusion criteria and were reviewed and summarized. Four were randomized controlled trials, with 3 of the studies having a placebo arm. Three were prospective cohort studies, and 1 was a single arm, open label trial. Five of the 7 articles that specifically evaluated for rUTI reduction with vaginal suppositories did find a decreased incidence with probiotic use; however, only 2 had statistically significant results. Both of these were studies of Lactobacillus crispatus and were not randomized. Three studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus as a vaginal suppository.

Conclusion

Current data support the use of vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacillus as a safe, non-antibiotic measure, but actual reduction of rUTI in susceptible women remains inconclusive. The appropriate dosing and duration of therapy remain unknown.

### Nonantibiotic prevention and management of recurrent urinary tract infection [^115Ba668]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are highly prevalent, lead to considerable patient morbidity, incur large financial costs to health-care systems and are one of the most common reasons for antibiotic use worldwide. The growing problem of antimicrobial resistance means that the search for nonantibiotic alternatives for the treatment and prevention of UTI is of critical importance. Potential nonantibiotic measures and treatments for UTIs include behavioural changes, dietary supplementation (such as Chinese herbal medicines and cranberry products), NSAIDs, probiotics, D-mannose, methenamine hippurate, estrogens, intravesical glycosaminoglycans, immunostimulants, vaccines and inoculation with less-pathogenic bacteria. Some of the results of trials of these approaches are promising; however, high-level evidence is required before firm recommendations for their use can be made. A combination of these agents might provide the optimal treatment to reduce recurrent UTI, and trials in specific population groups are required.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^113dwGy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I² = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113AFvAL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

### Evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections versus prophylactic treatment with antibiotics [^1144xWYN]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered the most common bacterial infections, especially in women. The bladder is the most prevalent site of infection (cystitis). Some authors stated that women are 30 times more prone to have UTIs than men, while other authors reported a 8:1 ratio. Because 50–60% of women report at least one UTI in their lifetime, UTIs have become a common condition diagnosed and treated by urologists, gynecologists, and other health care providers.

At least one fourth of these patients will have a recurrence within a year, and 22% will have recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs). Infections are considered recurrent when patients have three or more culture-documented infections in a year or two or more in 6 months.

The European Association of Urology defines a significant bacteriuria as ≥ 10³ uropathogens/ml of midstream urine in acute uncomplicated cystitis in women, ≥ 10⁴ uropathogens/ml of midstream urine in acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women, ≥ 10⁵ uropathogens/ml of midstream urine in women, or ≥ 10⁴ uropathogens/ml of midstream urine in men (or in straight catheter urine in women) with complicated UTI (in a suprapubic bladder puncture specimen, any count of bacteria is relevant).

On average, each episode of acute UTI in premenopausal women is associated with 6.1 days of symptoms, 2.4 days of school or work absenteeism, and 0.4 days in bed. Besides the clinical impact on the health and quality of life, RUTIs have a great economic impact. An annual cost of US$2.5 billion is estimated in the USA. Bacteriuria is found in 2–3% of women 15–24 years of age, 20% in women 65–80 years of age, and 25–50% in women greater than 80 years of age. The population of women greater than 65 years of age in the USA is projected to double between 2000 and 2030. Therefore, it could be anticipated that UTIs will increase in the upcoming years. Aside from being common in the community, 2% of the hospitalized patients acquire UTIs. In the 1980s, nosocomial infections accounted for more than 500,000 per year.

### Preventing catheter-related bacteriuria… [^115ojayt]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Catheterization should be avoided when not required and when needed, should be terminated as soon as possible. Use of suprapubic and condom catheters may be associated with a lower risk of UTI than use of urethral catheters. Aseptic catheter insertion and a properly maintained closed drainage system are crucial to reducing the risk of bacteriuria. Instillation of antimicrobial agents into the bladder or urinary drainage bag and rigorous meatal cleansing seem to be of little benefit. Use of urinary catheters coated with silver alloy may reduce the risk of UTI. Systemic antimicrobial drug therapy seems to prevent UTIs, but primarily for patients catheterized for 3 to 14 days. Antibiotic drug prophylaxis is especially valuable in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate or renal transplantation. Using these methods, urinary catheter–associated UTI can often be prevented for weeks, but not longer terms.

The definition of catheter-related UTI varies in published reports and "bacteriuria" and "UTI" are often used interchangeably. If temporary or long-term urinary collection is required, options other than indwelling catheterization should be considered. Intermittent catheterization, ie, inserting and removing a sterile or clean urinary catheter several times daily, may reduce the risk of bacteriuria compared with an indwelling catheter. Because the incidence of bacteriuria is about 1% to 3% per insertion, however, most patients become bacteriuric within a few weeks. 1 Intermittent catheterization may also be associated with a lower risk of local and systemic complications of bacteriuria, but further studies are needed to assess these issues. Because of the high incidence, substantial morbidity, and occasional mortality associated with nosocomial UTI, several preventive measures have been evaluated in those requiring an indwelling catheter.

The most important infection control advance was the introduction approximately 3 decades ago of the closed catheter drainage system. 40–43 Proper aseptic techniques, including aseptic insertion and maintenance of the catheter and drainage bag, remain essential in preventing catheter-related UTI. 5, 44 It is vital that health care workers wear gloves when manipulating or emptying the drainage bag and wash hands vigorously between patient contacts. Efforts to prevent bacteriuria also include irrigating the bladder, instilling antibacterial solutions in the urinary collecting bag, rigorous meatal cleaning, using silver-coated urinary catheters, and prescribing short-term prophylactic antibiotic medications. Each method will be briefly discussed below.

### Can vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections? [^112aVJk8]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a burden to patients and the health care economy. By definition, UTIs are considered recurrent if there are more than two in a 6-month period or three in 1 year. Recurrent urinary tract infections not only impair quality of life for patients but they also have significant economic consequences. In 2003, the estimated health care cost of UTIs annually was US $1.6 billion, and the health care burden is certainly higher two decades later. The cost of an acute UTI workup ranges from US $390 to US $730, not including the price of antibiotic treatment.

Women are often given multiple rounds of antibiotics between primary care physicians and specialists to treat infections. Consequently, these patients often seek non-antibiotic alternatives, such as vaginal probiotics and supplements, as these have gained significant attention in mainstream media and the lay press. There is an increasing body of literature supporting the use of vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories to reduce candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis infections; however, the role of vaginal probiotics for the prevention of rUTI is less clear. There is increasing data that the vaginal microbiome varies between individuals that are susceptible to urinary infections. As such, it stands to reason that a vaginal probiotic would be more effective in preventing rUTI.

The objective of this study was to determine whether vaginal probiotics are an effective means of prophylaxis for women suffering from rUTI.

### Novel approaches to prevention of urinary tract infections [^113YqaxQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common clinical entities occurring in a variety of patient groups, most frequently caused by uropathogenic E. coli. Novel methods of preventing UTI currently under development are focused on three key approaches: (1) use of cranberry products, (2) restoration of the normal flora using Lactobacillus-based probiotic preparations, and (3) vaccine development. Although promising studies in each of these areas have been published or are ongoing, additional properly designed and powered clinical studies based on solid scientific evidence are needed.

### Lactobacillus rhamnosus PL1 and Lactobacillus plantarum PM1 versus placebo as a prophylaxis for recurrence urinary tract infections in children: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^113HnBJj]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in children. In children < 7 years of age, the prevalence of one episode of symptomatic UTI has been estimated at 3–7% in girls and 1–2% in boys, whereas 8–30% of them will have one or more episodes of UTI.

A superiority, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial is being conducted. One hundred and six patients aged 3 to 18 years with recurrent UTIs in last year (defined as: ≥ 2 episodes of UTI with acute pyelonephritis/upper UTI; or 1 episode of UTI with acute pyelonephritis and ≥ 1 episodes of UTI with cystitis/lower UTI; or ≥ 3 episodes of UTI with cystitis/lower UTI) or children with ≥ 1 infection in the upper urinary tract and ≥ 1 of recurrent UTIs risk factors (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, constipation, bladder dysfunction, myelomeningocele, sexual activity in girls) will be randomly assigned to receive a 90-day prophylaxis arm (probiotic containing L. rhamnosus PL1 and L. plantarum PM1) or a 90-day placebo arm. The primary outcome measure will be the frequency of recurrence of UTI during the intervention and in the period 9 months after the intervention.

Discussion

The findings of this randomised controlled trial (RCT), whether positive or negative, will contribute to the formulation of further recommendations on prevention of recurrent UTIs in children.

Trial Registration Number

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113fyWm7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections worldwide, being experienced by one in three women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent UTI is defined as more than three infections per year or more than two infections per 6 months, and it has a significant impact on quality of life, as highlighted by an international web-based survey of 1941 affected women. There is also a significant economic burden due to the costs of preventive strategies and sick leave. Most recurrent UTIs occur in otherwise healthy women who have no structural genitourinary tract abnormalities.

CPGs are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare in specific clinical circumstances" and are developed to optimize and standardize care. The successful implementation of a CPG depends on rigorous development, a clear implementation strategy, and adequate dissemination. Multiple studies across different clinical areas have shown that variability exists in the quality of CPGs, indicating that there is considerable room for improvement, especially in rigour of development and applicability. This is important because diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty can ensue if CPGs differ in core recommendations because of these limitations.

Differences in clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for the preventive treatment of recurrent UTI have been mentioned previously, but the authors of that report did not assess methodological quality. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty might ensue. We could find not a systematic appraisal of the quality of CPGs for the prevention and diagnostics of recurrent UTI in women. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument is often used to assess the methodological quality of CPGs in other areas. We therefore aimed to assess the methodological quality of CPGs for recurrent UTI and to summarize recommendations to help clinical decision makers choose the correct CPG for treatment or diagnostics.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^117PZRV4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberries (particularly in the form of cranberry juice) have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing such infections.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases and the Internet were searched using English and non English language terms; companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations were contacted; reference lists of review articles and relevant trials were searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi randomised controlled trials of cranberry juice/products for the prevention of urinary tract infections in susceptible populations. Trials of men, women or children were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each included trial, information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (urinary tract infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic), side effects and adherence to therapy). We were unable to perform statistical analysis due to the nature of the data available for review, so a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

Main Results

Five trials met the inclusion criteria (four cross-over, one parallel group). Four compared the effectiveness of cranberry juice versus placebo juice or water, and one compared the effectiveness of cranberry capsules versus placebo. Two further trials were excluded. Data from two out of the five trials indicated that cranberries were effective for either symptomatic or asymptomatic UTIs, but this result was not obtained in an intention-to-treat analysis. Side effects were common, and dropouts high. Overall, the quality of the five included trials was poor, the sample sizes were small, and thus the reliability of the results must be questionable.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The small number of poor quality trials gives no reliable evidence of the effectiveness of cranberry juice and other cranberry products. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals from the trials indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. There is no conclusive evidence to recommend cranberry juice for the prevention of UTIs. Further properly designed trials with relevant outcomes are needed.

Evidence acquisition

Study design

We conducted a systematic assessment of the quality of CPGs on recurrent UTI in women using the AGREE II instrument. The protocol for this review was published in PROSPERO under ID CRD42020142882.

Search strategy and selection of CPGs

Searches of PubMed and EMBASE were performed using defined search terms for UTI and CPG to identify eligible CPGs published between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2021 (see Supplementary File 1 for full details). The reference lists of all relevant CPGs were also screened manually to identify any CPGs that may have been missed. Finally, two appraisers — J.J.P. a PhD student and recurrent urinary tract infections/urology resident, and M.H.B. a general practitioner/epidemiologist with a special interest in urology and experience in systematic reviews — independently checked the identified literature. Only full CPGs available in English, Dutch, or Spanish that contained recommendations on prevention or diagnostics for recurrent UTI in adult women were included. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^114fumZP]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as repeated UTI with a frequency of at least two episodes in the preceding six months or three episodes in the past year. Acute UTI is most often uncomplicated cystitis and occurs in 50–80% of women in the general population. About one in four women with one UTI episode will go on to develop frequent recurrences, representing a substantial global healthcare problem. An economic analysis from the US described UTI as accounting for more than 6.8 million consultations, 1.3 million emergency department visits, and 245 000 hospital admissions with an annual cost of more than US$2.4bn (£1.8bn; €2.1bn). National and international guidelines acknowledge the need for preventive strategies, and those from the UK, Europe, and US strongly recommend the use of daily, low dose antibiotics as the standard prophylactic treatment for recurrent UTI.

The urgent need for demonstration of effective non-antibiotic treatments is underlined by the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy, which comments that "we are heading rapidly towards a world in which our antibiotics no longer work" and recommends a "strong focus on infection prevention". One aim of this strategy is to reduce antimicrobial use in people by 15% before 2024; to achieve that, exploration of non-antibiotic preventive treatments in common conditions such as UTI is essential. Methenamine hippurate is one such non-antibiotic treatment, which is hydrolysed to formaldehyde in acidic environments such as the distal tubules of the kidney. Formaldehyde is bacteriocidal and works by denaturing bacterial proteins and nucleic acids.

Methenamine hippurate has been evaluated in previous Cochrane systematic reviews, which concluded that "methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI" but recognised the "need for further large well-conducted RCTs [randomised controlled trials] to clarify". This study aimed to determine whether methenamine hippurate was an effective alternative to the standard treatment of low dose antibiotics for prophylaxis in women with recurrent UTI in a routine clinical setting. We tested the null hypotheses that methenamine hippurate was inferior to daily antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in women.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^114TV6QX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in women and are frequently defined as ≥ 2 episodes in the last 6 months or ≥ 3 episodes in the last 12 months. In a primary care setting, 53% of women above the age of 55 years and 36% of younger women report a recurrence within 1 year. Thus, management and prevention of recurrent UTI is of utmost significance. This review aims to highlight the latest research in prevention strategies and suggest a management pathway.

Methods

A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases for the latest systematic reviews and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Special emphasis was placed on the remit "recurrent" and strongly adhered to. Furthermore, a Google search was conducted for current guidelines on the management of UTIs.

Results

Current prevention strategies include eliminating risk factors that increase the risk of acquiring recurrent UTI and continuous, post-coital and self-initiated antimicrobial prophylaxis. Other prospective preventative strategies, currently under trial, include use of vaccinations, D-mannose and lactobacillus (probiotics).

Conclusion

Although risk factors should be identified and addressed accordingly, individualized antibiotic prophylaxis remains the most effective method of management. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies such as cranberry, vitamin C and methenamine salts lack strong evidence to be introduced as routine management options and as alternatives to antibiotics. Based on current evidence and guidelines, a management pathway is recommended. Emerging therapies require further evaluation before they can be recommended.

### Cranberry products and prevention of urinary tract infections [^115GDtHA]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are cranberry products (juice, tablets, capsules, and syrup) associated with prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) compared with placebo or other treatments?

Bottom Line

Cranberry products are not associated with prevention of UTIs. However, lack of association of cranberry products with a reduced incidence of UTIs in clinical trials may be due to lack of participant adherence, lack of sufficient active ingredient in the cranberry product, or lack of sufficient statistical power.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113tkP6K]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in women — non‑antibiotic and host‑directed strategies include that bacteriophage therapies are a "promising option" with "promising efficacy similar to antibiotics with few side effects". Host response modulation "is a key dynamic for which limited information currently exists but may represent a future direction for prevention strategies". Vaccines "have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the UTI recurrence and are already in use in many nations", yet "these are not yet available in the U.S"., even though "numerous high quality, prospective trials demonstrate their utility in women with rUTI", and "significant uncertainty remains, however, about when or if these will become available for use in the U.S. in the future". The "use of mannosides as therapeutic entities" to prevent adhesion "may represent a narrow-spectrum treatment strategy" but "clinical outcomes using such approaches have been equivocal". As an adjunct, "the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, have been suggested as a useful adjunct in both preclinical and clinical studies". Prevention research infrastructure exists: "an NIH-funded research consortium… the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Research Consortium", which is "dedicated to promoting prevention of LUTS (including UTIs)", aims to discover "methods to suppress symptoms without use of antibiotics" and "seeks to identify modifiable risk factors for acute cystitis which can be tested in a prospective prevention trial".

### Nitrofurantoin's efficacy and safety as prophylaxis for urinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^112jTMuX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Nitrofurantoin has been used for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) for over 60 years. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its efficacy and safety in the prophylaxis of UTI.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all controlled trials in humans assessing nitrofurantoin for UTI prophylaxis published from 1946 to 2015. We further reviewed population-level cohort studies evaluating nitrofurantoin's toxicity. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on controlled trials.

Results

Twenty-six controlled trials including 3052 patients fulfilled entry criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and toxicity, and 16 population-level cohort studies were identified for review of toxicity. Overall quality was poor, with all studies at increased risk for various biases. When compared with no prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI (risk ratio 0.38 in favour of nitrofurantoin, 95% CI 0.30–0.48). Its prophylactic efficacy is superior to that of methenamine hippurate and comparable to that of other antibacterials. Compared with patients receiving other antibacterials, those receiving nitrofurantoin had an increased risk of 2.24 (95% CI 1.77–2.83) for a non-severe adverse effect. In all controlled trials, only one patient experienced a severe adverse effect (interstitial pneumonia). Cohort studies reported severe adverse effect frequencies of 0.02–1.5 per 1000 nitrofurantoin users.

Conclusions

Nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI. Its use may be associated with increased non-severe adverse effects; severe adverse effects occur infrequently. The risk of severe toxicity seems to increase with the duration of nitrofurantoin prophylaxis.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^113sxAFg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins (PACs), which inhibit the adherence of p-fimbriated Escherichia coli to the urothelial cells lining the bladder. Cranberry products have been used widely for several decades to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the fifth update of a review first published in 1998 and updated in 2003, 2004, 2008, and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 13 March 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register Search Portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products compared with placebo, no specific treatment or other intervention (antibiotics, probiotics) for the prevention of UTIs were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where appropriate. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

For this update 26 new studies were added, bringing the total number of included studies to 50 (8857 randomised participants). The risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment was low for 29 and 28 studies, respectively. Thirty-six studies were at low risk of performance bias, and 23 studies were at low risk of detection bias. Twenty-seven, 41, and 17 studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively. Forty-five studies compared cranberry products with placebo or no specific treatment in six different groups of participants. Twenty-six of these 45 studies could be meta-analysed for the outcome of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs. In moderate certainty evidence, cranberry products reduced the risk of UTIs (6211 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84; I² = 69%). When studies were divided into groups according to the treatment indication, cranberry products probably reduced the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs (8 studies, 1555 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; I² = 54%), in children (5 studies, 504 participants: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68; I² = 21%) and in people with a susceptibility to UTIs due to an intervention (6 studies, 1434 participants: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61; I² = 0%). However, in low certainty evidence, there may be little or no benefit in elderly institutionalised men and women (3 studies, 1489 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30; I² = 9%), pregnant women (3 studies, 765 participants: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.50; I² = 3%), or adults with neuromuscular bladder dysfunction with incomplete bladder emptying (3 studies, 464 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; I² = 0%). Other comparisons were cranberry products with probiotics (three studies) or antibiotics (six studies), cranberry tablets with cranberry liquid (one study), and different doses of PACs (two studies). Compared to antibiotics, cranberry products may make little or no difference to the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs (2 studies, 385 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.33; I² = 0%) or the risk of clinical symptoms without culture (2 studies, 336 participants: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.14; I² = 68%). Compared to probiotics, cranberry products may reduce the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.56; I² = 0%). It is unclear whether efficacy differs between cranberry juice and tablets or between different doses of PACs as the certainty of the evidence was very low. The number of participants with gastrointestinal side effects probably does not differ between those taking cranberry products and those receiving placebo or no specific treatment (10 studies, 2166 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). There was no clear relationship between compliance with therapy and the risk for repeat UTIs. No difference in the risk for UTIs could be demonstrated between low, moderate and high doses of PACs.

Authors' Conclusions

This update adds a further 26 studies taking the total number of studies to 50 with 8857 participants. These data support the use of cranberry products to reduce the risk of symptomatic, culture-verified UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, in children, and in people susceptible to UTIs following interventions. The evidence currently available does not support its use in the elderly, patients with bladder emptying problems, or pregnant women.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JSgfm]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are a common global health issue, particularly affecting women, with approximately 7 million women seeking outpatient care annually for uncomplicated UTIs. These infections, caused by bacterial invasion of the urinary tract, include conditions such as cystitis and pyelonephritis. Due to anatomical factors, women are more susceptible to UTIs, and recurrence is a significant concern. with up to 27% of women experiencing a repeat infection within six months. This recurrence contributes to both clinical and economic burdens.

Antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin, are commonly prescribed for acute UTI treatment but come with side effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances and allergic reactions. More critically, widespread antibiotic use is fueling the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which complicates treatment. Long-term antibiotic use in treating UTIs leads to high overall resistance to commonly used antibiotics, such as ampicillin (39.6%), trimethoprim (23.8%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (22.4%), Despite the current approach to managing UTIs predominantly involves antibiotics, there are ongoing concerns about overuse, antibiotic resistance, and potential aftereffects.

While current guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) focus on optimizing UTI management, challenges remain in antibiotic selection, treatment duration, and the management of recurrent infections. Recent studies, including a meta-analysis by Bakhit et al. (2021), suggest that methenamine hippurate may offer a promising alternative for preventing recurrent UTIs, though the results have been inconclusive, necessitating further investigation.

Given the concerns over antibiotic resistance and adverse effects, exploring non-antibiotic alternatives like methenamine hippurate is essential. This urinary antiseptic works by releasing formaldehyde in acidic urine, exerting bactericidal effects within the urinary tract. Its unique mechanism and favorable safety profile make it an attractive candidate for UTI prevention.

This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs through an updated analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). By incorporating trial sequential analysis, we aim to provide more reliable estimates of its efficacy compared to standard antibiotics and placebo. The findings of prior systematic reviews, such as those by Lee et al. and Bakhit et al. suggest some potential benefits of methenamine hippurate, but further robust data is needed to confirm its role in UTI prophylaxis.

### Prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^112mk2R6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The underlying cause of catheter-associated urinary tract infection is biofilm formation by uropathogens on the urinary catheter. Biofilm is a relatively new concept in medicine, and current measures to prevent biofilm formation are inadequate. Considerable work is being done in this area, but little clinical progress has been made. The purpose of this review is to analyze recent publications concerning prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

Recent Findings

Several recent studies have elucidated aspects of biofilm formation in catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Other researchers are working on methods to disrupt biofilm formation on catheter surfaces. At the same time, the magnitude of the problem of catheter-associated urinary tract infection has increased awareness of the effectiveness of basic infection control measures. A modern approach to infection control may include computerized ordering systems that minimize unnecessary days of catheterization. Finally, consumption of cranberry juice products and bacterial interference are two novel approaches to urinary tract infection prevention.

Summary

Biofilm-disrupting strategies offer promise for the future but have little immediate applicability. Implementation of infection control measures to improve catheter function and remove unnecessary catheters can be done at the present time. In general, prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remains an elusive goal. More basic research at the level of pathogenesis is needed so that novel strategies can be designed.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1124xoE5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I² = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: -46%, 95% CI: -56% to -37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114xto5v]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women (AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline) — scope and purpose: The guideline limits scope to recurrent episodes of localized (restricted to the lower urinary tract) cystitis in women and states that it does not apply to individuals with complicating factors at higher risk for development of UTI or decreased efficacy of therapy, or those with signs or symptoms of systemic bacteremia. Within this document, the term UTI refers to acute bacterial cystitis unless otherwise specified. The stated aims are to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs by reducing recurrence of UTI events.

### Segmental acupuncture for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections. A randomised clinical trial [^116g6a3W]. International Urogynecology Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are considered to be the most common bacterial infections, with approximately 80% of all UTIs occurring in women. Nearly 1 in 3 women is expected to suffer from at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24 years and almost half of all women will experience one UTI during their lifetime. Recurrences affect approximately 20–30% of women with initial UTI, although recurrence rates vary widely.

Recurrent UTIs, defined as two UTIs within 6 months or three UTIs within 12 months, are a common problem seen in clinical practice with important medical, social and financial implications. Prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs is an ongoing challenge, with several different management strategies being used. Low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for several months is reported to be effective but should not be administered first line, because it fosters the development of antibiotic resistance of the causative microorganisms, as well as the commensal flora. In postmenopausal women vaginal oestrogen therapy reduces symptomatic UTI episodes. Further prevention strategies include the oral immunostimulant OM-89, the vaginal vaccine Urovac, lactobacilli prophylaxis, cranberry products, and acupuncture. American cranberries have been used in the prevention of UTIs for many years. The latest Cochrane update supports the use of cranberry products to reduce the risk of symptomatic UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs.

The use of acupuncture for UTI treatment has been studied for over 20 years. So far, two randomised controlled trials assessed the effect on the prevention of recurrent UTIs with positive results. Acupuncture points in those studies were chosen according to patients´ individual diagnoses following Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) patterns.

Segmental acupuncture, based on segmental anatomy, is in part an alternative model to the traditional Chinese meridian system. The locations of the needles are determined by the corresponding segments of the affected organs. This allows standardised treatment regimens without in-depth knowledge of TCM. Combination with auriculotherapy has been proven to be useful.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of segmental acupuncture combined with auriculotherapy in the treatment of recurrent UTIs in women. We hypothesised that women receiving acupuncture treatment in addition to standard treatment were more likely to have no UTIs at 6 months than women with standard treatment only.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111GqZrm]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

Search strategy

This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook for Systematic Review of interventions and the Preferred reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement guidelines.

We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL, along with Google Scholar for additional internet sources, from their inception until March 2024 for randomized controlled trials of methenamine hippurate vs antibiotic/placebo trials in women with recurrent urinary tract infection. Please refer to appendix our search strategy. A highly sensitive search strategy was also used in a way to better identify randomized trials in the databases.

The references from all included studies, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also searched manually for any additional studies. The prospective meta-analysis protocol was registered on PROSPERO under protocol CRD42024512556.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed adult women (aged ≥ 18 years) with a history of recurrent or confirmed UTIs. Studies were eligible if they compared the efficacy of methenamine hippurate with placebo/no treatment or any antibiotic and reported at least one of the clinical outcomes of interest. We excluded non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), studies without a methenamine arm or without a comparison to placebo/antibiotics, studies involving women with catheters, patients with anatomical abnormalities (e.g. solitary kidney, ureteral or urethral stricture), or patients with active urinary tract infections.

The exclusion of women with active UTIs was critical for the integrity of this review since our purpose with this work is to evaluate methenamine hippurate as prophylaxis method for recurrent UTIs, not for the treatment of active infections. Including women with active UTIs could introduce significant confounding, as the focus of this review is on the prevention of future UTI episodes, rather than the treatment of an ongoing infection. By excluding women with active UTIs, we ensured that the results reflect the true prophylactic effect of methenamine hippurate. We also excluded studies that reported the use of acidifying agents in combination with methenamine hippurate, as these could interfere with the outcomes of interest. Case reports, systematic reviews, and bibliographic reviews were excluded to maintain a high standard of evidence.

### Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial strategies [^116WzUgm]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, especially in women. Low-dose daily or postcoital antimicrobial prophylaxis is effective for prevention of recurrent UTIs and women can self-diagnose and self-treat a new UTI with antibiotics. The increasing resistance rates of Escherichia coli to antimicrobial agents has, however, stimulated interest in nonantibiotic methods for the prevention of UTIs. This article reviews the literature on efficacy of different forms of nonantibiotic prophylaxis. Future studies with lactobacilli strains (oral and vaginal) and the oral immunostimulant OM-89 are warranted.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in non-pregnant women [^115XhX28]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common health care problem. Recurrent UTI (RUTI) in healthy non-pregnant women is defined as three or more episodes of UTI during a twelve month period. Long-term antibiotics have been proposed as a prevention strategy for RUTI.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy (during and after) and safety of prophylactic antibiotics used to prevent uncomplicated RUTI in adult non-pregnant women.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (1966-April 2004), EMBASE (1980-January 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(in The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004) and reference lists of retrieved articles

Selection Criteria

Any published randomised controlled trial where antibiotics were used as prophylactic therapy in RUTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Nineteen studies involving 1120 women were eligible for inclusion. Antibiotic versus antibiotic (10 trials, 430 women): During active prophylaxis the rate range of microbiological recurrence patient-year (MRPY) was 0 to 0.9 person-year in the antibiotic group against 0.8 to 3.6 with placebo. The RR of having one microbiological recurrence (MR) was 0.21 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.34), favouring antibiotic and the NNT was 1.85. For clinical recurrences (CRPY) the RR was 0.15 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.28). The NNT was 1.85. The RR of having one MR after prophylaxis was 0.82 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.53). The RR for severe side effects was 1.58 (95% CI 0.47 to 5.28) and for other side effects the RR was 1.78 (CI 1.06 to 3.00) favouring placebo. Side effects included vaginal and oral candidiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms. Antibiotic versus antibiotic (eight trials, 513 women): These trials were not pooled. Weekly pefloxacin was more effective than monthly. The RR for MR was 0.31(95% CI 0.19 to 0.52). There was no significant difference in MR between continuous daily and postcoital ciprofloxacin.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for 6–12 months reduced the rate of UTI during prophylaxis when compared to placebo. After prophylaxis two studies showed nodifference between groups. There were more adverse events in the antibiotic group. One RCT compared postcoital versus continuous daily ciprofloxacin and found no significant difference in rates of UTIs, suggesting that postcoital treatment could be offered to woman who have UTI associated with sexual intercourse.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Methenamine hippurate for preventing urinary tract infections [^111zDG7f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Methenamine salts are often used as an alternative to antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTI.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Manufacturers' of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies and contact was made with known investigators. Date of last search: September 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible. A comparison with a control/no treatment group was a prerequisite for selection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An exploration of heterogeneity and a detailed description of results, grouped by population, was undertaken.

Main Results

Thirteen studies (2032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcome measures were not interpretable because of underlying heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses suggested that methenamine hippurate may have some benefit in patients without renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.89; bacteriuria: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83), but not in patients with known renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 6.20; bacteriuria: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.07). For short-term treatment duration (1 week or less) there was a significant reduction in symptomatic UTI in those without renal tract abnormalities (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38). The rate of adverse events was low.

Authors' Conclusions

Methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities, particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis. It does not appear to work in patients with neuropathic bladder or in patients who have renal tract abnormalities. The rate of adverse events was low, but poorly described. There is a need for further large well-conducted RCTs to clarify this question, particularly for longer term use for people without neuropathic bladder.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and clinical outcomes among older adults with recurrent urinary tract infection: cohort study [^112MvaGa]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

clinical guidelines recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), but there is little evidence for their effectiveness in older adults.

Methods

this was a retrospective cohort study of health records from 19,696 adults aged ≥ 65 with recurrent UTIs. We used prescription records to ascertain ≥ 3 months' prophylaxis with trimethoprim, cefalexin or nitrofurantoin. We used random effects Cox recurrent event models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risks of clinical recurrence (primary outcome), acute antibiotic prescribing and hospitalisation.

Results

of 4,043 men and 15,653 women aged ≥ 65 with recurrent UTIs, 508 men (12.6%) and 2,229 women (14.2%) were prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis. In men, prophylaxis was associated with a reduced risk of clinical recurrence (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.45–0.54), acute antibiotic prescribing (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.51–0.57) and UTI-related hospitalisation (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94). In women, prophylaxis was also associated with a reduced risk of clinical recurrence (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.55–0.59) and acute antibiotic prescribing (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.59–0.62), but estimates of the risk of UTI-related hospitalisation were inconsistent between our main analysis (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05–1.28) and sensitivity analysis (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94).

Conclusions

antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with lower rates of UTI recurrence and acute antibiotic prescribing in older adults. To fully understand the benefits and harms of prophylaxis, further research should determine the frequency of antibiotic-related adverse events and the impact on antimicrobial resistance and quality of life.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Updates in clinical management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^1171guRo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and burdensome in women. Here, we discuss challenges with our current models of care and how evolving insights into the female urogenital microbiome have advanced the understanding of how we diagnose, treat, and prevent recurrent UTIs in nonpregnant adult women. Traditional care models attribute recurrent UTIs mainly to gastrointestinal sources, resulting in significant emphasis on eradicating pathogens with potential overreliance on antibiotics. Evidence now shows that the bladder harbors a complex microbiome, with interactions between the urinary and vaginal environments and immune mechanisms at the bladder mucosal surface influencing infection susceptibility. Thus, in updated models of care, more emphasis is placed on enhancing the protective microbiome. This may be especially important in postmenopausal women, who experience microbiome shifts that increase vulnerability to recurrent infections, underscoring the role of estrogen therapy and microbiome-supportive interventions. Updated treatment approaches emphasize antimicrobial stewardship, advocating for confirmation of the diagnosis and delayed antibiotic initiation when safe, and judicious use of antibiotics for symptom relief. Prevention strategies highlight the importance of vaginal estrogen, methenamine salts, and other supplements rather than exclusive reliance on prophylactic antibiotics. Ongoing research into emerging therapies such as UTI vaccines and bacteriophage drugs may further decrease our reliance on antibiotics in the future. This clinical update underscores the need for individualized care plans that balance effective infection management while minimizing antibiotic-related harms, emphasizing a holistic, microbiome-centered approach to recurrent UTI prevention and treatment.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1135gTkJ]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — pre-initiation step, postcoital and continuous strategies, efficacy, and duration: both the European Association of Urology and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend ensuring a negative urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics; postcoital prophylaxis should be offered to women who have UTIs temporarily related to sexual intercourse, and these women will take a single dose of an antimicrobial agent immediately after intercourse; postcoital therapy decreased recurrence rates compared with placebo (0.3 vs 3.6 patient-years, P = 0.001) and was equally as efficacious as continuous daily therapy; with continuous prophylaxis, a patient takes a single, daily antibiotic dose, and compared with placebo, continuous prophylaxis decreases recurrences by up to 95%; the duration of these regimens ranges from 6 months to at least 2 years, with regimens extended to 5 years in some reports; a Cochrane review in nonpregnant women found that antibiotics given continuously for 6 to 12 months were considerably more effective than placebo in preventing rUTI (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08–0.28); several studies have found that 50% to 60% of women become reinfected within 3 months of discontinuing prophylaxis; this document supports reevaluation of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis at 3 months, and antibiotic prophylaxis is rarely continued beyond 6 months, although it may have to be restarted if UTIs recur.

### Scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of urinary tract infection in the past 10 Years [^117BehL6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

### Preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections… [^116UX4AG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- Infection prevention and safe catheter insertion, maintenance, and removal reduce the risk of CAUTIs. Why it matters
- CAUTIs are one of the most common HAIs.
- About 75% of UTIs developed in hospitals are associated with a urinary catheter.
- 15–25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay.
- CAUTIs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and length of stay.
- They are preventable. Background A urinary tract infection is an infection that involves any of the organs or structures of the urinary tract. A CAUTI occurs when germs enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause infection. Recommendations All healthcare facilities
- Only use urinary catheters when needed.
- Place catheters using proper germ-free techniques with sterile equipment.
- Maintain the catheter's closed sterile drainage system.
- Remove catheters as soon as patients no longer need them. Prolonged use is the most important risk factor for CAUTIs. Healthcare facilities should follow the 2009 CDC Guideline for Prevention of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections. The guideline emphasizes the proper use, insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters in different healthcare settings. It also presents effective quality improvement programs that healthcare facilities can use to prevent CAUTIs. Acute care hospitals Acute care hospitals should follow Strategies to Prevent Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2022 Update. Assessment tools Facilities can monitor CAUTI rates and assess the effectiveness of prevention efforts through CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network. Facilities can also identify infection prevention gaps and launch tailored interventions to reduce CAUTI risk with the Targeted Assessment for Prevention Strategy.

### Treatment and prevention of recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women: a rapid review with practice recommendations [^116LonYk]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women are a highly prevalent and burdensome condition for which best practice guidelines for treatment and prevention that minimize harm and optimize well-being are greatly needed. To inform development of practice recommendations, a rapid literature review of original research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and practice guidelines was conducted.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Embase®, Opus, Scopus®, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library and the U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse electronic databases were searched from inception to September 22, 2017. Articles and practice guidelines were included if they were in English, were peer reviewed, included women, involved treatment or prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection and reported an outcome related to recurrence rates of urinary tract infection. Critical appraisal of original studies was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and of systematic reviews using the AMSTAR 2 tool.

Results

Of 1,582 citations identified 74 met our study inclusion criteria. These comprised 49 randomized controlled trials, 23 systematic reviews (16 with meta-analyses) and 2 practice guidelines. No study reported a multi-targeted treatment approach. There was a lack of high quality studies and systematic reviews evaluating prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection.

Conclusions

We recommend an algorithmic approach to care that includes education on lifestyle and behavioral modifications, and addresses specific populations of women with antimicrobial based and nonantibiotic alternatives. This approach includes the use of vaginal estrogen with or without lactobacillus containing probiotics in postmenopausal women, low dose post-coital antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infection associated with sexual activity in premenopausal women, low dose daily antibiotic prophylaxis in premenopausal women with infections unrelated to sexual activity, and methenamine hippurate and/or lactobacillus containing probiotics as nonantibiotic alternatives. Future research should involve consistent use of terminology, validated instruments to assess response to interventions and patient perspectives on care. Our treatment algorithm is based on the best available evidence, and fills a gap in the literature and practice regarding effective strategies to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in women.

### Preventing urinary tract infection in older people living in care homes: the 'StOP UTI' realist synthesis [^114KfT93]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most diagnosed infection in older people living in care homes.

Objective

To identify interventions for recognising and preventing UTI in older people living in care homes in the UK and explain the mechanisms by which they work, for whom and under what circumstances.

Methods

A realist synthesis of evidence was undertaken to develop programme theory underlying strategies to recognise and prevent UTI. A generic topic-based search of bibliographic databases was completed with further purposive searches to test and refine the programme theory in consultation with stakeholders.

Results

56 articles were included in the review. Nine context–mechanism–outcome configurations were developed and arranged across three theory areas: (1) Strategies to support accurate recognition of UTI, (2) care strategies for residents to prevent UTI and (3) making best practice happen. Our programme theory explains how care staff can be enabled to recognise and prevent UTI when this is incorporated into care routines and activities that meet the fundamental care needs and preferences of residents. This is facilitated through active and visible leadership by care home managers and education that is contextualised to the work and role of care staff.

Conclusions

Care home staff have a vital role in preventing and recognising UTI in care home residents.

Incorporating this into the fundamental care they provide can help them to adopt a proactive approach to preventing infection and avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use. This requires a context of care with a culture of personalisation and safety, promoted by commissioners, regulators and providers, where leadership and resources are committed to support preventative action by knowledgeable care staff.

### Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113weupH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Around 40–50% of women experience at least one urinary tract infection (UTI) during their lifetime and 20–30% of these have a recurrence within 3–4 months of the initial infection.¹ Recurrent UTI (usually defined as three episodes in the last 12 months or two episodes in the last 6 months) can have a considerable impact on a woman's quality of life. Each episode of acute UTI in young women is typically associated with about 6 days of symptoms, 2.4 days of restricted activities and 0.4 days of bed rest.¹ Antibacterial prophylaxis is effective in preventing recurrent episodes, but at the expense of unwanted effects and a risk of promoting bacterial resistance. Here we assess the efficacy of different antibacterial regimens and non-antibacterial alternatives (cranberry, probiotics, oestrogens, immunostimulation, hyaluronic acid and chondroitin, acupuncture and herbs) in the prevention of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in women.

### Urinary tract infection in children: recurrent infections [^116AyWgw]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 11% of girls and 7% of boys will have had a urinary tract infection (UTI) by the age of 16 years, and recurrence of infection is common. Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is identified in up to 40% of children being investigated for a first UTI, and is a risk factor for, but weak predictor of, renal parenchymal defects.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

We found three studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following intervention: prophylactic antibiotics.

### Can vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections? [^111RyyrU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and hypothesis

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are a burden to patients and the health care economy. Vaginal probiotics and supplements have gained significant attention in mainstream media and lay press as a non-antibiotic alternative. We performed a systematic review to determine whether vaginal probiotics are an effective means of prophylaxis for rUTI.

Methods

A PubMed/MEDLINE article search was performed from inception to August 2022 for prospective, in vivo use of vaginal suppositories for the prevention of rUTIs. Search terms included: vaginal probiotic suppository (34 results), vaginal probiotic randomized (184 results), vaginal probiotic prevention (441 results), vaginal probiotic UTI (21 results), and vaginal probiotic urinary tract infection (91 results). A total of 771 article titles and abstracts were screened.

Results

A total of 8 articles fit the inclusion criteria and were reviewed and summarized. Four were randomized controlled trials, with 3 of the studies having a placebo arm. Three were prospective cohort studies, and 1 was a single arm, open label trial. Five of the 7 articles that specifically evaluated for rUTI reduction with vaginal suppositories did find a decreased incidence with probiotic use; however, only 2 had statistically significant results. Both of these were studies of Lactobacillus crispatus and were not randomized. Three studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Lactobacillus as a vaginal suppository.

Conclusion

Current data support the use of vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacillus as a safe, non-antibiotic measure, but actual reduction of rUTI in susceptible women remains inconclusive. The appropriate dosing and duration of therapy remain unknown.

### Reducing unnecessary urinary catheter use and other strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection: an integrative review [^113YJ8VU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

The problem

Urinary tract infection (UTI) has long been considered the most common healthcare-associated infection (HAI), with the vast majority of these infections occurring after placement of the convenient, uncomfortable, often unnecessaryand easily forgotten urinary catheter. With an estimated449 334 healthcare-associated catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) per year, associated with an additional cost (in 2007) of US$749–1007per admission (or an estimated US$3744 when complicated by blood stream infections), it is not surprising that CAUTIs were among the first hospital-acquired conditions selected for non-payment by Medicare as of October 2008, and have been further targeted for complete eliminationas a 'never event', with a national goal to reduce CAUTI by 25% by 2014. These national initiatives renewed public and research interest in the prevention of CAUTI, prompting updates of several comprehensive guidelinesand reviews of strategies to prevent CAUTI released since the 2001 Making Health Care Safer report.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### An update on uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^11321799]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women comprise uncomplicated and complicated UTIs. Uncomplicated UTIs, such as acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, are very common infections in otherwise healthy women, with a high tendency to recur. Although severe complications are rare, their high prevalence causes remarkable costs in the healthcare systems.

Recent Findings

As most scientific evidence has been gathered in uncomplicated UTI, this study focuses on recent developments in epidemiology, pathogenesis, cause, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTI and recurrent UTI in women.

Summary

A remarkable increase of antibiotic resistance is also noted in uncomplicated UTI. Therefore, prudent use of antibiotic substances in uncomplicated UTI is increasingly important.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^113R4mk2]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published before November 2012 identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library; conference abstracts for 2006–12 were also reviewed.

Inclusion criteria Studies were included if they examined antibiotic prophylaxis administered to prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection after removal of a short term (≤ 14 days) urinary catheter.

Results Seven controlled studies had symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal as an endpoint; six were randomized controlled trials (five published; one in abstract form) and one was a non-randomized controlled intervention study. Five of these seven studies were in surgical patients. Studies were heterogeneous in the type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis and the period of observation. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with benefit to the patient, with an absolute reduction in risk of urinary tract infection of 5.8% between intervention and control groups. The risk ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72). The number needed to treat to prevent one urinary tract infection was 17 (12 to 30).

Conclusions Patients admitted to hospital who undergo short term urinary catheterization might benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis when the catheter is removed as they experience fewer subsequent urinary tract infections. Potential disadvantages of more widespread antimicrobial prophylaxis (side effects and cost of antibiotics, development of antimicrobial resistance) might be mitigated by the identification of which patients are most likely to benefit from this approach.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (from 1950), EMBASE (from 1980), reference lists of articles and abstracts from conference proceedings without language restriction. Manufacturers' of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies and contact was made with known investigators. Date of last search: June 2012

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-RCTs of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible. A comparison with a control/no treatment group was a prerequisite for selection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). An exploration of heterogeneity and a detailed description of results, grouped by population, was undertaken.

Main Results

Thirteen studies (2032 participants) were included. Six studies (654 patients) reported symptomatic UTI and eight studies (796 patients) reported bacteriuria. Overall, study quality was mixed. The overall pooled estimates for the major outcome measures were not interpretable because of underlying heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses suggested that methenamine hippurate may have some benefit in patients without renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.89; bacteriuria: RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83), but not in patients with known renal tract abnormalities (symptomatic UTI: RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 6.20; bacteriuria: RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.54 to 3.07). For short-term treatment duration (1 week or less) there was a significant reduction in symptomatic UTI in those without renal tract abnormalities (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38). The rate of adverse events was low.

Authors' Conclusions

Methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI in patients without renal tract abnormalities, particularly when used for short-term prophylaxis. It does not appear to work in patients with neuropathic bladder or in patients who have renal tract abnormalities. The rate of adverse events was low, but poorly described. There is a need for further large well-conducted RCTs to clarify this question, particularly for longer term use for people without neuropathic bladder.

### Urinary tract infection and neuropathic bladder [^111v2KvV]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common infection in patients with neurogenic bladder. Diagnosis is fraught with challenges since there is no globally accepted definition for UTI and symptoms can vary widely. Due to the increased risk of morbidity, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the risk of UTI, diagnostic criteria, and to treat aggressively when UTI is confirmed. Prevention of UTI is optimal but more studies are needed to identify the best methods to prevent UTIs in this population.

### Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^114CBQQK]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children is common (5–10%) and recurs in 10–30%. UTI causes an unpleasant, usually febrile illness in children. This review focuses on studies evaluating interventions to prevent UTI in children and published between January 2007 and June 2008.

Recent Findings

Three relevant updated Cochrane reviews, six randomized trials and an evidence-based guideline were published in the study period. Five of the six trials and one of the three Cochrane updates included data on the effects of relevant interventions in children. Three of the six trials investigated the efficacy of long-term, low-dose antibiotics as prophylaxis, and the other trials and both Cochrane updates evaluated complementary therapies such as vitamin A, probiotics and herbal supplements.

Summary

The benefit of prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in children remains unclear because of underpowered and suboptimally designed trials, but these studies suggest that any benefit is likely to be small, and clinical significance may be limited. The trials of complementary interventions (vitamin A, probiotics, cranberry, nasturtium and horseradish) generally gave favourable results but were not conclusive. Children and families who use these products should be aware that further infections are possible despite their use.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections among women: comparative effectiveness of 5 prevention and management strategies using a Markov chain monte carlo model [^115VGBex]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem among women. However, comparative effectiveness strategies for managing recurrent UTIs are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature review of management of women experiencing ≥ 3 UTIs per year. We then developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo model of recurrent UTI for each management strategy with ≥ 2 adequate trials published. We simulated a cohort that experienced 3 UTIs/year and a secondary cohort that experienced 8 UTIs/year. Model outcomes were treatment efficacy, patient and payer cost, and health-related quality of life.

Results

Five strategies had ≥ 2 clinical trials published: (1) daily antibiotic (nitrofurantoin) prophylaxis; (2) daily estrogen prophylaxis; (3) daily cranberry prophylaxis; (4) acupuncture prophylaxis; and (5) symptomatic self-treatment. In the 3 UTIs/year model, nitrofurantoin prophylaxis was most effective, reducing the UTI rate to 0.4 UTIs/year, and the most expensive to the payer ($821/year). All other strategies resulted in payer cost savings but were less efficacious. Symptomatic self-treatment was the only strategy that resulted in patient cost savings, and was the most favorable strategy in term of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

Conclusions

Daily antibiotic use is the most effective strategy for recurrent UTI prevention compared to daily cranberry pills, daily estrogen therapy, and acupuncture. Cost savings to payers and patients were seen for most regimens, and improvement in QALYs were seen with all. Our findings provide clinically meaningful data to guide the physician-patient partnership in determining a preferred method of prevention for this common clinical problem.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^114mRS4A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberries have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library) and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of last search: January 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs in all populations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (UTIs - symptomatic and asymptomatic, side effects, adherence to therapy). Relative risk (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane criteria.

Main Results

Ten studies (n = 1049, five cross-over, five parallel group) were included. Cranberry/cranberry-lingonberry juice versus placebo, juice or water was evaluated in seven studies, and cranberries tablets versus placebo in four studies (one study evaluated both juice and tablets). Cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs at 12 months (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) compared with placebo/control. Cranberry products were more effective reducing the incidence of UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, than elderly men and women or people requiring catheterisation. Six studies were not included in the meta-analyses due to methodological issues or lack of available data. However, only one reported a significant result for the outcome of symptomatic UTIs. Side effects were common in all studies, and dropouts/withdrawals in several of the studies were high.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. It's effectiveness for other groups is less certain. The large number of dropouts/withdrawals indicates that cranberry juice may not be acceptable over long periods of time. It is not clear what is the optimum dosage or method of administration (e.g. juice, tablets or capsules). Further properly designed studies with relevant outcomes are needed.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^113TeMWT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^111teJTQ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

Materials and Methods

A decision tree model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections for patients with a short-term indwelling urinary catheter. The model accounted for incidence of urinary tract infections with and without the use of prophylactic antibiotics, incidence of antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections, as well as costs associated with diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections and antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections. Costs were calculated from the health care system's perspective. We conducted one-way sensitivity analyses.

Results

The base case analysis showed that the use of prophylactic antibiotics is cost-saving in preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The use of prophylactic antibiotics resulted in lower costs and higher quality-adjusted life-years compared with no prophylactic antibiotics. Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal strategy changes to no prophylactic antibiotics when the incidence of urinary tract infections after prophylactic antibiotics exceeds 22% or the incidence of developing urinary tract infections without prophylactic antibiotics is less than 12%. Varying the costs of prophylactic antibiotics, urinary tract infection treatment, or antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infection treatment within a reasonable range did not change the optimal strategy.

Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections is cost-effective under most conditions. These results were sensitive to the likelihood of developing catheter-associated urinary tract infections with and without prophylactic antibiotics. Our results are limited to the cost-effectiveness perspective on this clinical practice.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### The efficacy of probiotics in prevention of urinary tract infection in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111XA1Us]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A consensus has not been reached yet about the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to assess the efficacy of probiotics in prevention UTI in children.

Methods

The present study was designed based on guidelines for systematic reviews of clinical trials. Two independent reviewers performed an extensive search in the Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus electronic databases up to the end of 2016. The summery of eligible studies was assessed independently by two reviewers and recorded in the data extraction form. Finally, a pooled relative risk (RR) was reported with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI).

Results

Data from 10 studies were entered in the present meta-analysis. Probiotic therapy did not have any beneficial effect on the incidence of UTI (RR = 0.94; 95% CI 0.85–1.03; p = 0.19) and its recurrence (RR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.85–1.02; p = 0.14). Subgroup analyses showed that probiotics as monotherapy do not have any beneficial effects on prevention of UTI (RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.89–1.04; p = 0.31). However, the incidence of UTI is reduced if probiotics are used as adjuvant therapy to antibiotics (RR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.85–0.99; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

The present meta-analysis showed that probiotics did not have a beneficial effect in reducing the incidence or recurrence of UTI. Only a moderate efficacy was seen when a probiotic was used as adjuvant therapy to antibiotics.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^115AfYaL]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection — methods and evidence synthesis: To provide evidence for the guideline, 2 literature searches were conducted, including surveillance of Medline-listed literature over the past 10 years and a systematic review on the effectiveness of prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent recurrence of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The search was expanded to include trials published since 1993 comparing antimicrobial prophylaxis with no treatment or placebo for children with VUR; because all except 1 recent randomized controlled trials included children more than 24 months of age and some lacked grade-specific data, the authors of the 6 RCTs were contacted and all provided raw data from their studies specifically addressing infants 2 to 24 months of age, according to grade of VUR. Meta-analysis of these data was performed, results from the literature searches and meta-analyses were provided to committee members, evidence and recommendation strength were graded according to AAP policy, and the subcommittee formulated 7 recommendations presented in text and in algorithm form in the Appendix.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^112aSQ97]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Repeated symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 25% of people who use clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their bladder. We aimed to determine the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTIs in adult users of CISC.

Methods

In this randomised, open-label, superiority trial, we enrolled participants from 51 UK National Health Service organisations. These participants were community-dwelling (as opposed to hospital inpatient) users of CISC with recurrent UTIs. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis once daily (prophylaxis group) or no prophylaxis (control group) for 12 months by use of an internet-based system with permuted blocks of variable length. Trial and laboratory staff who assessed outcomes were masked to allocation but participants were aware of their treatment group. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months. Participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Change in antimicrobial resistance of urinary and faecal bacteria was monitored as a secondary outcome. The AnTIC trial is registered at ISRCTN, number 67145101; and EudraCT, number 2013–002556–32.

Findings

Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 adult users of CISC for eligibility, of whom 404 (23%) participants were enrolled between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 31, 2016. Of these 404 participants, 203 (50%) were allocated to receive prophylaxis and 201 (50%) to receive no prophylaxis. 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. The primary analysis included 181 (89%) adults allocated to the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) adults in the no prophylaxis (control) group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. The incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months was 1.3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1.1–1.6) in the prophylaxis group and 2.6 (2.3–2.9) in the control group, giving an incidence rate ratio of 0.52 (0.44–0.61; p < 0.0001), indicating a 48% reduction in UTI frequency after treatment with prophylaxis. Use of prophylaxis was well tolerated: we recorded 22 minor adverse events in the prophylaxis group related to antibiotic prophylaxis during the study, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbance (six participants), skin rash (six participants), and candidal infection (four participants). However, resistance against the antibiotics used for UTI treatment was more frequent in urinary isolates from the prophylaxis group than in those from the control group at 9–12 months of trial participation (nitrofurantoin 12 [24%] of 51 participants from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants from the control group with at least one isolate; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 vs 21 [33%] of 64; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 vs 15 [24%] of 62; p = 0.002).

Interpretation

Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing UTI frequency in CISC users with recurrent UTIs, and it is well tolerated in these individuals. However, increased resistance of urinary bacteria is a concern that requires surveillance if prophylaxis is started.

### Urinary tract infections: 2021 Update [^11176wb8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) remains one of the most prevalent, but preventable, health care-associated infections and predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. Duration of urinary catheterization is the most important modifiable risk factor for development of CAUTI. Alternatives to indwelling catheters should be considered in appropriate patients. If indwelling catheterization is necessary, proper aseptic practices for catheter insertion and maintenance and use of a closed catheter collection system are essential for preventing CAUTI. The use of intervention bundles and collaboratives helps in the effective implementation of CAUTI prevention measures.

### Effectiveness of prophylactic oral and / or vaginal probiotic supplementation in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1142P7i8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Widespread antibiotic resistance has sparked interest in the identification of nonantibiotic strategies, particularly probiotics for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). We evaluated the effectiveness of prophylactic probiotic supplementation through oral and intravaginal routes in the prevention of recurrent UTIs.

Methods

This double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 174 premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTIs and randomized them to 1 of the 4 treatment groups: placebo (G1, oral placebo + vaginal placebo), oral probiotic (G2, oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria + vaginal placebo), vaginal probiotic (G3, oral placebo + vaginal lactobacilli), and probiotic combination (oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria + vaginal lactobacilli), for 4 months. Participants were followed up for symptomatic UTIs for 1 year. The primary end points were the number of symptomatic UTIs at 4 months, the proportion of participants with at least 1 symptomatic UTI, and the time to the first symptomatic UTI.

Results

The incidence of UTI at 4 months in G1, G2, G3, and G4 was 70.4%, 61.3%, 40.9%, and 31.8%, respectively. The mean number of symptomatic UTI recurrences at 4 months was significantly lower (P < .05) in G3 (1.06) and G4 (1.07) compared with G1 (2.1) and G2 (1.63). Further, the time to first symptomatic UTI (days) was significantly longer (P < .05) in G3 (123.8) and G4 (141.8) compared with G1 (69.3) and G2 (71.9). Probiotic supplementations were well tolerated with no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Prophylactic supplementation with either vaginal probiotics or in combination with oral probiotics demonstrated effectiveness in preventing recurrent symptomatic UTI episodes.

### Chinese herbal medicine for treating recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113Pt6UR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that affects 40% to 50% of women. Between 20% and 30% of women who have had a UTI will experience a recurrence, and around 25% will develop ongoing recurrent episodes with implications for individual well-being and healthcare costs. Prophylactic antibiotics can prevent recurrent UTIs but there are growing concerns about microbial resistance, side effects from treatment and lack of long-term benefit. Consequently, alternative treatments are being investigated. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has a recorded history of treating UTI symptoms and more recent research suggests a potential role in the management of recurrent UTIs. This review aimed to evaluate CHM for recurrent UTI.

Objectives

This review assessed the benefits and harms of CHM for the treatment of recurrent UTIs in adult women, both as a stand-alone therapy and in conjunction with other pharmaceutical interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 7 May 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator, using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched AMED, CINAHL and the Chinese language electronic databases Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), China Network on Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and Wan Fang Databases to July 2014.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatments using CHM with either an inactive placebo or conventional biomedical treatment. RCTs comparing different CHM strategies and treatments were eligible for inclusion. Quasi-randomised studies were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors. Where more than one publication of one study existed, these were grouped and the publication with the most complete data was used in the analyses. Where relevant outcomes were only published in earlier versions these data were used. All meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved a total of 542 women; of these, five recruited post-menopausal women (aged from 56 to 70 years) (422 women). We assessed all studies to be at high risk of bias. Meta-analyses comparing the overall effectiveness of treatments during acute phases of infection and rates of recurrence were conducted. Analysis of three studies involving 282 women that looked at CHM versus antibiotics suggested that CHM had a higher rate of effectiveness for acute UTI (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 33) and reduced recurrent UTI rates (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.82). Analysis of two studies involving 120 women that compared CHM plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone found the combined intervention had a higher rate of effectiveness for acute UTI (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47) and resulted in lower rates of recurrent infection six months after the study (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.80). One study comparing different CHM treatments found Er Xian Tang was more effective in treating acute infection in post-menopausal women than San Jin Pian (80 women: RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.57). Analysis showed that active CHM treatments specifically formulated for recurrent UTI were more effective in reducing infection incidence than generic CHM treatments that were more commonly used for acute UTI (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.77). Only two studies undertook to report adverse events; neither reported the occurrence of any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from seven small studies suggested that CHM as an independent intervention or in conjunction with antibiotics may be beneficial for treating recurrent UTIs during the acute phase of infection and may reduce the recurrent UTI incidence for at least six months post-treatment. CHM treatments specifically formulated for recurrent UTI may be more effective than herbal treatments designed to treat acute UTI. However, the small number and poor quality of the included studies meant that it was not possible to formulate robust conclusions on the use of CHM for recurrent UTI in women either alone or as an adjunct to antibiotics.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^113zMkff]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection.:

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published before November 2012 identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library; conference abstracts for 2006–12 were also reviewed.

Inclusion Criteria

Studies were included if they examined antibiotic prophylaxis administered to prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection after removal of a short term (≤ 14 days) urinary catheter.

Results

Seven controlled studies had symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal as an endpoint; six were randomized controlled trials (five published; one in abstract form) and one was a non-randomized controlled intervention study. Five of these seven studies were in surgical patients. Studies were heterogeneous in the type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis and the period of observation. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with benefit to the patient, with an absolute reduction in risk of urinary tract infection of 5.8% between intervention and control groups. The risk ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72). The number needed to treat to prevent one urinary tract infection was 17 (12 to 30).

Conclusions

Patients admitted to hospital who undergo short term urinary catheterization might benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis when the catheter is removed as they experience fewer subsequent urinary tract infections. Potential disadvantages of more widespread antimicrobial prophylaxis (side effects and cost of antibiotics, development of antimicrobial resistance) might be mitigated by the identification of which patients are most likely to benefit from this approach.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115xMvaN]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Repeated symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 25% of people who use clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their bladder. We aimed to determine the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTIs in adult users of CISC.

Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 adult users of CISC for eligibility, of whom 404 (23%) participants were enrolled between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 31, 2016. Of these 404 participants, 203 (50%) were allocated to receive prophylaxis and 201 (50%) to receive no prophylaxis. 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. The primary analysis included 181 (89%) adults allocated to the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) adults in the no prophylaxis (control) group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. The incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months was 1.3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1.1–1.6) in the prophylaxis group and 2.6 (2.3–2.9) in the control group, giving an incidence rate ratio of 0.52 (0.44–0.61; p < 0.0001), indicating a 48% reduction in UTI frequency after treatment with prophylaxis. Use of prophylaxis was well tolerated: we recorded 22 minor adverse events in the prophylaxis group related to antibiotic prophylaxis during the study, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbance (six participants), skin rash (six participants), and candidal infection (four participants). However, resistance against the antibiotics used for UTI treatment was more frequent in urinary isolates from the prophylaxis group than in those from the control group at 9–12 months of trial participation (nitrofurantoin 12 [24%] of 51 participants from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants from the control group with at least one isolate; p = 0.038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 vs 21 [33%] of 64; p = 0.0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 vs 15 [24%] of 62; p = 0.002).

Interpretation

Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing UTI frequency in CISC users with recurrent UTIs, and it is well tolerated in these individuals. However, increased resistance of urinary bacteria is a concern that requires surveillance if prophylaxis is started.

### Methenamine hippurate for preventing urinary tract infections [^116x9SpR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Methenamine salts are often used for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTI.

Search Strategy

Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, reference lists of review articles and retrieved trials. The manufacturers' of methenamine salts were contacted for unpublished studies and contact was made with known investigators in the area.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of methenamine hippurate used for the prevention of UTIs in all population groups were eligible for inclusion. A comparison with a control (no treatment) group was a prerequisite to selection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (BL and TB) performed independent assessment and data extraction using a standardised format. Discrepancies, methodological and interpretative issues were discussed with JS or JC. An exploration of heterogeneity as well as a detailed description of results grouped by population was conducted.

Main Results

Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. All trials were included in a descriptive analysis. Seven trials were included in meta-analyses. Four trials (199 patients) studied symptomatic bacteriuria and six trials (341 patients) studied bacteriuria as an outcome measure. Overall, trial quality was poor. The direction of six of the pooled trials was towards a favourable treatment effect from methenamine hippurate. Interpretation of the pooled estimates was not done in view of underlying heterogeneity. The study by Pettersson 1989 explained some, but not all, of the underlying heterogeneity. This study differed from all others by including patients with known upper renal tract abnormalities. Adverse reactions were mentioned by 10 studies. The rate of adverse events was low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to conclusively support the use of methenamine hippurate for urinary prophylaxis. An exploration of heterogeneity raises the (hypothesis generating) possibility that methenamine hippurate may have some efficacy in patients without but not in patients with known upper renal tract abnormality (with asymptomatic bacteriuria as the outcome measure). Due to the small sample size and methodological problems within the studies involved, interpretation of these data should be done cautiously. The rate of adverse events reported by the trials was low, which suggests that current usage is unlikely to be causing significant harm.

### The role of nonantibiotic treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections [^113np9Mq]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize evidence on the efficacy of nonantibiotic treatments in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The need for antibiotic-free regimens seems to be imperative given the worldwide rates of resistance of uropathogens to available antibiotics.

Recent Findings

In the recently published literature, cranberry products and probiotics are the focus of research. They both seem to be effective in preventing recurrent UTIs compared with placebo, but their benefit becomes less clear when they are compared with antibiotics.

Summary

A number of nonantibiotic-containing alternatives are available for the prevention of recurrent UTIs. For the majority of these alternatives, contradictory results have been published. These can be, at least partially, explained by variation in doses administered and duration of treatment. Selection of patients more likely to benefit from these interventions seems to be a realistic approach from a clinical-practice perspective, as well a worthwhile focus for future research.

### Antimicrobial agents for preventing urinary tract infections in adults undergoing cystoscopy [^111gvSzC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystoscopy is commonly performed for diagnostic purposes to inspect the interior lining of the bladder. One disadvantage of cystoscopy is the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) due to pre-existing colonization or by introduction of bacteria at the time of the procedure. However, the incidence of symptomatic UTI following cystoscopy is low. Currently, there is no consensus on whether antimicrobial agents should be used to prevent symptomatic UTI for cystoscopy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo or no treatment for prevention of UTI in adults undergoing cystoscopy.

Search Methods

We comprehensively searched electronic databases of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We used no language or date restrictions in the electronic searches. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors for related information. The last search of the electronic databases was 4 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared any prophylactic antibiotic versus placebo, no treatment, or other non-antibiotic prophylaxis in adults undergoing cystoscopy. There was no restriction on the dose, frequency, formulation, duration, or mode of administration of the antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were systemic UTI, symptomatic UTI (composite of systemic and/or localized UTI), and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were minor adverse events, localized UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial resistance. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with 7711 participants, all of which compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment control. We found no studies comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with non-antibiotic prophylaxis. Primary outcomesSystemic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on the risk of systemic UTI compared with placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 3.32; 5 RCTs; 504 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to two more people (95% CI 12 fewer to 46 more) per 1000 people developing a systemic UTI. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Symptomatic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.86; 11 RCTs; 5441 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to 30 fewer people (95% CI 42 fewer to 8 fewer) per 1000 people developing a symptomatic UTI when provided with antibiotic prophylaxis. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and potential publication bias. Serious adverse events: the studies reported no serious adverse events in either the intervention group or control group and no effect size could be calculated. Antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (4 RCTs, 630 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we are very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Secondary outcomesMinor adverse events: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on minor adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 14.80; 4 RCTs; 630 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Localized UTI: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on the risk of localized UTI (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.77; 1 RCT; 200 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we were very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Bacterial resistance: prophylactic antibiotics may increase bacterial resistance (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.87; 38 participants; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), but we were uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. We were able to perform few secondary analyses; these did not suggest any subgroup effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI but not systemic UTIs. Serious and minor adverse events may not be increased with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The findings are informed by low- and very low-quality evidence ratings for all outcomes.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infection in people with neuropathic bladder [^117QdkhU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic or neurogenic bladder describes a process of dysfunctional voiding as the result of injury in the brain, spinal cord or nerves innervating the bladder. People with neuropathic bladder, such as from spinal cord injury (SCI), are at significant risk of morbidity from urinary tract infections (UTI). Effective methods to prevent UTI in people with SCI have been sought for many years. Probiotics (micro-organisms that exert beneficial health effects in the host) have been recommended for bacterial interference of the urological tract to reduce colonisation by uropathogen and to manage the dual problems of infection and antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of probiotics in preventing symptomatic UTI in people with neuropathic bladder compared with placebo, no therapy, or non-antibiotic prophylaxis (cranberry juice, methenamine hippurate, topical oestrogen).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 10 March 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cross-over RCTs looking at the use of probiotics for the prophylaxis of UTI in people with neuropathic bladders was considered for inclusion. Men, women and children of all ages with neuropathic bladders from neurological injury such as suprapontine, supra sacral and sacral aetiologies was included. All bladder management types, including reflex voiding, time voiding, indwelling and intermittent catheterization were eligible for this review. Studies comparing probiotics to placebo, no treatment or other non-antibiotic prophylaxis was included. Studies comparing probiotics with antibiotics or in combination with antibiotics were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were planned for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

This review includes a total of three studies (one cross-over and two parallel RCTs) which involved 110 participants. All three studies looked at intravesical instillation of a low virulent Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain in reducing the risk of symptomatic UTI in participants with neuropathic bladder, predominantly from SCI. Two studies used the E. coli 83972 strain and one study used the E. coli HU2117 strain. We did not find any RCTs involving other probiotics or other routes of administration for preventing UTI in people with neuropathic bladder. There was consistency in definition of symptomatic UTI in all three studies. Symptoms that all studies considered were relevant to diagnose UTI were adequately defined. All three studies defined microbiological diagnosis of symptomatic UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was not considered an outcome measure in any of the included studies; however it was defined in two studies to establish successful inoculation. It is uncertain if the risk of symptomatic UTI is reduced with bladder inoculation using E. coli because the certainty of the evidence is very low (3 studies, 110 participants: RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.19; I² = 82%). Two studies reported adverse events. One study reported one episode of autonomic dysreflexia. One study reported three symptomatic UTI occurring in two patients, and two studies mentioned the absence of septicaemia and pyelonephritis. Intravesical instillation was reported as "generally safe". One study reported high attrition rates in participants due to the need to adhere to strict instillation protocols. The overall quality of the studies was poor. All three studies had high risk of attrition bias due to failure of an intention-to-treat analysis which undermines the randomisation process and weakened the results of the studies. All three studies also had high risk of reporting bias.

Authors' Conclusions

In this review, there were no studies identified addressing oral probiotics in preventing UTI in people with neuropathic bladder. It is uncertain if the risk of symptomatic UTI is reduced in people with neuropathic bladders via intravesical instillation of non-pathogenic E. coli as data were derived from small studies with high risk of bias. Although very minimal levels of harm was reported with this procedure, due to variable success rates, the need for strict adherence to instillation protocols together with high attrition rates in these studies, it is doubtful bladder instillation will be a widely accepted intervention in its current form. It is recommended that further appropriately powered RCTs with more robust methodological reporting be carried out.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111MdFtY]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings suggest that methenamine hippurate offers comparable efficacy to antibiotics in preventing symptomatic UTIs and reducing positive urine cultures, with a potentially favorable safety profile. However, the higher ABU rates in the methenamine group warrant further investigation to elucidate their clinical significance. The evidence supports methenamine hippurate as a viable non-antibiotic prophylactic option, particularly for patients aiming to minimize antibiotic exposure.

Future research should address the methodological shortcomings identified in this review, including the need for standardized UTI definitions, comprehensive reporting of adverse events, and evaluations of microbial resistance. Such studies are essential to refining clinical guidelines and optimizing the role of methenamine hippurate in UTI prevention. By expanding the evidence base, clinicians can better tailor prophylactic strategies to individual patient needs, balancing efficacy, safety, and the growing imperative to mitigate antibiotic resistance.

### Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections [^117QGVuZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cranberries have been used widely for several decades for the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the third update of our review first published in 1998 and updated in 2004 and 2008.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library) and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of search: July 2012

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products for the prevention of UTIs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.

Main Results

This updated review includes a total of 24 studies (six cross-over studies, 11 parallel group studies with two arms; five with three arms, and two studies with a factorial design) with a total of 4473 participants. Ten studies were included in the 2008 update, and 14 studies have been added to this update. Thirteen studies (2380 participants) evaluated only cranberry juice/concentrate; nine studies (1032 participants) evaluated only cranberry tablets/capsules; one study compared cranberry juice and tablets; and one study compared cranberry capsules and tablets. The comparison/control arms were placebo, no treatment, water, methenamine hippurate, antibiotics, or lactobacillus. Eleven studies were not included in the meta-analyses because either the design was a cross-over study and data were not reported separately for the first phase, or there was a lack of relevant data. Data included in the meta-analyses showed that, compared with placebo, water or not treatment, cranberry products did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTI overall (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.04) or for any the subgroups: women with recurrent UTIs (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.31); older people (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.44); pregnant women (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17); children with recurrent UTI (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.22); cancer patients (RR 1.15 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77); or people with neuropathic bladder or spinal injury (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.20). Overall heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 55%). The effectiveness of cranberry was not significantly different to antibiotics for women (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.85, 2.02) and children (RR 0.69 95% CI 0.32 to 1.51). There was no significant difference between gastrointestinal adverse effects from cranberry product compared to those of placebo/no treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.27). Many studies reported low compliance and high withdrawal/dropout problems which they attributed to palatability/acceptability of the products, primarily the cranberry juice. Most studies of other cranberry products (tablets and capsules) did not report how much of the 'active' ingredient the product contained, and therefore the products may not have had enough potency to be effective.

Authors' Conclusions

Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113Ruog8]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection in women — evidence review search strategy and inclusion criteria included searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January, Week 1, 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018), with an update on September 20, 2018; inclusion focused on women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) defined as ≥ 3 UTIs in a 12-month period or ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period, and also studies where the mean or median number of UTIs in a 12‑month period was ≥ 3; exclusions included pregnant women, rUTIs due to self‑catheterization or indwelling catheters, and prevention of UTI in operative or procedural settings; evaluated interventions included diagnostic tests for rUTI, antibiotics for acute UTI and prevention, cranberry, Lactobacillus, estrogen, and other preventive treatments, with outcomes including UTI recurrence, UTI‑related symptoms, recurrence rate, hospitalization, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse effects associated with interventions.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^116Qcf5R]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics urinary tract infection guideline — antimicrobial prophylaxis considerations state that although effectiveness for prevention of UTI has not been demonstrated, the concept has biological plausibility. Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^114dyXM9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This trial provides clear, robust evidence of the effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis as a preventive strategy against repeated UTIs for adults using CISC who have recurrent UTIs, which we showed over 12 months with three drugs that are licensed in the UK. The lower 95% confidence limit for the risk reduction (39%) in the primary outcome surpassed our prespecified minimal clinically important difference (20%). This confidence limit was also greater than that seen in a previous studyof children. The benefits of prophylaxis were valued by participants in the prophylaxis group, who were satisfied with treatment and most of whom elected to continue prophylaxis long-term. However, the measured health status of participants was not improved from the impaired values at baseline in either group.

Increased development of antimicrobial resistance over the 12-month trial duration in the prophylaxis group is a major concern that limits the appeal of the prophylaxis strategy. This finding was particularly evident for drugs that were used for prophylaxis in the trial but was also seen for other antibiotics that are commonly prescribed for treatment of UTI. This finding was broadly consistent with a trialdone in children.

### Technical report-diagnosis and management of an initial UTI in febrile infants and young children [^112uqQgp]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young children are clinically challenging. This report was developed to inform the revised, evidence-based, clinical guideline regarding the diagnosis and management of initial UTIs in febrile infants and young children, 2 to 24 months of age, from the American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection.

Methods

The conceptual model presented in the 1999 technical report was updated after a comprehensive review of published literature. Studies with potentially new information or with evidence that reinforced the 1999 technical report were retained. Meta-analyses on the effectiveness of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent recurrent UTI were performed.

Results

Review of recent literature revealed new evidence in the following areas. Certain clinical findings and new urinalysis methods can help clinicians identify febrile children at very low risk of UTI. Oral antimicrobial therapy is as effective as parenteral therapy in treating UTI. Data from published, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI when vesicoureteral reflux is found through voiding cystourethrography. Ultrasonography of the urinary tract after the first UTI has poor sensitivity. Early antimicrobial treatment may decrease the risk of renal damage from UTI.

Conclusions

Recent literature agrees with most of the evidence presented in the 1999 technical report, but meta-analyses of data from recent, randomized controlled trials do not support antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile UTI. This finding argues against voiding cystourethrography after the first UTI.

### Effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing urinary tract infections: an updated systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116G8LKp]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are a significant health problem worldwide, especially among women. methenamine hippurate has been proposed as a preventive measure against recurrent UTIs. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate in preventing UTIs, incorporating the latest research findings and employing trial sequential analysis to assess the robustness of the evidence.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted across MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar up to March 2024 for randomized controlled trials comparing methenamine hippurate with placebo or antibiotic in adult women with a history of recurrent, confirmed UTIs. Key outcomes included symptomatic UTIs as primary outcome and positive urine culture, asymptomatic bacteriuria and adverse effects as secondary outcomes. It is important to state that asymptomatic UTIs with negative urine cultures were not adequately accounted for in the studies; therefore, this outcome was excluded from our meta-analysis. Additionally, adverse effects related to antibiotic resistance were not described in the studies, so only the adverse effects of the medications themselves were considered. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2, and statistical analysis was conducted using RStudio software.

Results

We retrieved 5 articles, encompassing 216 patients in the methenamine group and 205 patients in the control group (Antibiotic). Our analysis revealed non-inferiority in the rate of symptomatic UTI episodes between the two groups (RR 1.15; 95%CI 0.96,1.38; p = 0.41; I² = 0%). Similarly, there were no notable distinctions in the rate of positive urine cultures (RR 1.20; 95CI 0.91, 1.57; p = 0.25; I² = 28%), and the rate of adverse effects (RR 0.98; 95CI 0.86, 1.12; p = 0.35; I² = 9%). However, we observed a decreased frequency of asymptomatic bacteriuria in the control group (RR 1.91; 95CI 1.29, 2.81; p = 0.0001; I² = 0%). In trial sequential analysis, existing studies were not able to achieve the futility boundaries.

Conclusions

Overall, our meta-analysis provides evidence supporting methenamine hippurate as an effective, non-inferior and safe prophylactic option for preventing recurrent UTIs in adult women, as demonstrated by the current evidence base. Nevertheless, more RCTs are necessary to achieve the futility boundaries in trial sequential analysis.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113JtMm9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection guideline methods — data synthesis and meta-analysis state that evidence tables included study characteristics, results, and risk of bias ratings; for interventions to prevent rUTIs, meta-analysis used the random effects DerSimonian and Laird model in RevMan 5.3.5 when there were at least three studies that could be pooled; antibiotic analyses were stratified by specific antibiotic and estrogen analyses by systemic versus topical administration; sensitivity analysis excluded high risk of bias trials; for acute UTI antibiotic treatment, pooled estimates came from systematic reviews; heterogeneity is reported via I2 calculations; prior meta-analyses were not updated but new trials were checked for consistency; and some Key Questions had too few studies for meta-analysis.

### Gaps in knowledge and recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113BSLEM]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The focus of this review is to present recent literature and gaps in knowledge (GIKs) surrounding the current and future treatment and prevention of uncomplicated recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) in women.

Recent Findings

Recurrent urinary tract infections are common, significantly reduce quality of life, and create a substantial economic burden to the healthcare system. They are disproportionately affecting the postmenopausal women. Antibiotics, which are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of uncomplicated rUTI, have become problematic, as there is a global rise in allergy and resistance to these agents and their use is associated with further antimicrobial resistance. Thus, in recent decades, several alternative, nonantibiotic approaches have been evaluated.

Summary

There is a critical need for a concerted and standardized methodology for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring women with rUTIs. Additionally, novel nonantibiotic alternative treatment and preventive measures for UTIs are desperately required to address the global issue of antibiotic recalcitrance in all age groups, and specifically older women. Research efforts have sought to develop alternative and more effective techniques; many of which appear to be promising, but require additional evaluation and validation through clinical trials.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^113G2cVE]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of CAUTI prevention

Routine use of antimicrobial- or antiseptic-impregnated catheters. (Quality of evidence: HIGH)
Breaking a closed system. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheterized patients, except in the few patient populations for which this is anticipated to have more benefit than harm, as detailed in the 2019 IDSA Guideline for Management of Asymptomatic Bacteriuriaand the 2019 US Preventative Services Task Force Recommendation on Asymptomatic Bacteriuria in Adults(eg, pregnant women, patients undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma). (Quality of evidence: HIGH) Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not an effective strategy to prevent CAUTI in other patient groups, as it increases the risk of antibiotic-associated complications more than any potential benefit for the prevention of symptomatic CAUTI. The conditions that predispose the patient to bladder colonization (anatomic, immunologic) are not resolved by antibiotics, so bacteriuria recurs.
Catheter irrigation as a strategy to prevent infection. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Do not perform continuous irrigation of the bladder with antimicrobials as a routine infection prevention measure. If continuous irrigation is being used to prevent obstruction, maintain a closed system.
Routine use of systemic antimicrobials as prophylaxis. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Routine changing of catheters to avoid infection. (Quality of evidence: LOW) In the case of a patient with a long-term catheter in place (ie, > 7 days), catheter replacement can be considered at the time of specimen collection for urine testing to obtain a fresh sample.
Alcohol-based products on the genital mucosa. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Unresolved issues and future areas of study

Use of antiseptic solution versus sterile saline for meatal and perineal cleaning prior to catheter insertion. –,
Use of urinary antiseptics (eg, methenamine) to prevent UTI.
Spatial separation of patients with urinary catheters in place to prevent transmission of pathogens that could colonize urinary drainage systems.
Standard of care for routine replacement of urinary catheters in place > 30 days for infection prevention.
Best practices for optimizing and tailoring implementation of CAUTI prevention and urine-culture stewardship from the adult acute-care setting to the pediatric acute-care setting.
