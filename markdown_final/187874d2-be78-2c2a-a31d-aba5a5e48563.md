## Question

Vibrid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "Vibrid". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Vibrid" is a typographical error for "viridans" streptococci. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of viridans group streptococci across syndromes. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors, followed by pathogenesis and biofilm biology. After that, I need to examine diagnostic challenges and species-level identification. Then, I should appraise antimicrobial resistance patterns and their therapeutic implications. Finally, I will synthesize management principles by syndrome, including endocarditis, neutropenia, and stroke, and close with prevention and a concise clinical takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "Vibrid" does not map to a standard pathogen or drug name. Wait, let me verify the most likely intended term: given the context of oral streptococci and endocarditis, this almost certainly refers to viridans group streptococci, a heterogeneous collection of alpha-hemolytic streptococci that are common oral commensals and important opportunistic pathogens, particularly in infective endocarditis and immunocompromised hosts [^115rxB6p] [^115HSvwt].

> Next, I should review clinical significance across syndromes. Viridans streptococci are a leading cause of community-acquired native valve infective endocarditis, accounting for roughly half of such cases in non–IV drug users, and they are also prominent causes of bacteremia in neutropenic patients, where S. mitis predominates and is linked to shock and respiratory failure. They are implicated in peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, abscesses (notably with anginosus-group species), and increasingly recognized in thrombotic disease through detection in coronary and carotid plaques and cerebral thrombi, suggesting a role in atherothrombosis beyond classic endovascular infection [^116Z7G5t] [^113K88hQ] [^113vZyp3] [^114WtaaA] [^111Kjzuw] [^111st7mJ].

> I will now examine epidemiology and risk factors. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while viridans streptococci are commensals, disease risk clusters in patients with valvular heart disease, prosthetic material, neutropenia, mucositis, high-dose cytarabine, stem cell transplantation, and poor dental health. Dental procedures and even routine activities can cause transient bacteremia, and in children with cancer, VGS bacteremia incidence has risen over time, with S. mitis the predominant species and frequent penicillin nonsusceptibility [^116Z7G5t] [^113K88hQ] [^112r7NWe] [^111tWncF].

> Let me consider pathogenesis, especially biofilm biology. Viridans streptococci are adept at biofilm formation on cardiac valves and within atherosclerotic plaques; biofilm-embedded bacteria evade immune detection and antibiotics, and dispersal of virulent phenotypes from biofilms can trigger local inflammation and plaque rupture. Mechanistically, TLR2-mediated recognition of streptococcal components appears central, with upregulation of inflammatory pathways and matrix metalloproteinases that degrade extracellular matrix and weaken fibrous caps, linking infection to thrombosis and ischemic events [^115HSvwt] [^116hTk4K] [^113L3b82] [^1159ftMW].

> Next, I should review diagnostic challenges and species identification. Traditional phenotypic methods struggle to distinguish among viridans species and from S. pneumoniae; MALDI-TOF MS improves identification but can misclassify some pneumococcus-like isolates, and molecular methods such as MLSA refine speciation. In clinical practice, I need to ensure that blood culture isolates labeled "viridans" are not actually S. pneumoniae or other streptococci, and I should remember that S. suis is frequently misidentified as viridans in some settings, which can delay appropriate management [^116QbBwz] [^113jSGnH] [^116XDTXR] [^116pJuBs].

> I should double-check resistance patterns before recommending therapy. Penicillin nonsusceptibility among viridans streptococci is substantial, with reports ranging from roughly 13–50% depending on the series, and macrolide resistance is common; this variability argues for routine susceptibility testing and caution with empiric monotherapy. Notably, even a single dose of amoxicillin can perturb oral ecology and select for reduced susceptibility, underscoring the need to avoid unnecessary antibiotics and to tailor therapy to culture results [^111TanLh] [^117LQsfr] [^1145nt1X].

> Now, I will synthesize management by syndrome, starting with infective endocarditis. For highly penicillin-susceptible native valve IE (MIC ≤ 0.12 mcg/mL), aqueous penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4 weeks is standard, with a 2-week penicillin or ceftriaxone plus gentamicin regimen reasonable in select uncomplicated cases with normal renal function. For relatively resistant strains (MIC 0.12–0.5 mcg/mL), extend therapy to 6 weeks and add gentamicin for the first 2 weeks. For MIC ≥ 0.5 mcg/mL, treat as enterococcal IE with penicillin or ampicillin plus gentamicin, or use vancomycin if β-lactam intolerant. In prosthetic valve IE, use 6 weeks of penicillin or ceftriaxone plus gentamicin for 2 weeks, with vancomycin as an alternative in β-lactam allergy. I should confirm MICs and adjust duration accordingly, and I must avoid combining vancomycin with gentamicin due to nephrotoxicity risk [^1119VYqS] [^114LqVaW] [^112QAfmX] [^113oc8Pm] [^111x2xwc] [^1119hkQX].

> For neutropenic patients with viridans bacteremia, I need to ensure early recognition of sepsis and shock risk. Empiric therapy should include broad Gram-positive coverage active against viridans streptococci, with many centers favoring vancomycin or a β-lactam with reliable activity pending susceptibilities, given reports of penicillin nonsusceptibility and severe presentations. I should confirm species and susceptibilities to de-escalate appropriately and continue for at least 10–14 days, longer if persistent bacteremia or complications occur [^113K88hQ] [^113TBrNg] [^115ZPyMp].

> Regarding stroke and atherothrombosis, hold on, I should verify causality versus association. Multiple studies detect viridans streptococcal DNA and immunopositive bacteria in coronary and carotid plaques and in cerebral thrombi, and observational data link oral bacterial burden with carotid disease; however, these are largely observational and mechanistic, so I should frame this as a plausible contributor that reinforces the importance of oral health and secondary prevention rather than as established causal therapy targets at this time [^116hTk4K] [^111Kjzuw] [^111st7mJ] [^116K8iRY].

> For peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, I should confirm that viridans streptococci are a recognized cause with generally favorable outcomes but a higher risk of refractory courses. Management follows standard peritonitis protocols with empiric Gram-positive coverage, typically a cephalosporin or vancomycin depending on local resistance, with catheter removal considered for refractory or relapsing cases after 5 days of appropriate therapy [^114WtaaA].

> Prevention is critical, so I need to ensure I align with guidelines. For infective endocarditis, the AHA restricts antibiotic prophylaxis to patients at highest risk and emphasizes dental disease control and access to care. For neutropenic patients, maintain meticulous oral hygiene and consider dental evaluation before chemotherapy. For cardiovascular disease, prioritize oral health, smoking cessation, and control of traditional risk factors, recognizing that reducing oral bacterial burden may mitigate atherothrombotic risk even if the exact magnitude remains under study [^112wDTSh] [^116Z7G5t] [^113Ns7iL].

> In summary, viridans group streptococci are oral commensals that become significant pathogens in selected hosts, with endocarditis, neutropenic sepsis, and atherothrombotic disease as key syndromes. I should confirm species-level identification when it changes management, obtain susceptibilities given variable resistance, and tailor therapy to syndrome and MIC, while reinforcing prevention through oral care and judicious antibiotic use. If the user truly meant something other than "viridans", I need to clarify the exact term to provide a precise, reference-aligned answer [^116Z7G5t] [^111TanLh] [^1119VYqS].

Viridans streptococci are **commensal oral bacteria** that can cause significant infections in vulnerable hosts, most notably infective endocarditis [^116Z7G5t], bacteremia in neutropenic patients [^113K88hQ], and dental caries [^113JFyg9]. They are **alpha-hemolytic**, catalase-negative, and often misidentified by routine labs; MALDI-TOF MS improves speciation [^116QbBwz] [^113jSGnH]. Penicillin resistance is rising (13–50%) [^111TanLh], so therapy should be guided by MICs; for endocarditis, use penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4–6 weeks, adding gentamicin for 2 weeks if MIC > 0.12 mcg/mL [^1119VYqS] [^112kUifk]; vancomycin is an alternative for β-lactam allergy [^114LqVaW] [^113TdzSo]. Prevention hinges on **oral hygiene** [^116Z7G5t] and targeted prophylaxis only for high-risk cardiac patients undergoing dental procedures [^112wDTSh].

---

## Microbiological characteristics

- **Hemolysis**: Alpha-hemolytic (partial hemolysis) on blood agar.
- **Catalase**: Negative.
- **Identification**: Historically difficult; MALDI-TOF MS improves accuracy [^116QbBwz] [^113jSGnH].
- **Species**: Common species include S. mitis, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius, S. gordonii, and S. oralis [^115R9JSV].

## Clinical significance and pathogenicity

Viridans streptococci are **opportunistic pathogens** that cause disease when host defenses are compromised or when they gain access to normally sterile sites:

| **Clinical condition** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Infective endocarditis | Major cause of native valve endocarditis; adherence to damaged valves and biofilm formation drive pathogenesis [^116Z7G5t] [^115HSvwt] |
| Bacteremia in immunocompromised patients | Common in neutropenia, especially with mucositis; can cause sepsis and shock [^113K88hQ] [^113TBrNg] |
| Dental caries | S. mutans and S. sanguinis are key in biofilm and caries formation [^notfound] |
| Abscesses | Anginosus group (S. anginosus, S. constellatus, S. intermedius) cause deep abscesses [^113vZyp3] [^113PqR8Q] |

---

## Risk factors for infection

- **Cardiac conditions**: Congenital heart disease, prosthetic valves, prior endocarditis [^notfound].
- **Immunosuppression**: Neutropenia, malignancy, transplantation [^113K88hQ].
- **Dental procedures**: Transient bacteremia increases endocarditis risk [^116Z7G5t].
- **Poor oral hygiene**: Increases bacterial load and bacteremia risk [^116Z7G5t].

---

## Antibiotic resistance

Penicillin resistance is **increasing (13–50%)** [^111TanLh], with variable cross-resistance to cephalosporins and macrolides [^117LQsfr]; susceptibility testing is essential [^1119VYqS].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Culture**: Gold standard; slow growth requires prolonged incubation.
- **MALDI-TOF MS**: Rapid, accurate species identification [^116QbBwz] [^113jSGnH].
- **Molecular methods**: 16S rRNA sequencing for ambiguous cases [^116XDTXR].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the **clinical syndrome** and susceptibilities:

| **Clinical condition** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Infective endocarditis | Penicillin G or ceftriaxone for 4–6 weeks; add gentamicin for 2 weeks if MIC > 0.12 mcg/mL; vancomycin for β-lactam allergy [^1119VYqS] [^112kUifk] [^114LqVaW] |
| Bacteremia in neutropenia | Empiric vancomycin plus ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam; adjust to susceptibilities [^113TBrNg] |
| Dental infections | Penicillin or amoxicillin; clindamycin if allergic |

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **oral hygiene** to reduce bacterial load [^116Z7G5t] and on **targeted prophylaxis**. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only for high-risk cardiac patients undergoing invasive dental procedures [^112wDTSh].

---

Viridans streptococci are **oral commensals** that cause significant disease in at-risk hosts; management requires accurate identification, susceptibility-guided therapy, and prevention through oral care and selective prophylaxis.

### Prevention of viridans group streptococcal infective endocarditis: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112wDTSh]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2007, the American Heart Association published updated evidence-based guidelines on the recommended use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent viridans group streptococcal (VGS) infective endocarditis (IE) in cardiac patients undergoing invasive procedures. The 2007 guidelines significantly scaled back the underlying conditions for which antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended, leaving only 4 categories thought to confer the highest risk of adverse outcome. The purpose of this update is to examine interval evidence of the acceptance and impact of the 2007 recommendations on VGS IE and, if needed, to make revisions based on this evidence.

Methods and Results

A writing group was formed consisting of experts in prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis including members of the American Dental Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in addition to the American Heart Association. MEDLINE database searches were done for English language articles on compliance with the recommendations in the 2007 guidelines and the frequency of and morbidity or mortality from VGS IE after publication of the 2007 guidelines. Overall, there was good general awareness of the 2007 guidelines but variable compliance with recommendations. There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007.

Conclusions

On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis only for categories of patients at highest risk for adverse outcome while emphasizing the critical role of good oral health and regular access to dental care for all. Randomized controlled studies to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective against VGS IE are needed to further refine recommendations.

### Phylogenetic analysis of viridans group streptococci causing endocarditis [^116XDTXR]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Identification of viridans group streptococci (VGS) to the species level is difficult because VGS exchange genetic material. We performed multilocus DNA target sequencing to assess phylogenetic concordance of VGS for a well-defined clinical syndrome. The hierarchy of sequence data was often discordant, underscoring the importance of establishing biological relevance for finer phylogenetic distinctions.

### Infections with viridans group streptococci in children with cancer [^113K88hQ]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Infection with viridans group streptococci (VGS) causes morbidity and mortality in children with cancer. Incidence of these infections has increased over time. Neutropenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia and those receiving high-dose cytarabine or undergoing stem cell transplantation are at highest risk. One-third of infected patients develop a shock syndrome despite prompt antibiotic therapy. Host defense mechanisms contribute substantially to colonization and tissue damage, but the origin of the shock syndrome is not well understood. VGS infection may be accompanied by neurological complications, myocarditis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Routine systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis against VGS infection has not been proven effective. Current recommendations include appropriate antibiotic therapy and intensive supportive care.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^112X9QtV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Viridans streptococci are harmless commensals in the oral cavity, where they act as initial colonizers in the development of a dental biofilmknown as dental plaque. However, they have been found to be the major species of bacteria detected in blood following tooth extraction and other dental procedures, and are considered to be among the most common pathogenetic agents of infective endocarditis, which is a typical example of a chronic bacterial infection due to a bacterial biofilm.

The overriding question is the issue of causality — do the bacteria that can be found in atherosclerotic plaques have any causal role in the development of the plaques, or are they or their DNA present as a consequence of inflammation? Sensitive molecular probes may detect bacterial DNA engulfed by phagocytic cells also originating from a noncardiac site, such as the gingiva, skin, respiratory tract, or intestinal tract. Bacteria might attach as a biofilm onto the uneven surface of the plaques following transient bacteremia with no pathogenic significance. In a real infection, the pathogen invasion activates the innate immune system and there should be evidence of the presence of the agent in an atherosclerotic plaque but not in normal blood vessels. In an autopsy study, this idea may be carried further by studying whether the presence of bacteria in a coronary atheroma is linked with the rupture and thrombosis of the atheroma and with death due to an MI. In this setting, the absence of bacteria should associate with a normal artery or nonruptured atheroma and with a noncoronary cause of death.

### Streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients [^112r7NWe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The genetically diverse viridans group streptococci (VGS) are increasingly recognized as the cause of a variety of human diseases. We used a recently developed multilocus sequence analysis scheme to define the species of 118 unique VGS strains causing bacteremia in patients with cancer; Streptococcus mitis (68 patients) and S. oralis (22 patients) were the most frequently identified strains. Compared with patients infected with non– S. mitis strains, patients infected with S. mitis strains were more likely to have moderate or severe clinical disease (e.g. VGS shock syndrome). Combined with the sequence data, whole-genome analyses showed that S. mitis strains may more precisely be considered as > 2 species. Furthermore, we found that multiple S. mitis strains induced disease in neutropenic mice in a dose-dependent fashion. Our data define the prominent clinical effect of the group of organisms currently classified as S. mitis and lay the groundwork for increased understanding of this understudied pathogen.

Viridans streptococci are a major cause of infective endocarditis, and penicillin non-susceptibility is increasing in these organisms. We present the initial reported case of infective endocarditis due to penicillin non-susceptible viridans streptococci successfully treated with ceftriaxone monotherapy. The lack of evidence supporting the recommendations for treatment of endocarditis due to penicillin non-susceptible viridans streptococci is discussed.

### Viridans Streptococcus peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: clinical characteristics and comparison with concurrent polymicrobial infection [^114WtaaA]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Viridans streptococci refer to a group of Streptococcus species that are nutritionally fastidious and mainly alpha-hemolytic on sheep blood agar; these gram-positive cocci are commensals of the oral cavity, upper airway, and the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. The major portals of entry for VS are damaged epithelial barriers of a patient's mucosa.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis is a common complication in patients undergoing regular PD. Clinical courses of PD-related peritonitis vary from mild to severe forms, depending on the causative organisms and clinical conditions. The remarkable consequences of PD-related peritonitis are technique failure leading to PD catheter removal. Although gram-negative organisms have been increasingly detected in PD-related peritonitis in recent years, gram-positive organisms remain major pathogens for this infection entity. Gram-positive cocci constitute around 43–64% of all PD peritonitis episodes, and Streptococcal species account for about 10–15% of them. VS are the majority of Streptococcus species. The incidence of VS peritonitis in several reports from different regions was similar. The entry pathway of VS into the peritoneal cavity includes contamination during the exchange procedure, gastrointestinal bacterial translocation, haematological dissemination with oral and dental procedures and catheter related. Of note, among PD-related peritonitis cases caused by gram-positive cocci, those caused by viridans streptococcus (VS) were reported to have a lower risk of PD catheter removal and chances of relapsing episodes but a higher incidence of clinically refractory course.

Although mono-VS peritonitis in patients undergoing PD in general has a favorable outcome, little is known about the clinical outcomes of VS-included polymicrobial peritonitis (mixed-VS peritonitis) in this patient population. The aim of this retrospective study was to better understand the differences between mono-VS peritonitis and mixed-VS peritonitis in patients undergoing PD.

### Infections caused by viridans streptococci in patients with neutropenia [^113TBrNg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The frequency of isolation of viridans streptococci from the blood of neutropenic patients with cancer has significantly increased over the course of the last 10–15 years. Risk factors in this patient population include severe neutropenia, oral mucositis, administration of high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and antimicrobial prophylaxis with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone. In some patients with cancer and neutropenia who develop viridans streptococcal bacteremia, a toxic shock-like syndrome has been described; Streptococcus mitis has been the causative species in most cases. Because resistance of viridans streptococci to a variety of antimicrobial agents is increasingly recognized, penicillin susceptibility cannot be assumed, and empirical vancomycin therapy should be used to treat neutropenic patients with cancer who have shock or are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Given the seriousness of septicemia caused by viridans streptococci and the potential for selection of other resistant microorganisms, the routine practice of antimicrobial prophylaxis for neutropenic patients with cancer should be reconsidered.

### Rapid identification of viridans streptococci by mass spectrometric discrimination [^116QbBwz]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Viridans streptococci (VS) are responsible for several systemic diseases, such as endocarditis, abscesses, and septicemia. Unfortunately, species identification by conventional methods seems to be more difficult than species identification of other groups of bacteria. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) for the rapid identification of 10 different species of VS. A total of 99 VS clinical isolates, 10 reference strains, and 20 strains from our in-house culture collection were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. To evaluate the mass-spectrometric discrimination results, all strains were identified in parallel by phenotypic and genotypic methods. MALDI-TOF-MS identified 71 isolates as the mitis group, 23 as the anginosus group, and 5 as Streptococcus salivarius. Comparison of the species identification results obtained by the MALDI-TOF-MS analyses and with the phenotypic/genotypic identification systems showed 100% consistency at the species level. Thus, MALDI-TOF-MS seems to be a rapid and reliable method for the identification of species of VS from clinical samples.

### Viridans group streptococci: a reservoir of resistant bacteria in oral cavities [^115Y5ptV]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

The worldwide spread of erythromycin A-resistant streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, is of concern. Many studies have demonstrated that the viridans group streptococci can be a reservoir of erythromycin A resistance. Within oral streptoccoci, an important difference in the susceptibility pattern has been noted. The purpose of this short editorial is to highlight the importance of this group of bacteria as a reservoir of resistance to erythromycin A and the possible transfer of resistance to S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes.

### Make modern microbiology matter more in the 2023 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis [^1137vQjt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Both the 2023 Duke–International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases (ISCVID) criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) and the 2023 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of IE have recently been published. The 2023 ESC guidelines were published after the Duke–ISCVID criteria and could have included the updated diagnostic criteria presented in the Duke–ISCVID criteria. Instead, the ESC guidelines refer to the modified Duke criteria from 2000 with some minor changes. This has resulted in 2 diagnostic criteria for IE, which is unfortunate for researchers in the field and ultimately for patients.

Whereas the 2023 ESC guidelines stress that a multidisciplinary approach is needed to optimally manage patients with IE, the working group is hardly multidisciplinary and there is no microbiologist in the group. Thus, the guidelines, in terms of microbiological diagnostics, fail to elaborate on potentially important aspects of managing patients with IE. We believe that there is a need for more microbiological input in the future when new guidelines are written.

The 2023 ESC guidelines present diagnostic criteria for IE where some changes in the microbiological aspects were introduced. These include introduction of the term "oral streptococci" instead of "viridans streptococci" and " Streptococcus gallolyticus " instead of " Streptococcus bovis. " Both changes are problematic since some viridans streptococci, such as Streptococcus anginosus, are instead "intestinal streptococci", and S. gallolyticus is just one of several species in the bovis group. It is therefore unclear which streptococci should be regarded as typical IE pathogens according to the 2023 ESC diagnostic criteria. Table 1 summarizes some of the problematic features of the ESC 2023 guidelines together with a short proposal for possible actions that can be taken to address these concerns.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^113r36ir]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Using broad‐range 16‐S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by cloning and sequencing, we found in 2005 that coronary atheromas collected at autopsy contained DNA of viridans group streptococci, among other species of bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. Viridans group streptococcal DNA was also detected in most thrombus aspirates from patients with MI, in ruptured cerebral aneurysms, in thrombus aspirates from surgical patients with lower‐limb arterial and deep venous thrombosis, and in cerebral thrombi from patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy; in the last‐mentioned series, the presence of viridans streptococci was also confirmed by bacterial immunohistochemistry. The presence of DNA from viridans streptococci has also been confirmed by other studies. The recent approach of using 16S rRNA gene sequencing–based metagenomic studies has revealed that atherosclerotic plaques harbor DNA sequences from dozens or even hundreds of oral, intestinal, skin or environmental bacteria, suggesting the presence of a microbiome. However, these sequences are mostly present in tiny < 1% fractions, the majority of them most probably carried by single or small groups of phagocytes or being contaminants from PCR reagents and other laboratory equipment or environmental elements, with no clinical significance.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^113f8PkS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Most chronic infections are currently considered to be due to bacterial biofilms. The viridans streptococci group is characterized by its unique ability to attach onto various surfaces and initiate the development of a dental biofilm. In the form of a biofilm, bacteria are mainly beyond the reach of antibiotics given in therapeutic concentrations and evade the innate immune system by liberating extracellular polymeric substances that prevent the outer wall structures of the bacteria from being recognized. In contrast, during bacteremia following dental procedures, for example, or in connection with other infections, when the bacteria are in the "planktonic" state in the blood harboring a capsule, they can be eliminated by orally administered antibiotics.

In the ruptured coronary atheromas of fatal MI cases in our series, the viridans streptococcal antibody cocktail stained intensely discrete groups of bacteria‐like structures colocalizing with CD68‐positive macrophages not far from the biofilm. These bacteria were also detected in masses outside the macrophages and were observed to have invaded the fibrous caps of atheromas in the ruptured and thrombosed coronary atheromas of MI cases, as well as in the symptomatic carotid arteries of clinical endarterectomy patients. This finding is consistent with the knowledge of the life of bacterial biofilms, inside which the next generation of virulent phenotype bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) builds up and is dispersed due to some as yet poorly known triggering factors, such as respiratory viruses, norepinephrine, limited nutrition, a fatty acid messenger, or free iron. This might also offer an explanation for the increase in the risk of MI in association with influenza, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and other chest infections.

### Inhibition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns by viridans group streptococci [^115Tk7Vc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We investigated the role of viridans group streptococci in the prevention of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in neonatal intensive care units. During a 26-month period at a children's hospital, 207 (49.9%) of 415 newborns were colonized with MRSA by the time of discharge. Two groups of newborns with matching durations of hospitalization were compared with regard to the prevalence of future colonization with MRSA: group 1 (103 patients) did not acquire colonization with viridans group streptococci and group 2 (63 patients) did acquire colonization with viridans group streptococci at birth or by 1 to 2 weeks (age, ≤ 11 days). The rate of colonization among patients in group 2 (9.5%) was significantly lower than that among patients in group 1 (44.7%; P < .001). No significant difference in patient characteristics (e.g., birth weight, diseases) was observed. These results indicate that viridans group streptococci, as bacteria that formerly occupied the oral cavities in newborns, may inhibit later colonization with MRSA.

### Differentiation between Streptococcus pneumoniae and other viridans group streptococci by matrix-assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight mass spectrometry [^113jSGnH]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is becoming the method of choice for bacterial identification. However, correct identification by MALDI-TOF of closely related microorganisms such as viridans streptococci is still cumbersome, especially in the identification of S. pneumoniae. By making use of additional spectra peaks for S. pneumoniae and other viridans group streptococci (VGS). We re-identified viridans streptococci that had been identified and characterized by molecular and phenotypic techniques by MALDI-TOF.

Methods

VGS isolates (n = 579), 496 S. pneumoniae and 83 non-S. pneumoniae were analysed using MALDI-TOF MS and the sensitivity and specificity of MALDI-TOF MS was assessed. Hereafter, mass spectra analysis was performed. Presumptive identification of proteins represented by discriminatory peaks was performed by molecular weight matching and the corresponding nucleotides sequences against different protein databases.

Results

Using the Bruker reference library, 495 of 496 S. pneumoniae isolates were identified as S. pneumoniae and one isolate was identified as non-S. pneumoniae. Of the 83 non-S. pneumoniae isolates, 37 were correctly identified as non-S. pneumoniae, and 46 isolates as S. pneumoniae. The sensitivity of the MALDI-TOF MS was 99.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 98.9–100) and the specificity was 44.6% (95% CI 33.7–55.9). Eight spectra peaks were mostly present in one category (S. pneumoniae or other VGS) and absent in the other category and inversely. Two spectra peaks of these (m/z 3420 and 3436) were selected by logistic regression to generate three identification profiles. These profiles could differentiate between S. pneumoniae and other VGS with high sensitivity and specificity (99.4% and 98.8%, respectively).

Conclusions

Spectral peaks analysis based identification is a powerful tool to differentiate S. pneumoniae from other VGS species with high specificity and sensitivity and is a useful method for pneumococcal identification in carriage studies. More research is needed to further confirm our findings. Extrapolation of these results to clinical strains need to be deeply investigated.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — historical rationale and current emphasis — Viridans group streptococci are noted to cause at least 50 per cent of community-acquired native valve IE not associated with intravenous drug use, and early work reported bacteremia related to oral hygiene and dental extraction. Okell and Elliott in 1935 reported that 11 percent of patients with poor oral hygiene had positive blood cultures with viridans group streptococci, and that 61 percent of patients had viridans group streptococcal bacteremia with dental extraction. As a result of these early and subsequent studies, during the past 50 years the AHA guidelines recommended antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent IE in patients with underlying cardiac conditions who underwent bacteremia-producing procedures, yet most of these factors remain valid, but collectively they do not compensate for the lack of published data that demonstrate a benefit from prophylaxis. The large majority of published studies have focused on dental procedures as a cause of IE and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent IE in patients at risk, and few data exist on the risk of or prevention of IE associated with a GI or GU tract procedure; accordingly, the Committee undertook a critical analysis of published data in the context of the historical rationale for recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for IE before a dental procedure. Available evidence supports an emphasis on maintaining good oral hygiene and eradicating dental disease to decrease the frequency of bacteremia from routine daily activities.

### Streptococcal endocarditis: a meta-analysis of species dependant risk [^111ThswV]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Streptococcal bacteraemia is common and forms a large proportion of work for clinical infection specialists and microbiology labs. The major challenge–particularly with the 'oral' streptococci, is identifying the small proportion of patients who have deep infection, particularly infective endocarditis (IE). Investigation for IE often requires transthoracic and/or transoesophageal echocardiography amongst other investigations, therefore determining the risk of IE in any patient with streptococcal bacteraemia is a significant task. Currently, the updated 2023 ISCVID Duke criteria for endocarditis specifies that all streptococci (excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) be considered typical causative pathogens of IE.

Why some species of streptococci seem to cause endocarditis more than others given their genetic homology is an active area of research but likely relates to specific abilities to adhere to and survive on valvular tissue. Virulence factors that associate oral or viridans group streptococci with systemic disease point towards extracellular matrix proteins that bind to glucansand interactions with the host immune response to generate a favourable microenvironment. These phenomena are not known to be linked to predominant genotypes or lineages amongst those diagnosed with streptococcal IE. A seminal paper by Chamat-Hedemand et al. suggested that not all streptococci are equal with respect to the risk of IE. Their national data registry cross-linked endocarditis diagnosis, blood culture data, and demographic data to reveal the proportion of endocarditis per streptococcal species at an unprecedented resolution.

Nonetheless, it is possible that the absolute risks of IE in one setting do not transfer into another due to differing patient populations, different degrees of diagnostic stewardship and culture processing approaches to both species identification, or methods of IE diagnosis. Consequently, we aim to better quantify the risk of IE in all patients with streptococcal bacteraemia by pairing a scoping review of the literature with a meta-analysis across the various methodologies. We also include local data from our four hospital network.

### Oral streptococciandinduce distinct morphological, inflammatory, and metabolic signatures in macrophages [^11527V3d]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Microbes that are in constant interaction with the host engage in varied interactions spanning symbiosis, and the outcomes range from damage, benefit, or indifference. The delicate interaction between the body's resident microbiota and the immune system is vital for maintaining homeostatic balance. Disruption in this immune homeostasis due to dysbiosis can be elicited by various lifestyle factors like tobacco consumption, chronic alcohol exposure, inadequate oral hygiene, dietary changes, or antibiotic usage. While host damage is often a requirement for the induction of a pathogen-specific immune response, the extent and nature of the damage incurred during the early stages and/or subsequent phases between host and microbial interactions determine the outcome of the host-microbe relationship. The occurrence of damage isn't solely attributed to the presence and proliferation of pathogens; rather, it can also stem from the deficiency of commensal bacteria that typically inhibit the colonization of these pathogens.

Oral commensal streptococci or viridans group streptococci (VGS) are Gram-positive cocci that are catalase-negative facultative anaerobes. While most exhibit alpha hemolysis, variations exist, with some demonstrating beta hemolysis or displaying no hemolytic activity when cultured on blood agar. Streptococci are the first organisms to colonize oral surfaces, and most of them are typically deemed non-pathogenic due to their lack of virulence factors, like exotoxin production, and due to their non-invasive potential found in other pathogenic organisms. Being early colonizers of the oral cavity, Streptococcus species like Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius play a significant role in maintaining oral homeostasis by establishing a stable multispecies dental biofilm. Despite being traditionally considered non-pathogenic, they can also become opportunistic pathogens, evidenced by their involvement in a diverse range of clinical diseases, including infective endocarditis, bacteremia, and infections related to malignancy.

Streptococcus intermedius is a viridans Streptococcus belonging to the Anginosus group. In the past 7 years, it has been associated with abscesses in 48 children, 40% of whom had complicated and/or life-threatening illness. It was the sole pathogen in 35 cases. Seventy-five percent of the infections occurred in winter and spring. None occurred in infants younger than 1 year.

### Thrombus aspirates from patients with acute ischemic stroke are infiltrated by viridans streptococci [^116K8iRY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The decline in strokes during the 20th century can only incompletely be explained by conventional risk factors and their temporal trends. It has been long suspected that bacterial infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of stroke. Using a molecular microbiological approach, we have found that thrombus aspirates from patients with stroke contained viridans streptococcal DNA fragments. In the present study, we confirmed the presence of viridans streptococcal bacteria using immunohistochemistry. Almost all of the thrombus aspirates contained oral streptococci, located mainly inside neutrophilic granulocytes. In symptomatic patients subjected to carotid endarterectomy, most carotid samples were strongly immunopositive for viridans group streptococci. We also found clear streptococcal immunopositivity in 17% of carotid artery samples from autopsy cases representing a cross‐section of the population. To our knowledge, only 1 study has previously reported the presence of viridans group streptococci in carotid artery endarterectomies using immunolocalization, but the presence of viridans group streptococci in cerebral thrombi has not been previously shown. Our results suggest that there may be a connection between symptomatic inflammation in carotid arteries and cerebral thrombus.

The present concept is that atherosclerosis is a complex chronic inflammatory disorder in the arterial intima, driven by oxidized or otherwise modified low‐density lipoprotein. Increasing knowledge suggests that the atherosclerotic process may also be accelerated by a bacterial infection, with infections of oral origin being extensively studied. Both oxidized low‐density lipoprotein and bacteria activate Toll‐like receptor–mediated pathways, leading to the elevation of cytokine levels and systemic inflammation, which are related to the initiation, development, and rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. The immune responses that have evolved to combat bacterial infections are thus shared with those involved in the immune response to the inflammatory components of atherogenesis. Oral infections have also been suggested to contribute to carotid artery intima‐media thickness, leading to carotid artery stenosis and subclinical atherosclerosis, and, after adjusting for conventional risk factors, a significant association has been reported between the level of tooth loss (as a marker of past periodontal disease) and the prevalence of carotid artery plaques.

### Viridans Streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem [^115n6E2H]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

The authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. They retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between October 1995 and January 1999. Viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. The majority of the isolates were Streptococcus mitis (55%). Others were S. sanguis (25%), S. oralis (12.5%), S. salivarius (5%), and S. acidominimus (2.5%). Twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. Thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest X-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. Initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. This study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. Further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

### Secretory IgA, salivary peroxidase, and catalase-mediated microbicidal activity during hydrogen peroxide catabolism in viridans streptococci: pathogen coaggregation [^117LvpZd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Viridans streptococci can kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) through the production of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). However, several hundred viridans streptococci cells are necessary to kill 1 cfu of MRSA. We analyzed the potency of bactericidal and fungicidal effector molecules induced by catabolism of H2O2 in the oral cavity. Secretory IgA (SIgA) and an unidentified salivary component bound Streptococcus sanguinis, a viridans streprococcus, and MRSA into coaggregates. In these coaggregates, salivary peroxidase and the MRSA catalase produced singlet molecular oxygen (¹O₂) from H₂O₂ produced by viridans streptococci. SIgA converted ¹O₂ into ozone, which has potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity. We calculated that < 10 cfu of Streptococcus sanguinis were necessary to kill 1 cfu of MRSA in the coaggregate. SIgA, Aspergillus niger catalase, and H₂O₂ in saliva killed Candida albicans, which is highly resistant to reagent H₂O₂. Together with indigenous bacteria and innate immunity, SIgA potentially constitutes a novel system that may sustain oral homeostasis.

### Native valve endocarditis due to Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus oralis [^115C9NMF]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Viridans streptococci are the commonest cause of native valve infective endocarditis (IE). The taxonomy of this group is evolving allowing new disease associations to be made. Streptococcus vestibularis is a recently described member of the viridans group, first isolated from the vestibular mucosa of the human oral cavity. It has rarely been associated with human disease. Streptococcus oralis, another member of the viridans group resident in the human oral cavity is a well known cause of IE and bacteraemia in neutropenic patients. We report the first case of native mitral valve endocarditis due to S. vestibularis in a patient with co-existing S. oralis endocarditis.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^116hTk4K]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial DNA from the oral cavity, respiratory tract, gut, and skin has been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting a role in chronic inflammation linked to atherosclerosis. Chronic bacterial infections often form biofilms resistant to antibiotics and immune detection, giving rise to a new generation of virulent bacteria in suitable conditions. This study explores the role of the immune system in bacterial‐induced inflammation of atherosclerotic plaques.

Methods

Coronary plaques from 121 sudden death victims and endarterectomy samples from 96 surgical patients were analyzed using bacterial real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and genome‐wide expression analysis. TLR (toll‐like receptor) signaling was examined in bacterial‐activated TLR cell lines.

Results

Of the bacteria detected, oral viridans group streptococcal DNA was the most common, being found in 42.1% of coronary plaques and 42.9% of endarterectomies. Immunopositivity for viridans streptococci correlated with severe atherosclerosis (P < 0.0001) in both series and death from coronary heart disease (P = 0.021) or myocardial infarction (P = 0.042). Viridans streptococci colonized the core of the atheroma as a biofilm unrecognized by macrophages of the innate immune system. In contrast, immunopositive streptococci that appeared to have originated from the biofilm infiltrated the ruptured fibrous cap of the atheroma in endarterectomy samples and coronary plaques and were detected by pattern‐recognizing receptors and coexpressed with the adaptive immune response. Among the viridans streptococcal strains, TLR2 was the most activated bacterial‐signaling pathway. Genome‐wide expression analysis of endarterectomy samples showed upregulation of bacterial recognition pathways.

Conclusions

Latent chronic bacterial inflammation evades immune detection and may contribute to the pathogenesis of complicated atherosclerotic plaques and fatal myocardial infarction.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Viridans group streptococci — antimicrobial resistance patterns and implications for IE prophylaxis report resistance to penicillin ranging from 17 to 50 percent and resistance to ceftriaxone from 22 to 42 percent; ceftriaxone was two to four times more active in vitro than was cefazolin. Resistance to macrolides ranged from 22 to 58 percent, and resistance to clindamycin ranged from 13 to 27 percent. In patients without cancer, 32 percent of strains were resistant to penicillin, and erythromycin resistance was 41 percent in otherwise healthy patients; after treatment with either azithromycin or clindamycin, the percentage of resistant streptococci increased to 82 percent and 71 percent, respectively. The impact of viridans group streptococcal resistance on antibiotic prevention of IE is unknown, it is impractical to recommend prophylaxis with only vancomycin or a fluoroquinolone, and there is no evidence that such therapy is effective for prophylaxis of IE.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^1159ftMW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Viridans Streptococcal Immunopositivity and Activity of the Innate and Adaptive Immune System

Next, we studied whether the bacteria‐recognizing receptors of the TLR signaling pathway were coexpressed with streptococci immunopositivity. Immunohistochemical staining of ruptured coronary atheromas (Figure 4B through 4V) showed a strong expression of streptococcal immunopositivity in connection with positive staining by antibodies against macrophage marker CD68, cell surface transmembrane TLR pathway signaling proteins TLR2, CD14, and TLR4, as well as ubiquitous transcription factor NF‐kB — all at the same rupture site. TLR2 expression was seen clearly, but CD14 and TLR4 (not shown in the Figure 4) were only barely positive, although CD14 is also a coreceptor for TLR2. Control staining with preimmune serum was negative. This suggests that streptococcal infiltration of the rupture site had activated a downstream signaling pathway required for the induction of inflammatory cytokines.

The entry of viridans group streptococci into coronary plaque may occur through neovessels (Figure 5A through 5C), that are formed due to the development of hypoxia inside the growing atheroma.

There were also immunopositive infiltrates at the border of the atheroma. The coronary sections were stained with viridans streptococcal antibody cocktail. More contrast was achieved by using the color (red) convolution option of the ImageJ software. Ab indicates antibody; and VStrep, viridans streptococcus.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^113L3b82]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Preimmune serum did not stain streptococcal biofilms (see Figures 2 and 4) but did stain free and phagocytized bacteria that were probably dispersed from the biofilm of a ruptured atheroma (see Figure 5). Flow cytometric analysis of the pooled viridans streptococcal antibody (Data S1 and Figure S1) showed that preimmune serum detected Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii, but not Streptococcus sanguinis. Nonimmune binding of immunoglobulins to bacteria via the capsular Fc fragment is involved in the opsonization and phagocytosis of bacteria. Most species of streptococci have been found to possess IgG Fc‐receptor binding activity. In a biofilm, bacteria have a reduced capsule due to downregulated capsular polysaccharide production, probably explaining the negative staining of the biofilm by preimmune serum.

The key histopathological findings associated with regions of rupture of the fibrous cap of the coronary plaque include a thin fibrous cap, increased signs of inflammatory activity and heightened amounts of proteases that digest fibrous components of the cap. In our study, virulent streptococci, that most probably have been released (dispersed) from the biofilm, were detected by TLRs of phagocytic macrophages initiating an immune response via the MyD88 dependent pattern recognition pathway. The activation of MyD88 dependent pathway leads to the production of cytokines including IL‐6 and TNF, which in turn induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinasesthat degrade collagen causing weakening and rupture of the fibrous cap of the atheroma. This was most probably seen in 1 of our cases, where macrophages loaded with immunopositive viridans streptococci were seen to infiltrate the thin ruptured fibrous cap of a victim who died of fatal MI.

### Thrombus aspirates from patients with acute ischemic stroke are infiltrated by viridans streptococci [^111KGHWD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral bacteria can enter the bloodstream after dental procedures (eg, root canal treatment or tooth extraction) causing transient bacteremia. In tooth extraction, most bacteria translocated into the circulation have been found to be viridans streptococci. Koren et al found that the abundance of viridans streptococcal DNA in atherosclerotic plaques correlated with their abundance in the oral cavity. After accessing systemic circulation, bacteria might end up in an atherosclerotic lesion via a circulating macrophage or directly through neovasculature developing inside the carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Viridans streptococci can directly interact with platelets, causing their activation. Activated platelets (ie, platelet‐derived growth factor) induce the recruitment of proatherosclerotic cells, which speeds up the atherosclerotic processes. Following bacteremia, bacteria‐induced thrombi might thus also be trapped in the left atrial appendage, causing a cardioembolic stroke in patients with altered hemodynamics, such as in atrial fibrillation. In our BMG series, 63.9% of the patients had atrial fibrillation. However, despite that, 62% of the cases were considered to be due to atherosclerosis, suggesting uncertainty in determining the cause.

Oral bacteria are known to form biofilms on hard tooth surfaces but also on soft epithelial tissue. Viridans streptococci are the initial colonizers in the development of a dental plaque. It has been suggested that bacteria form biofilm‐like structures in the atherosclerotic plaque. This could contribute to the persistent inflammation associated with atherosclerosis. Biofilm‐phenotype bacteria are much more resistant to antibiotics than the same bacteria in planktonic form.

To validate the specificity of the immunohistochemical stainings, we used several controls. The rabbit IgG isotype control is a primary antibody that lacks specificity to the target. Isotype controls are used as negative controls to differentiate a nonspecific background signal from a specific antibody signal. An E coli –specific antibody was used to show the specificity of the viridans streptococci antibody cocktail. All IgG isotype control–stained samples as well as the E coli immunostainings were negative.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^115HgmMD]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial treatment perspectives in infective endocarditis (IE) note that initial therapy is empirical and is revised once a pathogen and susceptibilities are defined, and infectious diseases consultation should occur at empirical therapy initiation. It is reasonable for the counting of days for the duration of therapy to begin on the first day on which blood cultures are negative, and it is reasonable to obtain 2 sets of blood cultures every 24 to 48 hours until clearance. After valve surgery, an entire course of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable if resected valve tissue is culture positive or a perivalvular abscess is found, whereas if tissue is culture negative, it may be reasonable for the duration of postoperative treatment given less the number of days of treatment administered for native valve infection before valve replacement. Retrospective data from 2 medical centers suggest that 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy may be sufficient after surgery when valve tissue cultures are negative, particularly in IE caused by viridans group streptococci or Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis); whether 2 weeks is sufficient with positive valve cultures was not addressed in one survey and included only 5 patients in another, and histopathological Gram staining with negative cultures is not a factor in defining length of therapy after surgery.

### H₂O₂ produced by viridans group streptococci may contribute to inhibition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of oral cavities in newborns [^1175Y5zd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

In an accompanying report, we showed that viridans group streptococci may prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization of the oral cavities of newborns. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of prevention in vitro. Most viridans group streptococci had bacteriocin-like activity and killed MRSA, Burkholderia cepacia, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans were resistant. The activity was induced only by H₂O₂-secreting strains and was inhibited by horseradish peroxidase or catalase in a dose-dependent manner. The mean concentration of H₂O₂ produced by 18 strains of viridans group streptococci (1 × 10⁸ cfu in 200 μL of culture medium ± standard deviation was 1.24 ± 0.60 mmol. Viridans group streptococci inhibited MRSA growth in saliva as well as in culture media. These results indicate that H₂O₂ produced by viridans group streptococci may inhibit MRSA colonization of oral cavities in newborns.

### Dental health and viridans streptococcal bacteremia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^115rxB6p]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Viridans streptococci were the most common cause of bacteremia in 61 consecutive myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, occurring in 19 of 31 bacteremic patients (61%) during the period of post-transplant neutropenia. Seven of the 19 had more than one viridans streptococcus in the same blood culture. Twenty isolates from 15 patients were Streptococcus mitis. Most viridans streptococci were resistant to norfloxacin, used routinely for prophylaxis. Comparison of the 19 patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia with a contemporaneous group of 23 allogeneic HSCT recipients with fever and neutropenia but no identified focus of infection found that patients with viridans streptococcal bacteremia were more likely to have severe intraoral pathology while neutropenic (26% vs 0%) and slightly shorter interval between the last dental procedure and the onset of neutropenia (11 vs 14 days). Poor underlying dental health and the use of norfloxacin thus appear to predispose to viridans streptococcal bacteremia.

### Thrombus aspirates from patients with acute ischemic stroke are infiltrated by viridans streptococci [^111Kjzuw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute ischemic stroke may be due to embolism from ruptured atherosclerotic carotid arteries. DNA of oral bacteria, mainly the viridans streptococci group, has been detected in thrombus aspirates of patients with ischemic stroke as well as in carotid endarterectomy samples. Because viridans streptococci are known to possess thrombogenic properties, we studied whether their presence in thrombus aspirates and in carotid artery specimens can be confirmed using bacterial immunohistochemistry.

Methods and Results

Thrombus aspirates from 61 patients with ischemic stroke (70.5% men; mean age, 66.8years) treated with mechanical thrombectomy, as well as carotid endarterectomy samples from 20 symptomatic patients (65.0% men; mean age, 66.2years) and 48 carotid artery samples from nonstroke autopsy cases (62.5% men; mean age, 66.4years), were immunostained with an antibody cocktail against 3 species (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus gordonii) of viridans streptococci. Of the thrombus aspirates, 84.8% were immunopositive for viridans streptococci group bacteria, as were 80.0% of the carotid endarterectomy samples, whereas immunopositivity was observed in 31.3% of the carotid artery samples from nonstroke autopsies. Most streptococci were detected inside neutrophil granulocytes, but there were also remnants of bacterial biofilm as well as free bacterial infiltrates in some samples.

Conclusions

Oral streptococci were found in aspirated thrombi of patients with acute ischemic stroke as well as in carotid artery samples. Our results suggest that viridans streptococci group bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.

### Viridans streptococcal biofilm evades immune detection and contributes to inflammation and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [^111eTvEN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The role of inflammation in mediating the risk in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has been confirmed by the CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti‐Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) trial, demonstrating for the first time that anti‐inflammatory therapy with a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL‐1β (interleukin‐1β) innate immunity pathway lowered the rate of recurrent cardiovascular events independently of lipid levels. This suggests that the prevention of inflammation may be as important as reducing plasma levels of cholesterol.

In the present study, we found that the atherosclerotic coronary atheromas of sudden cardiac death victims and atherosclerotic endarterectomy specimens from patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease harbor DNA from several oral bacteria, suggesting the presence of a microbiome. In normal arteries, bacterial DNA findings were less common. The most common DNA belonged to viridans streptococci — a group of oral bacteria commonly associated with endocarditis and sepsis. Bacterial DNA profiles were similar between autopsy coronary plaques and carotid and peripheral arterial samples obtained under sterile surgical conditions. We confirmed this DNA finding by means of immunohistochemistry, using a pooled in‐house antibody raised against the 3 most common viridans streptococcal species detected in atheromatous plaques. The occurrence of viridans streptococcal DNA in coronary plaques correlated with the streptococcal immunopositivity of the same samples, suggesting that this is not a matter of cross‐reactivity with oxLDL epitopes, although they also may play a role in the initial phase. The most unique finding in our study was that viridans streptococci seemed to colonize the lipid core and wall of an atheroma as a biofilm and that this biofilm was not recognized by cells of the innate immune system. Phenotypically virulent, strongly immunopositive streptococci that were dispersed from the biofilm were seen infiltrating the fibrous cap of the ruptured or symptomatic atheromas. These virulent streptococci were detected by macrophages co‐localizing with molecules of the pathogen‐recognizing TLR‐dependent signaling pathway and with lymphocytes expressing a T‐cell receptor complex, indicating the activation of adaptive immunity. GWE analysis of atherosclerotic plaques from endarterectomy patients showed that genes in the TLR‐dependent pathways for recognizing and killing bacteria were upregulated. Viridans streptococcal immunopositivity correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis in the clinical and autopsy series, and, in the autopsy series, with death due to CHD or MI. This evidence suggests that viridans streptococci are not innocent bystanders in the plaque.

### Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of macrolide, lacosamide, and streptogramin resistance in clinically resistant streptococci and their correlation with reduced biocide susceptibility [^113JFyg9]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Streptococcus genus comprises diverse Gram-positive cocci bacteria with notable medical importance. These bacteria are capable of inducing a spectrum of diseases, ranging from subacute to acute or chronic. Some notable human ailments attributed to Streptococci include rheumatic heart disease, scarlet fever, pneumococcal pneumonia, and glomerulonephritis. Streptococci are classified based on the hemolytic pattern exhibited on blood agar plates, which categorizes them into alpha-hemolytic, beta-hemolytic, and gamma-hemolytic groups. Another classification criterion is based on Lancefield grouping, which involves the identification of specific polysaccharide antigens in the bacterial cell wall.

Among the most clinically important Streptococci spp. S. pyogenes is commonly referred to as Group A streptococci (GAS). S. pyogenes can be classified into over 100 M-serotypes or emm types, determined by their M proteins present on the cell surface. These proteins contribute to their virulence by impeding phagocytosis. S. pyogenes represents a significant source of infections among children in both outpatient and hospital environments. They are known to cause various conditions such as pharyngitis, impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas, and cellulitis, along with severe invasive diseases like necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Another medically important β-hemolytic streptococci, S. agalactiae (group B) causes a wide range of invasive diseases among both infants and adults. In adults, bacteremia is one of the most common syndromes resulting from invasive S. agalactiae that can lead to seeding of the cardiac valves and endocarditis.

S. pneumoniae is an extracellular, opportunistic α-hemolytic streptococcal spp. that colonizes the upper respiratory tract mucosal surfaces. S. pneumoniae is present in the nasopharynx, as between 27 and 65% of children and fewer than 10% of adults are S. pneumoniae carriers. S. pneumoniae dissemination to the bloodstream and lower respiratory tract could lead to invasive inflammatory diseases including otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Viridans streptococci represent another group of clinically significant Streptococci spp. Among the prominent members of the viridans streptococci, which are typically commensal, S. sanguis and S. mutans cause dental caries, S. mitis is associated with meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and periodontal disease, and S. milleri is associated with purulent infections in both children and adults.

### Streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients [^116VYBFB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Identification of S. mitis Strain Clusters

Most cases of bacteremia and severe disease occurred in patients infected with S. mitis; thus, we focused on S. mitis strains and strains from the closely related S. oralis species. In contrast to what we observed for the S. oralis strains, several distinct groupings could be visualized within the S. mitis strains, which we arbitrarily labeled as clusters 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 3, panel A). S. mitis cluster 1 comprised 10 strains, including 2 that were genetically identical by MLSA, and cluster 2 comprised 22 strains, including 6 that were genetically identical. Cluster 3 comprised 29 strains and may contain additional strain groupings, but further phylogenetic delineation of this cluster could not be done with sufficient confidence. We did not observe substantial differences, in terms of distinct disease types or severity of infection, between patients from whom the S. mitis cluster strains were derived (Technical Appendix 2). However, there was a predominance of unexplained pulmonary infiltrate cases among patients infected with cluster 2 strains (p < 0.01 for cluster 2 strains vs. noncluster 2 strains) (Figure 3, panel B). This variable was investigated because, given the close genetic relationship between S. mitis and S. pneumoniae, we hypothesize that S. mitis strains may cause pneumonia in severely immunocompromised persons (Figure 1).

RESULTS

Presence of Bacterialin Atherosclerotic Plaques

Bacterial DNA was detected by RT‐qPCR in 65.7% of the coronary plaque samples from the TSDS autopsy series and in 57.9% of the available surgical samples from the TVS series, using universal bacterial primers and probes.

Bacterial DNA profiles were similar in both series (Figure 1A). The most common bacterial DNA detected in both series belonged to oral viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus spp. mainly Streptococcus mitis group), which were found in 42.1% of the autopsy‐obtained coronary plaques and in 42.9% of the surgical samples. Streptococcal DNA positivity was detected in 35.0% of the proximal RCA samples with AHA type I or II (early atherosclerosis), in 52.6% in samples with AHA type III or IV (mild to moderate atherosclerosis), in 42.1% in samples with AHA type V (fibroatheromas or partially calcified plaques), and in 60% in samples with AHA type VI (plaque rupture and thrombosis/hemorrhage), showing a nonsignificant trend (P = 0.246). DNA from other oral bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia) was also found in similar frequencies in both series. Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA was detected in 3.8% of the TSDS samples and in 10.5% of the clinical TVS samples.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^1158YPii]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) — the duration of therapy must be sufficient to ensure complete eradication of microorganisms within vegetations, with prolonged therapy necessary due to high bacterial densities and relatively slow bactericidal activity of β-lactams and vancomycin; when activity is faster or bacterial burden lower, shorter courses may be used in unique instances; combination therapy with penicillin or ceftriaxone and an aminoglycoside for 2 weeks is highly effective in viridans group streptococci IE in very select patients with uncomplicated infection; both β-lactam monotherapy and nafcillin plus an aminoglycoside for only 2 weeks have been effective in uncomplicated right-sided IE caused by S aureus, and monotherapy with a β-lactam would be selected for uncomplicated IE.

### Streptococcus mitis strains causing severe clinical disease in cancer patients [^112YFktE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

VGS Species and Clinical Syndromes

Because of the diverse genetic nature of the various VGS species, we next tested the hypothesis that distinct VGS species cause different clinical syndromes. Given the number of strains for each species, we analyzed the Mitis group species (i.e. S. mitis and S. oralis) individually and analyzed species comprising the Sanguinis, Anginosus, and Salivarius groups by group (Table 2). Compared with strains of other VGS species, S. mitis strains were significantly more likely to cause primary bacteremia (p < 0.01) and less likely to cause polymicrobial bacteremia (p = 0.01) and clinically minor bacteremia (p < 0.01). S. oralis strains were more likely to cause polymicrobial infection (p = 0.02), Sanguinis group strains were more likely to cause clinically minor bacteremia (p < 0.01), and Anginosus group strains were significantly associated with bacteremia with a gastrointestinal focus (p < 0.01). When we only considered patients with neutropenia or cases of monomicrobial bacteremia, we observed the same statistically significant species–clinical disease relationships (data not shown).

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis of infective endocarditis — Infective endocarditis (IE) is the net result of interaction between the bloodstream pathogen, matrix molecules, and platelets at sites of endocardial damage, and the following sequence is thought to result in IE: formation of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), bacteremia, adherence of bacteria in the bloodstream to NBTE, and proliferation within a vegetation. Turbulent blood flow from congenital or acquired heart disease traumatizes endothelium, creating a predisposition for deposition of platelets and fibrin that results in NBTE. Mucosal surfaces populated by dense endogenous microflora can release many different microbial species transiently into the bloodstream after trauma to sites such as the gingival crevice, oropharynx, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, urethra, or vagina; transient bacteremia caused by viridans group streptococci and other oral microflora occurs commonly with dental extractions, other dental procedures, or routine daily activities, and the microbial species entering the circulation depends on the endogenous microflora at the traumatized site. Modes of bacterial adherence serve as virulence factors in the pathogenesis of IE, with bacterial surface components in streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci functioning as critical adhesins; some viridans group streptococci contain a fimbrial adhesion protein (FimA), a lipoprotein receptor antigen I that serves as a major adhesin to the fibrin platelet matrix of NBTE. Staphylococcal adhesins function in at least two ways: microbial surface components facilitate attachment to human extracellular matrix proteins and to medical devices that become coated with matrix proteins after implantation, and bacterial extracellular structures contribute to the formation of biofilm on the surface of implanted medical devices. Both FimA and staphylococcal adhesins are immunogenic in experimental infections, and vaccines prepared against them provide some protective effect in experimental endocarditis. Within vegetations, buried microorganisms can multiply to reach maximal microbial densities of 10⁸ to 10¹¹ colony-forming units (CFUs) per gram of vegetation on the left side of the heart.

### Post-traumatic endophthalmitis caused by Streptococcus species in preschool children: clinical features, antibiotic susceptibilities and outcomes [^1146TyCg]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

The most common isolates were varied in streptococcal endophthalmitis studies, where most participants were adults. Yospaiboon found that S. pneumoniae was dominant in 45 cases, while Kuriyan reported that viridans group streptococci were dominant in 63 cases. Our study found that S. pneumoniae was more prevalent than viridans group streptococci in paediatric post-traumatic endophthalmitis (47.6% vs. 42.9%, respectively). We also found that the main isolates differed between the two age groups. Viridans group streptococci were the main isolates of post-traumatic streptococcal endophthalmitis in children aged 0–3 years, while S. pneumoniae was dominant in children aged 4–6 years. Viridans group streptococci are a heterogeneous group of organisms that can be human commensals, colonising the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts in addition to the oral mucosa. Younger children, aged 0–3 years, were more likely to bite and scratch objects while playing, leading to viridans group streptococci infection through the mouth-object-eye route, which could explain the higher proportion of viridans group streptococci infection in this age group.

### Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of Streptococcus suis infection in humans [^116pJuBs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Microbiological Diagnosis

Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid culture were the most common reported diagnostic methods among the case reports (Technical Appendix Table 4). Molecular diagnosis was more common in the large studies (11 studies) than in case reports. The most prevalent strain was serotype 2 (86.5%), followed by serotype 14 (2.3%), and serotype 1 (0.6%) of all 1,156 patients with serotype information mentioned in the articles. Serotypes 4, 5, 16, and 24 also were reported (1 patient per serotype).

Misdiagnosis of S. suis infection was not uncommon, either by conventional biochemical tests or commercial identification systems. The bacteria were often reported as viridans streptococci in initial cultures. In fact, up to 70% of all viridans streptococci cases in Thailand were confirmed as S. suis infections in the follow-up investigations. A total of 62.5% of S. suis –infected patients in another study in Thailand and 20% in a study inthe Netherlands were initially reported to be infected with viridans streptococci. Misidentification of the infectious agent as S. bovis (2 patients), S. pneumoniae (1 patient), and S. faecalis (1 patient) also was reported in the Netherlands series. Tsai et al. showed large variations between the 2 commercial systems (Phoenix Identification System, Beckon Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA; and Vitek II GPI Card, bioMérieux Vitek, Hazelwood, MO, USA), and misidentification of S. suis as S. acidominimus was common when the Phoenix system was used.

### Oral microflora and selection of resistance after a single dose of amoxicillin [^1145nt1X]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the effects of a single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis on normal oral microflora. A single dose of 2 g amoxicillin was given to 29 healthy volunteers. Saliva was collected before antibiotic administration (day 1), and again on days 2, 5, 10, 17 and 24 and subjected to culturing and antibiotic sensitivity analysis. Twenty-one per cent (6/29) of the individuals carried penicillin-V- and amoxicillin-resistant viridans streptococci before antibiotic administration. After a single dose of amoxicillin there was a significant reduction in Streptococcus salivarius on days 2 and 5, a significant reduction in other viridans streptococci on day 2 and the proportion of viridans streptococci with reduced susceptibility to amoxicillin was significantly increased on days 2 and 5. A single dose of amoxicillin can cause an ecological disturbance and induce selection of resistant strains in the oral microflora.

### Interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and Streptococcus milleri group bacteria [^113vZyp3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Because Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) bacteria — Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus anginosus — exhibit a striking propensity to cause abscesses, the interaction of these organisms with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) was examined. After incubation in pooled normal human serum, SMG stimulated less chemotaxis than did Staphylococcus aureus, in contrast to viridans streptococci, which caused greater chemotaxis than did S. aureus. PMNL ingested greater numbers of SMG and viridans streptococci than S. aureus but killed these organisms more slowly and less completely. Relative resistance to killing by PMNL is expected in organisms that cause abscesses, and inhibition of chemotaxis may contribute to pathogenicity, because delayed arrival of PMNL gives a head start to proliferating bacteria. This study helps explain the capacity of SMG to cause abscesses. It is unclear, however, why viridans streptococci, bacteria that rarely produce abscesses, share some of these same properties.

### Fatal case of streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Streptococcus mitis in patient with tetralogy Fallot disorder: a case report [^115obuq9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is an uncommon and potentially fatal complication involving replaced heart valves. PVE accounts for 10–30% of all cases of infective endocarditis, which is more likely to occur in the first 3 months after valve surgery. PVE may occur in 1–9% of patients. Despite significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of PVE, the mortality rate is significant and varies from 20 to 80% among affected patients. According to reports, 36.5% of PVE cases are associated with nosocomial infections. It seems that the main causes of mortality in patients are persistent bacteremia, heart failure and, intracardiac abscess.

The main cause of PVE is staphylococci, and streptococci and enterococci are less involved in its occurrence. Streptococcus viridans are responsible for 10–13% of PVE cases. Streptococcus is an anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacterium of which more than 100 species have been identified so far. Although most of the identified species of this pathogen are known as normal flora and are often found in the skin, throat, and upper respiratory tract, they are known as one of the most aggressive bacteria. Among the known species of this genus, 35 species are associated with the occurrence of infection in humans. S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. mutans can be mentioned among the known species of infection in humans. Among the species that cause endocarditis, of streptococcus viridans, which are the main flora of the mouth, are responsible for 76% of cases of streptococcal endocarditis, and S. mitis is the most common species.

The studies conducted in Iran on infective endocarditis caused by streptococci are very limited. During studies in Iran to identify potential pathogens that cause endocarditis in people using culture methods, S. viridans caused endocarditis in 11.8 and 6% of patients, respectively. The purpose of this study is case report of PVE caused by S. mitis infection, which was identified using molecular methods.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^111jMLmB]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Subacute mastitis — subacute mastitis occurs when ductal lumens become narrowed by bacterial biofilms in chronic mammary dysbiosis, and dysbiosis is defined as changes in the quantitative and qualitative composition of a host microbiome that contribute to inflammatory disease both acutely and chronically. Under physiological conditions, coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and viridans Streptococci (i.e. S. mitis and S. salivarius) form thin biofilms that line the epithelium of the mammary ducts allowing a normal milk flow, but in dysbiosis these species can form thick biofilms inside the ducts, inflaming the epithelium and forcing milk to pass through an increasingly narrower lumen. Because CoNS and viridans Streptococci do not produce toxins responsible for acute bacterial mastitis, systemic symptoms are uncommon and local breast symptoms are milder than in acute mastitis. Patients may report a history of previously treated acute bacterial mastitis; other risk factors include Cesarean birth, exclusive pumping, nipple shield use, and other circumstances that alter the milk microbiome. Patients may have recurring body aches, breast pain, nipple blebs, recurrent areas of induration or congestion, and may have unresolved hyperlactation, and sterile milk culture and sensitivities can be performed as noted.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis — epidemiological clues for culture-negative endocarditis identify likely pathogens by exposure or host factor. Injection drug use (IDU) is linked to S aureus (including community-acquired oxacillin-resistant strains), Coagulase-negative staphylococci, β-Hemolytic streptococci, Fungi, Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and polymicrobial infection. Indwelling cardiovascular medical devices are associated with S aureus, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Fungi, and Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Genitourinary disorders, infection, and manipulation (including pregnancy, delivery, and abortion) are associated with Corynebacterium sp, Enterococcus sp, Group B streptococci (S agalactiae), Listeria monocytogenes, Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Poor dental health or dental procedures point to VGS, nutritionally variant streptococci, Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella sp, and Gemella sp. Alcoholism or cirrhosis is associated with HACEK organisms, Bartonella sp, Aeromonas sp, Listeria sp, and S pneumoniae. Early (< 1 y) prosthetic valve placement is associated with Coagulase-negative staphylococci, S aureus, Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Fungi, Corynebacterium sp, and Legionella sp, whereas late (> 1 y) prosthetic valve placement is associated with Coagulase-negative staphylococci, S aureus, Viridans group streptococci, Enterococcus species, Fungi, and Corynebacterium sp. Animal exposures and gastrointestinal findings also guide etiology: Dog or cat exposure suggests Bartonella sp, Pasteurella sp, or Capnocytophaga sp; contact with contaminated milk or infected farm animals suggests Brucella sp or Coxiella burnetii; AIDS is associated with Salmonella sp, S pneumoniae, and S aureus; gastrointestinal lesions are associated with S gallolyticus (bovis), Enterococcus sp, and Clostridium septicum. HACEK indicates Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species, and VGS denotes viridans group streptococci.

VGS Species and Bacteremia

To gain insight into the species of VGS causing bacteremia in the study cohort, we performed MLSA of 7 housekeeping genes, as described. Strains were assigned to species by comparing their position on the phylogenetic tree with those of established type strains. The 118 strains could be confidently assigned to 11 distinct species (Figure 1; Technical Appendix 1). The most commonly observed species were S. mitis (68 strains), S. oralis (22 strains), and S. parasanguinis (12 strains). For classification purposes, various VGS species are often placed into distinct groups; the association between VGS strains causing bacteremia and group assignment is shown in Figure 1, using the scheme from Sinner et al. In total, 80% of strains were from the Mitis group, and the remaining strains were from the Sanguinis group (14%), Anginosus group (3%), and Salivarius group (3%).

Figure 1
Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of viridans group streptococci (VGS) strains causing bacteremia in patients with cancer. The neighbor-joining radial tree was generated by using concatenated sequences. Strains were assigned to a particular VGS on the basis of their proximity to type strains. Locations of well-characterized or type VGS strains (lines without circles) are also shown for reference purposes. Five contemporaneous Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are also included for reference purposes (shown in red). Numbers indicate bootstrap support values (%). Scale bar indicates genetic distance.

### Effect of benzathine penicillin treatment on antibiotic susceptibility of viridans streptococci in oral flora of patients receiving secondary prophylaxis after rheumatic fever [^112QrxZe]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the level of antibiotic resistance of viridans streptococci in the oral flora of children with a history of rheumatic fever, receiving long-term monthly intramuscular benzathine penicillin G prophylaxis.

Patients and Methods

Oral swabs from patients receiving monthly penicillin G prophylaxis for rheumatic fever were cultured and tested for viridans streptococci. The E-test was used to test susceptibility to penicillin G, clindamycin, clarithromycin and rifampin. Findings were compared with samples from healthy children who had not been exposed to antibiotic treatment for at least 2 months.

Results

Twenty-six patients and 20 control children were included in the study. Duration of intramuscular antibiotic treatment ranged from 5 months to 13.5 years. Sixty isolates of viridans streptococci species were obtained, with a similar distribution in the two groups. Intermediate resistance to penicillin (MIC 0.25–2 mg/L) was documented in 10 of the 32 isolates (31.2%) in the study group, and high resistance in none, compared to seven of 28 isolates (25%) with intermediate or high resistance in the control group (p = NS). All isolates in the study group and all but one in the control group were susceptible to clindamycin, and all isolates from both groups were susceptible to rifampin. One isolate (3.1%) in the study group and two (7.1%) in the control group were resistant to clarithromycin.

Conclusion

Monthly Intramuscular penicillin prophylaxis has no effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans streptococci in oral flora in children with a history of rheumatic fever, receiving secondary prophylaxis after rheumatic fever, regardless of the duration of treatment.

### Oral bacterial signatures in cerebral thrombi of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy [^111st7mJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic infections have been reported to be risk factors for both coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke.of oral bacteria, mainly from the viridans streptococci group, has been detected in coronary thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction and cerebral aneurysms. Viridans streptococci are known to cause infective endocarditis and possess thrombogenic properties. We studied the presence of oral bacterialin thrombus aspirates of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy.

Methods and Results

Thrombus aspirates and arterial blood were taken from 75 patients (69% men; mean age, 67 years) with acute ischemic stroke. The presence of Streptococcus species, mainly the Streptococcus mitis group, belonging to viridans streptococci as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in samples were determined using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. The relative amount of bacterialin a sample was determined with the comparative threshold cycle method. Bacterialwas detected in 84% (n = 63) of aspired thrombi, and 16% (n = 12) of samples were considered bacterialnegative.of Streptococcus species, mainly the S mitis group, was found in 79% (n = 59) of samples. The median relative amount of Streptococcus specieswas 5.10‐fold higher compared with the control blood samples from the same patients. All thrombi were negative for both P gingivalis and A actinomycetemcomitans.

Conclusions

This is the first study showing the common presence of bacterialfrom viridans streptococci in aspired thrombi of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Streptococcal bacteria, mostly of oral origin, may contribute to the progression and thrombotic events of cerebrovascular diseases.
