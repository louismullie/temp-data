## Question

HRT in menopausal women risks/benefits

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) in women and how to individualize its use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary indication and scope of therapy. Then, I should quantify symptomatic benefits and bone outcomes. Next, I will review cardiovascular, thrombotic, breast, endometrial, and other risks and how they vary by timing, age, and formulation. After that, I should consider special populations and risk modifiers. Finally, I will integrate decision-making tools and formulate practical, patient-centered recommendations with ongoing monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the indication and scope, because I need to ensure we are aligned with current guidance. The principal indication for systemic MHT is treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause; MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and any off-label use should be rare and justified by individualized goals and risk profiles, which I should verify against major guidelines and regulatory positions before proceeding [^114fevBe] [^112RSuzA] [^114WrBok].

> Now, I will examine symptomatic benefits and make sure I'm precise. MHT is the most effective therapy for hot flashes and night sweats, with randomized trials and pooled data showing roughly a 75% reduction in weekly hot flashes and about an 87% reduction in severity, and this benefit extends to improved sleep and quality of life, which can be substantial for many women, so I should confirm these ranges before counseling [^113JThMw]. For GSM limited to dryness or dyspareunia, low-dose vaginal estrogen is effective and preferred; if symptoms persist, options like DHEA or ospemifene are reasonable, and I need to ensure we separate local from systemic risks during discussion [^111ioqqJ].

> Next, I should review bone outcomes and be careful not to overstate. Systemic estrogen therapy prevents bone loss and reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects, and is FDA-approved for prevention of osteoporosis; however, it is not approved for treatment of established osteoporosis, so I must distinguish prevention from treatment when advising on duration and alternatives [^116L6LEC]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies primarily to women within 10 years of menopause or younger than 60, where the benefit-risk balance is most favorable, and that extended use for fracture prevention should be individualized with periodic reassessment [^114fevBe].

> I will now examine cardiovascular and thrombotic risks, and I need to double-check the timing hypothesis. Large randomized data, including WHI and Cochrane analyses, show increased risks of stroke and venous thromboembolism with systemic MHT overall, with absolute risks rising with age and time since menopause; however, when therapy is initiated in women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, absolute risks are lower and some analyses suggest neutral or more favorable coronary outcomes, supporting a timing effect rather than uniform harm across all ages [^116xRGvZ] [^1153aqw7] [^114WrBok]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: stroke risk is increased by about 24% and VTE by about 92% overall, but in early menopause the absolute excess is small, which matters for shared decision-making and formulation choice [^116rZnfb].

> Let me consider formulation and route, because this can meaningfully modify risk. Oral estrogen increases VTE risk via hepatic first-pass effects on coagulation, whereas transdermal estradiol at standard doses appears to have substantially lower or possibly no excess VTE risk, so for women with higher thrombotic risk or multiple risk factors, I should prefer transdermal routes and the lowest effective dose, and I should confirm that micronized progesterone is favored over synthetic progestins when a progestogen is needed for endometrial protection [^1178U8Q1] [^113r69Zv]. I should double-check that this aligns with endocrine and menopause society guidance before finalizing the plan [^113r69Zv] [^111ioqqJ].

> Breast cancer risk is the next critical area, and I need to be precise about estrogen-alone versus combined therapy. Combined estrogen-progestin therapy is associated with a modest increase in invasive breast cancer risk with longer durations, with risk rising after about 3–5 years and returning toward baseline after cessation, whereas estrogen-alone in women with hysterectomy shows no significant increase and may even show a slight reduction in incidence in some analyses, so I must tailor regimen and duration to baseline risk and patient preference [^114YryjJ] [^1123aAk6]. Hold on, I should verify that counseling includes baseline risk assessment and that we avoid implying zero risk with any systemic therapy, even in lower-risk profiles [^1174zrG3].

> I should confirm endometrial safety and the requirement for progestogen. In women with an intact uterus, unopposed systemic estrogen increases endometrial cancer risk, so a progestogen is required. Micronized progesterone is preferred when feasible, and tissue-selective estrogen complexes with a SERM like bazedoxifene can provide endometrial protection without a traditional progestin, which may be advantageous in selected patients [^1178U8Q1] [^113JThMw]. Let me reconsider whether local vaginal estrogen for GSM meaningfully affects the endometrium; data suggest very low systemic absorption and no clear increase in endometrial cancer with low-dose local therapy, though I should still individualize and monitor as needed [^111ZzYLd].

> Next, I should review other potential risks and benefits so I don't miss important trade-offs. Observational and trial data suggest a reduction in colorectal cancer with combined therapy, but this should not be used to justify MHT for cancer prevention; in women aged 65 or older at initiation, there is an increased risk of dementia with systemic therapy, reinforcing the importance of timing and the lowest effective dose approach; urinary incontinence may be worsened with systemic therapy, and gallbladder disease risk is modestly increased, particularly with oral formulations, so I need to screen for these vulnerabilities before prescribing [^115DNKPz] [^1123aAk6] [^1153aqw7]. But wait, what if the patient prioritizes symptom relief and accepts small absolute risks; in that case, shared decision-making with transparent risk communication is essential [^11211fam].

> I will now examine special populations where nuance is crucial. For women with premature menopause or primary ovarian insufficiency, MHT is generally recommended until the average age of natural menopause to preserve bone and possibly cardiovascular health, provided there are no contraindications, and I should confirm this aligns with endocrine and menopause society positions [^116L6LEC]. For BRCA carriers after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, limited data suggest MHT can be used for symptom control without a clear increase in breast cancer risk, but decisions should be individualized and coordinated with oncology and genetics; similarly, after treatment for gynecologic cancers, MHT may be appropriate in many scenarios, including some endometrial and epithelial ovarian cancer survivors, with careful counseling and surveillance [^1159gUo1] [^113LCxsY] [^113Et5W8]. Hold on, I should verify that each of these contexts requires multidisciplinary input and explicit documentation of risks, benefits, and patient preferences [^notfound].

> Next, I should review decision-making tools and risk communication, because misperception is common. Absolute risk differences are more meaningful than relative risks in counseling; for example, in women 50–59, excess VTE with oral estrogen is about 4 per 10,000 per year, and stroke about 3 per 10,000 per year, whereas combined therapy adds about 8 additional breast cancers per 10,000 per year over long-term use, figures that help patients contextualize rare events and align choices with their values [^11211fam]. I need to ensure we also discuss quality-of-life trade-offs, since decision analyses show that in symptomatic women, MHT often yields net QALY gains, whereas in asymptomatic women it tends to yield net harm, underscoring the centrality of indication and patient goals [^113MLo51].

> Let me integrate a practical, patient-centered approach and double-check each element against guidelines. For a healthy woman younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause with bothersome vasomotor symptoms, MHT is reasonable, using the lowest effective dose, preferably transdermal estradiol if VTE risk factors exist, and micronized progesterone if a uterus is present; duration should be individualized, with annual reassessment, and continuation beyond 65 is not automatically contraindicated if benefits persist and risks remain acceptable [^114fevBe] [^114dh9sV]. For women older than 60 or more than 10–20 years past menopause, I should generally avoid initiating systemic MHT due to higher absolute risks, consider nonhormonal options first, and if GSM predominates, use local vaginal estrogen; if osteoporosis prevention is the goal, consider nonhormonal antiresorptives rather than systemic estrogen for primary prevention of fracture in older women [^111ioqqJ] [^112RSuzA]. I should confirm contraindications such as prior breast cancer, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, active thromboembolic disease, or severe liver disease before any prescription [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and mitigation strategies are explicit. Annual reassessment of symptoms, bleeding patterns, blood pressure, BMI, and breast and cervical screening is prudent, with periodic consideration of dose reduction or discontinuation. If risks emerge, switching to transdermal formulations, lowering dose, or tapering can mitigate thrombotic and cardiovascular risks while preserving symptom control in many patients [^114UWJ1K] [^114fevBe]. Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is documented at each visit, including how risks and benefits were communicated and how patient preferences evolved, to maintain alignment with guideline-based care [^notfound].

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for **vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms of menopause** [^114fevBe] and prevents osteoporosis-related fractures [^116L6LEC]. For women aged < 60 years or within 10 years of menopause without contraindications, the benefits generally outweigh the risks [^111ioqqJ]; beyond this window, risks rise, especially for **cardiovascular disease and breast cancer** [^112LUkkN]. HRT is **not recommended for primary prevention of chronic diseases** [^112RSuzA], and therapy should be individualized with the lowest effective dose and periodic reassessment [^1157hBxF].

---

## Benefits of hormone replacement therapy

### Relief of menopausal symptoms

HRT effectively reduces vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) [^114fevBe] and alleviates genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), including vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia [^113JThMw]. It also improves sleep quality, mood, and overall quality of life [^1111xKPx].

---

### Bone health

HRT prevents bone loss and reduces fracture risk in postmenopausal women [^116L6LEC]. It is FDA-approved for osteoporosis prevention, though not for treatment [^116L6LEC].

---

### Potential cardiovascular benefits (timing hypothesis)

Some evidence suggests cardiovascular benefits when HRT is initiated in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause [^114WrBok], known as the "timing hypothesis" [^113xNCZ8]. However, HRT is not recommended for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention [^112RSuzA].

---

## Risks associated with hormone replacement therapy

### Cardiovascular risks

- **Coronary heart disease (CHD)**: Increased risk with combined estrogen-progestin therapy, particularly when initiated in older women or more than 10 years after menopause [^1111xKPx].
- **Stroke**: Increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially with combined therapy [^notfound].
- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, particularly with oral estrogen [^116aNoHu].

---

### Breast cancer risk

Combined estrogen-progestin therapy increases breast cancer risk with long-term use [^114YryjJ]; risk returns to baseline after cessation [^1123uSfv]. Estrogen-alone therapy does not significantly increase breast cancer risk and may reduce it [^1123aAk6].

---

### Other risks

- **Endometrial cancer**: Increased risk with unopposed estrogen; progestogen is required for women with a uterus [^1146ThMd].
- **Ovarian cancer**: Slight increase in risk with long-term use [^114UWJ1K].
- **Gallbladder disease**: Increased risk, particularly with oral estrogen [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing risk-benefit balance

Several factors influence the risk-benefit balance of HRT:

| **Factor** | **Influence on risk-benefit balance** |
|-|-|
| Age at initiation | Younger women (< 60 years or < 10 years postmenopause) generally have a more favorable balance [^111ioqqJ] |
| Time since menopause | Initiation close to menopause reduces cardiovascular risks [^114WrBok] |
| Type of HRT | - Estrogen-alone therapy (after hysterectomy) has lower risks than combined therapy [^114YryjJ] <br/> - Transdermal estrogen has lower VTE risk than oral [^1178U8Q1] |
| Duration of therapy | Longer duration increases risks, particularly for breast cancer and cardiovascular events [^115SF8aJ] |
| Individual risk factors | - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Breast cancer <br/> - Thromboembolic disorders <br/> - Liver disease [^114ExMCw] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **Indications**: HRT is indicated for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms, GSM, and osteoporosis prevention in at-risk women [^114fevBe].
- **Contraindications**: Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, breast cancer, thromboembolic disorders, active liver disease, and certain cardiovascular conditions [^notfound].
- **Individualization**: Therapy should be tailored based on age, time since menopause, symptom severity, and individual risk factors [^112TXcrr].
- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary, with periodic reassessment [^114UWJ1K].

---

## Alternative therapies

Non-hormonal options include SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, and clonidine for vasomotor symptoms [^117F5iL1]. For GSM, vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, and low-dose vaginal estrogen are effective alternatives [^111ioqqJ].

---

HRT is effective for menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis prevention, with the most favorable risk-benefit profile in women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause. It is not for chronic disease prevention, and therapy should be individualized with periodic reassessment.

### Is hormone replacement therapy safe in women with a BRCA mutation? a systematic review of the contemporary literature [^1159gUo1]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are recommended to undergo prophylactic (or risk reducing) bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) before age 40, resulting in surgical menopause. Given the concerns of estrogen deprivation on overall health, hormone therapy (HT) is often discussed, yet safety concerns persist.

Materials and Methods

We performed a systematic literature review of the safety of HT in women with a BRCA mutation undergoing prophylactic BSO.

Results

Although there remains a paucity of data on this topic, as evidenced by this systematic review of the contemporary literature, these patients do benefit from treatment, especially as it relates to menopausal symptoms without an apparently increased risk of breast cancer.

Conclusions

Decisions regarding the use of HT in women who undergo BSO after detection of a BRCA mutation must be individualized based on careful consideration of the risks and benefits. However, the risks of a subsequent cancer diagnosis appear small, particularly in regards to the benefits of treatment afforded by HT.

### Role of hormone therapy in the management of menopause [^114ExMCw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

There are many options available to address the quality of life and health concerns of menopausal women. The principal indication for hormone therapy (HT) is the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and benefits generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who elect HT at the time of menopause. Although HT increases the risk of coronary heart disease, recent analyses confirm that this increased risk occurs principally in older women and those a number of years beyond menopause. These findings do not support a role for HT in the prevention of heart disease but provide reassurance regarding the safety of use for hot flushes and night sweats in otherwise healthy women at the menopausal transition. An increased risk of breast cancer with extended use is another reason short-term treatment is advised. Hormone therapy prevents and treats osteoporosis but is rarely used solely for this indication. If only vaginal symptoms are present, low-dose local estrogen therapy is preferred. Contraindications to HT use include breast or endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and active liver disease. Alternatives to HT should be advised for women with or at increased risk for these disorders. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be provided for the shortest duration necessary because risks increase with increasing age, time since menopause, and duration of use. Women must be informed of the potential benefits and risks of all therapeutic options, and care should be individualized, based on a woman's medical history, needs, and preferences.

Menopause hormone therapy and cardiovascular health

The current understanding of MHT and its cardiovascular risks and benefits has evolved significantly over the past 2 decades. Table 2 highlights the most pertinent trials and their findings. Among the most seminal studies on this topic was the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials, which were designed to evaluate the risks and benefits of systemic MHT for preventing chronic diseases, including CVD. The WHI enrolled women aged 50 to 79 years, with the average age of 63 years, more than a decade older than the average age of menopause in the United States (52 years). The WHI clinical trials were primarily designed to investigate the benefits and risks of specific hormonal therapies for chronic disease in postmenopausal women and therefore were not intended to determine if MHT reduced chronic disease in the younger, midlife woman. Unlike earlier observational studies suggesting cardioprotective benefits with MHT use, results from the WHI clinical trials do not support the use of MHT, specifically oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, dementia, or other chronic diseases in postmenopausal women.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111ioqqJ]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" (NAMS) updates "The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

Risk–benefit metric in Figure 1 — risks and benefits are expressed as the difference in number of events (number in the hormone therapy group minus the number in the placebo group) per 10,000 women per year, with < 10 per 10,000 per year representing a rare event.

### Timing and duration of menopausal hormone treatment may affect cardiovascular outcomes [^1171phx4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Largely on the basis of the first publication of findings of net harm with menopausal hormone treatment in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials, current Food and Drug Administration recommendations limit menopausal hormone treatment to the "… shortest duration consistent with treatment goals… ", with goals generally taken to mean relief of menopausal symptoms and maximal duration as approximately 5 years. The WHI finding of net harm was due largely to the absence of beneficial effects on coronary heart disease incidence rates. Published analyses of WHI data by age or time since menopause find that excess coronary heart disease risk with menopausal hormone treatment is confined to more remotely menopausal or older women, with younger women showing nonsignificant trends toward benefit (the "timing hypothesis"). Moreover, a recently published reexamination of data from the WHI Estrogen plus Progestin trial suggests that reduced coronary heart disease risk may appear only after 5 to 6 years of treatment. Consistent with this finding, risk ratios for coronary heart disease were calculated as 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 0.86–1.36) in years 1 to 6 and as 0.46 (confidence interval, 0.28–0.78) in years 7 to 8+ in the WHI Estrogen Alone trial. Previous studies also support the beneficial effects of menopausal hormone treatment after prolonged exposure. Thus, current analyses do not support a generalized recommendation for short duration of menopausal hormone treatment. Rather, they suggest that current Food and Drug Administration practice guidelines should be reconsidered to allow individualized care based on risk:benefit considerations. New research is urgently needed evaluating influences of timing, duration, dose, route of administration, and agents on menopausal hormone treatment-related risks and benefits to better understand how to optimize recommendations for individual patients.

### Current perspectives on benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy [^1123uSfv]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone or with added progestin relieves menopausal symptoms and physical changes associated with depleted endogenous estrogen levels. Estrogen replacement has also demonstrated a clear benefit in the prevention of osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy with added progestin maintains spinal bone density, protects against postmenopausal hip fractures, and provides these benefits even when therapy is started after age 60. More recently, additional benefits have emerged. Current estrogen and hormone replacement therapy users have a 34% reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Until recently, the body of evidence indicated that hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only reduced cardiovascular disease risk by 40% to 50% in healthy patients; whether the findings of 3 ongoing trials will change this conclusion is pending availability of the final results. The many benefits of estrogen and hormone replacement therapy must be weighed against a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis with use for 5 or more years, but which disappears following cessation of therapy. Overall, estrogen and hormone replacement therapy improves the quality of life and increases life expectancy for most menopausal women.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111g5hPA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) initiation timing — Current recommendations suggest that the initiation of MHT should generally be limited to women < 60 years of age or < 10 years after menopause onset; evidence in younger, symptomatic women is limited, with no adequately powered RCTs with clinical outcomes, and the best available evidence comes from subgroup analyses of WHI data in women 50 to 59 years of age or < 10 years since menopause onset.

CV risk factors unique to women

Female-specific biological factors, in addition to the unique clinical conditions encountered by women, pose additional CV risks. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, for example, have shown to have lasting implications for long-term CV risk and mortality, which persist despite adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. Earlier occurrence of preeclampsia during pregnancy is associated with poorer outcomes overall, and its severity can be correlated with the severity of CVD later in life. Gestational DM, defined as a new diagnosis of DM beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, increases risk of type 2 DM later in life by 7-fold, and raises CVD risk significantly more than type 2 DM alone.

Similarly, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that typically manifests as infertility and hyperandrogenism in reproductive aged women and also increases risk for CVD. It is the most common endocrine disorder in young women, affecting between 5% and 10% of women worldwide.PCOS patients tend to have insulin secretory defects and insulin resistance, predisposing them to metabolic syndrome, which is known to be associated with CVD. Presence of this diagnosis is associated with multiple comorbidities such as obesity and coronary artery disease. For example, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study reported a 4-fold increase in coronary artery calcification in PCOS patients when compared with the general community.

### Perspectives on the women's health initiative trial of hormone replacement therapy [^115DNKPz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

The premature termination of one comparison in the Women's Health Initiative primary prevention trial due to stopping rules being reached necessitates a reconsideration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This part of the Women's Health Initiative trial, however, examined only one popular HRT regimen (conjugated equine estrogen [0.625 mg] and medroxyprogesterone acetate [2.5 mg] daily) in asymptomatic postmenopausal women. To help clinicians understand this large, complex trial, we describe several pervasive biases in earlier observational studies, review the principal findings of the trial, summarize recent systematic reviews, and offer clinical suggestions for HRT. Observational studies of HRT have found consistent, powerful protection against heart disease; this now appears due to consistent, powerful selection biases. These biases have the same net effect: Women using HRT in observational studies were healthier than those not using it. The Women's Health Initiative trial found that the overall risk-benefit ratio tipped against using HRT for prevention. Cardiovascular disease and breast cancer were increased among users, whereas colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fractures were reduced. Whether these findings relate to women with menopausal symptoms and to different HRT regimens is unknown. Hormone replacement therapy remains the best treatment for menopausal symptoms. Although estrogen has proven benefit for osteoporosis prevention, alternatives include raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate. For women needing HRT, use of a low dose, with reassessments at least annually, appears prudent. Heart disease prevention strategies of proven value include exercise, weight control, blood pressure and lipid control, and avoidance of smoking. Hormone replacement therapy should not be used for this purpose.

ELITE (Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol) also sought to examine the timing hypothesis, with similar results. Postmenopausal women were stratified according to time since menopause, with < 6 years classified as early menopause and ⩾10 years as late menopause, and randomly assigned to receive either oral estradiol 1 mg per day (plus 45 mg vaginal progestin if with a uterus) or placebo. After 5 years, oral estradiol therapy was associated with decline in progression of subclinical atherosclerosis (measured as CIMT) compared with placebo when therapy was initiated within 6 years after menopause, but not when initiated 10 or more years after menopause.

The SMART (Selective Estrogens, Menopause, and Response to Therapy) trials have gone a step further in evaluating effects of conjugated estrogens/bazidoxifene [a third generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)] on postmenopausal women. At 12 months, this combination was associated with significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels when compared with placebo. Triglyceride levels, however, were significantly increased at both doses.

In contrast to the HERS and WHI, the KEEPS, ELITE, and SMART trials support the timing hypothesis and suggest no significant harm with possible CVD benefits when initiating MHT at the time of menopause. More recently, however, a 2017 Cochrane review of MHT including 22 published studies, mostly in menopausal women over 60, found that women taking continuous combination MHT had increased risk of IHD, VTE, stroke, breast cancer, biliary disease, and death from lung cancer. Estrogen-only MHT was associated with decreased risk of breast cancer and bone fracture with no increased risk of IHD. Women with known CVD on combined MHT had an increased risk of DVT. These results influenced current guidelines heavily, as we review below.

Systemic effects of estrogen

Estrogens regulate a variety of systemic factors – they can alter serum lipid concentrations, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, antioxidant systems, and the production of vasoactive molecules such as nitric oxide and prostaglandins. Estrogens can also have direct effects on vascular cells and tissues, enacted through both "genomic" and "non-genomic" pathways. The genomic pathway employs ligand-activated estrogen receptors located in the cell nucleus that are responsible for regulating gene transcription and expression in response to hormone binding. Non-genomic effects are mediated by estrogen receptors localized to cell membrane signaling domains. While the genomic mechanism is thought to be responsible for estrogen's longer-term effects, the non-genomic pathway can explain estrogen's more rapid effects, such as arterial vasodilation in response to estrogen administration. This mechanism is thought to play a role in inhibiting progression of atherosclerosis.

Estrogen's effects on the vasculature can depend partly on the extent to which atherosclerosis has been established in a given vessel. Estrogen's potential anti-atherosclerotic effects may be less robust in diseased arteries. Not only has existing atherosclerosis shown to result in diminished estrogen receptor expression, but the effects of estrogen itself may have different consequences depending on the state of the vessel and its endothelium. Studies in several animal subjects have shown that anti-atherosclerotic effects of exogenous estrogens are most apparent when minimal underlying atherosclerosis is present at the time of therapy initiation.

### Managing menopause [^113uoLrX]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to considerations for hormone therapy, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to consider initiating hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms in patients at increased risk of breast cancer, with appropriate counseling and surveillance.

### British Gynaecological Cancer Society and British menopause society guidelines: management of menopausal symptoms following treatment of gynaecological cancer [^113bk3sm]. Post Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for menopause, more specifically with respect to patients at increased risk of gynecological cancers, BGCS/BMS 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid continuing hormone replacement therapy beyond the usual age of menopause in patients with a cancer susceptibility gene associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (such as BRCA carriers). Consider continuing hormone replacement therapy based on the individual balance of risks and benefits in patients after bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy for primary breast cancer prevention.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) also studied CE plus MPA in postmenopausal women aged 50–79, and was actually stopped early due to a 24% increased risk of coronary heart disease in this group compared with placebo. This group also had increased risk of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and breast cancer. These effects were most apparent at 1 year, and with the exception of breast cancer risk, dissipated after stopping intervention. When results were examined by time since menopause, risk of IHD was neutral for women < 10 years from menopause and increased for women > 20 years from menopause.

These observations, in conjunction with observed systemic effects of estrogen described above, led to the development of the timing hypothesis: the idea that beneficial effects of MHT occur only when therapy is initiated early in the menopausal period, prior to the development of advanced atherosclerotic disease. This was theorized to be based on underlying characteristics of damaged vessel wall and presumed negatively altered vascular remodeling in atherosclerotic vessels. The Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) evaluated the effectiveness of a combined estrogen/progestin in preventing progression of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) or coronary artery calcium (CAC) in women who are within 36 months of their final menstrual period. In healthy women, within 36 months of menopause, therapy did not prove to slow the progression of CIMT or affect CAC. Treatment did improve mood, sleep, vasomotor symptoms, and bone density without an increase in adverse events, suggesting that there may be noncardiac benefits and safety in using MHT in recently postmenopausal women.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114dh9sV]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — extended use after age 65 years: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years, and although the Beers criteria warns against hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. For otherwise healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS), continuing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making, and hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy older women at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persist or when hormone therapy remains the best choice because of lack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention therapies; however, long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia, and mitigation strategies include switching from oral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen, and lowering of dose.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^116DhHJr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

### Patients' understanding of risk: a qualitative study of decision-making about the menopause and hormone replacement therapy in general practice [^115wSqTg]. Family Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore women's understanding of the risks associated with the menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

Methods

Two general practices in Cambridge participated in this qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Forty women aged between 50 and 55 years, known to be current users, ex-users, or never-users of HRT were included in the study.

Results

Participants viewed risk as a danger: coping with risk required an assessment to facilitate an informed decision. To understand risk and make a personal interpretation, patients used their own knowledge, the presentation and context of that risk, together with their individual belief system particularly relating to representations of womanhood, lay beliefs and fatalism, control and choice. Experience, age and emotions often modified the salience of risk, and participants then used this meaning to weigh up the risks and benefits of a particular threat.

Conclusion

Participants gained understanding of risk by an active risk assessment process involving individual and complex interplay between knowledge and core beliefs, allowing the assessment of risks and benefits to facilitate an informed decision about the menopause and HRT.

### FDA requests labeling changes related to safety information to… [^112zfSUa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

MHTs are used to provide relief from common menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats) and symptoms due to changes to the vagina, vulva, and urinary tract caused by decreased estrogen, also known as vulvovaginal atrophy, or now more commonly known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Some MHTs are also approved to prevent osteoporosis. Most recently, FDA held an Expert Panel on July 17, 2025, and the panel focused on the risks and benefits of MHT. After the Expert Panel meeting, FDA requested broad public input on the risks and benefits related to menopause hormone therapy. Although menopause is a natural process in a woman's reproductive life, menopausal symptoms can significantly and adversely impact women's quality of life. FDA has approved numerous MHTs to treat moderate/severe hot flashes, VVA, and for some, prevention of bone thinning. In 2020, the U. S.

Census Bureau data reported approximately 41 million women in the U. S. were aged 45 to 64 years, the ages when VMS is most common. A study published in 2021 found the prevalence of moderate to severe VMS in women 45 to 65 years to be approximately 34%. However, FDA's review of drug utilization data from U. S. outpatient prescriptions for MHT indicated that, in 2020, approximately 2 million women aged 46 to 65 years received a prescription for systemic estrogen-alone or combined estrogen plus progestogen. Such drug use data suggest MHT may be under-utilized among women likely to benefit from MHT. FDA recognizes the primary aim of the WHI trials was to evaluate the impact of hormone therapy on cardiovascular disease and other chronic medical conditions in post-menopausal women across all ages, with the average participant aged 63 years. In contrast, women typically experience bothersome VMS much earlier in the menopausal transition time.

Regarding the probable dementia risk, the WHI studies enrolled women aged 65 to 79 years, a population much older than women starting MHT. Based on the agency's assessment of available data and recognition that menopause symptoms can significantly impact a woman's quality of life, FDA has re-considered the benefit/risk balance of these drugs and is requesting the following key changes to the prescribing information of MHT products:

Benefits of MHT and current guidelines

MHT is effective in reducing vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, promoting bone health, and, in many cases, improving quality of life. A Cochrane review including 24 randomized controlled trials studying MHT administration for vasomotor symptoms demonstrated a reduction in weekly hot flashes by 75% and an 87% decrease in severity of hot flashes, demonstrating it to be an effective therapy for this difficult-to-manage symptom of menopause, which on its own is associated with increased risk of CVD. MHT is currently approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and as estrogen replacement in the setting of surgical menopause, hypogonadism, or premature ovarian insufficiency. Options for MHT include conjugated equine or synthetic estrogens, micronized 17β-estradiol, or ethinyl estradiol. Progestogens are indicated for endometrial protection in patients with a uterus, and include MPA, norethindrone acetate, and progesterone. Additionally, bazedoxifene, a SERM, can be combined with CE to form a tissue-selective estrogen complex, providing endometrial protection without the use of a progestogen.

### Clinical trials in menopause [^116aNoHu]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical trials in menopause have undergone much scrutiny over the years. This has led to significant shifts in the treatment of symptomatic menopause and a substantial impact on women. We aim to delineate the key studies contributing to this controversy and highlight new directions specifically related to menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and vascular disease risk.

Methods

We performed a search of sentinel studies delineating the risks and benefits of HT in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women. Using PubMed we input the following search terms: hormone replacement therapy, cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary heart calcification, carotid intimal thickness, lipids, and/or lipoproteins. We included studies of menopausal women (surgical or natural) using combined estrogen/progestogen therapy or estrogen-only therapy that looked at cardiovascular disease risk factors or outcomes. Studies were evaluated for inclusion by the authors; however, this is not intended to be a systematic or an exhaustive analysis.

Results

In women close to the time of menopause, there is a decreased risk of subclinical and clinical coronary heart disease with menopausal HT. Additionally, HT confers a significant benefit to vasomotor symptoms of menopause, bone health, and colorectal cancer. There is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral formulations that appears mitigated with transdermal estradiol. Mixed data regarding breast cancer risk are available, with some studies suggesting an increased risk of invasive breast cancer with estrogen/progestogen therapy and a null effect with estrogen-only therapy. Other more long-term epidemiologic studies identify a decreased risk.

Conclusions

The available literature suggests that HT is a viable option for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Newer trials will likely verify this assessment. If this is enough to change clinical practice, however, remains to be seen given the general fear of HT by many with prescriptive authority, and also the women in our care.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^117F5iL1]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD and is not recommended for women with a high CVD risk. In women who may benefit from the vasomotor, genitourinary, and bone health properties of MHT, CV risk should be assessed and optimized prior to initiation. A 2020 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) hormone therapy clinical practice review outlines reasonable guidelines for hormone administration based on current data. Patients with vasomotor symptoms who are < 60 years old and/or within 10 years of menopause onset and are healthy without contraindications [i.e. prior stroke, MI, or pulmonary embolism (PE), high risk for breast cancer or venous thromboembolism (VTE)] are reasonable candidates for hormone therapy. Risk factors such as obesity, DM, and migraines, among others, should prompt providers to trial transdermal MHT. In patients who are ⩾60 years or > 10 years from menopause, the risks of MHT mentioned above outweigh the benefits, and emphasis should be placed on lifestyle changes, though the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) suggests a collaborative decision be made on an individual basis between patient and provider. Other pharmacologic options can be trialed, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, and clonidine. Of the above, only low dose paroxetine (7.5 mg) is FDA-approved. In patients with primarily genitourinary symptoms, lubricants or moisturizers are recommended first. If these fail to improve symptoms, vaginal hormonal therapies can be utilized. Figure 1 addresses CVD risks in women and stratifies those risks with acceptable thresholds for MHT use.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and cancer-NCI… [^1123aAk6]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

Findings of follow-up studies of WHI participants and other studies have shown that MHT is associated with both potential benefits and potential harms. Potential benefits of MHT include: relief of hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and painful intercoursewith systemic and local estrogen or systemic estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken lower risk of hip and vertebral fractureswith systemic estrogen or estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken lower risk of breast cancerwith systemic estrogen lower risk of death from breast cancerwith systemic estrogen. Potential harms of systemic MHT include: increased risk of vaginal bleedingwith estrogen plus progestin that may require assessment by endometrial biopsy increased risk of urinary incontinencewith both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin.

increased risk of dementiawith both estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin when taken by those 65 years or older increased risk of stroke, blood clots, and heart attackwith estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin for as long as MHT is taken. Who should not take menopausal hormone therapy. Women who have had breast cancer in the past are often advised to avoid MHT because some studies suggest that it may increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence. However, other studies have not shown an increased risk. For example, a Danish cohort study of postmenopausal women treated for early-stage breast cancer showed no increased risk of recurrence or mortality associated with the use of vaginal or systemic MHT.

Many studies have also been done to investigate whether MHT is safe for women who have experienced premature or severe menopausal symptoms as a result of cancer treatments that reduce hormone levels. A 2020 clinical practice statement from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology concluded that the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks for most people with epithelial ovarian, early-stage endometrial, and cervical cancer as well as for people with.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1157hBxF]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — risk mitigation, monitoring, and continuation of hormone therapy in older women emphasizes that mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy, and that longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should include periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consideration of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional, and it remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy, with no data to support routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be considered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.

Media Inquiries: HHS Press Office Docket open for public comments on the risks and benefits related to menopause hormone therapy. On July 17, 2025, the FDA hosted the FDA Expert Panel on Menopause and Hormone Replacement Therapy for Women. The panel focused on the risks and benefits of menopause hormone therapy, and in particular, the risks of breast cancer, uterine cancer, and certain cardiovascular risks versus potential benefits on bone, genitourinary, cardiovascular, and cognitive health. Discussions focused on data regarding differential risks and benefits depending upon the age of hormone initiation, formulation, and dose since the original publication of the Women's Health Initiative Study.

In follow-up to this meeting that had invited expert panelists who spoke in a public forum, the FDA is opening a docket to allow for submission of broad, public comments on the risks and benefits related to menopause hormone therapy, including data that could support updates to the labeling of such products. The agency is specifically interested in perspectives on risks and benefits concerning breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, genitourinary systems, bone health, and dementia. As well as being interested in how such risks and benefits might differ based on timing of hormone initiation, including age, duration of use, type of estrogen and progestogen used and dosage forms, including route of administration. This request is part of the FDA's effort to understand various perspectives on these safety considerations and the use of hormone therapy for menopause-related conditions in clinical practice.

### Understanding the risks and benefits of hormone therapy… [^1118bKyz]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple physician groups and the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that physicians counsel postmenopausal patients about the individual risks and benefits of using hormone therapy. Currently, information about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy is incomplete. In addition, no current studies assess the attitudes, perceptions, and motivations of women faced with the choice of using hormone therapy. Women usually start hormone therapy to relieve menopausal symptoms. They continue or discontinue hormone therapy based on concerns about breast cancer, uterine and endometrial cancer, menstrual bleeding, and other side effects. Few nonusers understand that they have an increased risk of developing osteoporosis based on their estrogen deficiency. Scheid and colleagues examined the relationship between the use of hormone therapy and women's perceptions of the risks and benefits.

The participants were asked to estimate their lifetime probability of developing breast cancer, uterine cancer, or osteoporosis. They also were asked the same question concerning lifetime probability of myocardial infarction when taking or not taking hormone therapy. The questionnaire had a final section that collected information on the women's quality of life at their current health status and what it would be if they developed breast cancer, uterine cancer, osteoporosis, or myocardial infarction. The attitudes of women who used or did not use hormone therapy did not differ with regard to preventing menopausal symptoms, general health, body orientation, and locus of control. Women who were using hormone therapy perceived a greater reduction in the risk of developing osteoporosis and myocardial infarction than women who did not use hormone therapy.

Both groups estimated their lifetime probability of developing breast cancer, uterine cancer, osteoporosis, and myocardial infarction at inflated levels when compared with established probabilities. Women who did not use hormone therapy perceived a greater increase in the risk of developing breast or uterine cancer if they started hormone therapy, compared with the perceived risk among women who were already using hormone therapy. Women who used hormone therapy believed that they had a lower risk of developing osteoporosis and myocardial infarction because they were using hormone therapy. Quality-of-life measurements were similar in both groups except in regard to osteoporosis. The authors conclude that women overestimate the risk of the four diseases studied regardless of their current hormone therapy status.

Women who use hormone therapy believe these medications convey a greater reduction in risks for osteoporosis and myocardial infarction, with a smaller increase in the risk of developing breast and uterine cancers. Continuing efforts to assist women in understanding the risks and benefits of hormone therapy would be helpful.

### A contemporary view of menopausal hormone therapy [^114rkKyM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Enthusiasm for the use of hormones to ameliorate symptoms of perimenopause and menopause has waxed and waned over the years. Both treatment for symptoms and training of women's health care practitioners in the management of menopause have sharply declined since publication of the Women's Health Initiative initial results in 2002. Findings from that trial, which treated a population of older, asymptomatic patients, have been extrapolated over the past 21 years to all estrogen products, all menopausal women, and all delivery mechanisms. Our patients deserve a more nuanced, individualized approach. Conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate are no longer the predominant medications or medications of choice available for management of menopausal symptoms. All hormones are not equivalent any more than all antiseizure medications or all antihypertensives are equivalent; they have different pharmacodynamics, duration of action, and affinity for receptors, among other things, all of which translate to different risks and benefits. Consideration of treatment with the right formulation, at the right dose and time, and for the right patient will allow us to recommend safe, effective, and appropriate treatment for people with menopausal symptoms.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

Menopause and CVD risk

As early as 1976, Framingham investigators reported a 2.6-fold higher incidence of CV events in age-matched postmenopausal women when compared with premenopausal women. These same data also found that, on average, women develop CVD 7–10 years later in life compared with men. Observational studies since then have also consistently shown that early age at menopause is positively associated with IHD. – As a result, it has been hypothesized that the pronounced risk of IHD in older women is related to the mid-life withdrawal of endogenous sex steroids associated with the menopausal transition.

This hypothesis is supported by several observations. First, menopause has shown to be associated with more atherogenic shifts in the lipid profile. After menopause, women are noted to have higher total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in addition to reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the Study of Women Across the Nation, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B in particular, when compared with other common CV risk factors, were the only two factors to change in association with menopause and not just age. Second, studies have revealed that the weight gain experienced in midlife, specifically increased fat mass, loss of skeletal mass, and increased waist circumference, cannot be explained by increasing age alone but by ovarian aging associated with the last menstrual period. The menopause transition has shown to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome by impairing glucose metabolism in addition to causing negative effects on blood pressure, weight gain, and central abdominal obesity. Third, menopause is associated with greater percentage of both epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue, two emerging risk factors for IHD.

### Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women [^116rZnfb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence from systematic reviews of observational studies suggests that hormone therapy may have beneficial effects in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease events in post-menopausal women, however the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have had mixed results. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of hormone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women, and whether there are differential effects between use in primary or secondary prevention. Secondary aims were to undertake exploratory analyses to (i) assess the impact of time since menopause that treatment was commenced (≥ 10 years versus < 10 years), and where these data were not available, use age of trial participants at baseline as a proxy (≥ 60 years of age versus < 60 years of age); and (ii) assess the effects of length of time on treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 25 February 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. We also searched research and trials registers, and conducted reference checking of relevant studies and related systematic reviews to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of women comparing orally administered hormone therapy with placebo or a no treatment control, with a minimum of six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome. We combined results using random effects meta-analyses, and undertook further analyses to assess the effects of treatment as primary or secondary prevention, and whether treatment was commenced more than or less than 10 years after menopause.

Main Results

We identified six new trials through this update. Therefore the review includes 19 trials with a total of 40,410 post-menopausal women. On the whole, study quality was good and generally at low risk of bias; the findings are dominated by the three largest trials. We found high quality evidence that hormone therapy in both primary and secondary prevention conferred no protective effects for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, or revascularisation. However, there was an increased risk of stroke in those in the hormone therapy arm for combined primary and secondary prevention (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.41). Venous thromboembolic events were increased (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.69), as were pulmonary emboli (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.48) on hormone therapy relative to placebo. The absolute risk increase for stroke was 6 per 1000 women (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 165; mean length of follow-up: 4.21 years (range: 2.0 to 7.1)); for venous thromboembolism 8 per 1000 women (NNTH = 118; mean length of follow-up: 5.95 years (range: 1.0 to 7.1)); and for pulmonary embolism 4 per 1000 (NNTH = 242; mean length of follow-up: 3.13 years (range: 1.0 to 7.1)). We performed subgroup analyses according to when treatment was started in relation to the menopause. Those who started hormone therapy less than 10 years after the menopause had lower mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence) and coronary heart disease (composite of death from cardiovascular causes and non-fatal myocardial infarction) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96; moderate quality evidence), though they were still at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, high quality evidence) compared to placebo or no treatment. There was no strong evidence of effect on risk of stroke in this group. In those who started treatment more than 10 years after the menopause there was high quality evidence that it had little effect on death or coronary heart disease between groups but there was an increased risk of stroke (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.38, high quality evidence) and venous thromboembolism (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.80, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our review findings provide strong evidence that treatment with hormone therapy in post-menopausal women overall, for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events has little if any benefit and causes an increase in the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolic events.

### Update in hormone therapy use in menopause [^116EhNVU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The original report from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) changed our understanding of the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Since that time, reanalysis of the WHI and additional data from other studies have further refined these concepts. Here we provide an update on recent advances in the field. Menopausal hormone therapy continues to have a clinical role in the management of vasomotor symptoms. However, our understanding of the role of hormones in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer continues to evolve. Further analyses of the effect of age and proximity to menopause at the time of initiation of therapy, duration of treatment, dose, route of administration, and the persistence of risks and benefits after stopping hormone therapy are described. In addition, recent data have emerged suggesting that there may be a link between hormone therapy and cancers of the lung and ovary. Finally, we discuss new advances in hormone therapy that will likely lead to a more favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, enabling safer effective menopausal symptom relief.

Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) recommendations have changed significantly over the last thirty years. Early observational studies suggested that MHT offered broad benefits for women, including relief from menopausal symptoms, improved genitourinary health, prevention of osteoporosis, and reduction in cardiovascular disease. As randomized controlled trials were conducted to validate these findings, new evidence emerged that led to shifts in guidance from medical societies and sharp declines in MHT prescriptions. This review summarizes three decades of studies, key advancements and ongoing controversies. We also discuss recommendations for MHT from cardiology, obstetrics/ gynecology and endocrinology perspectives.

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: July 2008 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112H6TEs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research. A suggested reading list of key references is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable close to menopause but decreases with aging and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on menopause-2017 update [^1178U8Q1]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Counseling in menopausal women: how to address the benefits and risks of menopause hormone therapy. A FIGO position paper [^116yTPVn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and current health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks. Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs, and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens, to provide indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women in peri- and postmenopause, worldwide.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common symptoms and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen (often simply termed hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy or HT) therapy involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks. Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health (Martin and Manson. 2008. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 93, 4567–75). Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 565: hormone therapy and heart disease [^116HaBj5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy should not be used for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary heart disease at the present time. Evidence is insufficient to conclude that long-term estrogen therapy or hormone therapy use improves cardiovascular outcomes. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that women in early menopause who are in good cardiovascular health are at low risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and should be considered candidates for the use of estrogen therapy or conjugated equine estrogen plus a progestin for relief of menopausal symptoms. There is some evidence that lends support to the "timing hypothesis", which posits that cardiovascular benefit may be derived when estrogen therapy or hormone therapy is used close to the onset of menopause, but the relationship of duration of therapy to cardiovascular outcomes awaits further study. Clinicians should encourage heart-healthy lifestyles and other strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in menopausal women. Because some women aged 65 years and older may continue to need systemic hormone therapy for the management of vasomotor symptoms, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against routine discontinuation of systemic estrogen at age 65 years. As with younger women, use of hormone therapy and estrogen therapy should be individualized based on each woman's risk-benefit ratio and clinical presentation.

### Use of cardiovascular age for assessing risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy [^111UnqYS]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative studies and others have suggested that menopausal hormone therapy may enhance the risk of new cardiovascular (CV) events in older women and diminish the development of coronary atherosclerosis in younger women. The underlying mechanisms to explain these findings are encapsulated in the term "Timing Hypothesis". Extensive pathophysiologic studies have provided mechanistic evidence for the dichotomous effects of estrogen on coronary artery vasculature. Early in the atherosclerotic disease process, estrogen exerts protective effects on the endothelium and retards plaque formation. Late in the process, estrogen causes plaque erosion or rupture with subsequent thrombosis and acute coronary events. Analysis of the Timing Hypothesis in women examined in the Women's Health Initiative primarily used chronologic age to assess divergent effects of estrogen. The complexity of the data underlying coronary pathophysiology has resulted in controversy whether MHT can be used in older women or those with prior CV disease. In a debate of this issue at a recent International Menopause Society meeting, the concept of using CV age rather than chronologic age was discussed as a practical method of resolving this issue and facilitating therapeutic decisions in older women. This "Personal Perspective" will review the concepts underlying CV age, describe how it is determined, provide support for its utility, and propose future studies using this parameter.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114WrBok]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular disease — key points: For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke (Level I), and hormone therapy is not government approved for primary or secondary cardioprotection (Level I). Personal and familial risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, VTE, and breast cancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy (Level III). The effects of hormone therapy on CHD may vary depending on when hormone therapy is initiated in relation to a woman's age or time since menopause onset (Level I). Women who initiate hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset are at higher absolute risks of CHD, VTE, and stroke than women initiating hormone therapy in early menopause (Level I).

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^111zbUzT]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogen and progesterone are principal hormones in a woman's life. Before menopause, women are exposed to regularly varying levels of endogenous estrogens and progesterone released during repeated menstrual cycles and potentially to more sustained levels of these hormones during pregnancy. Reproductive-age women may be further exposed to these hormones via oral contraceptives, composed of a progestin with or without an estrogen, and other forms of hormonal contraception. Near or after menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) — estrogen alone or combined with a progestin — may be offered to mitigate menopausal symptoms arising from precipitous declines in endogenous estrogen production and to reduce the risk of bone fractures. – Women with prior use of oral contraceptive pills show a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Despite the intended medical effects and additional health benefits, these hormonal agents, especially estrogens, remain a lingering concern for breast cancer risk. –

In this review, we have aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between estrogens and breast cancer. Given the expansive scope of scientific investigations pertaining to this topic, we focus on findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses with rigor and a large sample size, as well as preclinical mechanistic studies. To be inclusive on the topic with depth, we examined vast evidence, via extensive search on PubMed, from clinical and basic experimental studies, which include hormonal contraceptives, HRT, estrogen-elevating fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), reproductive factors, steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, breast cancer therapies, basic experimental studies, and animal research. Ultimately, we have sought to connect the dots by critically assessing and cohesively integrating wide-ranging, oft-incongruent findings into the conclusions based on the totality of current evidence.

### Menopausal hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women [^116aiXXj]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Annually, more than 1.3 million women in the US transition into menopause. Menopausal transition is associated with profound hormonal changes, which can be symptomatic in 80% of women, and these symptoms, including vasomotor, genitourinary, sleep difficulties, and cognition, can be severe in about 30% of women. Vasomotor symptoms, which are episodes of profuse heat accompanied by sweating and flushing, cause anxiety and sleep disruption and tend to be the most lifestyle-limiting symptom in many women.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the treatment of choice for menopausal symptoms and is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. During peak use in the late 1990s, prescriptions for MHT rose rapidly in the US, fueled by observational studies showing a protective effect on coronary heart diseases and cardiovascular deaths. MHT use, however, declined rapidly in 2002 after the Women's Health Initiative trial showed that the health risks associated with MHT outweighed the benefits. Recent studies highlighting nuances in the risks of MHT with suggestions that the absolute risks of adverse events depend on several factors, including age at initiation and timing in relation to menopause, MHT type, dosage, duration, and route of administration, have led to several national societies putting out guidelines on MHT prescribing.

In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against the use of MHT for primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women, while the North American Menopause Society recommended tailoring MHT in treating menopausal symptoms to each individual need. The US Preventive Services Task Force also highlighted research gaps, including the need to understand the comparative benefits and harms of different MHT formulations and age at initiation. A gap in the current conversation on MHT use is an understanding of recent trends in, and prevalence of, MHT use. To our knowledge, the most recent study on MHT prevalence using a nationally representative sample was based on self-reported data up to 2010; hence, there are no recent MHT use data captured by prescriptions to understand contemporary patterns in the US.

The goal of this cross-sectional study is to comprehensively describe the most recent trends in, and current prevalence and correlates of, MHT use, taking into consideration MHT formulations, among postmenopausal women in the US. Study findings will provide data that can help guide national discussions and policy on MHT use.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117D87TK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Guideline no. 422e: menopause and cardiovascular disease [^116QZs7m]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of cardiovascular risks, SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend to use the lowest effective dose of estrogen, and, where indicated, estrogen-only therapy when prescribing menopausal hormone therapy to minimize the associated risk of VTE.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### The women's health initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy: lessons learned [^116xRGvZ]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) assessed oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) taken with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for prevention of chronic disease in postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years.

Methods

Women with an intact uterus (n = 16,608) were randomized to CEE+ MPA therapy or placebo for a median of 5.6 years; women with hysterectomy (n = 10,739) were randomized to CEE-alone therapy or placebo for a median of 7.2 years. Both cohorts have been followed for 18 years.

Results

In the overall study population (mean age, 63 y), neither estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) nor estrogen-only therapy prevented coronary heart disease or led to a favorable balance of chronic-disease benefits and risks. Subgroup analyses, however, suggest that timing of hormone therapy (HT) initiation influences the relation between HT and coronary risk, as well as its overall benefit-risk balance, with more favorable effects in women who are younger (age < 60 year) or recently menopausal (within 10 year) than in women who are older or further past the menopausal transition. In younger women who entered the trial of estrogen-only therapy with oophorectomy, the intervention was associated with a significant 32% reduction in all-cause mortality over long-term follow-up.

Conclusions

WHI findings indicate important differences in HT-related clinical outcomes by age and time since menopause. Systemic HT has an acceptable safety profile for menopause management when initiated among healthy women who are younger (or recently menopausal) and not at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease or breast cancer. Initiation of treatment in older women who are distant from menopause onset, however, should be avoided. Other HT formulations and routes of delivery warrant further study.(WHI clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00000611).

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115RMpRN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Mortality with menopausal hormone therapy — overall effect and timing hypothesis: A meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated no significant effect on all-cause mortality with MHT use, including women < and > 60 years of age, but a Cochrane review reported a 30% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52–0.95) in women starting MHT < 10 years since menopause (or < age 60); meta-analyses reported a 30–40% mortality reduction, while the guideline concludes that further data are required for definitive conclusions about mortality in younger women.

### Benefits and harms associated with hormone replacement therapy: clinical decision analysis [^113MLo51]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate harms and benefits associated with use of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five years in women with different baseline risks for breast cancer.

Design

Probabilistic clinical decision analysis.

Setting

Hypothetical population of white UK women aged 50 years with different baseline risks for breast cancer.

Main Outcome Measure

Gain or loss in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).

Results

Women free of menopausal symptoms showed a net harm from HRT use, which increased for increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. Those with a baseline risk of 1.2% would expect a loss in QALYs of 0.4 months (- 0.03 QALYs, 95% credibility interval - 0.05 to - 0.01). The main analysis showed HRT to be on average beneficial in women with symptoms, with benefit decreasing with increasing baseline risk of breast cancer. The results were sensitive to the assumed value of quality of life with menopausal symptoms, therefore a contour plot was developed to show the probability of net harm for a range of different values and baseline risks.

Conclusions

HRT for primary prevention of chronic diseases in women without menopausal symptoms is unjustified. Perceived quality of life in women with symptoms should be taken into account when deciding on HRT. Thus, a decision analysis tailored to an individual woman is more appropriate in clinical practice than a population based approach.

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^111Bqg3t]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditional CV risk factors not equal in men and women

Well-established risk factors for CVD include diabetes mellitus (DM), tobacco use, hypertension (HTN), obesity, and lack of physical activity. These risk factors affect men and women differently and portend a higher risk of CVD in women. See Table 1 for a summary.

Table 1.
Traditional CV risk factors and their disproportionate effects on CVD in women compared with men.

Women are disproportionately affected by DM: mortality for diabetic women is an estimated 2.1 million versus 1.8 million in diabetic men, and a majority of these deaths are CV in nature. In women with DM, there is a 1.81-fold increased risk of death from IHD compared with women without DM, and in men there is a 1.48-fold increased risk when compared with non-diabetic men. Additionally, risk of heart failure is 5-fold higher in diabetic women as compared with non-diabetic women, which is higher than the 2-fold increase in heart failure seen in diabetic men as compared with non-diabetic men. The risk differences in DM on CVD by gender appear multifactorial. Women have higher rates of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), hypercoagulability, and increased expression of concurrent metabolic syndromes. – Further compounding these disparities, diabetic women are also less frequently prescribed evidence-based therapies by their healthcare providers.

### Hormone therapy: evolving concepts [^116C75ea]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the medical literature published in 2002 regarding menopausal hormone therapy and its impact on clinical practice.

Methods

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE with the keywords of menopause, sex steroids, and hormone replacement therapy. Randomized clinical trials were reviewed. An evidence-based review is presented.

Results

Menopausal hormone therapy has undergone radical change since the publication of the Women's Health Initiative randomized prospective trial of combined estrogen plus progestin therapy for disease prevention. After a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the E + P versus placebo trial of 16,608 women was stopped because the health risks of taking E + P exceeded the benefits. An increase in breast cancer risk, coupled with an adverse trend in overall risk-benefit ratio, reached the preset stopping boundaries. In addition, there was an increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The decreased risks seen for osteoporotic fracture and colorectal cancer were outweighed by the above risks. The FDA has required mandatory label changes for all hormone products based on these findings. The Women's Health Initiative found that treatment with estrogen plus progestin for up to 5 years is not beneficial overall. There is early harm for coronary heart disease, continuing harm for stroke and venous thromboembolism, and increasing harm for breast cancer. This risk-benefit profile is not consistent with a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases in postmenopausal women. Menopausal hormone therapy should be reserved for women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.

Conclusions

In the past 20 years, menopause has become a household word, with much better understanding of its consequences. The growing numbers of menopausal women and clinical trials have coincided to draw increasing attention to the perimenopausal and menopausal years. Better studies of older therapies and the expanded number of new choices today, with more in development and evaluation, have complicated provider and patient choices but greatly improved the potential for effective intervention.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy in clinical perspective [^1121rYHE]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Although many of the risks and benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy are known, only recently has the magnitude of these effects and their perspective to other therapies become more fully understood. Careful review of randomized controlled trials indicates that the risks of postmenopausal hormone therapy including breast cancer, stroke and venous thromboembolism are similar to other commonly used agents. Overall, these risks are rare (less than 1 event per 1,000 women) and even rarer when initiated in women less than 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause. In addition, the literature indicates similar benefit of postmenopausal hormone therapy, in women who initiate hormone therapy in close proximity to menopause, to other medications used for the primary prevention of coronory heart disease in women.

We compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy with and without combination hormone replacement therapy in three cohorts of women with menopausal symptoms over a 20-year period using a Markov decision-analysis model. Women were either at high or low risk for breast cancer and coronary heart disease or at high risk for osteoporosis.

Results

Hormone replacement therapy decreases life expectancy slightly compared with no hormone replacement therapy if menopausal symptoms are not considered. However, if relief from menopausal symptoms is considered and the usefulness of life with symptoms is worth < 0.996 compared with life without symptoms, then 5 years of hormone replacement therapy provides equivalent quality-adjusted life-years.

Conclusion

Combination hormone replacement therapy decreases life expectancy if quality of life with menopausal symptoms is not considered. However, the benefit of hormone replacement therapy can exceed the risk for women with menopausal symptoms.

### Timing hypothesis for postmenopausal hormone therapy: its origin, current status, and future [^115b463s]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This work aims to review preclinical/clinical cardiovascular studies that led to randomized trials of the risks and benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT), the pathobiological basis for the timing hypothesis, and subset analyses of randomized trials that tend to support the timing hypothesis; to elaborate experimental data that might inform the results of recent trials; and to summarize evidence regarding how early is early enough for the initiation of HT.

Methods

This work used interpretive literature review.

Results

Preclinical and large observational studies provided what was considered at the time to be convincing evidence that HT provided protection against progressing coronary artery atherosclerosis. Those findings prompted three randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective trials to determine the risks and benefits of HT. None provided any evidence that HT had any beneficial effects on preexisting coronary artery atherosclerosis. Monkey studies provided clear evidence that HT was effective in slowing the progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis only when administered soon after surgical menopause and that benefit was lost if estrogen therapy was delayed until the plaques had become complicated. The phenomenon was referred to as the "timing hypothesis", and evidence for its translation into postmenopausal women was sought in subset analyses of data from the Women's Health Initiative and from newly planned prospective trials.

Conclusions

Current data are both supportive and not supportive of the timing hypothesis. However, evidence indicating that estrogens administered in the perimenopausal transition or early in menopause are not harmful to the cardiovascular system and, when given for a few years for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, may slow the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the postmenopausal cardiovascular disease burden seems convincing.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^117TijsH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

HTN is another well-established risk factor for CVD and the leading cause of CV mortality worldwide. Women with HTN have a higher population-adjusted CV mortality when compared with men and are less likely to be treated to guideline-directed blood pressure goals. Postmenopausal women are particularly susceptible to this – as estrogen levels decline, so do its protective vasodilatory effects and resulting benefits on blood pressure.

Obesity, another traditional CV risk factor, is more prevalent in women than in men. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2013, among the 37.7% of adults aged 20 years or older who were classified as obese, 35% were men and 40.4% were women. Obesity has independently shown to be associated with increased risk of CVD in women. The Framingham Heart Study, for example, found obesity to increase relative risk of CAD by 64% in women compared with 46% in men. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest inactivity levels are higher among women than in men, especially with older age. Given observational data that higher levels of activity may be associated with lower rates of chronic diseases such as CVD, this may also be adding to the increased CV risk that women face.

### What the women's health initiative has taught us about menopausal hormone therapy [^111pvX15]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Our understanding of the complex relationship between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has been informed by detailed analyses in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating MHT in postmenopausal women. Although the WHI demonstrated increased risk of CVD events with MHT in the overall cohort, subsequent secondary analyses demonstrated that these risks were influenced by the woman's age and time since menopause, with lower absolute risks and hazard ratios for younger than older women. As MHT is the most effective treatment for the vasomotor symptoms of menopause, it is important to understand its risks and how to conduct risk stratification for symptomatic women. In addition to reviewing the WHI findings, studies pre- and post-WHI are reviewed to describe the relationship between MHT and CVD risk in menopausal women. The absolute risks of adverse cardiovascular events for MHT initiated in women close to menopause are low, and all-cause mortality effects are neutral or even favorable for younger menopausal women. The WHI has advanced and refined our understanding of the relationship between MHT and CVD risk. Although MHT should not be used for CVD prevention, absolute risks of CVD are low when MHT is started close to menopause in healthy women and hazard ratios tend to be lower for younger than older women. For women in early menopause and without contraindications to treatment, the benefits of MHT are likely to outweigh the risks when used for menopausal symptom management.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: current considerations [^114KkBWo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### The randomized world is not without its imperfections: reflections on the women's health initiative study [^1174K6Np]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

In May 2002, the Women's Heath Initiative (WHI) clinical trial, designed to clarify the risks and benefits of combination hormone replacement therapy, came to a premature halt. An interim safety review after an average follow-up of 5.2 years found that a combination of estrogen and progestin often prescribed to postmenopausal women increased the risk of invasive breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The combination hormone therapy reduced bone fractures and colorectal cancer, but not enough to outweigh the other risks. The WHI trial presents a challenge for patients, physicians, and epidemiologists, since many observational studies have shown cardiovascular benefits of long-term hormone replacement therapy (HRT). At the same time, a companion paper in the same journal reported an epidemiologic study with a 13.4-year mean follow-up suggesting that estrogen replacement therapy, when used alone for 10 years or more, increases the risk of ovarian cancer. The medical community is still recovering from these twin shocks and trying to digest the results of both of these studies. The WHI study calls into question the long-term use of HRT in healthy women. The benefit of the temporary use of estrogen in controlling disruptive symptoms of the menopause is not being contested. Absent from many news releases are the hedging and equivocation typical of other reported clinical trials. There are still some "hanging chads" out there, and this commentary is designed to examine the uncertainties that remain after the WHI report. It is also intended to suggest development of alternative strategies to control symptoms of the menopausal transition that will reduce risks of HRT. The evidence from the WHI study will need to be incorporated into medical decision making, but clinical decisions, like most human decisions, are complex and in the final analysis must be based on information from many sources.

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112RSuzA]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — recommendations of other organizations state that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends against the use of menopausal hormone therapy for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease", while also noting that women "in early menopause who are in good cardiovascular health and at low risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes should be considered candidates for the use of estrogen therapy or conjugated equine estrogen plus progestin for relief of menopausal symptoms" and that such therapy "is approved for use in women with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture"; the North American Menopause Society "recommends that hormone therapy should not be prescribed for chronic disease prevention", adding that extended duration "might be appropriate in symptomatic women or for the prevention of osteoporosis, if alternative therapies are not tolerated, based on a careful assessment of individual benefits and risks"; and the American Academy of Family Physicians "endorses the previous USPSTF recommendation on hormone therapy in postmenopausal persons".

### Estrogen and progestogen use in peri-and postmenopausal women: March 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114i3Dza]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2004 regarding recommendations for estrogen and progestogen use in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2004 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The position statements published by NAMS do not represent "practice standards" that would be codified and held up as standards by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, they are prevailing opinion pieces in a best effort attempt to incorporate current evidence into practical clinical recommendations.

Results

With the primary goal being to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of peri- and postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for both disease prevention and treatment of menopause-related symptoms, current evidence allowed for a clear distinction between areas of consensus and areas for which the Panel determined that there was inadequate evidence for any conclusion to be reached. The document lists all of these areas along with clear explanatory comments. A comprehensive list of key references is provided. The absence of evidence is also recognized in the list of needs for further research recommended by the Panel.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of ET or EPT for menopause-related symptoms and disease prevention in appropriate populations of peri- and postmenopausal women.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy: risks and benefits [^112LUkkN]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal hormone therapy (PMHT) is used for the relief of menopausal symptoms, but the dosage has varied greatly throughout its existence. By the end of the 1990s, PMHT was mainly used to prevent chronic diseases such as osteoporosis, coronary heart disease and dementia, and large prevention trials were undertaken in this context. Following the initial negative reports of these trials, use of PMHT dramatically decreased. These reports noted surprisingly increased risks, notably of coronary heart disease, stroke and breast cancer, in people who used PMHT. Nowadays, considering the currently available data, it seems that an important distinction should be made between the treatment of climacteric symptoms in young, generally healthy, postmenopausal women and the prevention of chronic diseases in elderly women. PMHT seems to be beneficial and safe for postmenopausal symptomatic women aged < 60 years. Treatments with a high safety profile should be the preferred option, including low-dose PMHT, oestrogen-only therapy in women who have had a hysterectomy, and vaginal oestrogen therapy for women with atrophic vaginitis. Nonandrogenic progestin might have a reduced thrombotic and breast cancer risk, and transdermal oestrogen could have a reduced thrombotic risk. Nevertheless, PMHT should not be used for the prevention of chronic diseases in the elderly (> 70 years old) owing to the increased risk of stroke and breast cancer in these patients.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116L6LEC]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis key points — Hormone therapy prevents bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, with dose-dependent effects on bone density (Level I), and hormone therapy reduces fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women (Level I). Hormone therapy is FDA approved for prevention of bone loss, but not for treatment of osteoporosis (Level I). In the absence of contraindications, in women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, systemic hormone therapy is an appropriate therapy to protect against bone loss (Level I). Unless contraindicated, women with premature menopause without prior fragility fracture or osteoporosis are best served with hormone therapy or oral contraceptives to prevent bone density loss and reduce fracture risk, rather than other bone-specific treatments, until the average age of menopause, when treatment may be reassessed (Level II). Decisions regarding initiating and discontinuation of hormone therapy should be made primarily on the basis of extraskeletal benefits (ie, reduction of VMS) and risks (Level III).

### A comparative review of the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy regimens [^112rh8Ne]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial) investigated the effect of conjugated equine estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on specific potential long-term benefits and risks. A review of the clinical studies that have investigated different types and regimens of estrogens combined with progestins was conducted to assess how applicable the results of the Women's Health Initiative are to hormone replacement therapy regimens in general. The studies that were reviewed were limited to randomized clinical trials and observational studies that have been published over the last 15 years (1987–2002) and to meta-analyses and reviews that may have included the literature before 1987. The increased risks for venous thromboembolism, stroke, coronary heart disease, and breast cancer that were identified in the Women's Health Initiative trial have also been reported with postmenopausal hormone therapies that contain a variety of estrogen and progestin products. The beneficial effects that were noted in the Women's Health Initiative, with respect to reductions in fractures and colorectal cancer, have not been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials that use different estrogen/progestin combinations; however, observational trials that used a variety of estrogen or hormone replacement therapy products and randomized clinical studies that evaluated bone mineral density (an excellent predictor of fracture risk) with different estrogen/hormone replacement therapy regimens would suggest that results would be similar to those found in the Women's Health Initiative. Although the relief of menopausal symptoms, the primary reason women seek treatment, was not included in the overall benefit/risk analysis of the Women's Health Initiative, numerous trials suggest that all therapies are effective. Overall, these data indicate that the benefit/risk analysis that was reported in the Women's Health Initiative can be generalized to all postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy products.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114fevBe]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 hormone therapy position statement — Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture; risks differ by type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used, and treatment should be individualized with periodic reevaluation. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss, whereas for women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia; longer duration of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### Hormone replacement therapy and the cardiovascular system lessons learned and unanswered questions [^115CNzUC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the U.S., exceeding breast cancer mortality in women of all ages. Women present with cardiovascular disease a decade after men, and this has been attributed to the protective effect of female ovarian sex hormones that is lost after menopause. Animal and observational studies have shown beneficial effects of hormone therapy when it is initiated early in the perimenopausal period or before the development of significant atherosclerosis. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in older women have not shown any benefit in either primary prevention or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, with a concerning trend toward harm. This review outlines the lessons learned from the basic science, animal, observational, and randomized trials, and then summarizes yet-unanswered questions of hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk.

### The timing hypothesis: hormone therapy for treating symptomatic women during menopause and its relationship to cardiovascular disease [^113xNCZ8]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

The risks and benefits of menopausal hormonal therapy (HT) have been evaluated extensively over the past three decades. While the efficacy of HT for management of menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness is well established, its relationship to cardiovascular outcomes is complex. The timing hypothesis, which posits that the cardiovascular effects of HT depend on the timing of initiation of HT in relation to menopause, has helped shape our understanding of the cardiovascular outcomes related to HT. Based on results from female monkey studies, the timing hypothesis provides a framework to explain discrepancies in results between multiple observation studies and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials. The WHI trials closed early in 2002 in part because of increased cardiovascular events seen in women on treatment. Subanalysis of the WHI results by age group, and more recent randomized control studies, including the Kronos Early Estrogen and Prevention Study (KEEPS) and Early Versus Late Intervention Trial (ELITE), demonstrate that the risk of adverse cardiovascular events for HT are low for women < 60 years of age or within 10 year from menopause. Although current data does not support using HT for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, it does suggest that HT can be safely used to treat symptoms in appropriately selected women close to menopause.

Menopause hormone therapy

Based on the above, it is probable that decline in endogenous sex hormone levels play a part in the increased CV risk women face with age. However, only a few longitudinal studies have gone so far as to study associations between circulating sex hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin levels, and CVD, with varying results. Moreover, as both menopause and biological aging are interrelated in time, the extent to which one contributes to age-related CV risk over the other is difficult to delineate. However, the question of a possible CV benefit from MHT has been promoted for decades, as noted in several observational studies such as the Nurse's Health Study, which found postmenopausal hormone use to decrease risk for major coronary events in women without previous CVD. Since the 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials studying various MHT have taken place, looking at both primary and secondary prevention outcomes.

The 1998 Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) was the first published secondary prevention trial to evaluate hormone therapy in women with known coronary disease. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of conjugated estrogens (CE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The primary outcome was nonfatal MI and IHD death with no significant decreases in rates of these events in women assigned to the hormone group compared with those assigned to the placebo group after 4.1 years of follow up. Post hoc analyses showed a statistically significant time trend in which more IHD events actually occurred during the first year of treatment, with fewer in years 3–5. With this knowledge, investigators hypothesized that this early risk may be due to a prothrombotic effect of treatment that may be outweighed by beneficial effects with time. Surveillance was continued for 6.8 years via the HERS II trial, at which time hormone therapy failed to reduce risk of CV events in women with IHD. Treatment for 6.8 years also increased rates of venous thromboembolism and biliary surgery.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115SF8aJ]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Duration of use, initiation after age 60 years, and discontinuation — benefits of hormone therapy generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who are aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, but because increasing risk is observed with advancing age and extended duration of use, women are advised to use the appropriate dose for the time needed to manage symptoms. Because many women will experience bothersome vasomotor symptoms (VMS) for many years, long-duration hormone therapy may be needed and an arbitrary age-based stopping rule is not clinically appropriate; frequent VMS persist on average 7.4 years and for many more than 10 years. In a study of Swedish women aged older than 85 years, 16% reported hot flashes at least several times per week, and up to 8% of women continue to have hot flashes for 20 years or longer after menopause.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^111Bw5aY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: concepts, controversies, and approach to treatment [^111VeXUA]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Randomized trials also demonstrate positive effects on bone health, and age-stratified analyses indicate more favorable effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in younger women (close proximity to menopause) than in women more than a decade past menopause. In the absence of contraindications or other major comorbidities, recently menopausal women with moderate or severe symptoms are appropriate candidates for HT. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials-estrogen and progestin trial and the estrogen-alone trial-clarified the benefits and risks of HT, including how the results differed by age. A key lesson from the WHI trials, which was unfortunately lost in the posttrial cacophony, was that the risk:benefit ratio and safety profile of HT differed markedly by clinical characteristics of the participants, especially age, time since menopause, and comorbidity status. In the present review of the WHI and other recent HT trials, we aim to provide readers with an improved understanding of the importance of the timing of HT initiation, type and route of administration, and of patient-specific considerations that should be weighed when prescribing HT.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

### ACOG committee opinion. risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^114km4ep]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to evaluate critically the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestins to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and, potentially, cardiovascular disease. Postmenopausal women should be apprised of the current understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

NAMS position statement — conclusions on effectiveness and benefit-risk stratification state that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture, and that risks differ by type, dose, route, timing, and progestogen need; treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. Absolute attributable risks for hormone therapy in the 50- to 59-year-old age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereas risks appear greater when initiated at 60 years and older or further than 10 years from menopause onset, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset. For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, and based on the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable for ET than for EPT. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than for younger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111yvUiD]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended.
