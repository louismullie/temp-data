## Question

normal cervical lymph node size in mm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the normal size of cervical lymph nodes in millimeters, including how these thresholds vary by age and anatomic level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why "normal" size varies by age and location. Then, I should verify adult versus pediatric norms and the role of imaging modality. Next, I will examine level-specific pediatric thresholds, especially the jugulodigastric (Level II) exception. After that, I should review adult criteria and the tension between RECIST and clinical practice. Finally, I will integrate morphology and growth kinetics, and close with practical recommendations and caveats anchored to guidelines and studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why size alone is insufficient. Normal cervical nodes vary with age, anatomic level, and imaging plane; size thresholds used for cancer staging (e.g. RECIST) are designed for oncologic response assessment and can misclassify physiologic nodes, particularly in children, so morphology and clinical context must guide decisions [^111vhRU9] [^114Vdny4] [^117HJQms].

> I need to check pediatric norms next. In children, multiple CT series of otherwise healthy cohorts support that short-axis diameters up to 10 mm are common, with Level II (jugulodigastric) nodes often larger; specifically, short-axis > 15 mm for Level II and > 10 mm for all other levels are uncommon and thus considered enlarged in otherwise healthy children, and age-specific adjustments are generally small and not clinically necessary in practice [^113yXqTr] [^112fLY85] [^114qU4xN] [^111vhRU9].

> Wait, let me verify the Level II exception because it is easy to overgeneralize. The jugulodigastric node is frequently the largest cervical node in healthy children, and several pediatric CT studies show that a short-axis up to about 15 mm can still be within physiologic limits, whereas exceeding 15 mm becomes uncommon and should prompt closer evaluation alongside morphology and clinical features [^113yXqTr] [^112fLY85] [^114qU4xN].

> Hold on, I should also consider imaging plane effects before I lock in axial-only thresholds. Nodes at Levels II, III, and V often align vertically; long-axis measurements on coronal or sagittal planes can be substantially larger than axial short-axis, so applying axial-plane cutoffs to non-axial measurements risks false positives; therefore, measurements should be standardized to the axial short-axis when comparing to thresholds [^111vhRU9] [^113tWqCz].

> Next, I should review adult norms and reconcile them with oncologic criteria. In adults, a short-axis ≤ 10 mm is generally considered normal, with a commonly cited exception for the jugulodigastric node up to 15 mm; RECIST 1.1 uses a 10 mm short-axis threshold to define pathologic nodes, and Lugano permits up to 15 mm long-axis in some contexts, underscoring that these systems serve staging rather than population "normal" definitions, so clinical judgment remains essential [^112hgBN3] [^116V56Ud] [^117CDXh8] [^117HJQms].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated long-axis and short-axis cutoffs. I should double-check that the adult jugulodigastric "1.5 cm" figure refers to long-axis in clinical palpation and imaging traditions, whereas RECIST's 10 mm is short-axis. Keeping this axis distinction clear avoids misapplication of thresholds across different conventions [^117CDXh8] [^116V56Ud] [^114xkbDH].

> I will now examine morphology and growth kinetics because size is nonspecific. Features increasing suspicion include round shape (short/long axis ratio approaching 1), loss of the fatty hilum, peripheral vascularity, necrosis, calcification, irregular margins, and interval growth, whereas an oval shape with preserved hilum and central vascularity favors reactive nodes; in thyroid cancer specifically, cystic change, microcalcifications, and peripheral vascularity raise concern, and FNA with Tg washout is recommended for nodes ≥ 8–10 mm if results would change management [^114Vdny4] [^115hmhnh] [^117FfBhS] [^117UYRb6].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. In very young children, large but stable, non-tender, oval nodes with a hilum are often reactive. Persistence without red flags is common and low risk, though supraclavicular nodes and nodes > 3 cm warrant heightened scrutiny. Conversely, in adults with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, even subcentimeter nodes can harbor metastasis, so size thresholds must be integrated with primary site risk and morphologic features [^115SXVf8] [^115WEk1y] [^116V56Ud].

> Next, I should review how guidelines operationalize this. Node-RADS cautions against overinterpreting size alone and integrates configuration and clinical context. Ultrasound is first-line for neck node assessment in children and in thyroid cancer workflows. Biopsy thresholds are typically lower in thyroid cancer (often 8–10 mm short-axis) when results would alter surgical planning, whereas in other HNSCC contexts, size is weighed alongside necrosis, shape, and extranodal extension to guide biopsy and staging [^1121QppF] [^114Vdny4] [^1124wnnS] [^116V56Ud] [^117FfBhS].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical thresholds. For children, short-axis ≤ 10 mm is generally normal, with Level II nodes acceptable up to about 15 mm; exceeding these sizes is uncommon and merits careful assessment of morphology and clinical context. For adults, short-axis ≤ 10 mm is generally normal, with the jugulodigastric node up to 15 mm (long-axis tradition) often acceptable if otherwise reassuring; any node > 15 mm short-axis in any level is abnormal and warrants further evaluation, recognizing that subcentimeter nodes can still be malignant in high-risk oncologic settings [^113yXqTr] [^112fLY85] [^117CDXh8] [^112hgBN3].

> Finally, I need to ensure the caveats are explicit. Size thresholds vary by age, anatomic level, and imaging plane. Axial short-axis should be the reference dimension. Oncologic criteria like RECIST are for staging and response, not for defining population normals. And morphology, vascular pattern, interval growth, and clinical context should drive management as much as absolute size, with ultrasound and selective FNA/Tg washout as key tools when thyroid cancer is suspected [^111vhRU9] [^116V56Ud] [^114Vdny4] [^117FfBhS].

---

Normal cervical lymph nodes are **≤ 10 mm in short-axis diameter** for most levels, with a **≤ 15 mm short-axis** allowance for level II (jugulodigastric) nodes. Nodes exceeding these thresholds are considered enlarged and warrant further evaluation [^112fLY85]. Size alone is insufficient; **shape, hilum, and vascularity** also guide assessment [^114Vdny4] [^113fqxHX].

---

## Normal size criteria by anatomical level

| **Anatomical level** | **Normal short-axis diameter** |
|-|-|
| Levels I, III, IV, V, VI | ≤ 10 mm |
| Level II (jugulodigastric) | ≤ 15 mm |

---

These criteria are widely used in clinical practice and supported by radiological guidelines and studies [^112hgBN3] [^113yXqTr].

## Clinical significance of lymph node size

Lymph node size is a **key indicator** of potential pathology; however, size alone is not sufficient to distinguish benign from malignant nodes [^1117ErfR]. Enlarged nodes may be reactive to infection or inflammation, or indicative of malignancy such as lymphoma or metastatic carcinoma [^114Vdny4].

---

## Additional imaging features influencing clinical decision-making

While size is important, **other imaging features** must be considered when evaluating cervical lymph nodes:

- **Shape**: Oval nodes with a preserved fatty hilum are typically benign, whereas round nodes with loss of the hilum raise suspicion for malignancy [^115hmhnh].
- **Echogenicity**: Homogeneous echogenicity is benign; heterogeneous echogenicity or cystic changes suggest malignancy [^112wzCgR].
- **Vascularity**: Central vascularity is benign; peripheral or chaotic vascularity suggests malignancy [^115hmhnh].
- **Calcifications**: Microcalcifications are suspicious for metastatic nodes, particularly from thyroid carcinoma [^112wzCgR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **comprehensive assessment** of cervical lymph nodes, integrating size with morphological features and clinical context [^114Vdny4]. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) recommends documenting node size, location, and suspicious features, and performing ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for nodes ≥ 8–10 mm with suspicious features [^114Vdny4].

---

## Conclusion

Normal cervical lymph nodes typically measure **≤ 10 mm in short-axis diameter**, with level II nodes allowed up to **15 mm**. Size alone is insufficient for diagnosis; **shape, hilum, and vascularity** must also be assessed to guide management [^112hgBN3].

### Uterine cervical carcinoma after therapy: CT and MR imaging findings [^1165X93p]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Cervical carcinoma is one of the most frequent causes of death in women. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the primary modalities for follow-up of treated cervical carcinoma. A normal vaginal cuff after hysterectomy appears as a smooth, low-signal-intensity muscular wall on T2-weighted MR images. Early (2–3 months after treatment) and significant decreases in the signal intensity and volume of the tumor at MR imaging indicate a good response to radiation therapy. Sites of recurrence are the pelvis, lymph nodes, and distant sites. Pelvic recurrence appears as a heterogeneously enhancing mass at contrast material-enhanced CT and often appears as a heterogeneous, high-signal-intensity mass at T2-weighted MR imaging. Lymph node recurrence ranges from scattered, minimally enlarged nodes to large, conglomerate nodal masses. Determination of neoplastic infiltration of lymph nodes is based on size; most researchers consider nodes greater than 1 cm in short-axis diameter to be metastatic. Distant metastases are usually due to recurrent disease and occur in the abdomen, thorax, and bone. Knowledge of the normal therapeutic changes and the spectrum of recurrent tumor in patients with cervical carcinoma is important for accurate interpretation of follow-up CT and MR images.

### Vascularity and grey-scale sonographic features of normal cervical lymph nodes: variations with nodal size [^112D6z4E]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Aim

This study was undertaken to investigate variations in the vascularity and grey-scale sonographic features of cervical lymph nodes with their size.

Materials and Methods

High resolution grey-scale sonography and power Doppler sonography were performed in 1133 cervical nodes in 109 volunteers who had a sonographic examination of the neck. Standardized parameters were used in power Doppler sonography.

Results

About 90% of lymph nodes with a maximum transverse diameter greater than 5 mm showed vascularity and an echogenic hilus. Smaller nodes were less likely to show vascularity and an echogenic hilus. As the size of the lymph nodes increased, the intranodal blood flow velocity increased significantly (P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant variation in the vascular resistance(P > 0.05).

Conclusions

The findings provide a baseline for grey-scale and power Doppler sonography of normal cervical lymph nodes. Sonologists will find varying vascularity and grey-scale appearances when encountering nodes of different sizes. Ying, M.et al. (2001). Clinical Radiology, 56, 416–419.

Cervical lymph node metastases in differentiated thyroid carcinoma — Cervical lymph node metastases occur in 20%–50% of patients, with micrometastases (< 2 mm) that may approach 90%; preoperative US identifies suspicious cervical adenopathy in 20%–31% of cases and may alter surgical approach in as many as 20% of patients, though preoperative US identifies only half of the lymph nodes found at surgery. Sonographic features suggestive of metastatic lymph nodes include enlargement, loss of the fatty hilum, a rounded rather than oval shape, hyperechogenicity, cystic change, calcifications, and peripheral vascularity. Confirmation of malignancy uses US-guided FNA for cytology and/or Tg washout, and a Tg concentration < 1 ng/mL is reassuring.

### A novel diagnostic criterion for lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer using multi-detector computed tomography [^115Vo4AZ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The sensitivity of the current 10mm cut-off diameter that is used to diagnose lymph node (LN) metastasis is too low. This is the first study to develop a new criterion to diagnose LN metastasis in a region-by-region manner using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT).

Methods

1) The short-axis diameter of the LNs in MDCT images from 1-mm slices obtained immediately prior to surgery was compared with the pathological diagnosis in 78 uterine cervical cancer patients undergoing primary surgery. For the region-by-region analysis, we divided para-aortic and pelvic spaces into 13 regions. 2) In 28 cases in which patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by surgery, we compared MDCT images before and after NAC.

Results

1) The optimal cut-off in the region-by-region analysis was 5mm, yielding 71% sensitivity and 79% specificity. 2) NAC significantly decreased LN size (p < 0.0001). NAC decreased the number of swollen LN regions (> 5mm) from 51% (81/158) to 26% (41/158).

Conclusions

The new criterion developed using MDCT could be effective for accurately assessing LN status. It also facilitates the assessment of NAC efficacy regarding the eradication of LN metastases.

### RECIST 1.1 and lesion selection: how to deal with ambiguity at baseline? [^116V56Ud]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Equivocal nodal lesions

Nodal lesions need to be discussed independently. In version 1.1 of the guidelines drafted by the RECIST workgroup, it was decided to set a size limit of 10 mm in the short axis for "pathological" lymph-nodes. The risk of selecting a non-malignant lymph-node within the initial pool of lesions differs between targets and non-targets.
Equivocal lymph nodes as Targets

The measurability threshold of these pathological nodes is specifically set higher (i.e. 15 mm vs 10 mm for non-nodal) which greatly limits the overlap range with a physiological lymph node even if the risk is not null.

Moreover, for lymph nodes, it can be noted that if they prove to be reactive (i.e. without tumor cells), there is a greater chance of their being inflamed in reaction to the cancer. In this case, their evolution should follow the course of the disease without distorting the response.
Equivocal lymph nodes as Non-Targets

Unfortunately, what is valid for measurable nodes is not valid for nodes in the non-measurable category (i.e. 10–15 mm). Indeed, the 10 mm size criterion used to characterize a "pathological" lymph node is not highly specific and this choice is very debatable. It is not uncommon to find chronic centimetric lymph nodes in smokers at mediastinal level (Fig. 1 d). Conversely, in the neck, a necrotic subcentimetric lymph node is unequivocally specific in ENT carcinomas.

The 10–15 mm lymph nodes are then at high risk of being classified as non-malignant NTL (in the absence of other criteria such as shape, extra-nodal extension signs and density).

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping — detection performance and surgical management emphasize that best detection and mapping results are in tumors of less than 2 cm diameter, and adherence to the SLN mapping algorithm is important; surgeons should perform side-specific nodal dissection in any cases of failed mapping and remove all suspicious or grossly enlarged nodes regardless of SLN mapping.

Head and neck ultrasound — lymph node malignancy assessment states that no single sonographic characteristic defines nodal malignancy, and multiple features are assessed; features concerning for malignancy include cystic degeneration of all or part of the node, large dimensions, a rounded appearance with nearly equal transverse, anteroposterior, and longitudinal measurements, microcalcifications, irregular margins, cortical thickening, and peripheral or transnodal vascularity on power Doppler imaging, whereas inflammatory nodes may be quite large but retain their fatty hilum and associated axial vascularity on Doppler imaging.

### Normal head and neck lymph nodes in the paediatric population [^117Azxzs]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine the normal range of head and neck lymph nodes in a paediatric population.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was undertaken of 200 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in patients aged between 5 months to 16 years. Exclusion criteria included possible causes for lymphadenopathy. Studies were reported previously as normal. Eight regions were assessed for the presence of nodes, short and long axis of the largest node measured, and the ratio was calculated.

Results

Most commonly identifiable nodes were the deep cervical, submandibular, and posterior cervical in 100%, 99.5%, and 92.5% of studies. In the long axis, the three largest were the submandibular, deep, and posterior cervical with mean values of 19.7, 18.1, and 15.4 mm, respectively. For the S/L ratio, the three with the most oval shape were the pre-auricular, occipital, and submental with ratios of 0.64, 0.63, and 0.6, respectively. A positive correlation between the occipital and deep cervical lymph node groups with age was found to be stronger than the rest of localisations.

Conclusion

This study characterises the normal distribution, size, and shape of head and neck lymph nodes in a healthy paediatric population, demonstrating that rounder and larger lymph nodes may be a normal finding, depending on their location and patient age.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^115RC42K]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — criteria for reoperation versus surveillance in nodal recurrence: Prior guidance used size thresholds whereby if a metastatic lymph node was > 8 mm in the smallest dimension in the central neck or > 10 mm in the lateral neck, reoperation was preferred over continued monitoring. In a retrospective study of 130 reoperated patients, central compartment lymph nodes measuring ≥ 15 mm represented an independent risk factor for biochemical incompleteness, and individuals grouped by disease < 10 mm versus 10–15 mm did not differ. Disease > 15 mm was associated with higher recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement and a higher rate of temporary, but not permanent, vocal cord paresis. Multiple non-size factors should be considered, including proximity of metastatic lymph nodes to adjacent vital structures and the functional status of the vocal cords. Appropriately selected and counseled patients can be monitored via serial clinical and radiographical monitoring, with surgery or other "rescue" interventions if progression is observed; if disease remains stable, monitoring can continue. Bulky and/or invasive recurrent disease is generally best treated with surgery, and decisions about monitoring versus intervention should use shared decision-making with the patient and include an experienced multidisciplinary team.

### The prognostic significance of nodal metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma can be stratified based on the size and number of metastatic lymph nodes, as well as the presence of extranodal extension [^1114zw41]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasound and prophylactic dissections have facilitated identification of small-volume cervical lymph node (LN) metastases in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Since most staging systems do not stratify risk based on size or number of LN metastases, even a single-microscopic LN metastasis can upstage a patient with low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PMC) to an intermediate risk of recurrence in the American Thyroid Association (ATA) system and to an increased risk of death in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (stage III if the metastatic node is in the central neck or stage IVA if the microscopic LN metastasis is identified in the lateral neck). Such microscopic upstaging may lead to potentially unnecessary or additional treatments and follow-up studies. The goal of this review is to determine if the literature supports the concept that specific characteristics (clinically apparent size, number, and extranodal extension) of LN metastases can be used to stratify the risk of recurrence in PTC.

Summary

In patients with pathological proven cervical LN metastases (pathological N1 disease; pN1), the median risk of loco-regional LN recurrence varies markedly by clinical staging, with recurrence rates for patients who are initially clinically N0 (clinical N0 disease; cN0) of 2% (range 0%-9%) versus rates of recurrence for patients who are initially clinically N-positive (clinical N1 disease; cN1) of 22% (range 10%-42%). Furthermore, the median risk of recurrence in pN1 patients varies markedly by the number of positive nodes, < 5 nodes (4%, range 3%-8%) vs. > 5 nodes (19%, range 7%-21%). Additionally, the presence of extranodal extension was associated with a median risk of recurrence of 24% (range 15%-32%) and possibly a worse disease-specific survival.

Conclusion

Our previous paradigm assigned the same magnitude of risk for all patients with N1 disease. However, small-volume subclinical microscopic N1 disease clearly conveys a much smaller risk of recurrence than large-volume, macroscopic clinically apparent loco-regional metastases. Armed with this information, clinicians will be better able to tailor initial treatment and follow-up recommendations. Implications of N1 stratification for PTC into small-volume microscopic disease versus clinically apparent macroscopic disease importantly relate to issues of prophylactic neck dissection utility, need for pathologic nodal size description, and suggest potential modifications to the AJCC TNM (tumor, nodal disease, and distant metastasis) and ATA risk recurrence staging systems.

### The adult neck mass… [^115WEk1y]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Lymph nodes are located throughout the head and neck region and are the most common sites of neck masses. Fixed, firm, or matted lymph nodes and nodes larger than 1. 5 cm require further evaluation. Computed tomographic scanning can usually demonstrate cystic masses medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the hyoid bone in the neck. Treatment is complete surgical excision, with preparation and examination of frozen sections to exclude malignancy. Fine-needle aspiration and biopsy should be performed before excision because of the possibility of cystic metastases from squamous cell carcinoma within Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. 4 Other congenital anomalies of the lateral neck include cystic hygromas and dermoids.

Inflammation Lymph node groups in the neck include the submandibular nodes within the submandibular triangle, the jugular chain of nodes located along the internal jugular vein, and the posterior-triangle nodes located between the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius musculature. Inflammatory lymphadenopathy is typically self-limited and resolves spontaneously over a period of weeks. Chronic sialadenitis as a result of salivary stones or duct stenosis can result in gland hypertrophy and fibrosis. 8 Chronic inflammation may result in a mass within the submandibular or parotid glands. Treatment is usually conservative unless pain is severe enough to justify surgical excision. Cervical adenitis is probably the most common cause of an inflammatory mass in the neck. This condition is characterized by painful enlargement of normal lymph nodes in response to infection or inflammation.
9. Thyroid and salivary gland nodules should undergo fine-needle aspiration and biopsy.

This diagnostic procedure should also be performed when a neck mass persists beyond four to six weeks. In experienced hands, the sensitivity and specificity of fine-needle aspiration and biopsy exceed 90 percent. 33 Local recurrences have been reported following stereotactic core-needle biopsy of solid tumors, including breast, liver, colon, pancreas, and lung cancers. Biopsy should be considered for neck masses with progressive growth, location within the supraclavicular fossa, or size greater than 3 cm. Biopsy also should be considered if a patient with a neck mass develops symptoms associated with lymphoma. Frozen-section examination of the mass followed by neck dissection should be performed if the mass proves to be metastatic carcinoma.

### What is the role of imaging at primary diagnostic work-up in uterine cervical cancer? [^115WyRS1]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Imaging at Primary Staging

Most centers in high-income countries routinely employ diagnostic imaging at primary work-up in cervical cancer. Accordingly, the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) guidelines for cervical cancer recommend pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest radiography and/or chest/abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT), or whole-body positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) in the primary diagnostic work-up to assess local tumor extent and metastatic spread. Which imaging modality each individual patient undergoes is typically guided by putative FIGO stage, perceived risk of metastatic disease, and local access to the different imaging modalities.

For assessment of local tumor extension, MRI has long been considered the imaging method of choice providing exquisite soft tissue resolution allowing an accurate assessment of tumor size, localization, and local infiltration as well as pelvic lymph node enlargement. Transrectal ultrasound (TRS) or transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) may also provide detailed and accurate information on local tumor extent when performed by ultrasound-trained gynecologists.

For the assessment of pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases and for the detection of distant metastases in locally advanced cervical cancer, MRI and CT have been widely used. However, both MRI and CT have low sensitivities for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes, whereas PET-CT reportedly demonstrates better sensitivity. This may be related to the size criterion typically employed to diagnose metastatic lymph nodes at CT and MRI, thus by definition missing the smaller metastases, and to the fact that CT and MRI are inferior to PET-CT for differentiation between metastatic enlarged nodes and hyperplastic enlarged nodes. However, PET-CT also yields low sensitivity for diagnosing small/microscopic metastases. Thus, negative imaging findings for lymph node metastases based on any imaging modality do not rule out occult lymph node metastases in cervical cancer. This is clearly illustrated by a recent randomized trial reporting significant rate of upstaging (33%) after surgical staging (including paraaortic lymph node dissection) compared to clinical/radiological stage, in locally advanced cervical cancer patients (FIGO stage 2B-4). These limitations in diagnosing paraaortic lymph node metastases preoperatively are also taken into account in the ESGO-ESTRO-ESP cervical cancer guidelines (2018), which recommend surgical staging, consisting of paraaortic lymph node dissection in locally advanced cervical cancer also in patients with negative paraaortic lymph nodes on imaging.

### Imaging of lymphadenopathy in the neck [^111HVVax]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Imaging is playing a major role in the assessment of cervical lymphadenopathy. In infectious disease, the assessment of abscess formation and the relation of the abscess to surrounding vital structures is crucial for its management. In head and neck malignancies, imaging can be helpful for staging. Imaging of the neck for the assessment of nodal metastases can be used to detect occult metastases or to assess operability of palpable metastases. The detection of small occult metastases has limitations, as micrometastases cannot be depicted; however, imaging can fulfill a role in diminishing the risk of occult metastases, and thus influence management. For this purpose a very sensitive technique is necessary. The currently used radiological criteria are not sensitive enough to accomplish enough reduction of the risk of occult metastases; therefore, more sensitive CT and MRI criteria, but especially ultrasound-guided aspiration, should be employed to assess the clinically negative neck.

### Sonography of neck lymph nodes. part II: abnormal lymph nodes [^1163EA5X]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Assessment of cervical lymph nodes is essential for patients with head and neck carcinomas, and ultrasound is a useful imaging technique. Sonographic features that help distinguish between the causes of neck lymphadenopathy, including grey scale and Doppler features, are discussed. In addition to the distribution and location of nodes, the useful grey-scale features are: size, shape, internal architecture, intranodal necrosis, absence of hilar structure and calcification. The useful Doppler features are: distribution of vascularity and intranodal resistance. Ancillary features such as oedema of soft tissue and nodal matting are particularly helpful to identify tuberculous nodes.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^117HJQms]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines and literature are inconsistent in terms of cut-off values for normal cervical lymph node sizes. None of them provides guidelines specifically for children. Based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), axial short-axis diameters should not exceed 10 mm, whereas the Lugano criteria state that axial long-axis diameter can be up to 15 mm without being malignant. However, these guidelines are specifically for malignant diseases and might therefore be inappropriate for distinguishing between normal and abnormal when looking at other causes (e.g. infectious disease). Other authors recommend a cut-off point of 15 mm in the long axis (all imaging planes) for Levels I–III and 10 mm for Levels IV–VI or a short axial axis cut-off of 11 mm for Levels II and III and 10 mm for all other levels. For ultrasound, a short-axis upper limit of 10 mm is generally used, as well. In our clinical practise a cut-off point of 10 mm in short-axis diameter in the axial plane is considered the upper limit for all levels except Level II, where 15 mm is used. With these size limits, four lymph nodes (all in different children) would have been classified as being enlarged at our centre (3% of the included children). Although size is an important criterion in assessing lymph nodes on all imaging modalities, other factors such as shape, borders, internal architecture and enhancement characteristics are of course important, as well. This is especially relevant because interrater variability is to some extent unavoidable when assessing measurements in radiologic images. This variability should be considered, and size alone should not be used to form clinical decisions, but rather other imaging features and the clinical presentation should be taken into account as well, especially when measurements approach the clinically used cut-off points.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^113GpimA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Follow-up expectations — neck mass management: Clinicians should inform the patient about the expected time until response of the neck mass, including the return of the lymph node to normal size, < 1.5 cm, and the need for clinical follow-up if the mass persists; the patient and clinician are jointly responsible to ensure that the neck mass decreases in size or that a final diagnosis is made. The nature of follow-up is at the discretion of the patient and the clinician, and follow-up may entail a revisit or telephone call with the clinician, referral to a specialist, or additional testing.

### Automated segmentation of lymph nodes on neck CT scans using deep learning [^114XThts]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In current clinical practice, evaluation of lymph nodes on CT is based on 2 dimensional measurements and various morphologic criteria evaluated by experts. Despite significant advances in lymph node evaluation and classification, expert classification and discrimination of abnormal from normal lymph nodes are imperfect, and the accuracy can be even less when interpretation is performed by radiologists not subspecialized in head and neck imaging. In particular, detection of early nodal metastases in small lymph nodes measuring less than 1 cm remains a significant challenge. As a result, patients having mucosal cancers at certain high-risk sites with greater than 15–20% risk of associated nodal metastases routinely undergo neck dissections, even if this could result in overtreatment of potentially up to 60–70% of patients. Even though functional metabolic techniques such as PET scans can increase sensitivity for detection of early nodal metastases, the sensitivity is still not sufficient for precluding elective neck dissections. In addition to limitations in detection of early metastatic nodal spread, current approaches for evaluating lymph nodes in the clinical setting may not enable ready discrimination of the type of pathology involving a lymph node in the absence of a clear primary tumor or other known or identifiable primary etiology.

In addition to a general interest in semi-automation and augmentation of image analysis tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic radiology, there has been a specific interest in using different radiomic or computer vision approaches, including deep learning, for improving accuracy of detection and classification of lymph nodes. However, particularly because of the small size of lymph nodes, to be successful, most of the current approaches are contingent first on object (lymph node) identification and segmentation. Automation of these steps would also be a prerequisite for any such tool to be seamlessly integrated into the busy clinical workflow for adoption in clinical practice to impact patient care. Therefore, development of robust, automated, or semi-automated nodal detection and segmentation tools is essential and an important barrier that needs to be overcome in order to effectively deploy these techniques into clinical practice. Automated deep learning segmentation of lymph nodes is uniquely challenging because of the typically small node size occupying a small percentage of pixels on a given scan. This is particularly the case for those nodes where machine-assisted classification is likely to have the greatest impact — i.e. the small nodes measuring less than 1 cm where expert evaluation is least accurate. Outside of diagnostic radiology, organ segmentation is routinely performed in radiation oncology where automated or semi-automated approaches of this variation prone, time-consuming task also has great potential for efficiency and reduced variability.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^111vhRU9]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this retrospective analysis of cervical CT examinations we provide the prevalence and three axes of diameters for lymph nodes at six cervical levels for children aged 1–17 years. We found a wide variety of maximum lymph node diameters, ranging from 1 mm to 28 mm, in these children. Results show a small to medium correlation between lymph node size and age for Levels IV to VI. This finding is in line with earlier published normal measurements of chest lymph nodes in children. Because the differences in lymph node size with increasing age are small, we believe that age-dependent normal values are not necessary in clinical practise. Additionally, we found that quite often the largest diameter does not correspond to the axial plane in which lymph nodes are most often measured. For cervical lymph nodes it can be concluded that their alignment is often vertical for Levels II, III and V in the majority of nodes. This could be explained by their close proximity to other vertically aligned anatomical structures. Therefore, long- and short-axis diameters measured in the axial plane are likely to be shorter than those measured in the coronal plane. Applying the guidelines for lymph node size to the coronal plane, and possibly the sagittal plane, as well, might therefore lead to different diagnoses of enlarged cervical lymph nodes. This corresponds with an earlier publication in which measurements in all three imaging planes were compared.

### Importance of molecular analysis in detecting cervical lymph node metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [^117BWZPo]. Head & Neck (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the impact of nodal status on treatment and survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, accurate staging of cervical lymph nodes is critical. This article explores the value of molecular analyses in the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis.

Methods

A review of the literature was carried out and combined with our own experience regarding the role of molecular analyses in detecting cervical lymph node metastasis.

Results

Few studies have demonstrated the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of molecular analysis in detecting tumor cells in lymph nodes. Nodal staging was improved by the use of molecular techniques; when compared with histopathologic examination, however, the small sample size of these studies did not allow definitive conclusions.

Conclusions

Molecular analysis is exquisitely sensitive in detecting very small cancer deposits within lymph nodes. It provides an oncologic basis that may be used to guide therapy and influence outcomes. It should be recommended for diagnostic use in controlled studies of patients without evidence of lymph node metastasis on routine hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. The clinical significance of these types of metastases, however, must be determined with carefully designed and controlled prospective clinical trials.

### Defining the role of modern imaging techniques in assessing lymph nodes for metastasis in cancer: evolving contribution of PET in this setting [^114jKpKk]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Accurate characterization of lymph nodes in patients with cancer and in patients who present with unexplained lymphadenopathy is of major importance for appropriate treatment planning and determination of prognosis. Size measurements are still the most frequently used method for discriminating malignant from non-malignant lymph nodes, but are insufficiently accurate. In order to improve evaluation of lymph nodes, there is a need for imaging modalities that go beyond anatomical lymph node assessment and that allow visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes at the cellular level. We review and discuss functional imaging techniques in the evaluation of lymph nodes.

The cervical lymph nodes can be affected by a variety of infectious, inflammatory, benign, and malignant pathologic conditions. Clinical history and physical examination with the complementary use of imaging is essential to accurately make a diagnosis or appropriate differential. Knowledge of cervical lymph node anatomy, drainage pathways, morphologic variations, and common nodal pathology is key to correct interpretation of cervical lymph nodes on imaging. Computed tomography (CT), MR, ultrasound, and PET/CT are complementary imaging modalities that can be used in the evaluation of cervical lymph node pathology.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound of the thyroid and extracranial head and neck [^114Vdny4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cervical lymph node ultrasound evaluation — Sonographic examination of cervical lymph nodes may be comprehensive or focused, as appropriate for the clinical question and scenario. The size and location of abnormal lymph nodes should be documented, and suspicious nodal morphology including, but not limited to, calcification, cysts/ focal echogenic areas that are unrelated to a fatty hilum, and abnormal blood flow should be documented. Round shape and absence of echogenic hilum, although reported in malignant nodes, are findings with poor specificity in thyroid cancer. Location of abnormal lymph node(s) should be documented with annotations and/or enough visual information to describe the location according to the image-based nodal classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery, or in a fashion that allows the referring clinician to convert the location of abnormal nodes to that system. Node evaluation should be performed at centers with experienced personnel, and lymph node size varies with nodal compartment with node size often less important in malignancy assessment than nodal morphology. Enlarged cervical nodes can be seen in lymphoma and other malignancies but are often reactive and are seen in acute and chronic infections and inflammatory disease processes such as postviral syndromes and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In the pediatric population, cervical lymph node size, echotexture, vascularity, and potential nodal suppuration or abscess-formation evaluation are important in the evaluation of acute lymphadenitis.

Conclusion

When evaluating cervical CT examinations in children, lymph node alignment might not correspond to the axial plane. In the majority of children, regardless of age, the axial short-axis diameter of lymph nodes is < 15 mm for Level II lymph nodes and < 10 mm for lymph nodes at all other cervical levels.

### Radiation therapy for cervical cancer: executive summary of an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^1148qvCE]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASTRO cervical cancer guideline — IMRT nodal boost dosing and technique state that IMRT may be used to boost selective sites of nodal involvement, with dose dependent on node size; generally, between 5500 to 6500 cGy is delivered to involved nodes based on size, location, contribution from brachytherapy, and dose per fraction. This may be performed with either a sequential or an integrated boost technique as long as normal tissue constraints are met, especially for small bowel and duodenum. A sequential technique allows replanning to a smaller nodal volume after 4500 cGy with homogeneity of dose across the node, whereas a simultaneous integrated boost results in heterogeneity of dose across the node and is therefore better suited for small nodes that will not change shape or size dramatically during treatment.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^1124wnnS]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy refers to lymph nodes that are abnormal in size or consistency. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes, and epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm, are considered abnormal. Hard or matted lymph nodes may suggest malignancy or infection. In primary care practice, the annual incidence of unexplained lymphadenopathy is 0. 6%. Physical Examination Overall state of health and height and weight measurements may help identify signs of chronic disease, especially in children. NODAL CHARACTER AND SIZE The quality and size of lymph nodes should be assessed. Lymph node qualities include warmth, overlying erythema, tenderness, mobility, fluctuance, and consistency. Shotty lymphadenopathy is the presence of multiple small lymph nodes that feel like "buck shots" under the skin. 8 This usually implies reactive lymphadenopathy from viral infection.

A painless, hard, irregular mass or a firm, rubbery lesion that is immobile or fixed may represent a malignancy, although in general, qualitative characteristics are unable to reliably predict malignancy. Painful or tender lymphadenopathy is nonspecific and may represent possible inflammation caused by infection, but it can also be the result of hemorrhage into a node or necrosis. 3 No specific nodal size is indicative of malignancy.
3. 9 Infection is a common cause of head and cervical lymphadenopathy. In children, acute and self-limiting viral illnesses are the most common etiologies of lymphadenopathy. 2 Inflamed cervical nodes that progress quickly to fluctuation are typically caused by staphylococcal and streptococcal infections and require antibiotic therapy with occasional incision and drainage. INGUINAL Inguinal lymphadenopathy, with nodes up to 2 cm in diameter, is present in many healthy adults.

It is more common in those who walk outdoors barefoot, especially in tropical regions. Radiologic evaluation with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasonography may help to characterize lymphadenopathy. The American College of Radiology recommends ultrasonography as the initial imaging choice for cervical lymphadenopathy in children up to 14 years of age and computed tomography for persons older than 14 years. 15 Based on the location of the abnormal nodes, the sensitivity of these modalities for diagnosing metastatic lymph nodes varies; therefore, history and clinical examination must guide selection. 16 If the diagnosis is still uncertain, biopsy is recommended.

### Gray scale and power Doppler sonography of normal cervical lymph nodes: comparison between Chinese and white subjects [^114CBusp]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the racial difference in gray scale and power Doppler sonography of cervical lymph nodes between white and Chinese subjects.

Methods

Twenty healthy white subjects and 20 healthy Chinese subjects had sonographic examination of the neck. They were age and sex matched. Lymph nodes were evaluated for their number, size, site, echogenic hilus, vascular pattern, degree of vascularity, blood flow velocity, and vascular resistance.

Results

A total of 184 lymph nodes were detected in the 20 white subjects, and 196 lymph nodes were found in the 20 Chinese subjects. There were no significant differences in the number, size, and distribution of the lymph nodes between the 2 populations. One hundred ninety-six region- and size-matched lymph nodes were selected from the 2 groups of subjects (98 nodes from each group) for evaluation of echogenic hilus, vascular pattern, degree of vascularity, blood flow velocity, and vascular resistance. There was no significant difference in the gray scale and vascular features of cervical nodes between white and Chinese subjects.

Conclusions

There is no significant racial difference in the gray scale appearance of cervical lymph nodes. Unlike some other body regions, there is no significant vascular difference between white and Chinese populations. Results on power Doppler and gray scale sonographic assessment of cervical lymphadenopathy reported in previous studies may be applicable in both populations.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^113AjyAU]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are a couple of limitations to our study that need to be addressed. It would have been preferable to prospectively perform the CT examinations. However, it is not ethically desirable to expose healthy children to ionizing radiation to obtain normal measurements for cervical lymph nodes. Therefore, we used CT scans made in an emergency setting after high-energy trauma to study normal dimensions of lymph nodes. It is our belief that these children form the best available sample of a healthy population of children. Furthermore, it is unlikely that cervical lymph nodes would increase in size minutes to hours after trauma, which was the timeframe in which the scans were made. For some ages the sample size was relatively small, but we were still able to provide normative data for all ages. It should be noted, however, that maximum sizes can be biased by the small sample sizes. Last, the measurements were performed by a doctoral student (S.S.) with limited experience. This limitation was overcome by a an interobserver analysis for a subset of 20 patients with an experienced paediatric radiologist (A.S.L.), and very good interrater reliability was shown.

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^113XakQL]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

AIUM practice guideline — lymph nodes ultrasound specifies that indications for an ultrasound examination of enlarged cervical lymph nodes include determination of likely inflammation from metastatic malignant lymph nodes; determination of a lymph node from another mass lesion such as a cyst, schwannoma, paraganglioma, lipoma, or parathyroid adenoma; determination of possible lymphomatous node(s); determination of the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy at specific levels to determine the required type of neck dissection; determination of the specific level of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma within lymph node(s) to assist in defining the primary source; fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology; and core sampling for lymphoma. A mass identified on physical examination is well suited to subsequent sonographic evaluation, lymph nodes are examined initially with grayscale ultrasound imaging, and if a focused examination is performed, a regional or comprehensive ultrasound inspection of other lymph node levels is usually required. If a primary malignant lesion in the aerodigestive tract or thyroid gland is identified on physical examination, ultrasound may be the first-line imaging modality used, allowing identification of other nodes that may not be palpable and access to cytology with ultrasound-guided FNA.

### Clinical and sonographic factors influencing diagnostic yield of ultrasound-guided core biopsy of cervical lymph nodes [^115GnZu3]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Cervical lymphadenopathy can indicate various benign or malignant conditions. While ultrasound-guided core biopsy is commonly used for diagnosis, its effectiveness can vary. Our study aimed to determine factors that affect the diagnostic yield of this procedure, potentially guiding appropriate patient referrals towards either more invasive diagnostic procedures, such as open biopsy or less intensive approaches like ongoing follow-up.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective study was conducted evaluating ultrasound-guided core biopsies performed for cervical lymphadenopathy at a single institution. Imaging features and technical details were documented. Two radiologists collected data from formal procedure reports and recorded sonographic images. Data were then correlated with histopathologic reports.

Results

The study included 136 patients with final diagnoses of lymphoproliferative disease (95 patients, 69.8%), reactive lymphadenopathy (24 patients, 17.6%), and carcinoma (17 patients, 12.5%). Twenty-four of the initial biopsies were nondiagnostic (17.6%), requiring diagnosis through surgery, follow-up, or repeated biopsy. Of the 24 nondiagnostic biopsies, 17 were eventually identified as reactive lymph nodes, and 7 harboured lymphoproliferative disease. All carcinoma cases were detected on the initial biopsy. Larger lymph node size correlated with higher diagnostic yield (P < 0.01). No correlation was found with needle gauge (P = 0.13), proximity to large vessels (P = 0.68), or overshoot potential (P = 0.26).

Conclusion

Our study results show that smaller lymph node size and the presence of a fatty hilum are correlated with reduced diagnostic yield. Patients with unfavourable characteristics should be considered for imaging surveillance, fine-needle aspiration (FNA), or an open biopsy.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and evaluation… [^111wbXA4]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The body has approximately 600 lymph nodes, but only those in the submandibular, axillary or inguinal regions may normally be palpable in healthy people. 1 Lymphadenopathy refers to nodes that are abnormal in either size, consistency or number. There are various classifications of lymphadenopathy, but a simple and clinically useful system is to classify lymphadenopathy as "generalized" if lymph nodes are enlarged in two or more noncontiguous areas or "localized" if only one area is involved. Physical Examination When lymphadenopathy is localized, the clinician should examine the region drained by the nodes for evidence of infection, skin lesions or tumors. If lymph nodes are detected, the following five characteristics should be noted and described: Size. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0. 5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than

1.

5 cm should be considered abnormal. 7, 8 Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series 10 of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm² had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm² to 2.25 cm² in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than
2.25 cm². In children, lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter were predictive of granulomatous diseases or cancer. 11 These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings. Consistency. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic.

Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term "shotty" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses.

### Management of recurrent / persistent nodal disease in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer: a critical review of the risks and benefits of surgical intervention versus active surveillance [^116qaQpH]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) recurrent or persistent nodal disease — surveillance, growth risk, and biopsy thresholds are outlined as follows: Clinical evidence suggests lymph node metastases may be followed in select circumstances to document growth before proceeding with therapeutic intervention, and small, postoperative thyroid bed nodules (defined as < 11 mm) occur in as many as a third of patients, with only a small percent (< 10%) proving malignant and even fewer progressing. Furthermore, lateral neck nodal metastases measuring less than 10 mm showed low potential for structural disease progression over a median of 3.5 years, with only 9% increased by more than 5 mm in size. These data suggest that properly selected patients can be offered a strategy for close monitoring with serial thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements and ultrasonography of suspicious cervical lymph nodes. The decision to biopsy suspicious lymph nodes or use Tg measurement in the washout from a fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy should be made based on whether the biopsy will lead to an appropriate and reasonable therapeutic intervention, with reasonable size guidelines for FNA when surgery is considered being 8 mm or greater in the central compartment and 10 mm or greater in the lateral compartment. In nearly all circumstances before surgery, confirmation of metastatic thyroid cancer should be performed through a FNA biopsy of the suspicious node for cytology and/or Tg analysis, although FNA confirmation may not always be technically possible and surgery may still be considered if imaging is particularly suspicious and thought to be beneficial.

### Lymph node imaging for thyroid cancer [^116aHzoT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical lymph nodes (LNs) in the central (level VI) and lateral (levels II-V) compartments of the neck are the most common sites of locoregional metastases associated with thyroid cancer. Prophylactic nodal dissections are uncommon in modern thyroid surgery and are not routinely performed due to concern for increased morbidity and do not offer improved survival. Therefore, a selective approach for LN dissections is increasingly important. Preoperatively, this is most frequently assessed with cervical ultrasound (US). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck can also be used for preoperative assessment. Both US and CT imaging can be used to characterise LNs in levels II-VI and their risk of malignancy based on size, morphology, and growth. US-guided fine-needle aspiration of equivocal LN with thyroglobulin (Tg) washout can also determine if a LN harbours malignancy. For postoperative surveillance after total thyroidectomy, both US and CT continue to play an important role at 6–12 months intervals. These patients may also benefit from additional biochemical data such as Tg levels in addition to LN and thyroid bed imaging. Thyroid uptake scans may also play a role in LN surveillance postoperatively for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in certain clinical contexts. Less commonly, positron emitted tomography may play a role, but is typically reserved for patients with aggressive or radioactive iodine refractory disease.

Cervical lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid cancer during surveillance — With prophylactic lateral and central neck dissections despite normal preoperative cervical lymph node sonography, up to 90% of patients with papillary cancers < 1 cm have metastatic level VI lymph nodes and up to 40% have metastatic lateral neck lymph nodes, but in the absence of these dissections this is not the observed clinical loco-regional recurrence rate and ultrasound may detect small-volume metastatic disease that may represent a stable reservoir of residual cancer. Only one study has addressed predictors of outcome and found no sonographic, pathologic, demographic, or molecular feature predicted outcome, and observational studies using standardized ultrasound protocols are required to define the magnitude and predictors of disease progression.

### Contribution of Doppler sonography blood flow information to the diagnosis of metastatic cervical nodes in patients with head and neck cancer: assessment in relation to anatomic levels of the neck [^111yoyKA]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although sonographic evaluation of cervical adenopathy by use of size criteria is effective, the sensitivity and specificity fall short of that required to make adequate judgments regarding neck dissection. Therefore, we tested whether the combined use of size criteria and Doppler sonographic findings would improve the predictive ability for metastatic cervical nodes.

Methods

We analyzed 338 histologically proved cervical lymph nodes (108 metastatic and 230 nonmetastatic) in 73 patients with head and neck cancer. The sonographic topography of the nodes was compared with dissected specimens, and their position in the neck was categorized into three levels (I, II, and III+IV). The diagnostic accuracy of sonography was evaluated by using the single criterion of short-axis diameter of the node or by the combined criteria of short-axis diameter and Doppler blood flow features (the absence or presence of normal hilar flow).

Results

As compared with the single criterion of short-axis nodal diameter, the combined criteria of nodal size and Doppler blood flow patterns increased the diagnostic accuracy of sonography at all levels in the neck. Accordingly, the best cut-off values were improved to 6, 7, and 5 mm for nodes at levels I, II, and III+IV, respectively. In addition, the combined criteria yielded high sensitivites (≥ 89%) and specificities (≥ 94%).

Conclusion

Hilar blood flow information obtained by Doppler sonography significantly improves diagnostic accuracy for the detection of nodes metastatic from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative neck imaging surveillance after primary resection states that ultrasound to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments is the preferred method of imaging surveillance for most DTC (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty evidence). If the serum Tg level after surgery is above the excellent response range (see Table 9), and/or there are Tg Ab, cervical ultrasound and/or cross-sectional imaging should be performed prior to administering RAI (Good Practice Statement). Six to 12 months following completion of initial therapy, cervical ultrasound to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments should be performed, with timing and frequency thereafter informed by the patient's risk for residual or recurrent disease and response to therapy (Good Practice Statement). Suspicious lymph nodes or lesions < 8–10 mm in shortest dimension may be followed without FNA unless they grow or threaten vital structures such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, esophagus, or great vessels (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). If cytological diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic DTC would influence treatment decisions or change management, ultrasonographically suspicious lymph nodes or lesions ≥ 8–10 mm in the shortest dimension should be assessed with FNA for cytology and measurement of Tg in the needle washout fluid (Good Practice Statement).

### Cervical lymph nodes [^112R521t]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

The lymph node staging is a very important prognostic parameter for patients with presenting with head neck cancer and is influencing the selection of the different therapeutic strategies including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of them. The accuracy of imaging techniques, such as US, MR imaging, and CT, depends on the appropriateness of radiological criteria used for diagnosing lymph node metastases. Size of nodes and evidence of necrosis are still the most important radiological criteria. However, the size shows great variability. A spherical lymph node larger than 10mm is an indicator for a malignant node, whereas an oval shape and/or a fatty hilus are more benign signs. But there are many limitations and different cut offs published in the literature, indicating that the size of a lymph node is not a reliable criteria for the assessment of lymph nodes in the head and neck region. Today new high-resolution MRI sequences and the development of specific contrast agents are offering new possibilities in the diagnostic work-up of head and neck lymph nodes. Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO's) are resulting after intravenous application in a reduction of the T2 relaxation time. This is causing a signal decrease on T2-weighted MR images in benign lymph nodes after administration of USPIO's, whereas malignant lymph nodes do not show a significant signal decrease. Some clinical studies presented already very promising results. Based on the fact, that the size evaluation of lymph nodes in the head and neck has not changed during the last decade, this paper will mainly focus on MRI with new contrast agents and new techniques as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI).

### Jugulodigastric lymph node size by age on CT in an adult cancer-free population [^114xkbDH]. Clinical Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Evaluate jugulodigastric node size in cancer-free patients.

Methods

Retrospective review of 234 neck CT angiograms was performed. Known neoplasm, inflammation or poor imaging were excluded. Maximal diameter of the largest jugulodigastric node in the axial plane bilaterally was measured.

Results

172 patients (median age = 62) were included. Jugulodigastric node size decreased with age and was statistically significant between those above and below 62years. Patients 20–30years had mean 14.4mm (7.5–20.1mm).

Conclusions

Although 15mm is considered the normal maximum long-axis size of the jugulodigastric node in cancer patients, average size in younger cancer-free patients is commonly above 15mm.

### Current concepts in lymph node imaging [^116KAgic]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The accurate identification and characterization of lymph nodes by imaging has important therapeutic and prognostic significance in patients with newly diagnosed cancers. The presence of nodal metastases limits the therapeutic options and also generally indicates worse prognosis in patients. Thus, it becomes crucial to have this information before commencing therapy. Current cross-sectional imaging modalities rely on insensitive size and morphologic criteria and, thus, lack the desired accuracy for characterizing lymph nodes. This is mainly because metastases can be present in non-enlarged lymph nodes and not all enlarged nodes are malignant. PET has overcome some of these limitations but is still constrained by current resolution limits for small nodal metastases. This has fueled the development of targeted techniques for nodal imaging and characterization as outlined in this article. In the past few years, studies have shown that these newer imaging techniques can bridge some of the limitations of existing imaging for nodal characterization and thereby provide the much-needed staging information before the initiation of therapy.

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (node-RADS): a concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^114GLvjB]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Structured reporting

To provide the best possible assessment of the nodal status of patients, radiologists are required to (a) know the purpose of the imaging study, i.e. staging at initial diagnosis, suspected recurrence or response assessment; (b) have detailed knowledge of tumor histology and stage of the primary tumor to determine the probability of nodal involvement; (c) have knowledge of the pattern of spread and the prevalence of micro- as opposed to macroscopic nodal involvement; (d) be familiar with the Node-RADS criteria for nodal involvement on MRI/CT at various anatomic sites and recognizing pitfalls in diagnosis; (e) have an idea of the accuracy of imaging observations and understand the impact of positive and negative imaging results on patient management; and (f) be familiar with new imaging methods for evaluating nodal disease including the value of PET/CT. In this context, Node-RADS is applicable to baseline staging and assessing the response to therapy. Representative cases for both applications are given in Figures 1 and 2 of the Electronic Supplementary Material.

Staging objectives

To identify the presence and extent of regional nodal metastases to assign an N-staging category.
To identify whether the extent of nodal disease will significantly alter the surgical approaches. For example, by increasing the extent of surgical exploration, or the requirement for the placement of vascular grafts.
To determine whether the presence of metastatic nodal involvement designates M-stage disease.
To identify the presence and extent of regional nodal enlargement with a view to planning biopsy.
To distinguish between nodal enlargement due to malignancy and that due to benign hyperplasia.
To acknowledge the limitation of imaging to detect microscopic disease in normal size nodes (currently possible to some extent only with MR lymphography and PET-CT).

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^115Pne4V]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One of the possible symptoms of infectious or malignant disease in children is lymphadenopathy. Large lymph nodes are a common finding in otherwise healthy children. For correct diagnosis of enlarged cervical lymph nodes on ultrasound, CT or MRI, it is important that normal short- and long-axis diameters of lymph nodes are known for all cervical levels and for all ages.

Cervical lymphadenopathy in children is widely addressed in the literature, but this is often in terms of localisation and abnormal appearance. No normal measurements or specific size criteria have been described for cervical lymphadenopathy in children and generally, the normal measurements as described for adults are applied for children as well. Lymph nodes with a short axis greater than 10 mm (mm) are usually considered abnormal; exceptions are deep cervical lymph nodes, in which a maximum diameter of 15 mm is considered within normal limits.

Although lymph nodes are typically measured in the axial plane, the growth and alignment of a lymph node might not correspond to this plane. Classification of lymphadenopathy was shown to differ among the axial, coronal and sagittal planes when applying size criteria based on the axial plane. Axial measurements were found to be slightly smaller compared to measurements in the coronal and sagittal planes.

The body size changes continuously during childhood and the occurrence of large cervical lymph nodes is common in otherwise healthy children. Reportedly, lymph nodes with a short axial axis greater than 10 mm are seen in up to 90% of children 4–8 years old. Therefore, lymph node measurements are likely to differ over time and among ages, and applying adult standard values to children of all ages might not be sufficient for correct diagnosis of lymphadenopathy. For lymph nodes in the chest this influence of age on lymph node size was already shown.

Our aim was to analyse CT examinations in children after high-energy trauma to provide normal measurements of cervical lymph nodes for the paediatric population and to determine whether lymph node size changes by anatomical location and with the child's age.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^117CDXh8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Adult neck mass — physical examination features indicating malignancy risk include size, texture, mobility, ulceration, nodal grouping, and growth. Malignant neck masses are likely to be > 1.5 cm in diameter and firm to palpation, may demonstrate reduced mobility in both longitudinal and transverse planes, and may ulcerate the overlying skin; additional findings include multiple, grouped, matted lymph nodes and continued increase in size. A healthy jugulodigastric lymph node is typically the largest of all cervical lymph nodes, with 1.5 cm being the upper limit of normal; the GDG decided that a size > 1.5 cm was a reasonable indicator of possible malignancy in any cervical location. Regarding firmness as a predictor, the GDG reported a majority opinion that 14 of 18 felt firmness is predictive of malignancy.

### Morphological MRI criteria improve the detection of lymph node metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: multivariate logistic regression analysis of MRI features of cervical lymph nodes [^1177cPgg]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The presence of cervical lymph node metastases is an important prognostic factor in patients with HNSCC as it worsens significantly the treatment outcome. The choice of management depends on the existence and extent of lymph node metastases in the neck. Therapy could consist of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combined therapy. However, all these therapies have a considerable morbidity and mortality. Therefore, treatment refinements like limitation of the field of radiation or a more selective neck dissection are necessary. MRI is one of the imaging techniques that is used to guide treatment decisions, but the ability of MRI to discriminate between lymph nodes with and without metastasis is still poor.

A commonly used criterion for the assessment of cervical lymph node involvement on MRI is the short axial diameter, and several studies have been undertaken to determine the optimal cutoff size of the short axial diameter for discrimination between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes. On MRI a commonly used size cutoff point is a short axial diameter of 10 mm, but a range varying from 9 to 15 mm has been described. The challenge for radiologists remains the detection of metastases in small lymph nodes with a short axial diameter below 10 mm, because mere use of the size criterion will result in misclassification of these nodes as normal. In this respect, according to the literature, the performance of MRI is still poor for detection of lymph node metastases, and this concerns especially the detection of metastases in small lymph nodes.

In addition to the size criterion, the use of morphological criteria might have added value to detect metastatic disease in lymph nodes. The diagnostic value of morphological criteria has not been well evaluated in patients with HNSCC. In patients with rectal cancer, Kim et al. demonstrated that in addition to the size criterion, morphological criteria such as borders and heterogeneity could be helpful signs to predict nodal involvement.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy and additional diagnostic value of morphological criteria observed on MRI images, such as border irregularity and heterogeneity of the signal intensity on T2-weighted images and heterogeneity of enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted images.

### Quantitative vascular feature-based multimodality prediction model for multi-origin malignant cervical lymphadenopathy [^117M2w7x]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cervical lymphadenopathy is a systematic disease with multiple etiologies, including reactive hyperplasia, tuberculosis, metastasis, lymphoma, and rare entities. The risk of malignancy increases with age, and the rate of such cases is as high as nearly 75% among patients older than 40 years. Malignant cervical lymphadenopathy may originate from different primary tumors, which reflects the biological tendency of primary cancer cells from different organs to disseminate through the lymphatic vasculature. Careful vigilance is warranted given that this situation indicates an unfavorable prognosis. Currently, nodal biopsy is commonly performed to clarify the nature of cervical lymphadenopathy. However, benign cervical lymphadenopathy accounts for up to 30.7% of cases involving biopsy for suspected malignant cervical lymphadenopathy. Additionally, biopsy is an invasive procedure, with potential risks of surgical complications and healthcare service burdens. Accordingly, a trustworthy method is needed for assessing cervical lymphadenopathy before biopsy.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — Thyroid sonography and lymph node survey (Recommendation 6) states that thyroid sonography with survey of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed in all patients with known or suspected thyroid nodules (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Diagnostic thyroid/neck ultrasound (US) should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule, nodular goiter, or a radiographic abnormality suggesting an incidentally detected thyroid nodule (including CT, MRI, or 18FDG-PET uptake). US should evaluate thyroid parenchyma and gland size; nodule size, location, and characteristics; and the presence or absence of suspicious cervical lymph nodes, and the report should document three-dimensional nodule size, location, and detailed features (composition, echogenicity, margins, calcifications, shape if taller than wide, and vascularity). In patients with low serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) who have radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy suggesting nodularity, US should also be performed to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that do not require FNA and nonfunctioning nodules that meet sonographic criteria for FNA.

### American Thyroid Association statement on preoperative imaging for thyroid cancer surgery [^111jgXBe]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The success of surgery for thyroid cancer hinges on thorough and accurate preoperative imaging, which enables complete clearance of the primary tumor and affected lymph node compartments. This working group was charged by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association to examine the available literature and to review the most appropriate imaging studies for the planning of initial and revision surgery for thyroid cancer.

Summary

Ultrasound remains the most important imaging modality in the evaluation of thyroid cancer, and should be used routinely to assess both the primary tumor and all associated cervical lymph node basins preoperatively. Positive lymph nodes may be distinguished from normal nodes based upon size, shape, echogenicity, hypervascularity, loss of hilar architecture, and the presence of calcifications. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes may be useful in guiding the extent of surgery. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography with contrast or magnetic resonance imaging) may be considered in select circumstances to better characterize tumor invasion and bulky, inferiorly located, or posteriorly located lymph nodes, or when ultrasound expertise is not available. The above recommendations are applicable to both initial and revision surgery. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT may be helpful in cases of recurrent cancer with positive tumor markers and negative anatomic imaging.

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (node-RADS): a concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^1117ErfR]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

Evaluation of lymph nodes for the likelihood of disease involvement is important in the context of cancer staging because nodal involvement is a powerful adverse prognostic indicator that often determines patient management, frequently distinguishing surgical candidates from those best suited for non-surgical management. In most cases, the incidence of nodal involvement increases with tumor bulk and stage and is dependent on tumor histological type and grade.

Even though numerous studies have evaluated morphologic criteria in computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US), practically there is still no consensus on which criteria should be used, although nodal size is generally accepted. Paralleling approaches to assess size include short- and long-axis diameters, as well as volumetric measurements. However, lymph node size is a poor indicator for predicting the presence of secondary malignancy. In a study focusing on mesorectal lymph nodes in rectal cancer patients, Gina Brown and colleagues showed a broad size overlap between histologically benign (2–10 mm) and malignant (3–15 mm) lymph nodes. Furthermore, using nodal size as a criterion for metastatic involvement can be confusing in the head and neck (HN) region as benign nodes have different sizes depending on patient age and on anatomic location; e.g. submandibular nodes are typically larger than lymph nodes in other neck groups (sometimes called stations/levels). The choice of the size cutoff will influence sensitivity and specificity for the detection of nodal metastases. In a HN study, Curtin and colleagues showed that a size cutoff of 10 mm in the largest axial nodal diameter results in a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 39%, respectively, whereas a size cutoff of 15 mm yielded corresponding values of 56% and 84%, respectively. Also, there is no consensus on whether lymph nodes should be measured in the axial or craniocaudal dimensions.

### Morphological MRI criteria improve the detection of lymph node metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: multivariate logistic regression analysis of MRI features of cervical lymph nodes [^114hi4Z6]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The principal finding of this study was that in addition to the size criterion, new criteria, such as border irregularity and heterogeneity on T2-weighted images, result in a better diagnostic performance of MRI for the detection of cervical lymph node metastases in HNSCC.

Accurate assessment of cervical lymph node metastases in HNSCC is important regarding prognosis and choice of management. Detection of lymph node metastases is usually based on the short axial diameter as size criterion. However, many studies have shown that the size criterion alone was not accurate enough as predictor for lymph node metastasis. Sensitivity is poor when the commonly chosen cutoff value of 10 mm is used, and although use of a lower cutoff value, as proposed by van den Brekel et al. results in higher sensitivity, lower cutoff values are associated with low specificity. We evaluated in this study the effect on sensitivity and specificity when lowering the cutoff point from 10 to 7 mm in short axial diameter; sensitivity raised from 43% to 79%, but the associated specificity expectedly lowered from 92% to 64%. However, the corresponding diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) did not differ significantly (DOR = 8.16 with 95% CI 4.09–16.3 versus DOR = 6.43 with 95% CI 3.38–12.23). Another assessment of lymph node dimensions is the measurement of ratios of maximum longitudinal to maximum short axial diameter (l/s ratio). A ratio less than 2, like in round lymph nodes versus elliptical lymph nodes, is indicative of metastatic disease, but this is related to enlarged lymph nodes. Because in our presented series 82% of all assessed lymph nodes were not enlarged – showing short axial diameters less than 10 mm – we used in this study the 10-mm short axial diameter as cutoff point.

### Lymphatic system of the head and neck [^112JmWQG]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An intimate knowledge of the lymphatic drainage of the head and neck is needed by the clinician examining and diagnosing patients with lesion of this region. It is considered that approximately 150 to 300 lymph nodes are located in the neck region. The classification of cervical lymph nodes by Rouvière has long been most widely referenced in textbooks and articles because it covers most of the lymph nodes of the head and neck region. Anatomical review of the lymphatic system of the head and neck helps surgeons understand and treat the patients who have any cancers and cancer metastasis in and around the head and neck regions. Regardless, comprehensive review of the lymphatic system of the head and neck has been rarely discussed. This paper details the anatomy of the lymphatics of these regions by reviewing related publications, books, official reports from the academic society and also describes the clinical manifestations and levels used in staging of the various lymph nodes with illustrations and computed tomographic images.

### Automated segmentation of lymph nodes on neck CT scans using deep learning [^113vr4s3]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Early detection and accurate classification of metastatic pathologic lymph nodes are essential for optimal staging and management of patients with HNSCC. In general, radiologist experts with head and neck expertise can discriminate normal from abnormal lymph nodes with a high degree of accuracy for nodes larger than 1 cm, although the performance may drop for radiologists who are less familiar or not subspecialty trained in head and neck radiology. On the other hand, for smaller nodes measuring less than 1 cm, the ability of experts in identifying early pathologic lymph nodes decreases, with significant patient care implications. Pilot studies using radiomics and AI suggest that these approaches may be to enhance diagnosis and augment the expert interpretation, potentially enabling identification of early nodal metastases that is undetectable by the naked human eye. However, these approaches typically require segmentation of target lymph nodes prior to classification, a task that would be prohibitively time consuming and impractical in clinical practice. An approach enabling automatic detection and segmentation of small objects such as lymph nodes has unique challenges but if solved has applications beyond lymph nodes in the neck, including to other body areas. The aim of this study was to address this initial, fundamental step. To this aim, we developed and assessed a novel deep convolutional neural network algorithm for automatically segmenting cervical lymph nodes, with a good performance resulting in a Dice score of 0.8084 considering the complexity of the task.

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (node-RADS): a concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^117Rqmwd]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale and discussion of the system

Overview and general considerations

The evaluation of a lymph node using the Node-RADS scheme results in an assessment category scored between 1 and 5, which reflects the level of suspicion for involvement by malignancy: "1 — very low"; "2 — low"; "3 — equivocal"; "4 — high"; "5 — very high". For this purpose, the interpreting radiologist is guided through a three-level flowchart (Fig. 1). Levels 1 and 2 address the two principle imaging criteria of "size" and "configuration". Level 3 provides the resulting Node-RADS assessment score. Categories, definitions, and features of the respective criteria are also given in Fig. 1.

### Unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy in children: predictive factors for malignancy [^117XQKyC]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine clinical factors that are able to predict the likelihood of malignancy of unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy in children.

Methods

The data of 175 cases with unexplained cervical lymphadenopathy, including sex, age, fever, number of involved regions, and location and size of the largest node, were collected. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to find out the optimal parameter for size of the largest node. Logistic regression was applied to determine independent predictors for malignancy.

Results

On the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis, the ratio of maximal width to maximal length (ratio) was confirmed as the optimal parameter of size for malignancy prediction, and its threshold, which maximized sensitivity and specificity, was 0.5. Multivariate binary logistic regression model indicated that number of involved regions (odds ratio [OR], 5.169; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.291–20.691; p = 0.020), location of the largest node (OR, 12.423; 95% CI, 3.657–42.205; p = 0.000), and ratio (OR, 52.080; 95% CI, 16.089–168.588; p = 0.000) were significant independent predictors of malignancy.

Conclusions

Higher ratio (> 0.5), multiple cervical regions of adenopathy (≥ 2), and region II or III location of the largest node are associated with malignancy. These data should be helpful to supplement clinical judgment in determining which enlarged cervical nodes harbor cancer.

### Normal size of retropharyngeal lymph nodes in children on three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging [^114ZRsaq]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Age-specific normal measurements or specific size criteria for retropharyngeal lymph nodes in children have not been defined.

Objective

We aimed to determine the normal measurements and distribution of retropharyngeal lymph nodes on three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3-D MRI) in children.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective study, we included 440 patients (213 girls) aged 0–17 years who were admitted to our center with seizures and headaches and underwent brain and neck MRI with T2-sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolution sequences. We evaluated the number, laterality, and level distribution of lateral and medial group lymph nodes according to the skull base-cervical vertebrae. For both groups, we measured the short and long diameters of the largest lymph node in the axial plane and the craniocaudal diameter in the sagittal plane. The short/long diameter ratios and volumes were determined.

Results

In 433 cases (98%), 1,554 lateral group lymph nodes were detected. Medial group lymph nodes were less common (7%). The lateral group was mostly bilateral, while the medial group was unilateral. Lateral group lymph nodes extended from the skull base-first cervical (C1) vertebral level to the C4, while the medial group extended from the C2 vertebral level to the C4. The mean axial short axis, axial long axis, and sagittal long axis diameters were 5.8 mm, 10.1 mm, and 15.5 mm for the lateral group and 3.8 mm, 7.6 mm, and 10.8 mm for the medial group, respectively.

Conclusion

The findings of the study show that normally retropharyngeal lymph nodes are frequently seen in children and provide valuable information for lateral and medial lymph nodes depending on age.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^113tWqCz]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Cervical contrast-enhanced CT images (100 kV, 70 mAs) in a 2-year-old boy. a Axial reconstruction shows a Level II lymph node (arrow) with a short-axis diameter of 8 mm and a long-axis diameter of 10 mm. b Corresponding coronal image shows the same Level II lymph node (arrow) with a long-axis diameter of 16 mm. The depicted images provide an example of the vertical alignment of lymph nodes that is often found among cervical lymph node stations

Table 4 shows the upper limits (mean + 1.96 SD) of the normal range in this paediatric population as calculated per axis and per lymph node level. For the short axial axis diameters, the upper limits of all levels show similarity with current adult guidelines (all levels except for Level II remain less than 10 mm (range 5.63–8.59 mm). For Level II, the upper limit exceeds 10 mm (11.28 mm), with adult guidelines indicating a normal range up to 15 mm. Of all the measured lymph nodes, 11 nodes had a short axial axis higher than 10 mm (1.5% of the measured lymph nodes in 10 children). Those lymph nodes were found in Levels I, II, III and V. When taking into account that for Level II lymph nodes an upper limit of 15 mm is currently used for the short axial axis cut-off point, only 4 lymph nodes would be considered enlarged (0.5%). The long axial axis was above 15 mm in 16 of the measured lymph nodes (2.1%); most of these lymph nodes were found at Level II. For the long axis in the coronal plane, lymph node sizes ranged from 1 mm to 28 mm, and a total of 33 lymph nodes (4.8%) had a diameter exceeding 15 mm. Most of them were found at Levels II and III. Figure 2 shows boxplots for all six lymph node levels. Table 5 shows Pearson correlation coefficients for age and lymph node size. Small to medium significant correlations were seen for Levels IV through VI in all three axes (0.19–0.47, P -values < 0.05). For Levels I through III, weak correlations were seen for the long axial axis diameter at Level I (0.20, P = 0.02) and the long coronal axis diameter at Level III (0.18, P = 0.04).

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and indications for evaluation [^112YtB8B]. Pediatrics in Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding on physical examination in the pediatric population. Although it is often physiologic, lymphadenopathy can also be associated with more serious illnesses and has many possible etiologies. A broad differential diagnosis can be narrowed with a thorough clinical history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging. The goal of this review is to provide a framework for understanding normal physiology, identify when enlarged lymph nodes may be associated with pathology, develop differential diagnoses associated with lymphadenopathy, and apply a systematic approach for diagnostics and appropriate management, with a focus on findings concerning for malignancy and the initial evaluation.

### Computed tomography in the management of cervical lymph node pathology [^117XJ11W]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Computerised tomography (CT) is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cervical pathology in head and neck carcinoma. However, different criteria used in CT analysis make the comparison of outcome studies difficult. This study compares two different CT criteria (two different lymph node sizes) for detection of cervical lymph node pathology for head and neck tumours in the same patient population. A prospective study was performed on 55 patients, with minimum T2 intraoral squamous cell carcinoma and high risk extraoral malignancies, who underwent 65 neck dissections. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of clinical palpation, CT considering lymph nodes larger than 10mm as positive and CT considering lymph nodes larger than 15 mm as positive are compared. The results are as follows: sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of clinical palpation are 86, 84 and 85%, respectively; sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CT with lymph nodes exceeding 10 mm are 95, 47 and 63%, respectively; sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CT with lymph nodes exceeding 15 mm are 86, 81 and 83%, respectively. The outcomes of the study reveal that CT evaluation of cervical lymph nodes with a cutoff value of 15 mm should be preferred to a cutoff value of 10mm in order to prevent over-treatment in cervical management of head and neck tumours. When accuracy of the results is considered, CT alone does not have an advantage over clinical palpation in this study.

### Automated segmentation of lymph nodes on neck CT scans using deep learning [^112qKrKD]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Early and accurate detection of cervical lymph nodes is essential for the optimal management and staging of patients with head and neck malignancies. Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for radiomic and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in increasing diagnostic accuracy for the detection and classification of lymph nodes, but implementation of many of these approaches in real-world clinical settings would necessitate an automated lymph node segmentation pipeline as a first step. In this study, we aim to develop a non-invasive deep learning (DL) algorithm for detecting and automatically segmenting cervical lymph nodes in 25,119 CT slices from 221 normal neck contrast-enhanced CT scans from patients without head and neck cancer. We focused on the most challenging task of segmentation of small lymph nodes, evaluated multiple architectures, and employed U-Net and our adapted spatial context network to detect and segment small lymph nodes measuring 5–10 mm. The developed algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.8084, indicating its effectiveness in detecting and segmenting cervical lymph nodes despite their small size. A segmentation framework successful in this task could represent an essential initial block for future algorithms aiming to evaluate small objects such as lymph nodes in different body parts, including small lymph nodes looking normal to the naked human eye but harboring early nodal metastases.

### It's not a cervical lymph node, it's a vein: CT and MR imaging findings in the veins of the head and neck [^113WYF6R]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

The anatomy and imaging appearances of the veins of the head and neck can vary considerably, and normal veins may mimic disease processes at computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. On unenhanced CT scans, aberrant veins may be difficult to differentiate from lymph nodes or other pathologic conditions. Even at contrast material-enhanced CT, differences in venous enhancement or the mixing of opacified with nonopacified blood can lead to confusion, particularly if the vein is focally dilated. Similarly, the size and signal intensity of head and neck veins may vary at MR imaging due to slow or turbulent flow or variable enhancement, resulting in misdiagnosis. A thorough understanding of the normal venous anatomy and common variants is necessary to properly differentiate an unopacified or focally dilated vein from lymphadenopathy or some other disease entity and can help the radiologist avoid the erroneous interpretation of findings.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^114qU4xN]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

No normal measurements or specific size criteria have been described for cervical lymph nodes in children.

Objective

To determine the normal measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on CT.

Materials and methods

We included 142 children (ages 1–17 years) who underwent cervical CT examination after high-energy trauma. We evaluated axial and coronal 2-mm reconstructions for lymph nodes at six cervical levels. For the largest lymph node at each level, we measured diameters in both the long and short axial axes and the long coronal axis.

Results

A total of 733 lymph nodes were measured in 142 children (62% boys, 38% girls). The greatest measured diameters were 14 mm for the short axis in the axial plane, 24 mm for the long axis in the axial plane and 28 mm for the long axis in the coronal plane. The Pearson correlation coefficient for age and lymph node size at Levels IV–VI was in the range of 0.19–0.47.

Conclusion

Lymph nodes with an axial short-axis diameter exceeding 15 mm for Level II and 10 mm for all other cervical levels are uncommon in otherwise healthy children.

### Measurements of cervical lymph nodes in children on computed tomography [^116JH8Uc]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Analyses of the data were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY). Lymph node size was analysed per age and lymph node station. Median measurements, interquartile range (IQR) and maximum diameters were calculated for each age group. To identify whether adult guidelines for lymph node size are applicable in children, we calculated upper limits for normal ranges (mean value + 1.96 standard deviations [SD]) per level and axis using the logarithmic transformed data; we compared those measurements to the currently used adult guidelines for lymph node size (10-mm short-axial-axis upper limit, except for deep cervical nodes, in which an upper limit of 15 mm is considered normal). After performing a log transformation to normalise the data, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between age and lymph node size. Interobserver agreement for the CT examinations evaluated by both readers was assessed using a Bland–Altman plot.

### Introducing the node reporting and data system 1.0 (node-RADS): a concept for standardized assessment of lymph nodes in cancer [^112hgBN3]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Criterion "size"

There is an ongoing debate about the setting of limits for physiologic and pathologic size of lymph nodes. Ultimately, any chosen size cutoffs depend on the desired sensitivity and specificity concerning the stage of the primary tumor and/or clinical status of patients. Many radiologists do not consider nodal size to be an absolute criterion for the assessment of likely malignant involvement. However, since the size of lymph nodes is a criterion that is widely used, and is incorporated into the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria for response assessment studies, Node-RADS divides nodal sizes into three categories: "normal", "enlarged", and "bulk".

In general, a lymph node is defined to have a "normal" size, when its short-axis diameter is < 10 mm. Node-RADS defines exceptions for normal size for inguinal nodes which could measure < 15 mm in short-axis diameter; on the other hand, Node-RADS sets a lower cutoff for specific subregions, where the normal short-axis diameter should be < 5 mm: facial, parotid, retroauricular, occipital, retropharyngeal, anterior jugular, retrocrural, cardio-phrenic, mesenteric, obturator, and mesorectal lymph nodes. A "bulk" is defined as a lymph node with the longest diameter of ≥ 30 mm measured in any dimension. Since there are no generally accepted measurements for the term "bulk", especially outside of lymphomas, we were guided by the TNM classification for head and neck cancer, where a lymph node diameter of 30 mm is the threshold for N2 (with the exception of HPV-positive oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and thyroid cancer). Lymph nodes of "enlarged" size do not meet either the definitions of the categories "normal" or "bulk" or are between 10 and 15 mm (short axis) for RECIST purposes, or show interval increases of ≥ 2 mm in short-axis diameter, if prior imaging datasets are available for comparison. The ≥ 2-mm threshold is based on a consideration regarding the spatial resolution of CT scans (512 matrix over a 40–50-cm field-of-view results in a pixel size of 0.78 to 0.98 mm). The requirement of two pixels for a reliable measurement translates into axial dimensions of ≥ 2 mm.

NCCN Thyroid carcinoma — oncocytic carcinoma, postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) use after total thyroidectomy is stratified by clinicopathologic factors. RAI not typically recommended when all of the following are present: largest primary tumor ≤ 2 cm, intrathyroidal, no vascular invasion, Clinical N0, no detectable thyroglobulin (Tg), postoperative unstimulated Tg < 1 ng/mL, and negative postoperative ultrasound, if done, with the pathway labeled "RAI not typically indicated (ONC-6)". RAI selectively recommended for the following factors: large primary tumor size, minor vascular invasion (< 4 foci), cervical lymph node metastases (millimetric central nodes), postoperative unstimulated Tg 1–10 ng/mL, and microscopic positive margins, with the pathway labeled "RAI being considered (ONC-4)". RAI recommended (if any present) for differentiated high-grade carcinoma, significant N1b disease, gross extrathyroidal extension, extensive vascular invasion (≥ 4 foci), postoperative unstimulated Tg > 10 ng/mL, or bulky or > 5 positive lymph nodes, and RAI is recommended when the combination of individual clinical factors predicts a significant risk of recurrence, distant metastases, or disease-specific mortality.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^111GsDUM]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

AJCC TNM staging for cervical lymph nodes (clinical N) in head and neck cancers applies to squamous cell carcinoma and salivary gland carcinoma of all head and neck sites except HPV-related oropharynx cancer, nasopharynx cancer, melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, and sarcoma, and includes staging of patients with an occult primary tumor and EBV-unrelated and HPV-unrelated metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy; it is specified for patients treated with primary nonsurgical treatment without a cervical lymph node dissection. N1 is defined as metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and ENE(-). N2 comprises metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm and ENE(-); or metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm and ENE(-); or in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm, ENE(-). N2a is a single ipsilateral node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm and ENE(-); N2b is multiple ipsilateral nodes, none larger than 6 cm and ENE(-); N2c is bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm and ENE(-). N3a is metastasis in a lymph node larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-); N3b is metastasis in any node(s) with clinically overt ENE(+) (ENEc). Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes, and a designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category to indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or below the lower border of the cricoid (L); clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as ENE(-) or ENE(+), and ENEc is defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature, dense tethering or fixation to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction.

### The value of advanced MRI techniques in the assessment of cervical cancer: a review [^111VX4iy]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Detection of lymph node metastases

Conventional MRI relies on the criterion of size for assessing pelvic lymph node involvement. Lymph nodes are rated as suspicious if the short axis diameter is greater 1 cm. However, given the overlap in size between metastatic, hyperplastic and normal lymph nodes and the fact that micrometastases in small lymph nodes are not uncommon, conventional MRI is limited in lymph node assessment, even when accounting for FIGO stage. The literature shows that the diagnostic accuracy of MRI is 67–95%, its sensitivity is 37–90%, and its specificity is 71–100%, even when other signs of metastatic disease, such as loss of normal lymph node architecture, rounder form, irregular borders and heterogeneous signal intensity, are considered.

DWI may represent a powerful adjunct for differentiating between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes, as it reflects differences in cellularity and histopathology between benign and malignant lymph nodes. Several studies have reported that lymph node metastases have a higher degree of diffusion restriction than normal lymph nodes, and this can be assessed quantitatively using ADC values. Choi et al. found that measuring the minimal ADC in a lymph node had greater sensitivity for detecting metastases than measuring the short-axis diameter (86% vs 55%, p < 0.001). Similarly, Liu et al. reported a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 96.5% for the detection of metastatic nodes. Yet the results in the literature are conflicting, as Rizzo et al. found no significant association between DWI parameters and the presence of lymph node metastasis. However, the authors suggested that their results might have been influenced by patient selection (early clinical stage) and small patient number. Another study reported an overlap in mean ADC values between malignant lymph nodes and hyperplastic lymph nodes, which reduced the diagnostic accuracy to 78.4%. However, the patients in that study were excluded if all of their lymph nodes had a short axis diameter under 5 mm, and this may have influenced the results. Although a meta-analysis by Shen et al. confirmed the usefulness of DWI for differentiation between benign and metastatic lymph nodes, study heterogeneity — especially regarding the lack of standard protocol for DWI — limits the comparability of these results. Further prospective studies with standardised MRI protocol may offer more evidence regarding the value of DWI for nodal detection.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^116c9kkY]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) postoperative surveillance — serum thyroglobulin (Tg), cervical ultrasound (US), and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) thresholds are described. In low- and intermediate-risk patients after total thyroidectomy, the risk of lymph node recurrence is low (< 2%) if there is an undetectable serum Tg level. One gram of DTC should increase the serum Tg by ~ 1 ng/ mL during thyroid hormone treatment and by ~ 2–10 ng/ mL during TSH stimulation. Neck ultrasound can detect involved nodes as small as 2–3 mm in diameter, but if diagnosing recurrent cancer will influence clinical decisions, then FNA biopsy for cytology and Tg measurement in the aspirated fluid generally should be performed for suspicious lymph nodes ≥ 8–10 mm in their shortest dimension, whereas small lymph nodes (≤ 10 mm in shortest dimension) can be managed expectantly. Tg measurement in the aspirated fluid should be compared with serum Tg measurement (secured on the same day, prior to the FNA) in most patients, and FNA for Tg determination is technically demanding and has not been standardized. FNA cytology alone misclassifies thyroid cancer in up to 20% of patients, and most lymph nodes in the thyroid bed that are < 6 mm in shortest dimension are seldom malignant.

### Ultrasound evaluation of persistent cervical lymph nodes in young children [^115SXVf8]. Clinical Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

To review the ultrasonographic outcomes of persistent lymph nodes, in the absence of other concerning signs or symptoms, in patients < 6 years of age.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 98 patients < 6 years old who had neck ultrasound for persistent lymph nodes at a single university hospital over a 3.5 year period between January 2016 and June 2019.

Results

There were no cases of malignant disease or serious systemic illness. Ninety-two of the 98 examinations showed normal or reactive lymph nodes. There were three sonographically indeterminate cases and two non-lymph-node structures: haemangioma and dermoid cyst. One examination reported an abnormal lymph node, which had resolved by the time of review in clinic.

Conclusion

Persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes should be investigated; however, a distinction should be made between lymph nodes that have regressed to < 1 cm but are still palpable and persistently enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes. The findings of the present study indicate that persistence of non-enlarged lymph nodes is not a predictor for malignancy. It is advised that clear guidelines are used, which state the criteria for further investigation, to promote the best use of imaging.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^111K9rf4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — occult primary cervical node evaluation emphasizes targeted history, imaging, and biopsy approach. Patients with a biopsy-proven carcinoma of a cervical lymph node require a thorough history with emphasis on tobacco exposure, prior cancer history, and ethnic descent from endemic NPC regions, and these patients require dedicated imaging of the H&N accomplished through contrast-enhanced CT imaging; an FDG-PET/CT may reveal a primary site not visible on contrast-enhanced CT imaging. For non-diagnostic necrotic lymph nodes, a core biopsy may be obtained, and open biopsy should not be performed unless the patient is prepared for definitive surgical management that may entail a neck dissection.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^117UYRb6]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative neck ultrasound and lymph node evaluation — Recommendation 7 — states that preoperative neck ultrasound to evaluate central and lateral cervical lymph nodes and assess gross extrathyroidal extension is recommended for all patients undergoing surgery for malignant cytologic or molecular findings (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of sonographically suspicious lymph nodes at least 8–10 mm in the smallest diameter should be performed to confirm malignancy if this would change management (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence). The addition of FNA thyroglobulin (Tg) washout to the evaluation of suspicious cervical lymph nodes may be performed in select preoperative patients, but interpretation may be difficult in patients with an intact thyroid gland (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Confirmation of malignancy in suspicious lymph nodes is achieved by ultrasound-guided FNA for cytology and/or measurement of Tg in the needle washout.

### Histologic diagnoses in persistently swollen cervical lymph nodes [^114Auiat]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Biopsy and histological examination of persistently enlarged cervical lymph nodes represent a major health care issue and have high impact on further clinical therapy. Tertiary health centers are faced with an increased demand for diagnostic workup to rule out malignancy. We performed a retrospective study from January 2000 to June 2008 to identify patients referred to us for diagnostic biopsy and to document the histopathological result.

Methods

Patients with a diagnostic biopsy, but neither clinical signs of head and neck cancer nor other malignancies, were identified within the records. Patient characteristics and histopathological diagnosis were retrieved.

Results

Three hundred twenty-six patients were identified (146 women, and 180 men). One hundred twenty-three patients (38%; 44 women, and 79 men) had a malignancy: 61 with metastatic disease and 62 with malignant lymphoma; the youngest was 15 years old and the oldest was 92 years old.

Conclusion

Persistently swollen cervical lymph nodes should trigger a thorough clinical examination and prompt biopsy for histopathological workup.

### American Thyroid Association consensus review and statement regarding the anatomy, terminology, and rationale for lateral neck dissection in differentiated thyroid cancer [^111EtSd2]. Thyroid (2012). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) lateral neck metastasis — risk factors and evaluation — should consider clinical features and targeted assessment. A number of important factors in the patient's history are relevant to the risk for and detection of lateral neck metastases in patients with DTC, and it is important to consider risk factors including the patient's age, gender, tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion, extra-thyroidal extension, and presence of central compartment nodal disease; younger patients and men appear to have a significantly higher risk of cervical lymph node metastasis than older patients or women. Recent identification of molecular alterations such as the presence of the BRAF mutation may be important markers to consider, but, consistent with the 2009 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, BRAF or other markers being positive alone are insufficient justification to do a prophylactic lateral neck dissection at the present time. In the setting of primary or recurrent DTC, palpable hard/firm lymph nodes should prompt a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the lateral neck by clinical and radiographic examination, and recommendation 21 suggests that preoperative high resolution ultrasound (US) examination of the contralateral thyroid lobe and cervical lymph nodes is the standard of care for all patients undergoing thyroid surgery for malignant cytology.

### Clinical and imaging assessment of cervical lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinomas [^113Jc1sA]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The goals of this study were to analyze clinical factors that affect cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) of the neck.

Methods

The study sample included 589 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for PTC. Patient age and sex, number, size, and location of tumors, lymphovascular invasion, and extrathyroidal extension were evaluated as risk factors for central and lateral LNM.

Results

Increased risk of lymph node metastasis was found for male patients, < 45 years old, with tumor size > 1 cm, lymphovascular invasion, and extrathyroidal invasion. Cancers located in the upper neck had a higher relative risk of lateral metastasis than cancers located in the lower neck. Sensitivity of both US and CT imaging was higher for lateral (70–80%) than for central (42–47%) LNM. Specificity of US and CT was high (92–97%) for both central and lateral LNM. Using central lymph node size of greater than 5 mm as an indicator of metastasis, preoperative US had 58.3% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.

Conclusions

Preoperative US and CT imaging are useful for identifying features that indicate a high risk of LNM and for determining appropriate management of PTC.

### The size of the metastatic lymph node is an independent prognostic factor for the patients with cervical cancer treated by definitive radiotherapy [^116TRjJ9]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Lymph node (LN) metastasis is a well-known prognostic factor of the cervical cancer. In the current study, the size of metastatic LN was evaluated for its significance in the patients treated with definitive radiotherapy.

Materials and Methods

LN metastasis was evaluated for the 268 consecutive patients. The short-axis diameters of the largest LN were measured on magnetic resonance images for the 155 patients with LN metastasis. All the patients were classified into three groups: the negative lymphadenopathy (group N), the small (< 15mm) lymphadenopathy (group SP), and the large (≥ 15mm) lymphadenopathy (group LP).

Results

Patients in the group LP showed significantly lower survival rates than the groups N and SP (5-year overall survival rates of 89%, 82%, and 58%, for groups N, SP, and LP, respectively, P < 0.001; 5-year disease-free survival rates of 80%, 67%, and 50%, respectively, P < 0.001). Regarding the pattern of failure, patients in the group LP showed inferior regional control rates and higher distant metastasis.

Conclusion

The current study shows that the patients with large metastatic LNs are at increased risk of dying from early distant metastasis with substantial number of combined regional failures. Adoption of more effective systemic treatment as well as high radiotherapy dose for LNs may improve cure rates for these patients.

### Abdominal lymph node size in children at computed tomography [^1118BnVh]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lymph nodes in children can be enlarged for a variety of reasons, amongst which are both malignant and infectious diseases. Lymph node size is often determined by US imaging, CT or MRI. To correctly identify enlarged lymph nodes, it is important to know normal short- and long-axis diameter sizes for various ages and lymph node stations. Until now, no specific guidelines for evaluating abdominal lymph nodes in children have been published.

The Lugano criteria for lymphomas and Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are frequently used guidelines to evaluate lymph node size. The recommended cut-off values for all lymph nodes, irrespective of location and age, are 10 mm for the short axial axis diameter (both guidelines) and 15 mm for the long axial axis diameter. In daily clinical practice, these criteria for adults are frequently used to assess abdominal lymph nodes in children as well as in adults. During infancy, body size changes continuously and, therefore, lymph node size might change during childhood. Normal measurements of abdominal lymph nodes could thus be different for each age. In the literature, both cervical and thoracic lymph node measurements in children have been reported, but no normative data on abdominal lymph node size in children are available.

The aim of this study was therefore to provide normative data on abdominal lymph node size in children at CT performed to rule out abdominal injuries after high-energy trauma and to assess whether abdominal lymph node size and age are correlated.
