## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement about discrete random variables is not true for all of them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the axioms that define a discrete random variable and its probability mass function. Then, I should verify which of the five options is a general property versus a special-case approximation. Next, I will check whether the "approximately 95% within two standard deviations" rule is universally valid or only applies under specific distributional assumptions. Finally, I will confirm that the other options are indeed always true and state the exception clearly with a concise explanation.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't jump to conclusions. A discrete random variable has a countable set of possible outcomes, each with a probability, and the probabilities must sum to 1; the expected value is defined as the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability, and the outcomes are mutually exclusive by construction of the sample space, so options C, D, and E are definitional truths for all discrete random variables [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify option B before I move on. The possible outcomes of a discrete random variable must be numerical because we need to assign probabilities and compute moments like the mean; non-numerical categories would not permit the required arithmetic, so B is also a general property of discrete random variables rather than an exception [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of option A. The statement that approximately 95% of outcomes lie within two standard deviations of the mean is a feature of the normal distribution and some other symmetric, unimodal distributions; it is not a universal truth for all discrete random variables, and it can fail badly in skewed or heavy-tailed discrete distributions where the empirical coverage at ± 2 SD can be far from 95% [^notfound].

> I will now examine concrete counterexamples to ensure I'm not overstating this. Consider a Bernoulli random variable with p = 0.5; the mean is 0.5 and the standard deviation is 0.5, so "within two standard deviations" spans from −0.5 to 1.5, which captures all outcomes, meaning the coverage is 100%, not 95%. Conversely, a highly skewed discrete distribution can have less than 95% coverage within two standard deviations, so the 95% heuristic is not guaranteed and depends on the shape of the distribution [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the other options to be certain none of them are the exception. Options C, D, and E are axiomatic for discrete random variables, and option B is part of the definition that enables probability mass functions and moment calculations; only option A rests on distributional assumptions rather than the general definition, so it is the statement that is not true for all discrete random variables [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The statement that is not true for all discrete random variables is A, because the "approximately 95% within two standard deviations" rule is a normal-approximation heuristic and does not hold universally across discrete distributions, whereas B, C, D, and E are fundamental properties of discrete random variables [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **A**. The statement "Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean" is **not true for all discrete random variables** because this is a property of the normal distribution (the empirical rule), not a general rule for discrete distributions. Discrete distributions can be skewed or have limited ranges, so the 95% within 2σ rule does not always hold. Options B, C, D, and E are **true for all discrete random variables** by definition: outcomes must be numerical, mutually exclusive, probabilities sum to 1, and the mean equals the sum of value × probability.

## Analysis of each statement

### Statement A: Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean

This is the **empirical rule**, which applies to normal distributions; it is **not a general property of discrete random variables**. Discrete distributions can be skewed or have limited ranges, so the 95% within 2σ rule does not always hold. For example, a Bernoulli(0.5) variable has mean 0.5 and SD 0.5; "within 2σ" spans −0.5 to 1.5, which includes all outcomes, so the coverage is 100%, not 95%. Thus, this statement is **false for some discrete variables**.

---

### Statement B: The possible outcomes must all be numerical

By definition, a discrete random variable has a countable set of **numerical outcomes**; non-numerical categories are not considered values of a random variable. This statement is **true**.

---

### Statement C: The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive

Outcomes of a discrete random variable are **mutually exclusive** by definition; only one outcome can occur on a given trial. This statement is **true**.

---

### Statement D: The sum of all probabilities for all possible outcomes is always 1

This is the **axiom of total probability**; the probabilities over all possible outcomes of a discrete random variable must sum to 1. This statement is **true**.

---

### Statement E: The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability

This is the **definition of expected value** for a discrete random variable: E[X] = Σ x P(X = x). This statement is **true**.

---

## Conclusion

The statement that is **not true for all discrete random variables** is **A**, because the 95% within 2σ rule is specific to normal distributions and does not generalize to all discrete distributions.

### Counterfactual reasoning underlies the learning of priors in decision making [^dbb579d7]. Neuron (2018). Low credibility.

Participants performed the task across multiple sessions (9 to 14, usually 1 session/day). They usually completed 12 blocks per session. Across days, participants completed 165, 150 and 170 blocks, respectively, for a total of 4564, 4051 and 4554 trials. Before performing the main experiment, participants were trained to discriminate the direction of random dot motion. During training, the base rate was fixed and equal to ½. Participants first performed a version of the task in which they were only required to report the motion direction (436, 432 and 936 trials per participant). During a second stage of training, they also reported their confidence, using the same numerical scale as in the main experiment (961, 288 and 384 trials per participant).

Model

We used a bounded evidence accumulation model to fit the choices and the confidence about motion direction. In the model, these reports are based on the state of accumulated motion evidence (decision variable, e) at the timethat a bound (at) is reached or when the stimulus ends. The decision variable evolves according to 1-dimensional process of Brownian motion plus deterministic drift. In small time steps, the state of the decision variable is updated based on the sum of terms representing a deterministic drift and stochastic diffusion. The drift term is given by, where c is the signed motion coherence and κ is parameter which determines the signal-to-noise ratio. The diffusion term follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of, such that the variance at(absent bounds) would equal 1. This is not a free parameter, since for any other value we can obtain an equivalent model by scaling κ and A appropriately.

The model assumes that the decision maker has access to the state of the decision variable e and the decision time. In the Bayesian model, the reports of choice and confidence are based on the posterior probability over motion direction, and the belief report is based on the posterior probability over base rate. In these expressions, d is the motion direction, B is the base rate of the block, and i is the trial number.is the tuple of all observations of e andup to trial i within a block:

The posterior over the two possible directions of motion, can be obtained by Bayes rule:Which simplifies to:where the constant of proportionality is such that the sum of the probabilities of right and left equals 1. The sum on the right side of expression 4 is over the six possible values of B.

### Congenital Chagas disease in the United States: cost savings through maternal screening [^01957670]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

METHOD

We compared the costs of maternal screening and infant testing and treatment as needed (referred to as the Screening option), with the costs of No Screening, with its consequent morbidity and mortality due to lack of treatment or late treatment, using one tree that shows the combined costs for each possible maternal–child pairing. We constructed a decision-analytic model for the United States using TreeAge software (TreeAge Software Inc. Williamstown, MA) to find the lower cost option. The method is the same whether one is evaluating a targeted or a universal screening program because costs and benefits (cost savings) are reported on an individual basis. In the Discussion, we compare the implementation costs and benefits for targeted and universal screening.

The tree comprises a decision node (No Screening or Screening), chance nodes (probabilities of maternal infection, transmission, and various degrees of injury), and terminal nodes for each outcome (sums of costs attributable to each outcome). We use a societal perspective. Each outcome represents the expected value of all economic costs based on a series of conditional probabilities for each branch.

Probabilities.

Table 1 shows the probabilities of maternal infection (prevalence among women of childbearing age), maternal transmission, conversion from indeterminate form to symptomatic form, and other risks of morbidity and mortality. Point estimates and ranges are derived from the literature indicated in the source column. For prevalence, the point estimate (0.0131) refers to the population of U.S. Hispanic women from endemic areas, which is appropriate for a model of targeted screening. The range, used in sensitivity analysis (0.0‒0.0131), includes the prevalence among all U.S. women (0.0016), and is thus appropriate for universal screening.

Table 1
Probabilities

In a decision analysis, probabilities are conditional on prior probabilities. For each category, the possibilities are exhaustive (sum to 1.0) and mutually exclusive. For example, as seen in Table 1, of persons infected with Chagas disease, 30% are estimated to have symptoms, of whom about 2/3 will have cardiac symptoms. Similarly, Table 1 indicates that 10% of infected infants are estimated to be symptomatic at birth, and the expected distribution of severity of symptoms among that 10% is given in the subsequent rows of Table 1.

### Predictable clinical benefits without evidence of synergy in trials of combination therapies with immune-checkpoint inhibitors [^a82bbe72]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The introduction of immunotherapy is one of the most important recent developments in oncology. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) directed against PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 have improved survival for many but not all types of cancer. To increase rates and durability of responses to ICIs, thousands of combination clinical trials are under way. A key motivation for these trials is the hypothesis that chemotherapies, targeted drugs, and immunotherapies themselves can enhance the activity of ICIs by increasing tumor immunogenicity or through other mechanisms. The clinical success of ICI combinations has been widely interpreted as evidence of interaction-based mechanisms, but phase III trials do not address such hypotheses. Thus, the superiority of combination ICI therapies to monotherapy in multiple indications does not resolve whether "synergy" is involved, or necessary. It is nonetheless well recognized that investigating this issue has implications for the development of new treatments and trials, as well as practical matters such as prioritization of concurrent versus sequential therapy, and whether combination therapy is necessary for all patients.

When two or more active therapies are combined, they each provide some probability of response. In general, the probability that either one of two concurrent events A and B will occur (e.g. response to therapy A or therapy B) is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability that both occur (P (A and/or B) = P (A) + P (B) − P (A and B) (Fig. 1). This "addition law of probability" was first applied to remission rates from monotherapy or combination therapy by the acute leukemia group B (ALGB) in 1961, and led to the conclusion that the therapeutic advantage of combining 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia arose from two drugs acting independently. Specifically, ALGB Protocol 2 observed that some patients responded to therapy 6MP but not therapy MTX, and vice versa, allowing the combination to benefit patients in both groups. Moreover, the observed combination therapy response rate was remarkably close to that predicted by the addition law of probability. Thus, it has long been known that tolerable combinations of active therapies can provide a clinically meaningful benefit to patient populations (as measured by population-averaged outcomes, such as response rate) without a requirement for pharmacologic additivity or synergy in individual patients (note that pharmacologic additivity as commonly defined using Bliss or Loewe null models is different from addition of probabilities; ref.).

### The IMPROVEDD VTE risk score: incorporation of D-dimer into the IMPROVE score to improve venous thromboembolism risk stratification [^b43f56bf]. TH Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "IMPROVEDD risk score for venous thromboembolism" for factor V Leiden, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and prothrombin G20210A.

The IMPROVEDD risk score is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized medical patients. The acronym IMPROVEDD stands for eight variables used in the calculation: Immobility, Malignancy, Previous VTE, Rhythm other than sinus (atrial fibrillation), Obesity, already on Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, Elderly (age > 60 years), and D-dimer level.

This risk score is particularly useful in stratifying patients' risk for VTE, which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It helps clinicians decide on the need for prophylactic anticoagulation in hospitalized medical patients.

The IMPROVEDD score is not applicable to patients who are already diagnosed with VTE, as it is a predictive tool for undiagnosed VTE. It is also not suitable for use in pediatric patients, pregnant women, or patients with contraindications to anticoagulation.

The IMPROVEDD risk score calculator for venous thromboembolism (VTE) assesses the likelihood of developing VTE by examining several key risk factors. This process involves user inputs for specific medical conditions and demographic criteria, which are then translated into a numerical score reflecting VTE risk.

The calculator evaluates eight factors, each with assigned scores based on potential responses:

- **Previous VTE**:
- **Yes**: 3 points
- **No**: 0 points
- **Known thrombophilia**:
- **Yes**: 2 points
- **No**: 0 points
- **Current lower-limb paralysis**:
- **Yes**: 2 points
- **No**: 0 points
- **Current cancer**:
- **Yes**: 2 points
- **No**: 0 points
- **Immobilized for 7 or more days**:
- **Yes**: 1 point
- **No**: 0 points
- **ICU/CCU stay**:
- **Yes**: 1 point
- **No**: 0 points
- **Age more than 60 years**:
- **Yes**: 1 point
- **No**: 0 points
- **D-dimer level at or above twice the upper normal limit**:
- **Yes**: 2 points
- **No**: 0 points

To compute the total risk score, each selected response is converted to its corresponding numerical value. These values are added together to produce a cumulative score, which reflects the individual's collective risk factors.

The interpretation of the score points directly to the probability of VTE occurrence at 42 and 77 days:

- A score of 0 indicates a 0.4% risk at 42 days and 0.5% at 77 days.
- A score of 1 suggests a 0.6% risk at 42 days and 0.7% at 77 days.
- A score of 2 represents a 0.8% risk at 42 days and 1.0% at 77 days.
- A score of 3 corresponds to a 1.2% risk at 42 days and 1.4% at 77 days.
- A score of 4 indicates a 1.6% risk at 42 days and 1.9% at 77 days.
- Scores of 5 or more are associated with a 2.2% risk at 42 days and 2.7% at 77 days.

These interpretations offer a clear perspective on the potential VTE risk tied to each patient's unique profile of risk factors.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of pretest probability, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer result is sufficient to exclude DVT in patients with low pretest probability of DVT. Recognize that a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer result can exclude PE in moderate-risk patients with possible PE.

### Accurate spike estimation from noisy calcium signals for ultrafast three-dimensional imaging of large neuronal populations in vivo [^11ea5be0]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Time discretization and probability details

The model is discretized at the signal's temporal resolution t (below, t will be used for discrete time indices rather than continuous time). We will note the input as n t (number of spikes between time t − 1 and t), the hidden state x t (= c t in the simplest model where baseline is constant and known, = (c t, B t) when baseline fluctuates, = (c t, p t, B t) when a rise time was introduced) and the measure y t: = F t.

We detail here this discretization and the full derivations of probability distributions p (x t |x t-1) and p (y t |x t) in the case of the simpler physiological model. The model equations become:

Random variable n t follows an exponential law with parameter λΔt:

The other probability relations defined implicitly in the system (w t and ɛ t are independent Gaussian variables with mean zero and variance one) are

Note that the first line of the equation is a simplification for the more rigorous but complicate formula

The last probability needed to fully describe the model is p (x 1) = p (c 1)p(B 1). It is the a priori probability of the hidden state, in absence of any measurement. In practice, we used a uniform distribution for both c 1 and B 1.

Regarding c 1, indeed we found that when the true spiking rate was not known, a uniform probability was better than a distribution determined mathematically based on the value of a priori spiking rate, because if that value was not correct, errors were increased. If the true spiking rate is known however, the following a priori can be used: one can observe that c 1 is a weighted sum of Poisson random variables:

Its probability distribution can thus not only be computed exactly with iterative convolutions but is also well-approximated with a truncated normal distribution:

### Clofarabine increases the eradication of minimal residual disease of primary B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to high-dose cytarabine without improvement of outcome. results from the randomized clinical trial 08–09 of the cooperative acute lymphoblastic leukemia study group [^460743f7]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As demonstrated in trial CoALL 08–09, clofarabine combined with PEG-asparaginase is effective in the eradication of MRD and well tolerated in the frontline treatment of ALL. In comparison to high-dose cytarabine/PEG-ASP, clofarabine/ PEG-ASP was superior in the overall reduction of an MRD burden. The frequency of MRD-positive BCPALL patients in the standard arm was lower than the predicted rate of 60%, likely due to a smaller sample size and the different distribution of risk strata in the preceding trial, CoALL 03–07.

### Late mortality after COVID-19 infection in veterans vs risk-matched comparators… [^1664aa75]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Then, 37 covariates were included in the month-specific propensity-score model. 16 A caliper of 0. 2 times the pooled estimate of the SD of the logit of the propensity score was used to set limits on which uninfected patients could be matched. To reduce potential bias in estimates from censoring, we applied inverse probability of censoring weights21 on a monthly basis. We used the same covariates that we used in the matching process, updated monthly, with weights estimated using pooled logistic regression for comparators and all individuals in the COVID-19 infection group having a weight of 1.

As a further secondary analysis, we considered an alternative formulation of the primary approach, in which we censored all surviving individuals in a given matched group at the time that the first comparator in that group was observed to develop COVID-19, rather than use inverse probability of censoring weights in the adjusted analyses. Then, we applied these risk scores from the comparator group to the COVID-19 group, and conducted analyses stratified by tertile of risk. Covariates imbalanced in any subgroup were adjusted for all subgroup analyses. Our study's results among those hospitalized for COVID-19 should be considered strictly hypothesis-generating given that hospitalization is analogous to a postrandomization variable in this analytic framework27; however, they are consistent with the findings of other published studies of excess mortality among patients hospitalized with sepsis or pneumonia. 10, 11.

Our presentation of results by hospitalization status should be considered only hypothesis-generating and a first step. 16, 27 Other potential mediators include the development of symptoms of post−COVID-19 condition and subsequent care and illness among both the COVID-19-infected and their comparators. Finally, the so-called hazards of hazard rates for interpreting causal effects have been described, 28 and although we focus on within-match comparisons and use inverse probability of censoring weighting, unobserved confounding cannot be ruled out.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^2ae8f1a9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA level of certainty for economic value statements is framed with defined categories and implementation guidance: high level of certainty reflects conclusions based on findings from 1 or more high quality cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) with extensive sensitivity analyses suggesting robustness to uncertainty in key input parameters; moderate level of certainty reflects evidence deemed to be of moderate quality due to factors such as the number or quality of available CEAs, uncertainty of underlying evidence, or findings sensitive to uncertainty in key input parameters; the committee proposes an alternative framework for level of certainty and states that the rationale for the stated level should be provided in supporting text, that the level should not include whether cost effectiveness might change if the intervention cost changes over time, and that when economic value is indeterminate no level of certainty is reported and a parenthetical clause should explain insufficiency, conflict, or outdated evidence.

eTable 5. Unadjusted Analyses of Outcomes From Baseline to Week 16 in the Three Groups eTable
6. Primary and Secondary Outcomes From Baseline to Week 16 in Three Groups eTable 7. Primary and Secondary Outcomes From Baseline to Week 24 in Three Groups. The EARLY study is a randomized, open-label, active parallel-controlled clinical trial. Randomization was conducted using an interactive web response system. The randomization list of participants was generated by the stratified blocked randomization method using SAS software, version 9. 4, in which stratification was based on the center. Within each stratum, participants were randomized using a block randomization method, with a block size of 9, in a ratio of 1: 1: 1 to receive either metformin, empagliflozin, or 5: 2 MR.

The sample size calculation was based on the SD of the change in HbA1c level from a previous study, 23 with a 2-sided α of. 05, β of 0. 2, a minimum detectable between-group difference of
0. 1%, and an anticipated SD of 0. 2% based on pilot data analysis and a multiple pairwise comparison test using the Tukey-Kramer test. It was computed that each group required 108 participants using PASS 15 software. Accounting for an expected 20% dropout rate, each group required 135 patients. The primary outcome was analyzed following the intention-to-treat principle in the full analysis set, which included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of drugs or 5: 2 MR. The safety outcome was analyzed in the safety analysis set, defined as participants randomized who received at least 1 dose of drugs or 5: 2 MR and had safety assessment data collected at least once after the baseline.

Multiple imputation was used for missing values in the primary and key secondary outcomes. Post hoc subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the potential effect of baseline differences on HbA1c and weight loss. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 24. 0 software. All P values were from 2-sided tests and results were deemed statistically significant at P <. 05.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia — pediatric high-risk first relapse MRD categories and outcomes: In children with high-risk ALL (n = 60) who relapsed within 30 months, MRD after the first chemotherapy cycle (3–5 weeks after initiation of reinduction) was categorized as MRD negative, MRD positive but unquantifiable (levels < 0.01%), or MRD ≥ 0.01%, with corresponding 3-year EFS rates of 73%, 45%, and 19% (P < .05); thus, MRD assessment can identify patients with a high probability of second relapse, which may offer an opportunity for risk-adapted second-line treatment strategies.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^7f668c34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in preference-sensitive decisions.

Objectives

1. Create a comprehensive inventory of patient decision aids focused on healthcare options. 2. Review randomized controlled trials (RCT) of decision aids, for people facing healthcare decisions.

Search Strategy

Studies were identified through databases and contact with researchers active in the field.

Selection Criteria

Two independent reviewers screened abstracts for interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes. Information about the decision aids was compiled in an inventory; those that had been evaluated in a RCT were reviewed in detail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data using standardized forms. Results of RCTs were pooled using weighted mean differences (WMD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model.

Main Results

Over 200 decision aids were identified. Of the 131 available decision aids, most are intended for use before counselling. Using the CREDIBLE criteria to evaluate the quality of the decision aids: a) most included potential harms and benefits, credentials of the developers, description of their development process, update policy, and were free of perceived conflict of interest; b) many included reference to relevant literature; c) few included a description of the level of uncertainty regarding the evidence; and d) few were evaluated. Thirty of these decision aids were evaluated in 34 RCTs and another trial evaluated a suite of eight decision aids. An additional 30 trials are yet to be published. Among the trials comparing decision aids to usual care, decision aids performed better in terms of: a) greater knowledge (WMD 19 out of 100, 95% CI: 13 to 24; b) more realistic expectations (RR 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.9); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling informed (WMD -9.1 of 100, 95%CI: -12 to -6); d) increased proportion of people active in decision making (RR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.3); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post intervention (RR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.3 to 0.7). When simpler were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in: a) knowledge (WMD 4 out of 100, 95% CI: 3 to 6); b) more realistic expectations (RR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3 to 1.7); and c) greater agreement between values and choice. Decision aids appeared to do no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. Decision aids had a variable effect on which healthcare options were selected.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The availability of decision aids is expanding with many on the Internet; however few have been evaluated. Trials indicate that decision aids improve knowledge and realistic expectations; enhance active participation in decision making; lower decisional conflict; decrease the proportion of people remaining undecided, and improve agreement between values and choice. The effects on persistence with chosen therapies and cost-effectiveness require further evaluation. Finally, optimal strategies for dissemination need to be explored.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) consensus statement on essential biomarkers for immunotherapy clinical protocols [^5f7f80c3]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Predictive versus prognostic biomarkers

All biomarkers provide information about the state of a biological process at a discrete time point (eg, a patient's tumor, immune system, metabolic health). Prior to initiation of therapy, baseline biomarkers serve as a vehicle to define, in part, the status of the tumor and the host response. Longitudinal tracking of biomarkers can be valuable for detecting alterations in tumor biology and/or treatment response. A distinction is often made between prognostic biomarkers versus predictive biomarkers.

Prognostic biomarkers relate tumor and host variables to clinical outcomes independently of treatment and can be identified using various statistical and machine-learning tools. Tumor-related factors include variables that reflect its biology and pathology, such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, metastasis, and molecular markers such as PTEN gene overexpression and the presence of the androgen receptor variant AR-V7. Standardized reporting of prognostic tumor-related histologic features is included in all diagnostic pathology reports (eg, as per College of American Pathologists, CAP guidelines). Host-related factors pertain to patient characteristics that impact survival outcomes, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and comorbidities. These biomarkers can be used to: (1) stratify randomization by disease risk, reducing heterogeneity within subgroups and maximizing it across subgroups; (2) identify potential treatment targets; and (3) direct therapy to specific patient subgroups. For example, in a recent trial with 1,311 patients with advanced prostate cancer, randomization was stratified according to the predicted 24-month survival probability, determined by a prognostic model of OS. This approach was used to balance critical baseline factors between the two treatment arms.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines — grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) — defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate as "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low as "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) "grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional", and "Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence", though "In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation". For Strong recommendations, certainty is "High or moderate", the balance is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", they "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures". For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be "High, moderate, or low", benefits "probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", applicability "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and policymaking "will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

### The TIMI risk score for unstable angina / non-ST elevation MI: a method for prognostication and therapeutic decision making [^37bfe355]. JAMA (2000). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "TIMI score for unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction" for unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) score for Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) is a clinical tool used to stratify risk in patients presenting with chest pain suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. This scoring system applies specifically to patients with unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.

The TIMI score for UA/NSTEMI helps clinicians predict the likelihood of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within a 14-day period following presentation. These events include all-cause mortality, new or recurrent myocardial infarction, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization.

The score is calculated based on seven variables: age ≥ 65 years, at least three risk factors for coronary artery disease, prior coronary stenosis of ≥ 50%, ST-segment deviation on ECG at presentation, at least two anginal events in the prior 24 hours, use of aspirin in the past seven days, and elevated serum cardiac markers. Each variable is assigned 1 point, and the total score ranges from 0 to 7.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the TIMI score for UA/NSTEMI. However, it

The TIMI score for unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction calculator evaluates a patient's risk profile based on seven specific input criteria. Each criterion, if met, contributes one point to the patient's total TIMI score. The final score is used to assess the patient's likelihood of experiencing adverse cardiac events within 14 days.

To calculate the TIMI score, the following criteria are considered, each contributing 1 point if present:

1. Age ≥ 65 years
2. Presence of ≥ 3 risk factors for coronary artery disease (such as family history, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, current smoking)
3. Presence of significant coronary stenosis ≥ 50%
4. Use of aspirin in the past 7 days
5. Severe angina with ≥ 2 anginal events in 24 hours
6. Evidence of ST deviation on ECG
7. Presence of elevated serum cardiac markers

The computation involves assessing each of these conditions and summing the corresponding points. The total score, which ranges from 0 to 7, is used to interpret the patient's risk for adverse outcomes:

- A score of 0 or 1 suggests a 5% risk of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization within 14 days.
- A score of 2 indicates an 8% risk.
- A score of 3 corresponds to a 13% risk.
- A score of 4 signifies a 20% risk.
- A score of 5 represents a 26% risk.
- A score of 6 or higher suggests a 41% risk.

### Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^62fdbc5d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prognostic factors and risk stratification in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia — key risk determinants include "patient age, WBC count, immunophenotypic/cytogenetic/genetic subtype, presence of CNS disease, and response to therapy". In the POG/CCG system, "Standard risk was assigned to patients aged 1 to < 10 years and with a WBC count < 50 × 10^9 cells/L, whereas all other patients with ALL, including T-ALL (regardless of age or WBC count), were considered high risk". Subsequent approaches note that "Some cooperative groups subdivide patients into five or more different risk groups that are used to tailor therapy". In B-ALL, high- or very-high-risk features include "t(9;22) chromosomal translocation (ie, BCR::ABL1-positive ALL) and/or presence of BCR::ABL1 fusion gene; hypodiploidy (< 44 chromosomes); BCR::ABL1-like; iAMP21; patients < 1 year of age with KMT2A gene rearrangement; or inability to achieve remission with induction therapy", whereas lower-risk criteria include "hyperdiploidy — especially with simultaneous trisomies of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17 — and the t(12;21) chromosomal translocation (ETV6::RUNX1 subtype)". For T-ALL, "the clinical variables used to classify risk in B-ALL, including age and WBC counts, are not independently prognostic in T-ALL", and genomic studies in children with T-ALL "(n = 1300)… genomic features associated with clinical outcome have been identified".

### Pooled analysis of recent studies on magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia [^4c8acf52]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Table 3 summarises the main results. We present results for geometric means for long-term measurements (results for arithmetic means were similar) for each study adjusted for basic potential confounders, and separately for measured and calculated field studies, as well as combined results. A likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without random effects for exposure did not detect heterogeneity (P = 0.201), supporting the pooling of studies.

In most individual studies and in the combined results, the risk increased with increase in exposure, although the estimates were imprecise. For calculated field studies, the number of subjects in high-exposure categories was often too small to provide reliable estimates. As Brazil was the most influential study in terms of the number of highly exposed subjects, and included only young and only ALL cases, we present results with and without Brazil. Influence analysis omitting one study at a time confirmed that Brazil was the most influential study (results not shown). Without Brazil, the summary odds ratio for ⩾0.3 μ T vs < 0.1 μ T is 1.56 (95% CI 0.78–3.10), which is close to the age, sex and study-adjusted summary OR of 1.68 (95% CI 1.23–2.31) obtained in the pooled analysis of Greenland, but less precise. In individual studies and in combined results, the number of observed cases ⩾0.3 μ T was higher than the expected number obtained by modelling the probability of membership in exposure categories on the basis of the distribution of controls, including covariates.

For a more direct comparison of the current pooled results with those of Ahlbom et al, we conducted an analysis using the same cutoff points. Our overall risk estimates, although compatible with previously reported estimates, are substantially lower (Table 4). This is particularly true for studies on measured fields, a result heavily influenced by the Brazilian study. The combined OR for ⩾0.4 μ T vs < 0.1 μ T with Brazil omitted was 2.02 (95% CI 0.87–4.69), whereas combined ORs when omitting other single studies ranged from 1.32 to 1.49. When the Brazilian study is excluded from the analysis, our point estimates are very close to the results of Ahlbom et al. The same is true when a cutoff point ⩾0.3 μ T is used, rather than ⩾0.4 μ T.

In (Eq. 4), is the size of the discrete interval specified above,иare, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of the data set, corresponding to one patient, and the square brackets denote the integer part of the number.

Figure 1 b schematically shows (also in the form of a continuous curve) the "total" probability densityspecified in (Eq. 2), corresponding to the presence in (Eq. 1) of an independent term, for the widthof the probability density of which (in this caseis the standard of fluctuations of the random variable) the condition is introduced

According to (Eq. 3), if (Eq. 5) is true, the small-scale "roughness" of thedependence, the effective period of which, as indicated above, is h, will be averaged. The consequence of this process will be a decrease in the characteristic amplitude of such random small fluctuations. Consequently, the "total" dependence, as schematically demonstrated in Fig. 1 b, with a high probability may correspond to a much "smoother" curve than the one presented byin Fig. 1 a. This difference between the studied dependences can be recorded by mathematical means, such as, for example, the Fourier transform. In this case, the degree of this "smoothness", determined by a decrease in the amplitude of small-scale disturbances, with a high probability will differ for patients with an upcoming favorable or, conversely, unfavorable course of the disease. Such a property can be used as a diagnostic feature. Below, this hypothesis will be verified using data from analyses of a group of patients with diabetes mellitus with favorable and unfavorable disease progression during their hospital stay.

There are numerous possible goals for building statistical models. Those statistical goals, the associated model types, and each statistical tool involved in model building come with its own assumptions and requirements. In turn, these requirements must be met if we are to ensure that our models produce meaningful, interpretable results. However, beyond these technical details is the intuition, and the additional set of tools and algorithms, used by the statistician, to build the contextually appropriate model: not only must we build an interpretable model, we must build a model that answers the particular question at hand and addresses the particular goal we have in mind. In this column we discuss the methods by which statisticians build models for description, risk factor identification, and prediction.

Determinants of recommendation strength — certainty, patient values, cost, and examples emphasize that "The second determinant of the strength of a recommendation is the certainty in the effect estimates". In acutely ill medical patients, "For instance, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH has an apparent benefit in reducing symptomatic PE, symptomatic DVT, major bleeding, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, compared with UFH, in acutely ill medical patients", yet "The 5 randomized trials from which the evidence came were, however, judged at serious risk of bias due to an unclear randomization sequence-generation process and absence of blinding, and provided imprecise estimates", and "the body of evidence was rated down as low certainty", so "In this scenario, use of LMWH over UFH warrants a conditional recommendation". With respect to values, "The third determinant of the strength of a recommendation is uncertainty about, or variability in, the relative importance patients assign to the outcomes", such that "If significant variability in patients' values is known or assumed, it is expected that patients' preferences for 1 treatment option over another will also vary; hence a strong recommendation would be inappropriate". Regarding resources, "Cost is another determinant of the strength of a recommendation", and "ASH guidelines are generally focused on well-resourced settings; however, efforts to adapt guidelines to lower-resource settings are pursued when these considerations become more context dependent". An applied conditional example is "a conditional recommendation for a longer (6–12 week) international normalized ratio (INR) recall interval over a shorter (4-week) INR recall interval, during periods of stable INR control, for patients taking a vitamin K antagonist".

### Survival analysis part IV: further concepts and methods in survival analysis [^c00a9bc8]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

HOW SHOULD WE CHOOSE WHICH VARIABLES TO INCLUDE IN OUR SURVIVAL MODEL?

In some cases, the factors to be included in the model will be predetermined. In many others, there will be several possible covariates from which only a handful are to be chosen. This is often because there are a large number of covariates of which some are unimportant, but the identification and elimination of these is not always easy. As a starting point, it is good practice to include known prognostic factors and any that are specifically required by the study aims (e.g. the treatment identifier in the analysis of a clinical trial). It is then the burden of new factors to add significant additional predictive ability.

If there are a large number of factors of interest and there is relatively little information about their prognostic influence, automated selection techniques such as stepwise methods can be used. There are variations on these that start either with all covariates (backward elimination) or none (forward selection), adding or removing covariates according to statistical significance at some predecided level. A disadvantage of both is that they only evaluate a small number of the set of possible models. Instead, each possible model could be fitted, with the best being picked on the basis of a goodness-of-fit measure such as Mallow's C. However, this may be time-consuming with many covariates, multiple testing is problematic, and is seldom used due to its noninclusion in many software packages.

Unfortunately, all these methods are problematic. The 'best' model is derived solely on statistical grounds (and indeed may lack any clinical meaning), the regression coefficients produced are biased (too large) and standard errors and P -values are too small, especially for smaller sample sizes and when few events occur. Backward elimination is possibly the best of the above methods for identifying the important variables, and it allows one to examine the full model, which is the only fit providing accurate standard errors and P -values. An alternative, the lasso method attempts to force some regression coefficient estimates to be exactly zero, thus achieving variable selection while shrinking the remaining coefficients toward zero to reflect the overfitting and overestimation caused by data-based model selection.

If one cannot completely prespecify a model, it may be best to apply backward elimination or lasso to a full model of prespecified covariates of interest, and use bootstrap methods to compare the stability and predictive accuracy of the full model with that of a reduced one (see next question for further details).

### Early and delayed consolidation chemotherapy significantly improves the outcome of children with intermediate risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. final results of the prospective randomized PETHEMA ALL-89 TRIAL [^dc140f40]. Haematologica (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

To evaluate the impact of early and delayed consolidation chemotherapy on the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) stratified according to risk groups.

Design and Methods

From 1989 to 1994, 195 children (≤ 15 years old) diagnosed as having ALL (ALL-L3 excluded) in 15 Spanish hospitals entered the prospective, randomized PETHEMA ALL-89 trial. Patients were stratified into low-risk (LR), intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) groups according to their initial features and the rate of response to induction therapy. LR-ALL patients were randomized to receive or not early consolidation chemotherapy (C-1). After receiving C-1, IR patients were randomized to receive or not delayed consolidation chemotherapy (C-2). HR patients received C-1 and C-2 chemotherapy. Standard maintenance chemotherapy was administered to all patients for 2 years. High doses of intravenous methotrexate and 12 triple intrathecal doses were given as prophylaxis against central nervous system (CNS) disease.

Results

The mean (and standard deviation) age was 6 (4) years and 120 patients were males. Fourteen patients had early pre-B-ALL, 149 common or pre-B-ALL, and 32 T-ALL. Complete remission (CR) was attained in 189 patients (97%), 11 of whom (6%) had a slow response. Risk group stratification after CR was: LR 89, IR 50 and HR 56 patients (including a subset of 26 patients at very high risk). Ten-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities for the whole series were 58% (95% CI: 52–64%) and 69% (61–77), respectively, with a median follow-up of 8.7 years. Dividing the patients according to risk group, the 10-year EFS and OS probabilities in the LR group were 71% (63–79) and 86% (80–92), respectively; in the IR group 69% (57–81) and 76% (64–88), respectively, and in the HR group 30% (18–42) and 44% (32–57), respectively. For LR patients receiving C-1, EFS and OS were 79% (57–92) and 90% (82–98), respectively, versus 62% (48–76) and 66% (51–81) in patients not receiving C-1 (p = 0.06). For IR patients, EFS and OS were significantly improved in those receiving early and delayed consolidation (EFS 87% (74–88) vs. 52% (41–70), and OS 92% (87–97) vs. 61% (51–71)(p = 0.036). Prognostic factors for EFS identified in multivariable analyses were: age > 10 years in the LR group (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.3–9.5, p = 0.01), and treatment with C-2 in IR patients (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.4–17.8, p = 0.01). The CNS relapse rate was 4% for all the series (including the HR subset). Tolerance to treatment was good.

Interpretation and Conclusions

In this study, early consolidation seemed to improve the prognosis of children with LR-ALL, but differences in EFS were not significant. Delayed consolidation had a favorable influence on the outcome of IR-ALL. CNS preventive treatment without cranial irradiation was effective in all the groups of ALL patients.

### It is time for consensus on' consensus statements' [^30d1fdf5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Do consensus statements deserve the prestige they are afforded?

Expert opinion sits at the base of the evidence pyramid but when those experts gather, and take recent systematic reviews into account, their output — consensus statements — are given great weight. Consensus statements are some of the most downloaded and cited publications. They can inform state and sporting policy, which opens up the potential to impact individual behaviour and eventually patient outcomes. Judging how much to trust consensus statement recommendations can be difficult (see figure 1). How can the research community (consensus creators, Journal editors, media channels) ensure the great weight given to consensus statements is supported by a scientific, rigorous, transparent, replicable and equitable process?

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^8813691b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in decisions that involve weighing benefits, harms, and scientific uncertainty.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of decision aids for people facing treatment or screening decisions.

Search Strategy

For this update, we searched from January 2006 to December 2009 in MEDLINE (Ovid); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, issue 4 2009); CINAHL (Ovid) (to September 2008 only); EMBASE (Ovid); PsycINFO (Ovid); and grey literature. Cumulatively, we have searched each database since its start date.

Selection Criteria

We included published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of decision aids, which are interventions designed to support patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to usual care and/or alternative interventions. We excluded studies in which participants were not making an active treatment or screening decision.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed potential risk of bias. The primary outcomes, based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards, were:A) decision attributes; B) decision making process attributes. Secondary outcomes were behavioral, health, and health system effects. We pooled results of RCTs using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR), applying a random effects model.

Main Results

Of 34,316 unique citations, 86 studies involving 20,209 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included. Thirty-one of these studies are new in this update. Twenty-nine trials are ongoing. There was variability in potential risk of bias across studies. The two criteria that were most problematic were lack of blinding and the potential for selective outcome reporting, given that most of the earlier trials were not registered. Of 86 included studies, 63 (73%) used at least one measure that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion: A) criteria involving decision attributes: knowledge scores (51 studies); accurate risk perceptions (16 studies); and informed value-based choice (12 studies); and B) criteria involving decision process attributes: feeling informed (30 studies) and feeling clear about values (18 studies). A) Criteria involving decision attributes:Decision aids performed better than usual care interventions by increasing knowledge (MD 13.77 out of 100; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.40 to 16.15; n = 26). When more detailed decision aids were compared to simpler decision aids, the relative improvement in knowledge was significant (MD 4.97 out of 100; 95% CI 3.22 to 6.72; n = 15). Exposure to a decision aid with expressed probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.08; n = 14). The effect was stronger when probabilities were expressed in numbers (RR 1.93; 95% CI 1.58 to 2.37; n = 11) rather than words (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.48; n = 3). Exposure to a decision aid with explicit values clarification compared to those without explicit values clarification resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving decisions that were informed and consistent with their values (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.52; n = 8).B) Criteria involving decision process attributes:Decision aids compared to usual care interventions resulted in: a) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -6.43 of 100; 95% CI -9.16 to -3.70; n = 17); b) lower decisional conflict related to feeling unclear about personal values (MD -4.81; 95% CI -7.23 to -2.40; n = 14); c) reduced the proportions of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.77; n = 11); and d) reduced proportions of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.74; n = 9). Decision aids appear to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication in the four studies that measured this outcome. For satisfaction with the decision (n = 12) and/or the decision making process (n = 12), those exposed to a decision aid were either more satisfied or there was no difference between the decision aid versus comparison interventions. There were no studies evaluating the decision process attributes relating to helping patients to recognize that a decision needs to be made or understand that values affect the choice.C) Secondary outcomesExposure to decision aids compared to usual care continued to demonstrate reduced choice of: major elective invasive surgery in favour of conservative options (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.00; n = 11). Exposure to decision aids compared to usual care also resulted in reduced choice of PSA screening (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; n = 7). When detailed compared to simple decision aids were used, there was reduced choice of menopausal hormones (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; n = 3). For other decisions, the effect on choices was variable. The effect of decision aids on length of consultation varied from -8 minutes to +23 minutes (median 2.5 minutes). Decision aids do not appear to be different from comparisons in terms of anxiety (n = 20), and general health outcomes (n = 7), and condition specific health outcomes (n = 9). The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (adherence to the decision, costs/resource use) were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

New for this updated review is evidence that: decision aids with explicit values clarification exercises improve informed values-based choices; decision aids appear to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication; and decision aids have a variable effect on length of consultation. Consistent with findings from the previous review, which had included studies up to 2006: decision aids increase people's involvement, and improve knowledge and realistic perception of outcomes; however, the size of the effect varies across studies. Decision aids have a variable effect on choices. They reduce the choice of discretionary surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The effects on adherence with the chosen option, patient-practitioner communication, cost-effectiveness, and use with developing and/or lower literacy populations need further evaluation. Little is known about the degree of detail that decision aids need in order to have positive effects on attributes of the decision or decision-making process.

Statistical analyses

Among the eligible patients enrolled on 12 frontline studies, EFS from date of initial diagnosis was calculated for each study, with events defined as induction failure, relapse, second malignant neoplasm, or death of any cause, whichever occurred first. Patient and disease characteristics at initial diagnosis were compared between patients who relapsed and those who did not using Pearson's chi-squared tests. Among patients who relapsed, OS post-relapse was defined as the time between date of first relapse and date of death; patients alive at last follow-up were censored. Data cutoff date was June 30, 2021. The EFS or OS probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method with Greenwood standard errors. Analyses of OS post-relapse in relation to patient and disease characteristics were based on the logrank tests and univariate and multivariable Cox regression models. Analyses were performed for B-ALL, T-ALL, and infant ALL separately. All p -values reported are two-sided. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software.

### Developing clinical prediction models: a step-by-step guide [^854a7b21]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Step 8: Fit the prediction models

Modelling strategies

The strategies for model development should be specified in the protocol (step 5). Linear regression for continuous outcomes, logistic regression for binary outcomes, and Cox or simple parametric models for survival outcomes are the usual starting points in modelling. If the sample size is large enough (see step 6), models can include nonlinear terms for continuous predictors or interactions between predictors. More advanced modelling strategies, such as machine learning models (eg, random forests, support vector machines, boosting methods, neural networks, etc), can also be used. These strategies might add value if there are strong nonlinearities and interactions between predictors, although they are not immune to biases. As discussed under step 10, a final strategy needs to be selected if several modelling strategies are explored.

Dealing with competing events

When predicting binary or time-to-event outcomes, we should consider whether there are relevant competing events. This situation occurs when several possible outcomes exist, but a person can only experience one event. For example, when predicting death from breast cancer, death from another cause is a competing event. In this case, and especially whenever competing events are common, we should use a competing risks model for the analysis, such as a cause specific Cox regression model. A simpler approach would be to analyse a composite outcome.

Data driven variable selection methods

We advise against univariable selection methods — that is, methods that test each predictor separately and retain only statistically significant predictors. These methods do not consider the association between predictors and could lead to loss of valuable information. Stepwise methods for variable selection (eg, forward, backwards, or bidirectional variable selection) are commonly used. Again, they are not recommended because they might lead to bias in estimation and worse predictive performance. If variable selection is desirable — for instance, to simplify the implementation of the model by further reducing the number of predetermined predictors — more suitable methods can be used as described below.

Interfant-06 — risk stratification and consolidation outcomes in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are described as follows: Three risk groups were defined (low, high, medium) with counts specified, and medium- and high-risk patients were randomized to lymphoid versus myeloid consolidation; 6-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 46.1% and 58.2%, and disease-free survival (DFS) was comparable between randomized arms (ADE + MAE 39.3% vs. IB 36.8%; log-rank P = 0.47). In minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis at end of induction (EOI), infants with high MRD at EOI "may benefit" from myeloid over lymphoid consolidation (6-year DFS 45.9% vs. 23.2%), whereas those with low MRD at EOI "may benefit more" from lymphoid than myeloid consolidation (6-year DFS 78.2% vs. 45.0%). Risk-group definitions included high risk as age > 6 months with white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 300 x 10^9/L or poor prednisone response, with cohort sizes n = 167 (low), n = 164 (high), and n = 320 (medium) among n = 651 total infants with ALL.

Interpreting strong and conditional recommendations — stakeholder perspectives outlines practical implications for different audiences. For patients, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas under a conditional recommendation "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not". For clinicians, a strong recommendation indicates "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action", while a conditional recommendation acknowledges "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences". For policy makers, strong recommendations mean "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations", but conditional recommendations entail that "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and "On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence", whereas conditional recommendations are "likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adoption) by additional research".

Statistical analysis

DCEs are based on the random utility theory, which assumes that each respondent will select the alternative that best maximises their individual utility. In this context, utility can best be understood as an indication of the relative preference that respondents attach to each attribute. The sign of each coefficient (β) reflects whether it has a positive or negative influence for respondents, while the magnitude of the coefficient reflects the size of this influence. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise demographic characteristics of the questionnaire preceding the DCE.

Unforced choice data (with options coded as A, B or neither job) were used for all analyses with the respondents' choices as the dependent variable. All attributes were specified as categorical variables and effects coded. Consistent with current guidance, we first tested the financial attribute as a categorical variable to explore linearity. Results suggested a non-linear pattern and better model performance than categorising the attribute as a continuous variable; therefore, we coded the financial attribute as three separate parameters. All analyses were conducted using NLOGIT software V.6.

Three models were estimated to harvest a rich variety of information about respondent preferences. Initial exploratory analysis was undertaken using a multinomial logit model to estimate preferences across all participants (see online supplemental file 1). However, as this model assumes homogeneity of preferences, which is unlikely to be the case, a mixed multinomial logit model was conducted. The mixed model takes preference heterogeneity among participants into account by allowing attribute coefficients to be randomly distributed with a specified probability distribution. All parameters were modelled as random with a normal distribution, including the monthly financial benefit since the base multinomial logit model found both positive and negative coefficients for this attribute.

Next, a latent class model was estimated. This method explores whether there are underlying subgroups (classes) within the sample with similar preferences and can be particularly useful to inform policy recommendations. The analyst must stipulate the number of classes and which observed variables to include in the model. A two-class model was assessed by the authors to be the most appropriate to interpret the data as larger class models showed minimal gains in model fit statistics and class sizes became too small for meaningful interpretation (online supplemental file 3). Estimated probabilities of group membership were used to examine the characteristics associated with each group, with the largest probability used to determine the group for each respondent.

Ethics

The questionnaire was prefaced by an electronic participant information statement in simple Bahasa Indonesia. Participants were required to confirm that they had understood the participant information statement in order to proceed to the questionnaire; completion of the DCE constituted consent.

Evaluation of the Bayesian optimization algorithm

To illustrate Bayesian optimization with GP, we defined a single variable function and tried to find the maximum value by sequential sampling (Fig. 2). The function was deliberately chosen to have multiple peaks and local optima (dashed curve in Fig. 2) to test whether the optimization algorithm can indeed find the global maximum. The algorithm was able to find the maximum and the exploration and exploitation trade-off is illustrated by the sampling order depicted in the figure. The more points evaluated by the algorithm, the closer the algorithm became to the maximum as shown in Fig. 2b.

### All models are wrong and yours are useless: making clinical prediction models impactful for patients [^8938f457]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Mapping the path to usefulness

I know what you are thinking: "It takes time! Method development is trailblazing new ideas, the clinic will eventually catch up". Yes, it will take time. But if "it takes time" is the only answer you have on how your model will be useful for patients, then it will take even longer.

Can we expect models to be useful immediately after publication? Probably not. But we can expect model developers to have a roadmap to the clinical usefulness of their model. For drug discovery, there is a well-known sequence of steps to follow, and for medical software there are equally clear rules, but they are in my experience much less well-known.

Many validations of your model, like clinical trials, can be done without regulatory approval. But establishing line of sight to the clinic early and planning a path through regulation will be crucial if you really want your model to be used on patients. Which regulation to follow will depend on your location. For example, in Europe it is CE marking, in the UK it is UKCA approval, in the US it is FDA approval, and other parts of the world have similar schemes. Regulators always seem scary, but in fact they want to help and the best advice is to reach out to them as early as possible.

It is a big task and needs to be broken down into more easily digestible chunks. Start outlining the road to implementation while you are still designing your clinical prediction tool: is it even theoretically possible that your model will help a patient? Is there a clear decision point your model is addressing with data that are clinically relevant? Continue solidifying your plan while writing a paper about your model: What exactly needs to happen for doctors to use your tool? What validations are needed? If you introduce a new data modality, how would this fit into existing infrastructure? And if the main use of your model is not for patients, but maybe hypothesis generation or testing a new modelling idea, then here is the place to state it clearly.

Including a section on implementation into the discussion of every translational paper would be the simplest and in my view most impactful step to improve current scientific practices. It will make your papers stronger and prepare you for your conversations with regulators.

Writing an implementation plan can only be a first step - actions are needed, not words - but spending more time thinking about implementation and regulation would make academic researchers much more proactive partners in improving clinical standards, and that would be a major step forward.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^12d088ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids are intended to help people participate in decisions that involve weighing the benefits and harms of treatment options often with scientific uncertainty.

Objectives

To assess the effects of decision aids for people facing treatment or screening decisions.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched from 2009 to June 2012 in MEDLINE; CENTRAL; EMBASE; PsycINFO; and grey literature. Cumulatively, we have searched each database since its start date including CINAHL (to September 2008).

Selection Criteria

We included published randomized controlled trials of decision aids, which are interventions designed to support patients' decision making by making explicit the decision, providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to usual care and/or alternative interventions. We excluded studies of participants making hypothetical decisions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes, based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS), were:A) 'choice made' attributes; B) 'decision-making process' attributes. Secondary outcomes were behavioral, health, and health-system effects. We pooled results using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR), applying a random-effects model.

Main Results

This update includes 33 new studies for a total of 115 studies involving 34,444 participants. For risk of bias, selective outcome reporting and blinding of participants and personnel were mostly rated as unclear due to inadequate reporting. Based on 7 items, 8 of 115 studies had high risk of bias for 1 or 2 items each. Of 115 included studies, 88 (76.5%) used at least one of the IPDAS effectiveness criteria: A) 'choice made' attributes criteria: knowledge scores (76 studies); accurate risk perceptions (25 studies); and informed value-based choice (20 studies); and B) 'decision-making process' attributes criteria: feeling informed (34 studies) and feeling clear about values (29 studies). A) Criteria involving 'choice made' attributes:Compared to usual care, decision aids increased knowledge (MD 13.34 out of 100; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.17 to 15.51; n = 42). When more detailed decision aids were compared to simple decision aids, the relative improvement in knowledge was significant (MD 5.52 out of 100; 95% CI 3.90 to 7.15; n = 19). Exposure to a decision aid with expressed probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.16; n = 19). Exposure to a decision aid with explicit values clarification resulted in a higher proportion of patients choosing an option congruent with their values (RR 1.51; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.96; n = 13).B) Criteria involving 'decision-making process' attributes:Decision aids compared to usual care interventions resulted in:a) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -7.26 of 100; 95% CI -9.73 to -4.78; n = 22) and feeling unclear about personal values (MD -6.09; 95% CI -8.50 to -3.67; n = 18); b) reduced proportions of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.81; n = 14); andc) reduced proportions of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.72; n = 18). Decision aids appeared to have a positive effect on patient-practitioner communication in all nine studies that measured this outcome. For satisfaction with the decision (n = 20), decision-making process (n = 17), and/or preparation for decision making (n = 3), those exposed to a decision aid were either more satisfied, or there was no difference between the decision aid versus comparison interventions. No studies evaluated decision-making process attributes for helping patients to recognize that a decision needs to be made, or understanding that values affect the choice.C) Secondary outcomes Exposure to decision aids compared to usual care reduced the number of people of choosing major elective invasive surgery in favour of more conservative options (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.93; n = 15). Exposure to decision aids compared to usual care reduced the number of people choosing to have prostate-specific antigen screening (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; n = 9). When detailed compared to simple decision aids were used, fewer people chose menopausal hormone therapy (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; n = 3). For other decisions, the effect on choices was variable. The effect of decision aids on length of consultation varied from 8 minutes shorter to 23 minutes longer (median 2.55 minutes longer) with 2 studies indicating statistically-significantly longer, 1 study shorter, and 6 studies reporting no difference in consultation length. Groups of patients receiving decision aids do not appear to differ from comparison groups in terms of anxiety (n = 30), general health outcomes (n = 11), and condition-specific health outcomes (n = 11). The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (adherence to the decision, costs/resource use) were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that decision aids compared to usual care improve people's knowledge regarding options, and reduce their decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed and unclear about their personal values. There is moderate-quality evidence that decision aids compared to usual care stimulate people to take a more active role in decision making, and improve accurate risk perceptions when probabilities are included in decision aids, compared to not being included. There is low-quality evidence that decision aids improve congruence between the chosen option and the patient's values. New for this updated review is further evidence indicating more informed, values-based choices, and improved patient-practitioner communication. There is a variable effect of decision aids on length of consultation. Consistent with findings from the previous review, decision aids have a variable effect on choices. They reduce the number of people choosing discretionary surgery and have no apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The effects on adherence with the chosen option, cost-effectiveness, use with lower literacy populations, and level of detail needed in decision aids need further evaluation. Little is known about the degree of detail that decision aids need in order to have a positive effect on attributes of the choice made, or the decision-making process.

### Errors in the implementation, analysis, and reporting of randomization within obesity and nutrition research: a guide to their avoidance [^afa86835]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomization in scientific experiments bolsters causal inference. Determining a true causal effect would require observing the difference between two outcomes within a single unit (e.g. person, animal) in one case after exogenous manipulation (e.g. "treatment") and in another case without the manipulation, with all else, including the time of observation, held constant. However, this true causal effect would require parallel universes in which the same unit at the same time undergoes manipulation in one universe but does not in the other. In the absence of parallel universes, we can estimate average causal effects by balancing all differences between multiple units, such that one group looks as similar as possible to the other group. In practice, however, balancing all variables is likely impossible. For practical application, randomization is an alternative because the selection process is independent of the individual's pre-randomization (observed and unobserved) characteristics that could confound the outcome, and also balances in the long run the distributions of variables that would otherwise be potential confounders, thereby providing unbiased estimation of treatment effects. Randomization and exogenous treatment allow inferential statistics to create unbiased effect estimates. Departures from randomization may increase uncertainty and yield bias.

We conducted a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis on logit-transformed proportions to estimate the prevalence of LNM across studies. The logit transformation was used to stabilise variances and handle proportions near 0% or 100%; a continuity correction of 0.5 was applied to studies reporting 0% or 100% event rates to ensure stable variance estimation across all studies. For the heterogeneity parameter "tau" (i.e. the between-study standard deviation), we specified a half-normal prior with a scale parameter of 1. The overall effect "mu" (i.e. the average logit-transformed proportion across studies) was modeled using a weakly informative normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 4, as implemented in the R add-on package 'bayesmeta'. Posterior distributions of LN positivity proportions were summarised using the posterior mean and 95% credible intervals (CrIs), representing the range within which the true prevalence is expected to lie with 95% probability. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings under different exclusion scenarios: (1) the main analysis included all studies; (2) the overlap exclusion removed studies with overlapping cohorts; (3) the bias exclusion removed studies at serious risk of bias; and (4) the combined exclusion removed both overlapping and high-risk studies. We also plotted posterior samples of key parameters (e.g. mu, tau) to visualise distributional shape and subgroup variation, using trace plots to illustrate sampling variability and heterogeneity patterns across studies. Since bayesmeta derives posterior distributions analytically rather than via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, these trace plots were used solely for visualising parameter variability across studies and do not serve as diagnostic tools for MCMC convergence. All analyses were conducted in R (v4.0.2)using the following packages: 'bayesmeta'for Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis and posterior inference; 'ggplot2' 'ggridges'for data visualisation, including density and ridgeline plots; 'dplyr'and 'tidyr'for data preparation and wrangling; 'readxl'for importing Excel-based datasets; and 'mgcv'for supplementary generalised additive modelling.

### Key design considerations for adaptive clinical trials: a primer for clinicians [^88bf90dd]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Characteristics of adaptive designs

Adaptive designs allow for modifications to key components. Unlike conventional designs, where the learning typically occurs after the trial is completed, adaptive designs intend for continual learning as the data accumulate. Several characteristics are more common in, or unique to, adaptive trials than conventional trials (box 1). Changes can be made to the allocation ratio, total sample size, and eligibility criteria, trials can be extended from phase II into phase III, or treatment arms can be added or dropped. Adaptive trials have the potential for decreased time to completion, reduced resource requirements and number of patients exposed to inferior treatments, and overall improved likelihood of trial success. But they also come with the risk of creating inefficiencies if poorly planned. Any possible decision for adaptation should undergo rigorous risk-benefit assessment, such that the potential scientific and ethical gains outweigh the risks of causing bias or trial inefficiencies.

Box 1
What makes a randomised clinical trial adaptive?

Key study design components can be adapted throughout the trial
Trial planning involves several rounds of simulations
Consequences and gains of possible trial adaptations need to be understood before initiation
Statistical analysis plans are needed for both interim and final analyses
Research question may change along with adaptations (for example, narrowing the population)
Multiple trials (such as phase II and III) can seamlessly be combined in one adaptive trial
New experimental treatments can be added rather than starting a new separate trial

### Positive parenting and early childhood cognition: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d9471beb]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk of Bias in Individual Studies

A risk of bias assessment was conducted for included studies using the modified Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials, developed by the CLARITY Group at McMaster University (CLARITY Group). The Clarity tool was selected as it provides variability in the classification system based on available information (e.g. probably yes and/or probably no, in addition to definitely yes/definitely no options). Furthermore, it provides specific instructions for addressing unclearly reported masking status in randomized controlled trials (Akl et al.). These modifications allow for a nuanced assessment of risk of bias when a literature has variability in the quality of reporting, as was expected in the current review.

Studies were evaluated based on the following criteria: adequacy of random sequence generation, adequacy of allocation concealment, masking to group allocation (data collectors, participants, interventionists, data analysts), frequency of missing outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other biases (e.g. baseline differences). Additional questions were added to the assessment after consultation with the tool developer including the use of a power analysis, sample power, and trial registration. For each criterion, studies were rated as either: (1) definitely high-risk of bias; (2) probably/mostly high-risk of bias; (3) probably/mostly low risk of bias, or (4) definitely low risk of bias. Following piloting and adjustment of the assessment with 11 articles, each study was assessed by two independent coders and disagreements resolved by the second author. For multiple studies pulling from the same sample, ratings were compared for each criterion and where discrepancies emerged (k = 6), the higher rating was selected. Finally, total scores were generated for each study by assigning a value of 1 for "Definitely Yes" or "Probably Yes", and 0 for "Definitely No, Probably No or Not Reported", and then summing across all risk of bias items. Scores could range from 0 to 12 with higher scores indicating lower risk of bias.

### Cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel vs standard care in high-risk relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Canada [^efec3df0]. JAMA Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been approved for use in multiple jurisdictions. The public list price is US $475 000, or more than CaD $600 000. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is necessary to inform policy makers on the economic value of this treatment.

Objective

To assess the value for money of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under unknown long-term effectiveness.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cost-utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care using a Canadian population-based registry of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was performed. Results from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10% to 40%, to account for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data were collected in September 2017, and analysis began in December 2017.

Exposures

Tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible patients.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Relative health care costs, survival gains, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between tisagenlecleucel and current standard care.

Results

The treatment and control arms were modeled on 192 and 118 patients, respectively. The mean (SD) age of control individuals was 10 (4.25) years, and the mean (SD) age of the pooled clinical trial sample was 11 (6) years. The control individuals had 78 boys (66%), and the pooled clinical trial sample had 102 boys (53%). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with an additional 2.14 to 9.85 life years or 1.68 to 6.61 QALYs, compared with current care. The average additional cost of tisagenlecleucel was CaD $470 013 (US $357 031). Accounting for the total discounted cost over the patient lifetime resulted in an incremental cost of CaD $71 000 (US $53 933) to CaD $281 000 (US $213 453) per QALY gain.

Conclusions and Relevance

To our knowledge, this study offers the first cost-effectiveness analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a constructed population-based control arm. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000/QALY, tisagenlecleucel had a 32% likelihood of being cost-effective. Tisagenlecleucel cost-effectiveness would fall below $50 000/QALY with a long-term cure rate of over 0.40 or a price discount of 49% at its currently known effectiveness.

### How do you design randomised trials for smaller populations? A framework [^45132483]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

How should we approach trial design when we can get some, but not all, of the way to the numbers required for a randomised phase III trial?We present an ordered framework for designing randomised trials to address the problem when the ideal sample size is considered larger than the number of participants that can be recruited in a reasonable time frame. Staying with the frequentist approach that is well accepted and understood in large trials, we propose a framework that includes small alterations to the design parameters. These aim to increase the numbers achievable and also potentially reduce the sample size target. The first step should always be to attempt to extend collaborations, consider broadening eligibility criteria and increase the accrual time or follow-up time. The second set of ordered considerations are the choice of research arm, outcome measures, power and target effect. If the revised design is still not feasible, in the third step we propose moving from two- to one-sided significance tests, changing the type I error rate, using covariate information at the design stage, re-randomising patients and borrowing external information. We discuss the benefits of some of these possible changes and warn against others. We illustrate, with a worked example based on the Euramos-1 trial, the application of this framework in designing a trial that is feasible, while still providing a good evidence base to evaluate a research treatment. This framework would allow appropriate evaluation of treatments when large-scale phase III trials are not possible, but where the need for high-quality randomised data is as pressing as it is for common diseases.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between childhood infections and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [^20a84693]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis methods

Our analysis combined data at the study level. Our primary analysis sought to assess exposure to common infections vs no common infections (referent group) on the risk of developing ALL, relying on each study's definition. The most frequent infection was used when studies did not report a common infection variable. We used the adjusted odds ratio (OR) or rate ratio (RR) to calculate a pooled overall effect, and assumed OR and RR were equivalent due to the rarity of the outcome; ORs or RRs < 1 suggest infections are protective against ALL. If a study presented multiple frequency categories, we used the lowest vs the highest category, a method commonly used in meta-analyses. The method described by Greenland was used to calculate the variance using the reported 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated a crude OR for studies not reporting one, and to facilitate the calculation we added 0.5 to all cells if one of the four cells reported a zero. In secondary analyses, we used the different exposure levels of infection to compute a regression slope. If an exposure level was defined using a range, we used the midpoint of the range (e.g. 1–3 infections was assigned a frequency of 2), and if the level was ⩾4, we assigned a frequency of 4. For infection severity, a dichotomous variable (yes vs no) was used to determine the relationship with ALL. Post hoc analyses examined the timing of infections in the first year of life compared to infections that occurred after the first year of life, and putative infectious agents was conducted if ⩾3 studies reported the agent.

### Are there interindividual differences in anxiety as a result of aerobic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia? An ancillary meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^74a7594c]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether true interindividual response differences (IIRD) exist with respect to changes in anxiety because of aerobic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia (FM).

Data Sources

Data from a previous meta-analytical database of randomized controlled trials of exercise in adults with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials limited to aerobic exercise training on anxiety in adults 18 years or older with FM were included.

Data Extraction

Change outcome SDs treated as point estimates for anxiety were used to calculate true IIRD from each study. In addition, treatment effect data were extracted.

Data Synthesis

The inverse variance heterogeneity model was used to pool all results. For the 5 studies and 321 participants in which results were pooled, statistically significant treatment effect reductions in anxiety were observed (mean, -0.77 points, 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.77). However, no significant IIRD were found (mean, 0.6 points, 95% CI, -1.2 to 1.5). The 95% prediction interval for true IIRD in a future study was -1.7 to 0.8. The percent chance, ie, probability, of a clinically meaningful difference in variability, was 61.5% (only possibly clinically important).

Conclusions

The results of the current study suggest that aerobic exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety among adults with fibromyalgia. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to support the notion that true IIRD exist. Therefore, a search for potential mediators and moderators associated with aerobic exercise and changes in anxiety among adults with FM may not be warranted. However, additional research is needed before any true level of certainty can be established. This includes (1) the assessment of IIRD in future randomized controlled trials, (2) randomized controlled trials of longer duration, and (3) an increase in the proportion of men included in randomized controlled trials.

### Using smartphones to optimise and scale-up the assessment of model-based planning [^06fef678]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

The similarities and differences between the original two-step task and our gamified Cannon Blast are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Like the original, Cannon Blast consisted of 200 trials which was divided into two blocks of 100 trials. The first block was set at an easy difficulty, and the second at a medium difficulty. Level had no direct bearing on the core parameters-of-interest (which container participants select, rewards, drifts etc), and instead reflected how challenging the aim and shoot trajectory was. However as we explore in Experiment 2, level difficulty can be conceived of as a distraction manipulation. Easy levels included trials where the diamond did not move, had static obstructions that limited the angle at which it could be hit, or where diamonds moved slowly around the screen. Medium difficulty levels included more challenging trials with both moving diamonds and moving obstructions (Supplementary Table 2). While on average medium trials are more difficult than easy (average hit rate Medium = 45%, Easy = 52%), there was variation within both Easy levels (hit rates 83%, 53%, 44%, 29%) and Medium (hit rates 75%, 20%, 39%, 45%) (Supplementary Table 2). Reward probabilities in Cannon Blast were set higher on average (average reward probability: AA = 0.80 [0.64–0.94], AB = 0.72 [0.41–0.94], BA = 0.72 [0.41–0.94], BB = 0.64 [0.41–0.94]) than the original task (mean reward probability = 0.52 [0.25–0.75]) to promote enjoyment and limit frustration. In contrast to the traditional two-step task, which includes 40 practice trials, Cannon Blast starts with a short, passive walk-through demonstration of the task (Supplementary Figure 1). While the traditional task design has both first- (choice of rocket) and second-stage (choice of alien) actions, Cannon Blast has first-stage (choice of container) actions only. The decision to remove second-stage actions was in part done for gameplay reasons but also has been shown to increase the importance of model-based contributions in the first stage choice. A final major distinction between the tasks was the stated goal; in the traditional task, participants are directly told to earn rewards (space treasure). In Cannon Blast, participants are told to shoot as many diamonds as possible, and that this can be facilitated by ensuring they maximise rewards (good balls).

### Defining low-risk high hyperdiploidy in patients with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a retrospective analysis of data from the UKALL97 / 99 and UKALL2003 clinical trials [^fada44fe]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

High hyperdiploidy is the most common genetic subtype of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and is associated with a good outcome. However, some patients relapse and, given its prevalence, patients with high hyperdiploidy account for a large proportion of all relapses. We aimed to evaluate putative risk factors and determine the optimal pattern of trisomies for predicting outcome.

Methods

We used discovery and validation cohorts from consecutive trials — UKALL97/99 (n = 456) and UKALL2003 (n = 725) — to develop the prognostic profile. UKALL97/99 recruited patients aged 1–18 years between Jan 1, 1997, and June 15, 2002, and UKALL2003 recruited children and young adults aged 1–24 years between Oct 1, 2003, and June 30, 2001, from the UK and Ireland who were newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation testing was performed on pre-treatment bone marrow samples by regional UK National Health Service genetic laboratories or centrally by the Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, and results were reported using established nomenclature and definitions. We examined the prognostic effect of previously proposed genetic and non-genetic risk factors among patients with high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated on UKALL2003. We used Bayesian information criterion, targeted projection pursuit, and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal number of trisomies, and best subset regression and multivariate analysis to identify the optimal combination. Survival analysis considered three endpoints, as follows: event-free survival, defined as time to relapse, second tumour, or death, censored at last contact; relapse rate, defined as time to relapse for those reaching complete remission, censored at death in remission or last contact; and overall survival, defined as time to death, censored at last contact.

Findings

The median follow-up time for UKALL97/99 was 10·59 years (IQR 9·25–12·06) and 9·40 years (8·00–11·55) for UKALL2003. UKALL97/99 included 208 female patients and 248 male patients, and UKALL2003 included 345 female patients and 380 male patients. We deduced that the trisomic status of four chromosomes provided the optimal information for predicting outcome. The good risk profile comprised karyotypes with +17 and +18 or +17 or +18 in the absence of +5 and +20. All remaining cases were classified in the poor risk profile. The ratio of patients with good risk and poor risk was 82:18 and 80:20 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. In the validation cohort, patients with the high hyperdiploid good risk profile had an improved response to treatment compared with other patients with high hyperdiploidy at 10 years (relapse rate 5% [95% CI 3–7] vs 16% [10–23]; p < 0·0001; event-free survival 92% [90–94] vs 81% [73–86]; p < 0·0001; and overall survival 96% [94–97] vs 86% [79–91]; p < 0·0001). The outcome for high hyperdiploid poor risk patients was similar to that of patients with an intermediate cytogenetic profile. The prognostic effect of the UKALL high hyperdiploid profile was independent of minimal residual disease and the profile outperformed other high hyperdiploid risk profiles.

Interpretation

Future clinical trials and treatment protocols using high hyperdiploidy as a risk stratification factor should consider modifying the definition beyond chromosome count to incorporate this novel UKALL high hyperdiploid profile.

Treatment algorithm for former smokers — relapse risk assessment and timing: Determining the risk of relapse to smoking is the key assessment step for former smokers, assessed by asking how much time has passed since the individual's last use of tobacco products. Most relapses occur within days to weeks after initiating a quit attempt; the risk of relapse remains high for the first month and declines gradually over the next 3 months, but relapses still do occur even after 1 year of abstinence from smoking. Another useful question is how confident a smoker is that he/she will stay quit for the next year, which can be done using a 1 to 10 scale, where 1 indicates "not at all confident" and 10, very confident.

### The LEADING guideline: reporting standards for expert panel, best-estimate diagnosis, and longitudinal expert all data (LEAD) methods [^08f9a5f2]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Delphi survey results

The criteria for including a reporting standard was that the median of Delphi expert responses was at least 6 = Agree on the question about its inclusion. In Round 1, the mean ratings for the item inclusion scale ranged from 5.37 to 6.67 (M = 6.06; SD = 0.31; Table S2) with a median agreement ranging from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree. No new standards were suggested. The feedback resulted in the removal of one reporting standard and the clarification and reformulation of 20 standards. The standard on Transparency and replicability was rated as relevant but removed because it is achieved by reporting the other reporting standards. Standard 4.2 Validity and Standard needed a major clarification about the meaning of validity as well as standard. Minor clarifications and reformations, such as grammar or word changes, were made for 19 standards (see open material). The mean ratings in Round 2 ranged from 5.47 to 6.70 (M = 6.20; SD = 0.37; Table S3), with open feedback resulting in minor clarifications and reformulations of nine standards.

2.3. Refining the guideline through expert consensus

The authors finalized the guidelines in an expert consensus meeting. The meeting was held online with nine working and steering group members. The content and structure of the consensus meeting were prepared by the working group, and the meeting was led by the last author (O.K.). Participants had access to the guidelines, inclusion rationales (i.e. elaboration and explanation), and the drafted paper before the meeting, where they also had the option to provide comments and feedback in writing. The meeting included reviewing the Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 findings and discussing the paper draft, including the individual reporting standards and groups. We decided not to carry out another Delphi round since i) the median agreement for each reporting standard in both Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 ranged from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree, ii) no new standards were suggested, and iii) only minor changes were needed after Round 2, which taken together suggest consensus.

### Continuous and differential improvement in worldwide access to hematopoietic cell transplantation: activity has doubled in a decade with a notable increase in unrelated and non-identical related donors [^ec79ec7f]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 4.
Trend of disease stage at transplant for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. (A) The proportion of non-first complete remission (CR1) is decreased by approximately 10% globally as a sign that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are transplanted earlier in their disease stage. (B) Similar applies to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), although the amount of decrease in the proportion of non-CR1 is approximately 5%. (C) Trends in the proportion of > 1 st chronic phase (> 1CP) in overall chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is approaching 80% in region of Americas (AMR), North and South-East Asian region and Western Pacific region (SEAR/WPR), followed by 50–60% in other regions.

Donor/stem cell sources that contributed to improved access to allogeneic HCT showed different trends in each WHO region, but all regions were marked by an increase in the percentage of HCT from other related donors, the majority of whom were haploidentical donors. In many countries where the number of siblings is limited, the chance of finding a healthy HLA-identical sibling donor capable of providing hematopoietic stem cells is estimated to be about 25%, and this probability decreases further as the patient population ages. Therefore, increasing the number of HCT from other related donors or unrelated donors is a prerequisite for improving HCT accessibility. HCT from an unrelated donor is a well-studied and well-established treatment with an increasingly favorable outcome, survival outcomes after allele-level HLA-matched HCT outcomes are now equivalent to that of HLA-identical sibling. The matching of HLA at a high-resolution level for unrelated donors has been repeatedly confirmed in studies worldwide, and overall, an HLA single mismatch in HCT from an unrelated donor is considered to reduce survival probabilities by 5% to 10% in the context of calcineurin inhibitor plus methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis.

### Clinically defining and managing high-risk pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^c7073909]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

For children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the identification of those at higher risk of disease recurrence and modifying therapy based on this risk is a critical component to the provision of optimal care. The specific definitions of high-risk ALL vary across cooperative groups, but the themes are consistent, being largely based on leukemia biology and disease response. Intensification of conventional chemotherapy for those with high-risk disease has led to improved outcomes. It is anticipated that the development of rational targeted therapy for specific biologically unique subsets of children with leukemia will contribute to ongoing progress in improving the outcomes for children with acute lymphoblastic anemia.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — For patients, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas a conditional recommendation means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not" and "Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risk, values, and preferences". For clinicians, strong implies "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional notes "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". For policy makers, strong means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional states "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong indicates "The recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendation", while conditional notes "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional rather than strong recommendation will help identify possible research gaps".

ACC/AHA class of recommendation (COR) determination — FDA approval status is not a deciding factor: The answer is NO, and COR reflects "the strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk". FDA approval does not assess the benefit‑to‑risk ratio and "cannot be factored into the COR designation". COR 1 applies when benefits markedly outweigh hazards ("benefit > > > risk"), whereas COR 2a and COR 2b correspond to lower benefit‑to‑risk ratios ("benefit > > risk and benefit > risk, respectively").

Model building, regression and choice of methods

Inappropriate sensitivity analyses (eg, exclusion of 'outliers', 'leave one out' analyses in meta-analysis)

'Sensitivity analysis' is used in a wide variety of ways in different fields; even within medicine, a quick Google search finds a bewildering set of examples. In general, sensitivity analyses should be conducted to investigate the robustness (Note that this is robustness in a statistical, rather than a medical sense. That is, resistance to outliers) of analysis results where assumptions may have been made within statistical methods, or in the presence of 'problems' within the analysis (eg, missing data). Like all statistical methods, sensitivity analyses should be prespecified and specific. Data-driven sensitivity analyses, such as 'leave one out' analyses in meta-analysis and exclusion of observed 'outliers' from datasets are generally not recommended as such analyses may result in exclusion of valid data and selective reporting and increase the risk of statistical type I error where multiple sensitivity analyses are conducted. Post hoc sensitivity analyses must be carefully justified and be sure to say what, exactly, you are testing.

Variable selection via stepwise, backward, forward, bivariate screening

Variable selection in regression models is part art and part science and a variety of methods can be used. But one thing is clear; the methods in this topic heading are generally not good! They result in p values that are too low, SEs that are too small and parameter estimates that are biased away from 0. Ideally, you would use expert knowledge to select variables, but if you must use an automated method, LASSO is not bad.

Overuse of linear regression

Linear regression is one of the most common statistical methods and it has many legitimate uses. But there are many tools that were either recently invented or that recently became practical because of increases in computer speed, where 'recent' may be 'last 50 years'. Some examples are multivariate adaptive regression splines, all sorts of regression trees and related methods, quantile regression, 'big' data (where 'big' keeps on changing), and permutation and randomisation tests. Authors should consider these advancements when deciding how to apply regression to their data.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^68445d5f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient decision aids are interventions designed to support people making health decisions. At a minimum, patient decision aids make the decision explicit, provide evidence-based information about the options and associated benefits/harms, and help clarify personal values for features of options. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2003 and last updated in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the effects of patient decision aids in adults considering treatment or screening decisions using an integrated knowledge translation approach.

Search Methods

We conducted the updated search for the period of 2015 (last search date) to March 2022 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, EBSCO, and grey literature. The cumulative search covers database origins to March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included published randomized controlled trials comparing patient decision aids to usual care. Usual care was defined as general information, risk assessment, clinical practice guideline summaries for health consumers, placebo intervention (e.g. information on another topic), or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened citations for inclusion, extracted intervention and outcome data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Primary outcomes, based on the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS), were attributes related to the choice made (informed values-based choice congruence) and the decision-making process, such as knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, feeling informed, clear values, participation in decision-making, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were choice, confidence in decision-making, adherence to the chosen option, preference-linked health outcomes, and impact on the healthcare system (e.g. consultation length). We pooled results using mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), applying a random-effects model. We conducted a subgroup analysis of 105 studies that were included in the previous review version compared to those published since that update (n = 104 studies). We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

This update added 104 new studies for a total of 209 studies involving 107,698 participants. The patient decision aids focused on 71 different decisions. The most common decisions were about cardiovascular treatments (n = 22 studies), cancer screening (n = 17 studies colorectal, 15 prostate, 12 breast), cancer treatments (e.g. 15 breast, 11 prostate), mental health treatments (n = 10 studies), and joint replacement surgery (n = 9 studies). When assessing risk of bias in the included studies, we rated two items as mostly unclear (selective reporting: 100 studies; blinding of participants/personnel: 161 studies), due to inadequate reporting. Of the 209 included studies, 34 had at least one item rated as high risk of bias. There was moderate-certainty evidence that patient decision aids probably increase the congruence between informed values and care choices compared to usual care (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.13; 21 studies, 9377 participants). Regarding attributes related to the decision-making process and compared to usual care, there was high-certainty evidence that patient decision aids result in improved participants' knowledge (MD 11.90/100, 95% CI 10.60 to 13.19; 107 studies, 25,492 participants), accuracy of risk perceptions (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.34; 25 studies, 7796 participants), and decreased decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -10.02, 95% CI -12.31 to -7.74; 58 studies, 12,104 participants), indecision about personal values (MD -7.86, 95% CI -9.69 to -6.02; 55 studies, 11,880 participants), and proportion of people who were passive in decision-making (clinician-controlled) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.88; 21 studies, 4348 participants). For adverse outcomes, there was high-certainty evidence that there was no difference in decision regret between the patient decision aid and usual care groups (MD -1.23, 95% CI -3.05 to 0.59; 22 studies, 3707 participants). Of note, there was no difference in the length of consultation when patient decision aids were used in preparation for the consultation (MD -2.97 minutes, 95% CI -7.84 to 1.90; 5 studies, 420 participants). When patient decision aids were used during the consultation with the clinician, the length of consultation was 1.5 minutes longer (MD 1.50 minutes, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.20; 8 studies, 2702 participants). We found the same direction of effect when we compared results for patient decision aid studies reported in the previous update compared to studies conducted since 2015.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to usual care, across a wide variety of decisions, patient decision aids probably helped more adults reach informed values-congruent choices. They led to large increases in knowledge, accurate risk perceptions, and an active role in decision-making. Our updated review also found that patient decision aids increased patients' feeling informed and clear about their personal values. There was no difference in decision regret between people using decision aids versus those receiving usual care. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of patient decision aids on adherence and downstream effects on cost and resource use.

### Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions [^94f18aaf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Decision aids prepare people to participate in 'close call' decisions that involve weighing benefits, harms, and scientific uncertainty.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of decision aids for people facing difficult treatment or screening decisions.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1966 to July 2006); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library; 2006, Issue 2); CINAHL (Ovid) (1982 to July 2006); EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to July 2006); and PsycINFO (Ovid) (1806 to July 2006). We contacted researchers active in the field up to December 2006. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included published RCTs of interventions designed to aid patients' decision making by providing information about treatment or screening options and their associated outcomes, compared to no intervention, usual care, and alternate interventions. We excluded studies in which participants were not making an active treatment or screening decision, or if the study's intervention was not available to determine that it met the minimum criteria to qualify as a patient decision aid.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts for inclusion, and extracted data from included studies using standardized forms. The primary outcomes focused on the effectiveness criteria of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration: attributes of the decision and attributes of the decision process. We considered other behavioural, health, and health system effects as secondary outcomes. We pooled results of RCTs using mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR) using a random effects model.

Main Results

This update added 25 new RCTs, bringing the total to 55. Thirty-eight (69%) used at least one measure that mapped onto an IPDAS effectiveness criterion: decision attributes: knowledge scores (27 trials); accurate risk perceptions (11 trials); and value congruence with chosen option (4 trials); and decision process attributes: feeling informed (15 trials) and feeling clear about values (13 trials). This review confirmed the following findings from the previous (2003) review. Decision aids performed better than usual care interventions in terms of: a) greater knowledge (MD 15.2 out of 100; 95% CI 11.7 to 18.7); b) lower decisional conflict related to feeling uninformed (MD -8.3 of 100; 95% CI -11.9 to -4.8); c) lower decisional conflict related to feeling unclear about personal values (MD -6.4; 95% CI -10.0 to -2.7); d) reduced the proportion of people who were passive in decision making (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.8); and e) reduced proportion of people who remained undecided post-intervention (RR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8). When simpler decision aids were compared to more detailed decision aids, the relative improvement was significant in knowledge (MD 4.6 out of 100; 95% CI 3.0 to 6.2) and there was some evidence of greater agreement between values and choice. In this review, we were able to explore the use of probabilities in decision aids. Exposure to a decision aid with probabilities resulted in a higher proportion of people with accurate risk perceptions (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9). The effect was stronger when probabilities were measured quantitatively (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) versus qualitatively (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5). As in the previous review, exposure to decision aids continued to demonstrate reduced rates of: elective invasive surgery in favour of conservative options, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9); and use of menopausal hormones, detailed versus simple aid (RR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.0). There is now evidence that exposure to decision aids results in reduced PSA screening, decision aid versus usual care (RR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7 to 1.0). For other decisions, the effect on decisions remains variable. As in the previous review, decision aids are no better than comparisons in affecting satisfaction with decision making, anxiety, and health outcomes. The effects of decision aids on other outcomes (patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, continuance, resource use) were inconclusive. There were no trials evaluating the IPDAS decision process criteria relating to helping patients to recognize a decision needs to be made, understand that values affect the decision, or discuss values with the practitioner.

Authors' Conclusions

Patient decision aids increase people's involvement and are more likely to lead to informed values-based decisions; however, the size of the effect varies across studies. Decision aids have a variable effect on decisions. They reduce the use of discretionary surgery without apparent adverse effects on health outcomes or satisfaction. The degree of detail patient decision aids require for positive effects on decision quality should be explored. The effects on continuance with chosen option, patient-practitioner communication, consultation length, and cost-effectiveness need further evaluation.

### Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-25 years of progress [^600234fb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute lymphoblastic leukemia:

- **Definition**: ALL is a hematological malignancy that originates from B- or T-lymphoid progenitor cells and is characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature lymphoid cells within the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ALL is complex and involves a variety of genetic abnormalities that disrupt normal cell maturation and promote the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ALL is estimated at 1.8 per 100,000 person-years in the US and 2.75 per 100,000 person-years in Europe.
- **Disease course**: ALL typically presents with symptoms such as fever, pallor, bleeding, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Patients may also have lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In some cases, musculoskeletal manifestations may be the only initial presenting symptom.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is based on age at diagnosis, WBC count at presentation, and the presence of certain genetic changes. The outcome for older adults (≥ 40 years) and patients with relapsed or refractory ALL remains poor.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^d68115c4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma guideline recommendation strength — implications for stakeholders are outlined for strong versus conditional recommendations as follows: For individuals with asthma, most individuals would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not under a strong recommendation, whereas most would want the suggested course of action, but many would not under a conditional recommendation. For clinicians, under a strong recommendation most individuals should receive the intervention and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed; under a conditional recommendation different choices will be appropriate, shared decision making is urged, and decision aids may be useful to help individuals make decisions consistent with their risks, values, and preferences. For policymakers, under a strong recommendation the recommendation can be adopted as policy or performance measure and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator, whereas under a conditional recommendation policy making will require substantial debate and performance measures should assess whether decision making is documented. For researchers, under a strong recommendation credible research or other convincing judgments make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation, though on occasion it may be based on low or very low certainty and further research may provide important information that alters the recommendations; under a conditional recommendation the recommendation is likely to be strengthened by additional research and evaluation of the conditions and criteria can help identify possible research gaps. Strong recommendations are indicated by statements that lead with "We recommend", whereas conditional recommendations are indicated by statements that lead with "We conditionally recommend".

### Is a one-size-fits-all'12-month rule' appropriate when it comes to the last search date in systematic reviews? [^71179c4e]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Background

SRs are a recognised research approach for identifying, synthesising and analysing published evidence on topics of interest. Their aim is to provide a comprehensive, unbiased and trustworthy assessment of available evidence to support decision-makers in adopting policies that 'do more good than harm'. Indeed, policy makers, researchers, practitioners and public stakeholders from within and outside of healthcare, place increased emphasis on the importance of conducting SRs. Although the rationale for conducting SRs remains the same, the process of systematic reviewing has changed significantly in recent years. Technological advances and automation have helped to speed up processes such as study identification. However, additional steps in the review process, reflecting new understandings about how to ensure SR findings are robust and relevant to policy decision-makers' questions, have increased the work required. Continued increases in available published evidence have also increased the volume of research included and analysed in SRs. We suggest that there are two key factors that have significant time implications for reviewers today.

Breadth and depth of review questions impacts on the extent of work required

While historically SR questions were designed to be narrow, the Cochrane Handbook recognises that 'Increasingly, reviews are becoming broader, aiming, for example, to identify which intervention — out of a range of treatment options — is most effective, or to investigate how an intervention varies depending on implementation and participant characteristics'. Review methods have evolved, resulting in a rich diversity of SRs in relation to the types of questions, review approaches and research methods. In figure 1, we provide examples to characterise different types of reviews that explore intervention effectiveness and the questions they seek to answer. Although we focus on reviews addressing intervention effectiveness, the breadth and complexity of reviews addressing other types of question is also likely to vary.

Figure 1
Variation in the breadth and complexity of reviews addressing intervention effectiveness.

There are numerous factors that may impact on the time required to complete broad, complex or multicomponent reviews and thus increase their risk of remaining unpublished. Below we discuss six key factors.

### Dose transition pathways: the missing link between complex dose-finding designs and simple decision-making [^6c945bbf]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

The ever-increasing pace of development of novel therapies mandates efficient methodologies for assessment of their tolerability and activity. Evidence increasingly support the merits of model-based dose-finding designs in identifying the recommended phase II dose compared with conventional rule-based designs such as the 3 + 3 but despite this, their use remains limited. Here, we propose a useful tool, dose transition pathways (DTP), which helps overcome several commonly faced practical and methodologic challenges in the implementation of model-based designs. DTP projects in advance the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay, escalate, de-escalate, or stop early), using all the accumulated information. After specifying a model with favorable statistical properties, we utilize the DTP to fine-tune the model to tailor it to the trial's specific requirements that reflect important clinical judgments. In particular, it can help to determine how stringent the stopping rules should be if the investigated therapy is too toxic. Its use to design and implement a modified continual reassessment method is illustrated in an acute myeloid leukemia trial. DTP removes the fears of model-based designs as unknown, complex systems and can serve as a handbook, guiding decision-making for each dose update. In the illustrated trial, the seamless, clear transition for each dose recommendation aided the investigators' understanding of the design and facilitated decision-making to enable finer calibration of a tailored model. We advocate the use of the DTP as an integral procedure in the co-development and successful implementation of practical model-based designs by statisticians and investigators.

### Identifying relevant intersections in relation to motivation and attempt to stop smoking by using a combination of methods to develop robust predictive models and resampling techniques: a cross-sectional study of the German population [^7ac46751]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Regression models

MTSS

For the first outcome, application of ordinal regression models was planned in the study protocol. Initial analysis revealed violations of the proportional odds assumption, and therefore, multinomial regression models were chosen (Table S1). The seven categories of the MTSS‐scale were collapsed into three categories. The first category (absence of motivation) represents individuals without any intention to quit smoking (MTSS‐scale level 1 'I don't want to stop smoking'). The second category (unspecific motivation) covers those with moderate desire, but no intention to quit smoking (MTSS‐scale level 2 and 3, e.g. 'I think I should stop smoking but don't really want to'). Individuals who reported a strong desire, but no intention to quit or a moderate or strong desire and an intention to quit (MTSS‐scale level 4, 5, 6 and 7, e.g. ' = I really want to stop smoking and intend to in the next months'. were assigned to category three (motivation). The approach of collapsing categories is only partially methodologically justified by the violation of the proportional odds assumption. Nevertheless, the categories were collapsed on the basis of content‐related decisions and are not methodologically supported. As most variable selection approaches are not designed for multinomial regression models, best subset selection has been chosen (please see: Model training and validation).

QA

Our second outcome, the number of QAs, was recoded into a dichotomous variable 'past‐year quit attempt' (yes, ≥ 1 attempt vs. none). Multiple logistic regression models were used to describe the odds within the last 12 months. We followed a 2‐step approach for the choice of covariates: the functional form and interaction term were chosen using backward elimination (BE) in combination with Bayesian information criteria (BIC) (please see: Model training and validation).

The percent values in the figure represent the data at 24 months after transplantation. Shadings represent 95% confidence intervals. Hazard ratios (HRs) and p values were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model (a, b) and Fine & Gray's tests (c, d).* indicates p < 0.05.

When we compared the performance of the high-benefit approach to the conventional approaches of targeting all individuals eligible for MAC regimens (the population approach), young individuals (the modified population approach), or individuals with a high or very high rDRI (the high-risk approach), we found the strongest association in the high-benefit approach with a reduction in 1-year overall mortality (+5.93 percentage points [95% CI, 0.88 to 10.51]). In contrast, reductions observed with the high-risk approach (+3.84 percentage points [95% CI, −1.11 to 7.90]), the modified population approach (+2.87 percentage points [95% CI, −3.16 to 9.03]), and the population approach (reduction +2.05 percentage points [95% CI, −1.14 to 5.26]) were not significant (Table 3). These results suggest that the high-benefit-approach-guided utilization of intensified MAC regimens reduces 1-year overall death after transplantation in adult ALL patients more efficiently than conventional approaches.

### Mirtazapine as appetite stimulant in patients with NSCLC and anorexia… [^bceba098]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eTable 3. Hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity eTable
4. Visual Analogue Scale between intervention and control group eMethods Trial Protocol Data Sharing Statement Energy intake in patients with anorexia associated with lung cancer after 4 and 8 weeks of receiving placebo or mirtazapine. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico. Registered in clinical trials. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Normal distribution of variables was proved according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Means and standard deviation was calculated for variables with normal distribution and median with 25th and 75th percentile for variables without normal distribution. For categorical variables number and percentage were used as summary statistics.

Differences between groups were estimated with the t test for continuous variables with normal distribution, Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables without normal distribution, χ2 test and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Statistical significance was considered at P ≤.
05. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software from August to October
2022. A total of 134 patients were screened to participate from August 2018 through May 2022; 114 patients were assessed for eligibility and 28 were excluded. Reasons for ineligibility included 6 patients who did not meet eligibility criteria, 7 declined to participate, and 15 patients had major depressive disorder and were included in the open-label single-arm. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were overall balanced between the 2 arms. Overall, 41 patients were women, the mean age was 63. 5 years, 74 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scale score of 1, 63 had an adenocarcinoma subtype, 64 had stage IV NSCLC, and 50 received first-line treatment. Despite these encouraging findings, certain limitations mean that the results should be interpreted with caution. First, because this study was conducted at a single institution and had rigorous inclusion criteria, selection bias is possible. Second, the sample size was small, with a high dropout rate of patients, which could have resulted in false-positive results and study power loss.
