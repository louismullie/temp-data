## Question

moderate hepatomegaly without steatosis and normal labs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about moderate hepatomegaly without steatosis and with normal liver tests, including differential diagnosis, diagnostic strategy, and management considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the scenario and the implications of normal labs. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential by pathophysiology. Next, I will outline a history and examination framework, followed by a tiered investigation strategy. After that, I will define when to proceed to liver biopsy, consider special populations, and finish with management, follow-up, and prognostic notes, verifying each step against guidelines and evidence as I go [^117MpALN] [^1163SZ3e] [^115UN9Jy].

> Let me first confirm the core clinical premise: hepatomegaly is a structural sign that may herald significant disease even when aminotransferases, bilirubin, ALP, and synthetic function are normal; I need to ensure we do not falsely reassure based on normal labs alone. Wait, let me verify the evidence base — chronic liver diseases (viral hepatitis, MASLD, infiltrative disorders) can be silent biochemically, and normal ALT does not exclude necroinflammation or fibrosis, so the absence of steatosis on imaging should redirect but not pause evaluation [^115UN9Jy] [^1163SZ3e] [^116yoqq2].

> Next, I should review vascular and obstructive etiologies because they are potentially reversible and can present with hepatomegaly and initially normal or minimally abnormal liver tests; Budd–Chiari syndrome and hepatic vein thrombosis require Doppler ultrasound or MR venography, and congestive hepatopathy from right-sided heart failure can produce hepatomegaly with early subtle or even normal biochemistry, so I need to check for JVP elevation, edema, and cardiac findings before assuming a primary hepatic process [^117VQ2WS] [^113Fviv2].

> I will now examine infectious causes guided by exposure risks and prevalence; chronic HBV or HCV may present with hepatomegaly and normal transaminases in inactive or early disease, and parasitic infections such as schistosomiasis can cause non-steatotic hepatomegaly, so I should confirm travel and freshwater exposure, TB risk, and HIV status before deprioritizing infection — hold on, I should verify pediatric HCV data too, since hepatomegaly with mild or normal labs can occur in vertically infected cohorts [^113xyBma] [^112xPnk7].

> Let me consider hematologic and infiltrative malignancies because they are critical not to miss; lymphomas and leukemias commonly enlarge the liver with often nonspecific or late lab abnormalities, and amyloid light-chain deposition with or without myeloma can cause marked hepatomegaly — wait, I recall ALP may be hugely elevated in advanced amyloid, but it can be normal earlier, so I should confirm with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation if there are red flags such as weight loss or systemic symptoms [^113xyBma] [^116zyUJQ].

> I need to check genetic and metabolic disorders next, tailoring to age; in children and young adults, glycogen storage diseases (for example GSD III) and lysosomal storage diseases can present with large livers and normal or only mildly abnormal aminotransferases, while in adults Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency merit targeted screening even if routine chemistries are unremarkable — hold on, I should verify that ASMD nearly always has hepatosplenomegaly to keep it on the radar when spleen is enlarged too [^112oMSAg] [^111j5fSz] [^1125cVW3] [^114xb3Yo].

> But wait, what about autoimmune and granulomatous disease; autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary conditions, and sarcoidosis may present variably and sometimes with near-normal routine chemistries early. Hmm, wait a minute — my first instinct was that PSC invariably raises ALP; hold on, I should verify and not jump to conclusions, as early or small-duct disease may not show a classic cholestatic pattern initially, so a careful autoimmune panel still belongs in the workup if clinical suspicion exists [^117MpALN] [^112XLmib].

> Let me now think about neoplastic and focal processes; hepatocellular carcinoma can rarely occur without cirrhosis and with subtle labs early, and diffuse metastatic infiltration can enlarge the liver without overt cholestasis initially, whereas benign entities like FNH or adenoma typically cause focal rather than diffuse enlargement — so I should confirm parenchymal pattern on contrast-enhanced imaging and apply standard diagnostic frameworks when masses are present [^113xyBma] [^111fRPff] [^114HcQyH].

> Next, I should review the focused history to refine pretest probabilities; I need to check quantitative alcohol intake, metabolic risk factors, medications and supplements, travel and freshwater exposure, transfusion or injection risk, family history of liver disease, symptoms of heart failure, and B symptoms. Hold on, I should double-check that even in the setting of normal tests, a thorough systems review and targeted exam can surface the correct branch of the differential sooner and reduce unnecessary testing [^117MpALN] [^112Rymzo] [^113JkQRa].

> I will now examine the physical signs carefully; I should confirm true liver span and texture, look for stigmata of chronic liver disease, check jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema for congestion, palpate for lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly that might suggest infiltrative disease or portal hypertension, and assess for murmurs or signs of right heart dysfunction — wait, let me verify that spleen enlargement, when present, can tip me toward hematologic or storage etiologies and away from isolated focal liver disease [^112Rymzo] [^113xyBma] [^113Fviv2].

> Let me first confirm Phase 1 laboratory evaluation aligned with guidelines; even with normal baseline liver chemistries, I should obtain hepatitis B surface antigen and HCV antibody with reflex RNA if positive, autoimmune serologies (ANA, ASMA, AMA) with IgG, iron studies (ferritin and transferrin saturation), ceruloplasmin in appropriate ages, alpha-1 antitrypsin level, a CBC with differential and smear, and inflammatory markers when systemic disease is suspected, while considering AFP in the context of mass lesions or at-risk populations — hold on, I should review that this mirrors recommended first-line evaluation algorithms [^117MpALN] [^114NM8Lu].

> Next, I should review Phase 2 imaging for vascular and cardiac causes; a repeat targeted liver ultrasound with Doppler to assess hepatic veins, portal vein, and IVC is essential to exclude occult Budd–Chiari spectrum disease, and an echocardiogram should follow if there are any signs of right heart failure or pulmonary hypertension — let me confirm that early BCS and congestive hepatopathy can precede marked lab derangement, justifying these tests even when enzymes are normal [^117VQ2WS] [^113Fviv2].

> If ultrasound is inconclusive, I need to ensure advanced cross-sectional imaging; contrast-enhanced MRI or multiphasic CT can characterize diffuse versus focal processes, detect infiltrative malignancy, and apply standardized systems where focal lesions are present, which helps triage to biopsy versus surveillance — hold on, I should verify LI-RADS-based recommendations when HCC is in the differential to maintain diagnostic consistency [^111fRPff] [^115m9ixi].

> Phase 3 should be tailored by clues; if exposure suggests, I should confirm schistosomiasis with serology, and if red flags for plasma cell dyscrasia or amyloid exist, I should double-check with serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, adding HIV testing and TB IGRA when clinical context warrants — let me reconsider that a normal routine panel does not preclude these targeted diagnoses if the phenotype fits [^113xyBma] [^116zyUJQ].

> Decision point: when should I biopsy; if hepatomegaly persists and Phase 1–2 evaluations are unrevealing, or if infiltrative, granulomatous, or storage disease is suspected, image-guided liver biopsy becomes appropriate to identify patterns such as glycogen accumulation, amyloid deposition, granulomas, malignant infiltration, or unsuspected fibrosis — hold on, I should verify that biopsy is advised when imaging and serology cannot discriminate mimics of malignancy or infiltrative disease [^114dKge5] [^116zyUJQ].

> Special populations need separate consideration; in pediatrics, I should confirm that metabolic storage diseases and GSD III are relatively more likely and that pediatric HCV can present with subtle findings, while Wilson disease requires exclusion; in adults with prominent metabolic risk, I should remember that MASLD coexists frequently even if steatosis is not currently evident, and alcohol-metabolic interactions can modulate risk — wait, I need to ensure I'm not overattributing to MASLD when steatosis is absent but still keep cardiometabolic risk in view [^112oMSAg] [^112xPnk7] [^115w4Dqn] [^115dJ1oZ].

> Now, management should follow the identified cause; antivirals for HBV/HCV, disease-directed therapy for lymphoma or amyloidosis, phlebotomy for hemochromatosis, chelation for Wilson disease, and guideline-based care for congestive hepatopathy should be prioritized, and if no etiology is found, I should confirm a sensible plan of surveillance with periodic labs and imaging while optimizing metabolic health and advising alcohol abstinence given its synergistic harm in chronic liver diseases — let me double-check that abstinence is recommended across ALD and in MASLD with fibrosis to reduce progression risk [^117MpALN] [^112MLUgd] [^113EQisj] [^113XoUqa].

> I should confirm practical referral triggers; suspected malignancy or infiltrative disease, progressive hepatomegaly, or new red flags merit urgent hepatology input, whereas suspected cardiac congestion requires cardiology evaluation — hold on, I should verify that early specialist involvement improves time to diagnosis when imaging mimics are in play [^114dKge5] [^113Fviv2].

> Prognosis and follow-up require nuance; a negative initial workup with stable hepatomegaly may carry a favorable outlook with watchful monitoring, but infiltrative and malignant conditions vary widely in outcome and benefit from early detection; importantly, I need to remind myself that normal enzymes can mask clinically important liver disease, so longitudinal reassessment is warranted rather than a one-time dismissal — let me double-check that persistent abnormalities or structural changes justify continued surveillance [^116zyUJQ] [^115UN9Jy] [^113XoUqa].

> To summarize my decision pathway, I will not jump to conclusions based on normal labs; instead, I will confirm history and exam, execute core serologies and biomarkers, perform Doppler ultrasound and consider echocardiography, escalate to MRI or CT if needed, and proceed to biopsy when hepatomegaly remains unexplained or infiltrative disease is suspected, all while tailoring by age, risk, and exposure history — wait, I should verify each branch against guideline-supported steps to avoid unnecessary delays or missed diagnoses [^117MpALN] [^117VQ2WS] [^114dKge5].

Moderate hepatomegaly without steatosis and normal laboratory tests is most often due to **congestion from right-sided heart failure or valvular disease**, **infiltrative disorders (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma)** [^113xyBma], or **glycogen storage disease** [^1131SLpc]. Less common causes include polycystic liver disease, focal nodular hyperplasia [^113xyBma], or early Budd-Chiari syndrome [^117VQ2WS]. Evaluate with **echocardiography, CT/MRI** [^112bmYhi], and **targeted laboratory tests** (CBC, SPEP, ACE, autoimmune panel, viral serologies) [^117MpALN]; if results are inconclusive, **consider liver biopsy** [^114dKge5]. Management targets the **underlying cause** [^112Rymzo], and prognosis depends on the etiology and response to therapy.

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for moderate hepatomegaly without steatosis and normal laboratory tests includes:

| **Category** | **Specific conditions** |
|-|-|
| Congestive hepatopathy | - Right-sided heart failure [^113xyBma] <br/> - Constrictive pericarditis <br/> - Tricuspid regurgitation [^113Fviv2] |
| Infiltrative diseases | - Amyloidosis [^116zyUJQ] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^113xyBma] <br/> - Lymphoma <br/> - Leukemia <br/> - Glycogen storage diseases [^1131SLpc] |
| Vascular disorders | - Budd-Chiari syndrome (early stage) [^117VQ2WS] <br/> - Hepatic hemangioma <br/> - Arteriovenous malformations |
| Metabolic disorders | - Glycogen storage disease [^1131SLpc] <br/> - Wilson's disease (early stage) [^111j5fSz] <br/> - Hemochromatosis (early stage) [^113xyBma] |
| Infectious diseases | - Chronic hepatitis B or C (early stage) [^113xyBma] <br/> - Schistosomiasis <br/> - Brucellosis <br/> - Tuberculosis |
| Neoplastic conditions | - Hepatic adenoma [^113xyBma] <br/> - Focal nodular hyperplasia [^112HS9JQ] <br/> - Polycystic liver disease |

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain hepatomegaly without steatosis and normal laboratory tests:

- **Congestive hepatopathy**: Hepatic venous congestion from right-sided heart failure or valvular disease causes hepatomegaly without significant hepatocellular injury, keeping labs normal.

- **Infiltrative diseases**: Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and lymphoproliferative disorders enlarge the liver via infiltration without major hepatocyte injury, so labs may remain normal [^113xyBma].

- **Glycogen storage diseases**: Excess hepatic glycogen (e.g. hepatic glycogenosis) [^112oMSAg] enlarges the liver without significant hepatocellular injury, preserving normal labs.

- **Vascular disorders**: Early Budd-Chiari or hepatic hemangiomas can cause hepatomegaly without marked lab abnormalities.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential [^112Rymzo]:

- **Clinical history and examination**: Assess for heart failure, infiltrative disease, metabolic disorders, and infections [^1155Yms9].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, metabolic panel, viral hepatitis serologies, autoimmune panel, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and SPEP [^117MpALN].

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to assess liver size, structure, and vascular flow [^112bmYhi].

- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate for cardiac causes of hepatomegaly [^113Fviv2].

- **Liver biopsy**: Consider if noninvasive tests are inconclusive [^114dKge5].

---

## Prognosis and clinical significance

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause** [^1155Yms9]. In congestive hepatopathy, it hinges on cardiac disease severity and treatment effectiveness [^113Fviv2]; in infiltrative diseases, it varies by the specific disorder and response to therapy [^116zyUJQ]. For glycogen storage diseases, prognosis reflects metabolic control and complications [^112oMSAg]; in vascular disorders, it varies with disease severity and treatment response [^117VQ2WS].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on the **underlying cause**:

- **Congestive hepatopathy**: Treat heart failure or valvular disease [^113Fviv2].

- **Infiltrative diseases**: Disease-specific therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, immunosuppression) [^116zyUJQ].

- **Glycogen storage diseases**: Metabolic control and dietary management [^112oMSAg] [^1131SLpc].

- **Vascular disorders**: Anticoagulation or surgical intervention as indicated [^117VQ2WS].

---

Moderate hepatomegaly without steatosis and normal laboratory tests most often reflects **congestive, infiltrative, or metabolic causes** [^113xyBma]. A **structured workup** — history, targeted laboratory tests, imaging, and selective biopsy — is key to diagnosis [^112Rymzo]. Management and prognosis are determined by the **specific etiology** [^1155Yms9].

### Budd-Chiari syndrome — A review of the diagnosis and management [^117VQ2WS]. Acute Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Budd-Chiari syndrome:

- **Definition**: BCS is a liver disease that results from hepatic venous outflow obstruction characterized by a triad of abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, and ascites.

- **Pathophysiology**: Etiologies of BCS can be broadly classified into thrombotic causes (primary myeloproliferative diseases, underlying thrombophilia) and non-thrombotic causes (compression due to tumors of adjacent organs, polycystic kidney disease, parasitic liver disease).

- **Disease course**: Obstruction of hepatic veins increases sinusoidal pressure and reduces sinusoidal blood flow, leading to clinical manifestations of acute abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly or chronic symptoms of long-standing portal hypertension. Disease progression may result in fibrosis and fulminant hepatic failure.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year and 5-year mortality rate of treated BCS is 6% and 13%, respectively.

### Hepatic glycogenosis: a rare cause of hepatomegaly in type 1 diabetes mellitus [^1131SLpc]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2008). Low credibility.

Hepatomegaly, with or without abnormal liver function tests, is a common feature in both pediatric and adult patients with diabetes mellitus. We report a case involving a 16-year-old diabetic boy who presented with hepatomegaly, mildly elevated transaminases, and elevated serum lipids, which had not been previously noticed. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed hepatomegaly, and a liver biopsy indicated findings consistent with glycogenosis. The patient's abnormal liver function tests, elevated serum lipids, and hepatomegaly decreased over a period of 4 weeks with tight metabolic control.

This situation was attributed to overinsulinization, as the patient consumed an excessive quantity of food and thus administered an excessive quantity of insulin. In conclusion, hepatomegaly may occur in diabetic patients due to hepatic glycogen accumulation from excessive food and insulin intake. In hepatic glycogenosis, pathological findings improve within 4 weeks when good metabolic control is achieved. Therefore, other causes should be investigated if hepatomegaly persists for a longer period.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver, from the biliary epithelium, but is also found in abundance in bones and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys, and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone diseases, such as metastatic bone disease and bone fractures, and in cholestatic liver disease, for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases), and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis, indicated by elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin.

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency or the normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the bloodstream in response to hepatocyte injury or death, such as in hepatitis. Elevations in either of these enzymes are the most common abnormality seen on liver blood tests.

### Undetected hepatomegaly in obese children by primary care physicians: A pitfall in the diagnosis of pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^117T5ySR]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) relies on the initial detection of hepatomegaly or elevated serum aminotransferases by the primary care provider. In this investigation, the aptitude of the primary care provider to identify children with hepatomegaly and initiate an evaluation for NAFLD is determined. The physical examination findings and requests for diagnostic testing of 18 primary care physicians and pediatric gastroenterologists on 11 obese school-aged children, including a subset of children with hepatomegaly and NAFLD, were analyzed.

In children with NAFLD, clinicians detected hepatomegaly in 1.4% of encounters and requested serum liver chemistries in 12.5% of encounters. Hepatomegaly is detected poorly in obese children by primary care physicians, thereby increasing the likelihood of a delayed or omitted evaluation for NAFLD.

### A rare cause of severe hepatomegaly with an improving outcome [^116zyUJQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 43-year-old man presented with dyspnoea, a 15 kg weight loss, severe hepatomegaly, and an alkaline phosphatase level of 5400 U/L. Although examinations initially suggested cirrhosis, blood samples did not reveal any signs of underlying liver disease. Liver biopsy identified amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis, and bone marrow analysis showed multiple myeloma (MM). The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, the drugs of choice. He responded well to the treatment and has so far achieved partial response. Previously, MM was associated with a poor prognosis. However, due to improved treatment for AL, the patient can achieve a progression-free period with a good quality of life.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests involves identifying three common patterns of abnormal liver test results that can aid diagnosis:

- **Isolated raised bilirubin**: This is most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome and affects 5–8% of the population. Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. To confirm, repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and measure direct and indirect bilirubin. The total bilirubin should rise further due to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, exclude haemolysis by requesting a reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L), consider rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome and undertake genetic testing.

- **Cholestatic pattern**: Predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary obstruction (due to stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion, and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency, which is not liver-related, or may occur during periods of rapid growth in childhood. The presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, GGT is characteristically different.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Q87eu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

These updated guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests have been commissioned by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) under the auspices of the liver section of the BSG. The original guidelines, which this document supersedes, were written in 2000 and have undergone extensive revision by members of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG). The GDG comprises representatives from patient/carer groups (British Liver Trust, Liver4life, PBC Foundation, and PSC Support); elected members of the BSG liver section (including representatives from Scotland and Wales); British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL); Specialist Advisory Committee in Clinical Biochemistry/Royal College of Pathology and Association for Clinical Biochemistry; British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (BSPGHAN); Public Health England (implementation and screening); Royal College of General Practice; British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiologists (BSGAR); and Society of Acute Medicine. The quality of evidence and grading of recommendations was appraised using the AGREE II tool.

These guidelines deal specifically with the management of abnormal liver blood tests in children and adults in both primary and secondary care under the following subheadings:

- **What constitutes an abnormal liver blood test** and the parameters defining it.
- **What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel**: detailing the components included.
- **When should liver blood tests be checked** and the indications for testing.
- **Does the extent and duration of abnormal liver blood tests determine subsequent actions**: outlining the clinical decision-making process.

- **Laboratory and radiological exams before treatment**: Ultrasound before treatment was abnormal in 7 patients (24%): 5 had mild-moderate hepatomegaly (17%), with 1 (3%) also presenting a nonhomogeneous echo pattern, while 2 presented with mild steatosis (7%). Patients with hepatomegaly were 70% genotype 1 and 30% genotype 3. One patient with steatosis was also obese and was genotype 2. The median age of patients with pathologic ultrasound was 14 years; among those vertically infected, it was 14 years, and among those with horizontal infection (n = 3), it was a milder lower 13 years.

- **Laboratory and radiological exams after treatment**: After treatment, the ultrasound was normal in 4 out of 7 patients with alterations, and when alterations persisted, no further progression was observed (2 cases of mild hepatomegaly and 1 of steatosis).

TE (transient elastography) before treatment was performed in 26 out of 29 patients, showing a median stiffness of 5.4 kPa (range 2.7–14.6 kPa). Abnormal stiffness (N.V. < 7 kPa) was found in 9 (23%) (median 9.1 kPa, 7.1–14.6 kPa). The median age of patients with pathologic fibroscan was 17 ± 5.6 years for both vertically and horizontally infected subgroups. Four of them had hepatomegaly and/or nonhomogeneous echo patterns. TE after treatment was performed in 17 out of 29 patients and showed a median stiffness of 5.1 kPa (range 3.3–9.4 kPa). Among the 6 patients with altered stiffness, the median stiffness post-therapy was 7.9 kPa.

In exclusively HCV-treated patients (n = 29), a statistically significant difference was found in the values of AST and ALT pre- and post-therapy [respectively: t(55) = 4.592, P < 0.0001 and t(56) = 4.800, P < 0.0001].

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, specifically concerning indications for screening in adult patients, the EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend considering case-finding screening strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis in patients with the following cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis to potentially prevent progression to cirrhosis and its complications:

- **Overweight or obesity**: BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² (≥ 23 kg/m² in people of Asian ethnicity); waist circumference ≥ 94 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females (Europeans), ≥ 90 cm in males and ≥ 80 cm in females (South Asians and Chinese), ≥ 85 cm in males and ≥ 90 cm in females (Japanese).

- **Dysglycemia or T2DM**: Prediabetes, HbA1c 39–47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%) or fasting plasma glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–125 mg/dL) or 2-hour plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test 7.8–11 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL); T2DM, HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5%) or fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (≥ 126 mg/dL) or 2-hour plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (≥ 200 mg/dL); treatment for T2DM.

- **Dyslipidemia**: Plasma triglycerides ≥ 1.7 mmol/L (≥ 150 mg/dL); HDL-C ≤ 1.0 mmol/L (≤ 39 mg/dL) in males and ≤ 1.3 mmol/L (≤ 50 mg/dL) in females; lipid-lowering treatment.

- **Blood pressure**: ≥ 130/85 mmHg; treatment for hypertension.

### Non-invasive assessment of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease [^1128Ly2q]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects an estimated 25% of the global population and increasingly contributes to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. It encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions characterized by excessive accumulation of fat in the liver and is diagnosed following the exclusion of significant alcohol intake and other causes of chronic liver disease. In the majority of cases, it is due to overnutrition and is closely associated with metabolic risk factors. Despite being the most common cause of chronic liver disease, its name reflects what it is not, rather than what it is, and its definition is not aligned with the reality that more than one cause of chronic liver disease can be present in an individual patient.

Because of these fundamental issues, the term metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed. MAFLD is defined as hepatic steatosis in the presence of overweight or obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or more than two metabolic risk abnormalities. The new name and its definition bring better clarity to what the disease is and have been shown to have better clinical utility. However, the new term has not been universally adopted due to concerns about the impact on disease awareness, previous research based on the term NAFLD, and ongoing clinical trials for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

In this review on the non-invasive assessment of MAFLD, studies that were included were based on the term NAFLD unless stated otherwise. We believe that studies on non-invasive tests for NAFLD will continue to be relevant and informative.

### A new definition for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: An international expert consensus statement [^1164UyWK]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The exclusion of other chronic liver diseases, including "excess" alcohol intake, has until now been necessary to establish a diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, given our understanding of the pathogenesis of MAFLD and its rising prevalence, "positive criteria" to diagnose the disease are required. In this work, a panel of international experts from 22 countries proposes a new definition for the diagnosis of MAFLD that is both comprehensive and simple, and is independent of other liver diseases.

The criteria are based on evidence of hepatic steatosis, in addition to one of the following three criteria: overweight/obesity, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation. We propose that disease assessment and stratification of severity should extend beyond a simple dichotomous classification to steatohepatitis vs. non-steatohepatitis. The group also suggests a set of criteria to define MAFLD-associated cirrhosis and proposes a conceptual framework to consider other causes of fatty liver disease. Finally, we bring clarity to the distinction between diagnostic criteria and inclusion criteria for research studies and clinical trials. Reaching consensus on the criteria for MAFLD will help unify the terminology (e.g. for ICD-coding), enhance the legitimacy of clinical practice and clinical trials, improve clinical care, and move the clinical and scientific field of liver research forward.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113XoUqa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In response to abnormal liver blood tests, as indicated in Figure 1, the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes, it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to identify the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised due to inter-illness; however, when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% remained abnormal on retesting after one month, and even at two years, 75% still showed abnormal results. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests, it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a pediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

- **Figure 1 - Response to abnormal liver blood tests**: This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure, and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine the choice of pathway.

- **Collection of clinical data**: Data on hepatosplenomegaly were acquired through imaging techniques (preferably magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]; in some cases, ultrasound was used for patients with claustrophobia). Precise measurements of spleen and liver volumes were feasible only with MRI. In cases where ultrasound was used, the report indicated the presence of splenomegaly or hepatomegaly. Organ volumes were adjusted to body weight and expressed in multiples of normal (MN), assuming a normal spleen volume of 0.2% and a normal liver volume of 2.5% of body weight, with 1 kg equivalent to 1 L. Spleen and liver volumes in MN were used to express splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. For other analyses, such as correlation analysis and mixed-effect models, absolute volumes in milliliters were used, since spleen and liver volumes are only partially dependent on weight in adults.

- **Transient elastography**: Since 2020, transient elastography (TE) has been conducted within this cohort. TE measures liver stiffness and utilizes the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) to evaluate both liver steatosis and fibrosis. Based on guidelines for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), elevated CAP was defined as > 248 dB/m, indicating the presence of steatosis. A liver stiffness measurement above 7.1 kPa suggests the presence of fibrosis.

- **Pulmonary involvement**: Data on pulmonary involvement comprised high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans of the lungs and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO).

### Glycogen storage disease type III: Diagnosis, genotype, management, clinical course and outcome [^112oMSAg]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The condition known as glycogen storage disease type III (GSDIII) exhibits significant heterogeneity among individual patients. Most patients with GSDIII present clinically within their first year of life, with hepatomegaly being the primary symptom. Initially an acute childhood disease, GSDIII progresses into a chronic, progressive disorder affecting the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and bones in adulthood. The chronic complications and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus underscore the importance of closely monitoring the aging GSDIII cohort. There is a need for standardized quantitative clinical data collection, which can be achieved through an international longitudinal GSD patient registry and biobank.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as the disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as the disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels as compared with AST and ALT levels.

The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT is associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L for males and 19 to 25 IU/L for females; levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation.

- **Evaluation of hepatocellular injury**: Includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought.

- **Evaluation of alkaline phosphatase elevation**: For an elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be conducted.

### Assessing hepatomegaly: Automated volumetric analysis of the liver [^112bmYhi]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to define volumetric nomograms for identifying hepatomegaly and to retrospectively evaluate the performance of radiologists in assessing hepatomegaly.

- **Materials and methods**: Livers were automatically segmented from 148 abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans, which included 77 normal livers and 71 cases of hepatomegaly (diagnosed by visual inspection and/or linear liver height by radiologists). Quantified liver volumes were compared to manual measurements using volume overlap and error. Liver volumes were normalized to body surface area, from which hepatomegaly nomograms were defined as H scores by analyzing the distribution of liver sizes in the healthy population. H scores were validated against consensus reports. The performance of radiologists in diagnosing hepatomegaly was retrospectively evaluated.

- **Results**: The automated segmentation of livers was robust, with volume overlap and error of 96.2% and 2.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences (P > .10) between manual and automated segmentation for either the normal or the hepatomegaly subgroup. The average volumes of normal and enlarged livers were 1.51 ± 0.25 and 2.32 ± 0.75 L, respectively. One-way analysis of variance found that body surface area (P = 0.004) and gender (P = 0.02), but not age, significantly affected normal liver volume. No significant effects were observed for two-way and three-way interactions among the three variables (P > .18). H-score cutoffs of 0.92 and 1.08 L/m² were used to define mild and massive hepatomegaly at a 95% confidence interval.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^115iJJJh]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Each group produced a list of important topics in the NAFLD diagnosis and management pathway to address within the standards document. A literature search was conducted using PubMed Medline to identify relevant original research papers and existing guidelines up to the end of June 2021. Specific statements were then made by each group, informed by the quality of the evidence evaluated in line with the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. SM and WA amalgamated the draft statements from the three working parties and removed any duplication.

An anonymous modified Delphi voting process was conducted individually by each member of the working group using an online survey tool to assess the level of agreement with each statement on a five-point scale (strongly disagree [SD], disagree [D], neutral [N], agree [A], or strongly agree [SA]). Given the multidisciplinary nature of the working group, members could abstain from questions that related to areas outside their usual clinical practice (for example, a dietician may not feel qualified to make clinical decisions regarding when to perform a liver biopsy). After each round of voting, statements were redrafted where necessary through discussions via teleconference meetings and email.

'Agreement' was defined when statements received a score of 'strongly agree' or 'agree'. Statements were included where agreement was ≥ 80%, after exclusion of any abstains. The result of this process produced a series of recommendations, with a corresponding level of expert agreement and grading of the relevance.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1163SZ3e]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Duration of abnormality and retesting

As with the extent of liver blood test derangement, there are assumptions that the duration reflects clinical significance, thus necessitating routine repeat testing for patients with mildly abnormal liver blood tests. This is based on the belief that many liver blood test abnormalities may be transient and incidental and will normalize, precluding significant liver disease. While this may be true of some acute liver diseases, it is not the case for many chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) where normal liver blood tests do not necessarily imply the absence or resolution of disease.

Moreover, as demonstrated by the BALLETS study, 84% of adults still had abnormal tests when repeated one month later. When repeating blood tests (to see if they have normalized), the whole cost of the investigation must be considered, including recalling the patient, obtaining and transporting the blood sample to the laboratory, and the cost of the laboratory analysis. Therefore, a strategy of simply repeating abnormal tests can only be justified where there is a high degree of certainty that the abnormality will resolve in response to an identified acute insult. In other cases, detection of the first abnormality should trigger an investigation of the etiology or repeat testing to assess progression or disease severity where there is a suspicion that the underlying cause may require urgent referral or admission.

The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Identification of people with NAFLD

Use of defined pathways for the investigation of suspected liver disease has been shown to increase the diagnosis of significant liver disease and reduce unnecessary referrals. Therefore, services should have an agreed local clinical pathway for the investigation of suspected liver disease that includes an assessment for liver fibrosis using available non-invasive liver fibrosis tests. Key aspects to consider when developing pathways are described below.

NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, defined as any three of the following: impaired fasting glucose or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, increased waist circumference, or high blood pressure. NAFLD is highly prevalent in those with T2DM or the metabolic syndrome, and the presence of these risk factors is associated with more progressive liver disease in NAFLD. Therefore, consider the possibility of liver fibrosis due to NAFLD in those with Type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.

Proactive assessment for the presence of liver fibrosis in patients at risk can permit earlier identification of significant liver disease. The 'Scarred Liver Project', which offered community fibrosis testing to people with diabetes or obesity, alongside those with hazardous alcohol consumption, identified 3,688 patients at risk from a cohort of 25,018. Overall, 20% of at-risk individuals who attended a follow-up clinic had evidence of significant liver disease.

### Nafld vs masld (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) - why the need for a change of nomenclature [^115w4Dqn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Several reasons led to the change in nomenclature from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD); the most important being limitations due to the reliance on exclusionary confounder terms and the use of potentially stigmatizing language (the terms "nonalcoholic" and "fatty"). The new name was decided through a Delphi process and now includes the metabolic origin in the name and definition (the presence of at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors) without the stigmatizing terms. The recognition of a new category termed "metabolic and alcohol related/associated liver disease" (MetALD) opens up a new area for exploration, although the relative contribution of alcohol and metabolic risk factors requires further evaluation, as does the evidencing at a patient rather than population level.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma [^111fRPff]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The EASL 2025 guidelines provide detailed recommendations for the screening and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. For the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC, it is advised to utilize the Liver Imaging-Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria, specifically the CT/MRI version 2018 or the contrast-enhanced ultrasound version 2017.

- **CT/MRI imaging features**: To arrive at a diagnosis, combine major imaging features including tumor size, rim and non-rim arterial hyperenhancement, peripheral and non-peripheral washout (in the portal venous or delayed phases on CT and MRI using extracellular contrast agents or gadobenate dimeglumine, or in the portal venous phase only with MRI using gadoxetic acid), enhancing capsule, and threshold growth.

- **Ultrasound criteria**: For contrast-enhanced ultrasound, combine non-rim arterial hyperenhancement with late-onset (greater than 60 seconds) and washout of mild intensity to establish diagnosis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115L7iqZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

While the number of deaths from other common conditions is falling in the UK, those due to liver disease have been increasing dramatically, with a 400% increase in the standardized mortality rate over the period 1970–2010. Notably, for patients younger than 65, the rise in standardized mortality rate for liver disease is greater than 500%, making it the fifth biggest cause of premature mortality, with 64,000 years of working life lost every year.

For morbidity, in England as well as Wales, 57,682 hospital admissions and 10,948 deaths were due to liver disease in 2012. This rising burden of liver disease mainly reflects the three most common causes: alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and viral hepatitis, although autoimmune liver disease is also a significant contributor.

The burden of liver disease in children differs from that in adults. Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in all ages, reflecting the rise in childhood obesity, disease associated with injecting drug use and alcohol is rarely encountered. However, viral hepatitis is seen as a consequence of perinatal transmission, and its chronicity contributes to the disease burden seen in adults. Other causes of liver disease, such as biliary atresia or metabolic disorders, present almost exclusively in infancy or childhood, but progressive liver disease continues to evolve throughout childhood and into adulthood.

There are concerted efforts to deal with this rising tide of liver disease, such as the Lancet Commission on Liver Disease.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The extent of abnormality in liver blood tests is often assumed to correlate with prognosis, leading to the use of threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval for further investigation. However, this assumption lacks support from the literature. Prognosis is more accurately determined by diagnosis and the context in which the tests are requested.

To illustrate, consider two patients: one with an acute hepatitis A infection who can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, and another with hepatitis C whose ALT might be within the normal reference interval. Ten years later, the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well regardless of management, whereas the untreated patient with hepatitis C faces a substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease.

Indeed, the common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Despite increased liver blood test usage, patients often present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, potentially preventable with earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many liver enzymes, such as ALT, may be too high. This likely results from including patients with occult NAFLD in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

### Hepatic steatosis in patients with acromegaly [^116PPAF7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

This study recruited adult patients diagnosed with acromegaly from within the Department of Medicine II at Saarland University Medical Center, who were willing to provide informed consent for participation. The diagnosis of acromegaly was based on IGF-1 concentrations in blood and the absence of growth hormone suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Patients were excluded if they presented with chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection; had significant long-term alcohol consumption that surpassed 21 and 14 standard alcoholic drinks per week for men and women, respectively; were taking steatogenic medications; or presented with monogenic hereditary liver diseases. The study was approved by the Ärztekammer des Saarlandes local ethical committee (Refs. #271/11 and #67/16) and conducted within the framework of the Declaration of Helsinki.

- **Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical assessments**: Height and weight were recorded together with transient elastography using a stadiometer and a scale (seca 217 and seca 701, respectively; Seca), from which body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Waist circumference (WC) was obtained, and a full medical history was taken, which included previous and current medications. Fasted blood samples were collected for routine analyses, including liver function tests, serum lipids, and relevant hormones. Specifically, the following parameters were quantified: surrogate markers for liver function, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP).

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^115UN9Jy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages. Significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present in individuals with persistently normal ALT levels, such as HBV and HCV carriers, or in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

In order to characterize the natural course of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS)-associated hepatopathy, we evaluated liver biochemistry and imaging findings and their evolution with age in patients with SDS and verified SBDS mutations.

- **Study design**: Retrospective and cross-sectional liver imaging, biochemical, and histologic data of 12 patients (age range 2.1 to 37 years) with SBDS mutations were analyzed. Hepatic volume and parenchymal structure were determined from magnetic resonance imaging data.

- **Results**: Hepatomegaly and aminotransaminase elevation were observed in most of the patients with SDS at an early age; values normalized by age 5 years and remained normal over extended follow-up. Mild to moderate serum bile acid elevation was noted in 7 patients (58%). On magnetic resonance imaging, no patients (n = 11) had evidence of hepatic steatosis, cirrhosis, or fibrosis. Three middle-aged patients had hepatic microcysts.

- **Conclusions**: SDS-associated hepatopathy has an overall good prognosis. No major hepatic abnormalities developed during extended follow-up to adulthood. Mild cholestasis in follow-up, even after normalization of transaminase levels, may reflect primary alterations in liver metabolism in SDS.

### Zytiga [^1129d9Ce]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dose modification guidelines in hepatic impairment and hepatotoxicity**: In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), reduce the recommended dose of Zytiga to 250 mg once daily. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment, and monthly thereafter. If elevations in ALT and/or AST greater than 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 3 × ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment, discontinue Zytiga and do not re-treat these patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- Do not use Zytiga in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).

- **Hepatotoxicity**: For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with Zytiga (ALT and/or AST greater than 5 × ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 × ULN), interrupt treatment with Zytiga [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following the return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN. For patients who resume treatment, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter.

	- If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily, re-treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg.

Hepatomegaly is a near-constant feature of ASMD resulting from massive infiltration of hepatic macrophages, specifically Kupffer cells, laden with sphingomyelin into hepatic sinusoidal spaces. These are classically referred to as foam cells by histology. There is also lysosomal sphingomyelin accumulation in hepatocytes. Hepatic disease is a major cause of morbidity and one of the most common causes of death in patients with chronic visceral disease. In an analysis of morbidities contributing to death among 85 patients with chronic ASMD, liver disease was equally prevalent in patients who died in childhood or adulthood.

There remains a lack of awareness that adults with chronic ASMD disease are at significant risk of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and variceal bleeding. Nearly all adult patients (n = 17) with ASMD screened for enrollment in a Phase 1 clinical trial had some degree of hepatic fibrosis, ranging from early-stage fibrosis to established cirrhosis. Sphingomyelin accumulation was prominent in Kupffer cells as well as in hepatocytes of patients who developed fibrosis.

- **Question 2**: What is the next best step in diagnosis?
	- A. Patch testing
	- B. Blood arsenic levels
	- C. Blood, hair, and nail tests
	- D. Complete blood count with peripheral smear
	- E. Liver function tests

- **Answers**:
	- A. Patch testing – Incorrect. Allergy patch testing diagnoses allergic contact dermatitis, not systemic conditions such as arsenicosis.
	- B. Blood arsenic levels – Incorrect. Relying solely on blood arsenic levels is inadequate for diagnosing arsenicosis, as there could be false negatives resulting from prolonged consumption of low amounts of arsenic.
	- C. Blood, hair, and nail tests – Correct. Measurement of arsenic levels in blood, hair, and nails can confirm chronic arsenic exposure, supporting the diagnosis of arsenicosis. Our patient underwent the same and had raised arsenic in all the samples. Hair analysis revealed an arsenic content of 0.29 μg/g (normal, < 0.08 μg/g), whereas nail arsenic levels were elevated at 4.56 μg/g (normal, 0.2–3.0 μg/g). Blood arsenic levels were also increased at 8.23 μg/dL (normal, 0.17–5 μg/dL).
	- D. Complete blood count with peripheral smear – Incorrect. A complete blood count may show nonspecific abnormalities but would not confirm arsenicosis.
	- E. Liver function tests – Incorrect. Although liver function tests may show abnormalities in arsenicosis, they do not directly measure arsenic levels in the body.

### Screening for advanced steatotic liver disease [^116chE1y]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Steatotic liver disease often progresses asymptomatically, with the risk of advancing to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Early detection of advanced liver disease through screening presents an opportunity to prevent severe outcomes if said screening is linked to effective intervention. This review evaluates the feasibility of screening for advanced steatotic liver disease through the lens of the Wilson and Jungner criteria.

- **Presence of a presymptomatic stage**: Target for screening advances in diagnostic tests, cost-effectiveness, the availability of effective treatments, and the difficult task of balancing harms against benefits of screening.

Additional criteria are proposed to address contemporary challenges, including ensuring equitable access, implementing long-term program evaluation, and developing strategies to minimize psychosocial harm. The long-term benefits of screening — particularly in reducing liver-related morbidity and mortality — remain unclear, highlighting the need for large-scale randomized trials with long-term follow-up.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^11193En6]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condition characterized by hepatomegaly, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and a histologic picture similar to alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of alcohol abuse. Most patients with NASH are obese women, and many have diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia. NASH has also been associated with a number of metabolic conditions, surgical procedures, and drug treatments.

Most patients are asymptomatic. The most common sign of NASH is hepatomegaly, while stigmata of chronic liver disease are rare. Laboratory abnormalities include a 2–4-fold elevation of serum aminotransferase levels; other liver function test results are usually normal. Histologically, there is moderate to severe macrovesicular steatosis and lobular hepatitis with necrosis or ballooning degeneration and/or fibrosis.

The pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood, but lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are the leading culprits. The natural history of NASH is unknown, but it seems to be a stable disease in most patients. Treatment of NASH is unproven, but weight reduction is recommended in obese patients. Small pilot studies of several drugs have shown promise, but large randomized clinical trials are awaited. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage liver disease secondary to NASH.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113JkQRa]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

When should liver blood tests be checked?

There are multiple situations where requesting liver blood tests should be considered to determine the presence or severity of liver disease:

- **Non-specific symptoms**: Liver disease tends to develop silently with no signs or symptoms, and there is evidence that the majority of people with late-stage liver disease are undiagnosed. However, inflammatory liver diseases, including autoimmune liver disease and viral hepatitis, can be associated with symptoms. For example, 75% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) have one or more non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, or anorexia. These diseases can be effectively treated and are often diagnosed late, so the presence of these non-specific symptoms would be an indication to check routine liver blood tests, accepting that there are many other causes for these symptoms.

- **Evidence of chronic liver disease**: Patients with symptoms or signs of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or liver failure, including ascites, peripheral edema, spider naevi, and hepatosplenomegaly, need liver blood tests to monitor their function. In this regard, the inclusion of INR is important to fully define their synthetic function.

- **Conditions associated with a high risk of developing liver disease**: Autoimmune liver disease is more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, and liver blood tests may be appropriate if clinical symptoms change to suggest the development of liver disease — for example, pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) should also be monitored with liver blood tests if symptoms suggestive of liver disease develop.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117CHg7V]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Approach to common conditions: NAFLD

NAFLD is diagnosed by the presence of an echobright liver on ultrasound in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. For adults with NAFLD, it is recommended that a first-line, non-invasive assessment, such as Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), is undertaken to identify patients with advanced fibrosis. Patients with a low FIB-4 (≤ 65 years) or low NFS (≤ 65 years) can be managed in primary care. Presently, the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD is to reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity with the aim of inducing gradual and long-term weight loss.

- **Non-invasive algorithms**: Those patients with indeterminate FIB-4 (1.3–3.25) or NFS scores (−1.455 to 0.675) should undergo further testing with a second-line test such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. The decision to use Fibroscan or ARFI should be based on local expertise and availability of respective devices. Consider referral to a specialist clinic for patients with serum ELF measurements > 9.5 or Fibroscan > 7.8 kPa. Cut-off points for ARFI vary according to the manufacturer and thus should be tailored to the device used.

Finally, those patients with elevated FIB-4 (> 3.25) or NFS (> 0.675) should be considered for referral to a specialist clinic irrespective of second-line tests.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. These tests play crucial roles, such as investigating symptoms, monitoring medication, assessing chronic diseases, and conducting routine assessments. They result in abnormalities in up to 40% of patients.

The toll of liver disease continues to rise, and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective, before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^115ntJca]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The widely accepted European definition of NAFLD emphasizes the absence of excessive alcohol consumption (defined as ≥ 30 g per day for men and ≥ 20 g per day for women). A quantitative alcohol history is essential for diagnosis. Patients with NAFLD should have a regular reassessment of their alcohol consumption. There are additive and synergistic interactions between alcohol and cardiometabolic risk factors in the progression of fatty liver disease. Much of the evidence linking alcohol to health outcomes relies on cohort studies where alcohol consumption was measured only once at baseline. However, it is recognized that alcohol consumption fluctuates widely over the lifespan. In view of this, we recommend that patients with NAFLD should have a quantitative alcohol history taken at regular intervals.

The transition from compensated to decompensated disease is associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality. In individuals with alcohol-related liver disease, continued drinking is a stronger risk factor for decompensation than any histological or laboratory parameters. Both alcohol use and obesity have been shown to correlate with the progression of portal hypertension in chronic liver disease as cofactors.

In patients with NAFLD who do not have cirrhosis, the 2016 NICE clinical guideline reported insufficient evidence to restrict alcohol consumption beyond the national recommended advisory limits. However, alcohol can be a source of additional dietary calories, and minimizing use may prevent further weight gain, potentially exacerbating the condition.

### Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A 60-year-old man with probable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: weight reduction, liver biopsy, or both [^111wQU4N]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic disorders in the United States, but uncertainty remains as to the optimal way to manage it. Using the case of Mr. T, a 60-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and increased serum transaminase levels, an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on the patient's clinical profile and risk factors for metabolic syndrome, the exclusion of other liver diseases, radiologic imaging, and sometimes biopsy. At this point in Mr. T's disease, the most important step is differentiation between simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

- **Simple steatosis**: Has a benign natural history, but NASH is progressive and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by the lack of large randomized trials, particularly of combinations of therapies, but weight loss, exercise, and medical therapies targeted at the mechanism of liver injury in NASH are recommended. Improved noninvasive diagnostic tests, a clearer understanding of the natural history of NAFLD, and large, well-designed clinical trials are needed.

### How are abnormal results for liver function tests dealt with in primary care? Audit of yield and impact [^114FH32S]. BMJ (2001). Low credibility.

To determine whether abnormal results for liver function tests are investigated in primary care and the findings on full investigation, a retrospective audit and prospective clinical investigation were conducted. The setting included a university hospital and surrounding general practices serving approximately 330,000 people. The subjects were adults with abnormal liver function test results based on tests requested by their doctor between January 1 and June 30, 1995.

All patients with gamma-glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or alkaline phosphatase concentrations at least twice the upper limit of the reference range were studied. A median of 15 months later (range 12–21), records of hospital attendances and further investigations were examined. Where investigations were incomplete, records from the general practice were reviewed, and suitable patients were invited to attend the liver clinic.

The main outcome measures included investigations requested by the doctor and final diagnoses reached. A total of 933 patients with abnormal liver function tests were identified; follow-up data were obtained for 873 (94%). Of these, 531 patients were already under hospital review. Of the remaining 342 patients, 157 were suitable for investigation; the others had died, moved away, were elderly, or had repeat liver function tests with normal results. No further tests were requested for 91 (58%) of these patients. Sixty-six had been partially investigated by their doctor, and in seven patients, results suggesting a treatable chronic liver disease had not been followed up. On investigation, 97 (62%) had an identifiable outcome.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations.

The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time, albumin, complete blood count with platelets, hepatitis A, B, and C serologies, and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: From pathogenesis to patient care [^1175zTXJ]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in Western countries, encompassing a wide spectrum of liver lesions, from pure steatosis to end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis corresponds to only one stage of NAFLD. As NAFLD can be considered a liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, its prevalence is high in obese people and in patients who have type 2 diabetes — insulin resistance is one of the key elements of the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

This disease is often asymptomatic in the absence of decompensated cirrhosis but should be suspected in patients with elevated aminotransferase levels or radiological evidence of a fatty liver or hepatomegaly. Liver fibrosis is associated with factors such as age over 50 years, obesity, diabetes, and high triglyceride levels. Liver biopsy is the only way to assess the histologic features of necrotic inflammation and fibrosis that define nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and to determine its probable prognosis. The prognosis is good for pure steatosis, whereas the presence of necrotic inflammation is associated with a significant risk of progression to cirrhosis and, possibly, hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and exercise, are recommended. At the time of writing, there have been very few randomized, placebo-controlled trials of drug treatments for NAFLD.

### Screening in liver disease: Report of an AASLD clinical workshop [^115Lnmzi]. Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

This report summarizes an AASLD Clinical Workshop that was presented at Digestive Diseases Week 2003 on screening in liver diseases. As newer diagnostic tests become available, many liver diseases and complications of liver disease can be detected at an early asymptomatic stage. In many cases, early detection can lead to earlier treatment and improved outcomes. However, screening for liver diseases in asymptomatic persons has the potential for adverse consequences, including discrimination and stigmatization. The cost of screening programs is significant, and access to screening tests varies in different countries. Future screening programs require careful planning and implementation to balance the benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness. This review outlines the concepts of screening and their application to a broad range of liver diseases.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate, and pancreas, but it is not found in bone. Therefore, it can be useful in confirming that an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is of liver origin rather than bony origin. GGT is most commonly elevated due to obesity, excess alcohol consumption, or drug induction. Although an elevated GGT has low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### Identification and characterization of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^114kUQB1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by substantial diagnostic and evaluation gaps with no systematic screening. Even recognized cases are undercoded because of the perceived benign nature of the disease and the absence of approved pharmacologic treatment. NAFLD is often detected incidentally, particularly in the asymptomatic early phase. We doubled NAFLD detection via natural language processing of 1 million imaging reports combined with laboratory data from an unselected population. We describe NAFLD comorbidities and health care utilization as compared with age, sex, and body mass index matched control subjects.

### Approach to the liver biopsy in the patient with chronic low-level aminotransferase elevations [^116HcWAh]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pathologists sometimes encounter a liver biopsy from an asymptomatic patient with unexplained low-level parenchymal liver enzyme elevations. These biopsies often have minor histologic changes but are otherwise almost entirely normal. This can lead to the quandary of whether or not the features are clinically meaningful and how one must formulate a diagnosis from the possibly nonspecific findings of a near-normal biopsy. The following discussion focuses on the histologic changes that can be seen in these biopsies and the practical issues involved in making a diagnosis that provides useful information to the clinician. The literature and textbooks addressing the histologic and clinical features of these cases are reviewed, with an emphasis on the clinical implications of finding nonspecific histologic alterations in these patients.
