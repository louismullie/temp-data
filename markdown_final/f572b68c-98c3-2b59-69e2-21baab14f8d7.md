## Question

Treatment of chicken pox in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of chickenpox in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and natural history to anchor severity and prognosis. Then, I should verify which pediatric populations warrant antiviral therapy versus supportive care only. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for oral acyclovir and valacyclovir, including timing, dosing, and safety. After that, I need to check special situations like immunocompromise, corticosteroid exposure, and neonates. Finally, I will integrate supportive care, monitoring for complications, and prevention strategies, and close with a concise, risk-stratified recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. Chickenpox in immunocompetent children is typically self-limited, with lesions evolving over 5–7 days and contagion until all lesions crust; complications are usually secondary bacterial skin infections, though neurologic and respiratory complications can occur, albeit rarely, so I should not overstate risk while remaining vigilant [^112ANYoi] [^113cgyTB]. Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology to frame decisions: in many settings, most children acquire varicella before age 10, reinforcing that routine antivirals are not universally indicated in otherwise healthy children [^114GAYvX].

> Next, I should review who actually needs antiviral therapy. I need to ensure I separate three groups: otherwise healthy children, children at higher risk for moderate-to-severe disease, and immunocompromised children. For otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated varicella, routine antivirals are not recommended by AAP and major guidelines, so supportive care is standard; for children at higher risk (e.g., older than 12 years, chronic skin/pulmonary disease, long-term salicylates, corticosteroid exposure), oral acyclovir or valacyclovir can be considered, ideally within 24 hours of rash onset; for immunocompromised children, IV acyclovir is indicated for severe disease or significant immunosuppression, again with early initiation to maximize benefit [^113Fbznx] [^1133TNtc] [^113qodxJ].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for oral acyclovir in otherwise healthy children. The Cochrane review shows modest benefits: about 1 day less fever and fewer lesions, but inconsistent effects on time to no new lesions and pruritus, and no clear reduction in complications; thus, the clinical importance remains debated, which aligns with AAP's stance against routine use in healthy children [^113DHd7p] [^113Fbznx]. I should double-check timing: benefits wane if started after 24 hours, so early initiation is key when antivirals are chosen for higher-risk children [^115SYsuR].

> I will now examine dosing and safety for oral acyclovir. Standard pediatric dosing is 20 mg/kg per dose orally four times daily for 5 days, with a maximum of 800 mg per dose; children over 40 kg receive the adult dose of 800 mg four times daily for 5 days, and therapy should start as early as possible, ideally within 24 hours of rash onset [^117CBjSp] [^115LcJn5]. Hold on, I should verify renal considerations: dose adjustment is needed in renal impairment, and hydration should be encouraged to mitigate nephrotoxicity risk, though this is more critical with IV therapy than oral [^117CBjSp].

> Let me consider valacyclovir as an alternative. Valacyclovir is FDA-approved for chickenpox in immunocompetent children aged 2 to less than 18 years at 20 mg/kg orally three times daily for 5 days, not to exceed 1 g per dose; efficacy is extrapolated from pediatric acyclovir trials, and it is not recommended for children under 2 years due to insufficient data [^114XroeW] [^112qF98W]. I should confirm that initiation within 24 hours is advised to optimize benefit, consistent with the acyclovir evidence base used for extrapolation [^111ffgTX].

> But wait, what if the child is immunocompromised or has severe disease? I need to ensure I escalate appropriately: IV acyclovir is indicated for severe varicella or significant immunosuppression, typically 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7–10 days, switching to oral therapy once improving and no new lesions for 48 hours; in HIV-exposed or infected children, expert guidance supports IV acyclovir for severe disease and allows oral acyclovir for milder cases with close follow-up [^1133TNtc] [^113qodxJ]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives if acyclovir fails: foscarnet is an option for acyclovir-resistant VZV, though this is rare in immunocompetent hosts and more relevant in immunocompromised settings [^113qodxJ].

> I should confirm special situations. Children on systemic corticosteroids are at increased risk of severe or disseminated varicella; if exposed, VZIG prophylaxis should be considered, and if disease develops, antiviral therapy is reasonable even in otherwise healthy children given the elevated risk profile [^116CNAUE] [^1162Cimm]. For neonates and young infants, I initially thought antivirals might be broadly indicated, but wait, let me verify: routine antivirals are not recommended for otherwise healthy infants, though severe or complicated cases may warrant therapy; in exposed high-risk neonates, VZIG is used for post-exposure prophylaxis rather than routine treatment [^113Fbznx].

> Next, I should review supportive care because most children will not receive antivirals. Pruritus control with topical calamine or antihistamines, antipyretics for fever (avoid aspirin due to Reye syndrome risk), hydration, and hygiene to minimize secondary infection are foundational; I need to ensure caregivers know lesions are contagious until crusted and to keep the child out of school or childcare until that point [^112WS9ZF]. Hold on, I should verify complication red flags: rapidly progressive or focal erythema, severe pain, respiratory symptoms, altered mental status, or persistent high fever warrant urgent evaluation for bacterial superinfection, pneumonia, or neurologic complications [^114GAYvX].

> I will now examine prevention, because treatment decisions sit within a prevention framework. Universal two-dose varicella vaccination is the most effective strategy to reduce incidence, complications, and hospitalizations; post-exposure vaccination within 3–5 days can mitigate or prevent disease in susceptible contacts, and VZIG is reserved for high-risk, nonvaccine-eligible exposures [^112WS9ZF] [^114NjMvm] [^113Fbznx]. Let me reconsider the role of antivirals in exposed children: outside of immunocompromised hosts, routine post-exposure antivirals are not recommended, whereas vaccine or VZIG are preferred based on risk and eligibility [^114NjMvm] [^113Fbznx].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my risk-stratified recommendation is consistent with evidence and guidelines. For otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated varicella, provide supportive care and do not prescribe antivirals; for children at higher risk for moderate-to-severe disease, consider oral acyclovir or valacyclovir if started within 24 hours; for immunocompromised children or those with severe disease, use IV acyclovir promptly and escalate care as needed; throughout, monitor for complications and counsel on contagion and return-to-school criteria [^113Fbznx] [^1133TNtc] [^117CBjSp].

Treatment of chickenpox in children is **supportive care** for most healthy children, with antipyretics, antipruritics, and hygiene measures to prevent secondary infection [^114GAYvX]. Acyclovir is **not routinely recommended** for otherwise healthy children, but may be considered for those at higher risk of complications (e.g. > 12 years, chronic skin/lung disease, corticosteroid use) or if started within 24 hours of rash onset [^113Fbznx] [^113DHd7p]. For immunocompromised children or severe disease, **intravenous acyclovir is indicated** [^1133TNtc] [^117CBjSp]. Complications such as bacterial superinfection, pneumonia, or neurologic involvement require prompt medical evaluation and targeted therapy [^112WS9ZF].

---

## Supportive care

Supportive care is the cornerstone of management for **otherwise healthy children** with chickenpox:

- **Antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever control. Aspirin should be avoided due to the risk of Reye syndrome.

- **Antipruritics**: Topical calamine lotion, oral antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), or lukewarm oatmeal baths to relieve itching.

- **Hygiene measures**: Regular bathing, gentle cleansing of lesions, and trimming fingernails to prevent secondary bacterial infection.

- **Hydration**: Encourage oral fluids to maintain hydration.

---

## Antiviral therapy

Antiviral therapy is **not routinely recommended** for otherwise healthy children with uncomplicated chickenpox. However, it may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antiviral therapy** |
|-|-|
| Otherwise healthy children ≥ 13 years old | Oral acyclovir (20 mg/kg per dose, maximum 800 mg, four times daily for 5 days) [^117CBjSp] [^115LcJn5] |
| Children with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders | Oral acyclovir (20 mg/kg per dose, maximum 800 mg, four times daily for 5 days) [^117CBjSp] [^115LcJn5] |
| Children receiving corticosteroids | Oral acyclovir (20 mg/kg per dose, maximum 800 mg, four times daily for 5 days) [^117CBjSp] [^115LcJn5] |
| Immunocompromised children or severe disease | Intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7–10 days) [^1133TNtc] [^115tufKt] |

---

Antiviral therapy is most effective when initiated **within 24 hours** of rash onset [^115SYsuR] [^111ffgTX].

---

## Management of complications

Complications of chickenpox in children include **secondary bacterial infections**, pneumonia, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic complications. Management includes:

- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Topical or systemic antibiotics based on severity and clinical judgment.

- **Pneumonia or encephalitis**: Hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir therapy [^1133TNtc] [^115tufKt].

- **Hemorrhagic complications**: Supportive care and hematology consultation as indicated.

---

## Prevention

Prevention of chickenpox is primarily through **vaccination**. The varicella vaccine is recommended for all children at 12–15 months of age, with a booster dose at 4–6 years [^1118ZyUt]. Post-exposure prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is recommended for high-risk individuals (e.g. immunocompromised children, pregnant women) within 10 days of exposure [^113Fbznx].

---

## Parental education

Parental education is essential to ensure adherence to supportive care measures, recognize complications, and prevent transmission. Key points include:

- **Contagiousness**: Children are contagious from 1–2 days before rash onset until all lesions have crusted [^113cgyTB].

- **Return to school**: Children should return to school only after all lesions have crusted.

- **Warning signs**: Persistent high fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, severe headache, or signs of secondary bacterial infection warrant immediate medical evaluation [^notfound].

---

Treatment of chickenpox in children primarily involves **supportive care**, with antiviral therapy reserved for specific high-risk scenarios. Complications should be promptly recognized and managed, and prevention through vaccination remains the most effective strategy.

### Chickenpox: treatment [^114GAYvX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chickenpox is extremely contagious. More than 90% of unvaccinated people will become infected during their lifetime, but infection occurs at different ages in different parts of the world. In the US, the UK, and Japan, more than 80% of people have been infected by the age of 10 years, and by the age of 20 to 30 years in India, South East Asia, and the West Indies. It is usually a mild and self-limiting disease, but it can be severely complicated by pneumonitis or disseminated disease in some individuals, particularly neonates and those who are immunocompromised.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for chickenpox in healthy adults and children (including neonates) within 24 hours after onset of rash? What are the effects of treatment for chickenpox in healthy adults and children (including neonates) later than 24 hours after onset of rash? What are the effects of treatment for chickenpox in immunocompromised adults and children (including neonates)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of aciclovir, within 24 hours of onset of rash or later than 24 hours of onset of rash, in otherwise-healthy adults and children (including neonates); and aciclovir in immunocompromised adults and children (including neonates).

### Controlled trial of acyclovir for chickenpox evaluating time of initiation and duration of therapy and viral resistance [^115SYsuR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Chickenpox is prevalent in the US despite the availability of an effective vaccine. Acyclovir treatment is limited by concerns about efficacy if given after the first day of rash and by concerns about induction of viral resistance.

Objective

Evaluate initiation and duration of acyclovir treatment of chickenpox and its effect on viral resistance.

Study Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial in immunocompetent patients who were stratified by age at enrollment (children, 2 to 11 years; adolescents, ≥ 12 to 18 years; adults, ≥ 19 years) and duration of rash (≤ 24 h vs. > 24 to 48 h). Lesions were staged, counted and cultured; temperatures and symptoms were recorded daily.

Intervention

Subjects presenting within 24 h of rash onset (Group A) were randomly assigned to 5 or 7 days of oral acyclovir treatment, 80 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 3,200 mg/day in four divided doses. Subjects whose rash was > 24 to 48 h old were randomized to receive 5 days of acyclovir treatment beginning on the first (Group B1) or second study day (Group B2). Matching placebos were used to ensure that subjects uniformly received 28 doses of study compound.

Results

Of the 177 subjects recruited Group A patients who were treated on the first day of rash had the greatest number of significantly shortened event times with 5 days of therapy being equivalent to 7 days. There also were some shorter times to events for Group B1 patients who began therapy on the second day of rash vs. Group B2 patients who started acyclovir on the third. These included: time to maximum lesion formation (adolescents, P = 0.007; children, P = 0.03); 50% healing in adolescents (P = 0.005); and residual facial lesions in adults (P = 0.047). The probability of viral shedding was significantly reduced for Group A subjects vs. Group B1 subjects (P = 0.006). Viruses shed during therapy remained susceptible to acyclovir and retained normal thymidine kinase function.

Conclusions

Immunocompetent children, adolescents and adults with chickenpox displayed a gradation in their clinical responses to acyclovir that correlated with the time from onset of rash to initiation of therapy. Five days of therapy is sufficient because a 7-day course provided no additional benefit. The susceptibility to acyclovir of viruses shed during treatment did not change; however, the effect of therapy on resistance of latent virus was not assessed.

### Chickenpox in adults-clinical management [^114zSxxN]. The Journal of Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Acute varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, or chickenpox, is still perceived by many as a mild infection of childhood. However, chickenpox is increasingly common in adults and adolescents who together with immunosuppressed individuals are at a higher risk of severe infection. Antiviral therapy is available which both ameliorates symptoms and decreases the severity of chickenpox if administered early in the course of the infection. Passive immunisation with varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) may prevent or attenuate infection following exposure to varicella of an immunocompromised or pregnant individual or a neonate. Active immunisation is available and is universal in many developed countries. This review reflects current best practice in management of chickenpox in adults by specialist physicians in the UK. The accompanying flowchart has been formulated to guide emergency physicians and general practitioners through the decision-making process regarding treatment and admission for specialist care.

### Acyclovir for treating varicella in otherwise healthy children and adolescents [^113DHd7p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Acyclovir has the potential to shorten the course of illness which may result in reduced costs and morbidity associated with chickenpox.

Objectives

1) To examine the evidence evaluating the efficacy of acyclovir in alleviating symptoms of chickenpox and shortening the duration of illness. 2) To examine complications of chickenpox and adverse effects associated with acyclovir as reported in the relevant trials.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003), and EMBASE (1988 to April 2003). The reference lists of all relevant articles were reviewed. The primary author of relevant studies and the pharmaceutical company that manufactures acyclovir were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that evaluated otherwise healthy children zero to 18 years of age, with chickenpox.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently reviewed the studies for eligibility. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of the relevant studies using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted by one reviewer using a structured form and checked by a second. Continuous data were converted to the weighted mean difference (WMD). Weighted mean differences were combined into an overall estimate using random effects. There were too few studies to consider exploring statistical heterogeneity between studies (i.e., differences in reported effects), formally, or to assess for publication bias.

Main Results

Three studies were included. Study quality was three (n = 2) and four (n = 1) on the Jadad scale. Acyclovir was associated with a reduction in the number of days with fever (-1.1 days, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.9) and in reducing the maximum number of lesions (-76 lesions, -145 to -8). Results were less supportive with respect to the number of days to no new lesions and the number of days to the relief of itching. There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications associated with chickenpox or adverse effects associated with the treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Acyclovir appears to be effective in reducing the number of days with fever and the maximum number of lesions among otherwise healthy children with chickenpox. The results were less convincing with respect to the number of days to no new lesions and relief of itchiness. The clinical importance of acyclovir treatment in otherwise healthy children remains controversial.

Background

Acyclovir has the potential to shorten the course of illness which may result in reduced costs and morbidity.

Objectives

1) To examine the evidence evaluating the efficacy of acyclovir in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of illness. 2) To examine complications of chickenpox and adverse effects associated with acyclovir as reported in the relevant trials.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2002, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2001), EMBASE (1988 to September 2001). The reference lists of all relevant articles were reviewed. The primary author of relevant studies and the pharmaceutical company that manufactures acyclovir were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that evaluated otherwise healthy children 0–18 years of age with chickenpox.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently reviewed the studies for eligibility. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of the relevant studies using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment. Differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted by one reviewer using a structured form and checked by a second. Continuous data were converted to the weighted mean difference (WMD). Weighted mean differences were not combined into an overall estimate due to the varied age groups between studies. There were too few studies to consider statistical heterogeneity between studies (i.e., differences in reported effects), to perform subgroup or sensitivity analyses, or to assess for publication bias.

Main Results

Three studies were included. Study quality was three (n = 2) and four (n = 1) on the Jadad scale. Acyclovir was associated with a reduction in the number of days with fever, from -1.0 (95% CI -1.5,-0.5) to -1.3 (95% CI -2.0,-0.6). Results were inconsistent with respect to the number of days to no new lesions, the maximum number of lesions and the number of days to the relief of itching. There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications associated with chickenpox or adverse effects associated with the drug.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Acyclovir appears to be effective in reducing the number of days with fever among otherwise healthy children with chickenpox. The results were inconsistent with respect to the number of days to no new lesions, relief of itchiness and maximum number of lesions. The clinical importance of acyclovir treatment in otherwise healthy children remains controversial.

Background

Acyclovir has the potential to shorten the course of chickenpox which may result in reduced costs and morbidity. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials that evaluated acyclovir for the treatment of chickenpox in otherwise healthy children.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched. The reference lists of relevant articles were examined and primary authors and Glaxo Wellcome were contacted to identify additional trials. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed study quality using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment, and extracted data. Continuous data were converted to a weighted mean difference (WMD). Overall estimates were not calculated due to differences in the age groups studied.

Results

Three studies were included. Methodological quality was 3 (n = 2) and 4 (n = 1) on the Jadad scale. Acyclovir was associated with a significant reduction in the number of days with fever, from -1.0 (95% CI -1.5,-0.5) to -1.3 (95% CI -2.0,-0.6). Results were inconsistent with respect to the number of days to no new lesions, the maximum number of lesions and relief of pruritus. There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications or adverse effects.

### Valacyclovir [^114XroeW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Chickenpox

The use of valacyclovir tablets for treatment of chickenpox in pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years is based on single-dose pharmacokinetic and multiple-dose safety data from an open-label trial with valacyclovir and supported by safety and extrapolated efficacy data from 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating oral acyclovir in pediatric subjects.

The single-dose pharmacokinetic and multiple-dose safety trial enrolled 27 pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 12 years with clinically suspected VZV infection. Each subject was dosed with valacyclovir oral suspension, 20 mg/kg 3 times daily for 5 days. Acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects following valacyclovir oral suspension were compared with historical acyclovir systemic exposures in immunocompetent adults receiving the solid oral dosage form of valacyclovir or acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The mean projected daily acyclovir exposures in pediatric subjects across all age-groups (1 to less than 12 years) were lower (Cmax: ↓13%, AUC: ↓30%)than the mean daily historical exposures in adults receiving valacyclovir 1 gram 3 times daily, but were higher (daily AUC: ↑50%) than the mean daily historical exposures in adults receiving acyclovir 800 mg 5 times daily. The projected daily exposures in pediatric subjects were greater (daily AUC approximately 100% greater) than the exposures seen in immunocompetent pediatric subjects receiving acyclovir 20 mg/kg 4 times daily for the treatment of chickenpox. Based on the pharmacokinetic and safety data from this trial and the safety and extrapolated efficacy data from the acyclovir trials, oral valacyclovir 20 mg/kg 3 times a day for 5 days (not to exceed 1 gram 3 times daily) is recommended for the treatment of chickenpox in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years. Because the efficacy and safety of acyclovir for the treatment of chickenpox in children aged less than 2 years have not been established, efficacy data cannot be extrapolated to support valacyclovir treatment in children aged less than 2 years with chickenpox.

Valacyclovir is also not recommended for the treatment of herpes zoster in children because safety data up to 7 days' duration are not available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

14.4 Chickenpox

The use of valacyclovir hydrochloride for treatment of chickenpox in pediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age is based on single-dose pharmacokinetic and multiple-dose safety data from an open-label trial with valacyclovir and supported by safety and extrapolated efficacy data from 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating oral acyclovir in pediatric patients.

Based on the pharmacokinetic and safety data from this study and the safety and extrapolated efficacy data from the acyclovir studies, oral valacyclovir 20 mg/kg 3 times a day for 5 days (not to exceed 1 gram 3 times daily) is recommended for the treatment of chickenpox in pediatric patients 2 to < 18 years of age. Because the efficacy and safety of acyclovir for the treatment of chickenpox in children < 2 years of age have not been established, efficacy data cannot be extrapolated to support valacyclovir treatment in children < 2 years of age with chickenpox. Valacyclovir is also not recommended for the treatment of herpes zoster in children because safety data up to 7 days' duration are not available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Clinical overview of chickenpox (varicella) [^112WS9ZF]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Varicella is an acute infectious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus.
- The most common chickenpox complications are bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues in children and pneumonia in adults.
- The most effective prevention for varicella is chickenpox vaccination. The most common chickenpox complications are bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues in children and pneumonia in adults. Breakthrough varicella occurs less frequently among those who have received 2 doses of vaccine; compared with those who have received only 1 dose. Keep Reading: Detailed Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Varicella. Prevention CDC recommends 2 doses of varicella vaccine for all children, adolescents, and adults without evidence of immunity to varicella. Those who previously received one dose of varicella vaccine should receive their second dose for best protection against the disease.

Keep Reading: Chickenpox Vaccine Recommendations Nosocomial transmission of VZV is well-recognized and can be life-threatening to certain groups of patients. Reports of nosocomial transmission are uncommon in the United States since the introduction of varicella vaccine. Patient management Isolation Healthcare providers should follow standard precautions, airborne precautions, and contact precautions until lesions are dry and crusted. If negative air-flow rooms are not available, patients with varicella should be isolated in closed rooms. They should have no contact with people without evidence of immunity. Patients with varicella should be cared for by staff with evidence of immunity. Keep Reading: Preventing VZV Transmission in Healthcare Settings. Impact of U. S. varicella vaccination program The varicella vaccination program has dramatically decreased virus circulation and increased community protection.
- Varicella hospitalizations and deaths declined 94% and 97%, respectively, among people 50 years old and younger.
- The greatest decline in cases was among people 20 years old and younger who were born during the program, with 97% drop in hospitalizations and more than 99% drop in deaths.
- The risk of shingles is significantly lower among vaccinated children, including those who are immunocompromised.
- There is about an 80% lower risk of shingles among healthy vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children who had wild-type varicella.

### Valacyclovir (valacyclovir hydrochloride) [^112qF98W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4	Chickenpox

The use of valacyclovir for treatment of chickenpox in pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years is based on single-dose pharmacokinetic and multiple-dose safety data from an open-label trial with valacyclovir and supported by safety and extrapolated efficacy data from 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating oral acyclovir in pediatric subjects.

The single-dose pharmacokinetic and multiple-dose safety trial enrolled 27 pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 12 years with clinically suspected VZV infection. Each subject was dosed with valacyclovir oral suspension, 20 mg/kg 3 times daily for 5 days. Acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects following valacyclovir oral suspension were compared with historical acyclovir systemic exposures in immunocompetent adults receiving the solid oral dosage form of valacyclovir or acyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The mean projected daily acyclovir exposures in pediatric subjects across all age-groups (1 to less than 12 years) were lower (Cmax: ↓ 13%, AUC: ↓ 30%) than the mean daily historical exposures in adults receiving valacyclovir 1 gram 3 times daily, but were higher (daily AUC: ↑ 50%) than the mean daily historical exposures in adults receiving acyclovir 800 mg 5 times daily. The projected daily exposures in pediatric subjects were greater (daily AUC approximately 100% greater) than the exposures seen in immunocompetent pediatric subjects receiving acyclovir 20 mg/kg 4 times daily for the treatment of chickenpox. Based on the pharmacokinetic and safety data from this trial and the safety and extrapolated efficacy data from the acyclovir trials, oral valacyclovir 20 mg/kg 3 times a day for 5 days (not to exceed 1 gram 3 times daily) is recommended for the treatment of chickenpox in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years. Because the efficacy and safety of acyclovir for the treatment of chickenpox in children aged less than 2 years have not been established, efficacy data cannot be extrapolated to support valacyclovir treatment in children aged less than 2 years with chickenpox. Valacyclovir is also not recommended for the treatment of herpes zoster in children because safety data up to 7 days' duration are not available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Vaccines for post-exposure prophylaxis against varicella (chickenpox) in children and adults [^113rBwGe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The prevention of varicella (chickenpox) using live attenuated varicella vaccines has been demonstrated both in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and in population-based immunisation programmes in countries such as the United States and Australia. Many countries do not routinely immunise children against varicella and exposures continue to occur. Although the disease is often mild, complications such as secondary bacterial infection, pneumonitis and encephalitis occur in about 1% of cases, usually leading to hospitalisation. The use of varicella vaccine in persons who have recently been exposed to the varicella zoster virus has been studied as a form of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of vaccines for use as PEP for the prevention of varicella in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 1, 2014), EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2014) and LILACS (1982 to March 2014). We searched for unpublished trials registered on the clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP websites.

Selection Criteria

RCTs and quasi-RCTs of varicella vaccine for PEP compared with placebo or no intervention. The outcome measures were efficacy in prevention of clinical cases and/or laboratory-confirmed clinical cases and adverse events following vaccination.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and analysed data using Review Manager software.

Main Results

We identified three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The included trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis. We identified high or unclear risk of bias in two of the three included studies. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine) recipients (78%). Of the vaccine recipients who developed varicella, the majority only had mild disease (with fewer than 50 skin lesions). In the three trials, most participants received PEP within three days following exposure; too few participants were vaccinated four to five days post-exposure to ascertain the efficacy of vaccine given more than three days after exposure. No included trial reported on adverse events following immunisation.

Authors' Conclusions

These small trials suggest varicella vaccine administered within three days to children following household contact with a varicella case reduces infection rates and severity of cases. We identified no RCTs for adolescents or adults. Safety was not adequately addressed.

### Famciclovir [^113DoqND]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the multiple-dose safety part of the study; 47 subjects with active or latent HSV infection and 53 subjects with chickenpox. Patients with active or latent HSV infection received famciclovir twice a day for 7 days. The daily dose of famciclovir ranged from 150 mg to 500 mg twice daily depending on the patient's body weight. Patients with chickenpox received famciclovir three times daily for 7 days. The daily dose of famciclovir ranged from 150 mg to 500 mg three times daily depending on the patient's body weight. The clinical adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities observed in this study were similar to these seen in adults. The available data are insufficient to support the use of famciclovir for the treatment of children 1 to less than 12 years of age with chickenpox or infections due to HSV for the following reasons:

Chickenpox: The efficacy of famciclovir for the treatment of chickenpox has not been established in either pediatric or adult patients. Famciclovir is approved for the treatment of herpes zoster in adult patients. However, extrapolation of efficacy data from adults with herpes zoster to children with chickenpox would not be appropriate. Although chickenpox and herpes zoster are caused by the same virus, the diseases are different.

### Antiviral treatment of varicella in pediatric practice in the latium region of Italy: results of an observational study [^113ZMaKL]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of chickenpox in children is a controversial issue, at least in Europe. This study was designed to describe chickenpox in children and its reported management by pediatricians working for the National Health Service in the Latium region of Italy.

Methods

A questionnaire collected information on the duration, complications and treatment of the disease between September, 1998, and May, 1999, by participant pediatricians who enrolled 1094 patients in community pediatric practice.

Results

Secondary and tertiary cases of the disease in the same household were more severe than the primary cases. Acyclovir was given to 50% of the children, with a tendency to treat more severely ill children. The duration of the disease was significantly less in children receiving acyclovir within the first 24 h of rash (7.6 days 9.0). No complications requiring hospitalization were reported.

Conclusions

The use of antiviral drugs is not consistent among pediatricians. Clear guidelines are needed to minimize the use of drugs and to identify children who are likely to benefit most from antiviral therapy.

### Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection [^114oC6yP]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Infections by VZV, the virus that causes chickenpox and herpes zoster, usually are diagnosed by the classic clinical presentations. In immunocompromised patients, however, the atypical presentation can make the diagnosis more challenging. Although varicella typically follows an uncomplicated course in children, adults and immunocompromised patients can develop complications involving several organs; some complications may be fatal. Prevention of disease with the vaccine is ideal. When varicella or zoster infection does occur, proper treatment should be initiated, depending on the age and immune status of the patient.

VALTREX is indicated for treatment of cold sores in pediatric patients aged greater than or equal to 12 years and for treatment of chickenpox in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years [see Indications and Usage (1.2), Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

The use of VALTREX for treatment of cold sores is based on 2 double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trials in healthy adults and adolescents (aged greater than or equal to 12 years) with a history of recurrent cold sores [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The use of VALTREX for treatment of chickenpox in pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years is based on single‑dose pharmacokinetic and multiple‑dose safety data from an open‑label trial with valacyclovir and supported by efficacy and safety data from 3 randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trials evaluating oral acyclovir in pediatric subjects with chickenpox [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14.4)].

The efficacy and safety of valacyclovir have not been established in pediatric patients:

aged less than 12 years with cold sores
aged less than 18 years with genital herpes
aged less than 18 years with herpes zoster
aged less than 2 years with chickenpox

Summary of evidence — Primary varicella infection (chickenpox) epidemiology and severity. Before universal vaccination, varicella was a universal childhood disease that caused a generally mild and self-limited illness but could be associated with complications in the general population with up to 4 million new infections, 11,000 hospitalizations, and 100–150 deaths per year; varicella infections in adults are more likely to be severe and have a higher incidence of complications, and primary infections in immunosuppressed individuals are associated with significant morbidity with a high degree for disseminated disease. Since 1995, live-attenuated varicella has been available in the United States.

### The clinical and economic burden of antibiotic use in pediatric patients with varicella infection: a retrospective cohort analysis of real-world data in england [^112EcZVc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Varicella (chickenpox) is a highly infectious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus. An estimated 2–16 per 1000 individuals are infected annually worldwide. Although the condition typically presents during early childhood, varicella can be contracted at any age. The highest burden of illness is in young children, with > 90% of children experiencing infection before the age of 9 years. In 2014, the World Health Organization estimated that > 4 million varicella cases had severe complications, with > 4000 related deaths per year globally.

The World Health Organization recommends universal vaccination as one of the main preventive interventions where varicella is a public health problem, yet only 39 countries have universal varicella vaccination (UVV) programs. Varicella vaccination has been part of the recommended pediatric immunization schedule in the United States for > 25 years, which has resulted in a substantial decrease in disease burden. Within Europe, several countries have a lower varicella prevalence as a result of UVV programs. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and France, are yet to implement a UVV program, resulting in high annual varicella incidence and hospital admissions. The United Kingdom has an annual incidence of 13 000 cases per 100 000 population in children < 5 years old. In England, the average annual incidence of varicella hospital admissions is 7.6 (95% confidence interval, 7.3–7.9) per 100 000 population.

Because most varicella cases are considered mild and self-limiting, the majority may be managed without seeking care. However, more severe cases may result in complications, such as skin and soft-tissue infections, pneumonia, or neurological conditions, which may require treatment in primary or secondary care with antibiotics, antivirals, analgesics, or antihistamines.

Although clinical and economic impact estimates attributable to varicella have been produced for some European countries, the extent to which antibiotics are used to manage varicella is not well documented. A study from Latin America and Europe among children 1–14 years old with varicella reported that 13% of outpatients and 69% of inpatients were prescribed an antibiotic. More recently, a pediatric study at a hospital in Rome found that 43% of patients admitted for varicella received antibiotics, and a study in primary care in Belgium reported that 27% of patients with varicella were prescribed antibiotics.

1.2 Pediatric Patients

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for the treatment of cold sores (herpes labialis) in pediatric patients aged greater than or equal to 12 years. The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer) has not been established.

Chickenpox

Valacyclovir tablets are indicated for the treatment of chickenpox in immunocompetent pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years. Based on efficacy data from clinical trials with oral acyclovir, treatment with valacyclovir tablets should be initiated within 24 hours after the onset of rash [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Chickenpox and risk of stroke: a self-controlled case series analysis [^111WL6W3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our study provides new evidence that children who experience chickenpox are at increased risk of AIS over the subsequent months and that stroke is a rare complication of childhood chickenpox. The 4-fold increased risk we identified will represent only a small absolute stroke risk, given the low baseline incidence of pediatric stroke. Nevertheless, AIS is increasingly recognized among children and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, with up to three-quarters of survivors experiencing neurological and/or cognitive sequelae. Our findings suggest that the renewed attention on the mechanisms by which VZV and other infections cause vascular injury is warranted and could identify strategies to prevent strokes.

### Chickenpox, pregnancy and the newborn [^112Fkxbs]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2005). Low credibility.

In the UK, chickenpox (primary varicella virus infection) is usually a mild, self-limiting disease of childhood. It is more severe in adults. For example, of every 100,000 people who contract chickenpox, around 4–9 die from it, of whom 81–85% are adults. Chickenpox infection in pregnant women can lead to a severe maternal illness and it appears five times more likely to be fatal than in non-pregnant women. Although most women who have chickenpox in pregnancy give birth to healthy children, in other cases, the baby is harmed by in-utero infection or severe varicella of the newborn. Here we review the risks and key aspects of diagnosis and further management of varicella infection in pregnancy and the neonatal period.

### Vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in children [^113XxM4E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) are serious diseases that can lead to serious complications, disability, and death. However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections.

Authors' Conclusions

Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute Treatment of Herpes Zoster: 800 mg every 4 hours orally, 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days.

Genital Herpes: Treatment of Initial Genital Herpes: 200 mg every 4 hours, 5 times daily for 10 days.

Chronic Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent Disease: 400 mg 2 times daily for up to 12 months, followed by re-evaluation. Alternative regimens have included doses ranging from 200 mg 3 times daily to 200 mg 5 times daily.

The frequency and severity of episodes of untreated genital herpes may change over time. After 1 year of therapy, the frequency and severity of the patient's genital herpes infection should be re-evaluated to assess the need for continuation of therapy with acyclovir.

Intermittent Therapy: 200 mg every 4 hours, 5 times daily for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom (prodrome) of recurrence.

Treatment of Chickenpox: Children (2 years of age and older): 20 mg/kg per dose orally 4 times daily (80 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Children over 40 kg should receive the adult dose for chickenpox.

Adults and Children over 40 kg: 800 mg 4 times daily for 5 days.

Intravenous acyclovir is indicated for the treatment of varicella-zoster infections in immunocompromised patients.

When therapy is indicated, it should be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom of chickenpox. There is no information about the efficacy of therapy initiated more than 24 hours after onset of signs and symptoms.

Patients With Acute or Chronic Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment, the dose of Acyclovir Tablets should be modified as shown in Table 3.

Hemodialysis: For patients who require hemodialysis, the mean plasma half-life of acyclovir during hemodialysis is approximately 5 hours. This results in a 60% decrease in plasma concentrations following a 6-hour dialysis period. Therefore, the patient's dosing schedule should be adjusted so that an additional dose is administered after each dialysis.

Peritoneal Dialysis: No supplemental dose appears to be necessary after adjustment of the dosing interval.

In 1995 a varicella vaccine was licensed in the USA and was incorporated into the routine vaccination programme for children; a decline of varicella among children and adults, and a reduction in associated hospitalisation, complications and mortality, has resulted. In the UK, a policy of targeted vaccination of at-risk groups has been in place since the vaccine was introduced. Here we review the evidence for the different approaches to VZV vaccination policy.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute Treatment of Herpes Zoster

800 mg every 4 hours orally, 5 times daily for 7 to 10 days.

Genital Herpes

Treatment of Initial Genital Herpes

200 mg every 4 hours, 5 times daily for 10 days.

Chronic Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent Disease

400 mg 2 times daily for up to 12 months, followed by re-evaluation. Alternative regimens have included doses ranging from 200 mg 3 times daily to 200 mg 5 times daily.

The frequency and severity of episodes of untreated genital herpes may change over time. After 1 year of therapy, the frequency and severity of the patient's genital herpes infection should be re- evaluated to assess the need for continuation of therapy with acyclovir.

Intermittent Therapy

200 mg every 4 hours, 5 times daily for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom (prodrome) of recurrence.

Treatment of Chickenpox

Children (2 years of age and older)

20 mg/kg per dose orally 4 times daily (80 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. Children over 40 kg should receive the adult dose for chickenpox.

Adults and Children over 40 kg

800 mg 4 times daily for 5 days.

Intravenous acyclovir is indicated for the treatment of varicella-zoster infections in immunocompromised patients.

When therapy is indicated, it should be initiated at the earliest sign or symptom of chickenpox. There is no information about the efficacy of therapy initiated more than 24 hours after onset of signs and symptoms.

Patients With Acute or Chronic Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment, the dose of Acyclovir Capsules, Tablets, or Oral Suspension should be modified as shown in Table 3.

Table 3. Dosage Modification for Renal Impairment

Hemodialysis

For patients who require hemodialysis, the mean plasma half-life of acyclovir during hemodialysis is approximately 5 hours. This results in a 60% decrease in plasma concentrations following a 6-hour dialysis period. Therefore, the patient's dosing schedule should be adjusted so that an additional dose is administered after each dialysis.

Peritoneal Dialysis

No supplemental dose appears to be necessary after adjustment of the dosing interval.

Bioequivalence of Dosage Forms

Acyclovir Oral Suspension was shown to be bioequivalent to Acyclovir Capsules (n = 20) and 1 acyclovir 800-mg tablet was shown to be bioequivalent to 4 acyclovir 200-mg capsules (n = 24).

5.6 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections

Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

WARNINGS:

The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency and, in addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint or muscular pain, or both, lassitude and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions which require long-term corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroid may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.

Patients who are on immunosuppressant drugs are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in children or adults on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids. In children, or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If exposed, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as appropriate, may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Invasive group A streptococcal sepsis is a well documented complication of chickenpox, which requires prompt and aggressive treatment. Following the cluster, public health measures were put in place to prevent further disease. Varicella vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce hospital admissions as well as deaths related to chickenpox infection. This is the first reported cluster of two epidemiologically linked patients in the UK.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^1129LaiG]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicella zoster, commonly referred to as chickenpox, is a respiratory infectious disease that causes a characteristic red rash and pox on the skin surface. It is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which also causes shingles, often referred to as herpes zoster. Chickenpox symptoms typically arise 1–3 weeks after exposure to an infected individual, and a newly infected individual is infectious for around a week starting 1–2 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Symptoms last approximately 2 weeks, when the virus then retreats to the nerve ganglia in the spine. By the age of 15, nearly all children have antibodies to VZV, whether from a natural infection or vaccine. In 10–30% of adults, the latent varicella virus will reactivate and manifest as shingles, typically in adults aged over 60. The VZV vaccine prevents infection with VZV in children while a booster dose, referred to as a shingles vaccine, later in life suppresses VZV reactivation in adults.

Chickenpox and shingles can be more severe and occasionally life threatening in immunosuppressed patients.

### Varicella: is it time for a global vaccination programme? [^117Hb8dj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Varicella, known as chickenpox, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV), with an estimated 84 million cases annually. It primarily affects children, for most of whom it is a self-limiting illness. However, there are an estimated 950000 disability-adjusted life years attributed to VZV annually, disproportionately affecting lower-income settings. Children with impaired immunity and neonates are particularly at risk for severe varicella. Epidemiology varies between tropical and temperate regions with infections occurring at an earlier age in temperate climates. Varicella is a vaccine-preventable disease and over 40 countries have a universal one-dose or two-dose paediatric immunisation programme, either administered alone or combined with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination (MMRV). The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended the introduction of MMRV in November 2024. The vaccine, whether monovalent or MMRV, is effective in reducing varicella cases and hospital admissions, and two-dose regimens have further reduced breakthrough infections of shingles, a recognised concern in varicella vaccination programmes. Long-term data on shingles incidence in later life are not yet available and may be mitigated through paired universal shingles vaccination programmes for adults. Cost-effectiveness studies in high-resource settings support vaccination due to reduced hospitalisations and societal costs, such as missed caregiver employment. However, more research is needed for lower-resource regions to determine whether universal vaccination is feasible and cost-effective. While global varicella elimination is unlikely without sterilising immunity, vaccination can significantly reduce the disease burden, depending on regional epidemiology and available resources.

### Carboplatin injection (carboplatin) [^117VHJvb]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

is important to use effective birth control while you are being treated with carboplatin.

If you are breastfeeding, since nursing infants may be exposed to carboplatin in this way;
If you are taking other medicines, including all prescription and non-prescription (over-the counter) drugs, since carboplatin may affect the action of other medicines;
If you have any other medical problems, especially chicken pox (including recent exposure to adults or children with chicken pox), shingles, hearing problems, infection, or kidney disease, since treatment with carboplatin increases the risk and severity of these conditions.

What should I avoid while taking carboplatin?

If you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant, or if you are breastfeeding, let your doctor know right away. Carboplatin may harm your developing fetus or breastfeeding baby. If you are a woman of childbearing age, you should use birth control to avoid getting pregnant while you are taking carboplatin.

You should avoid contact with adults and children who have infections, and tell your doctor right away if you show signs of infection such as cough, fever, and/or chills. Also, while you are being treated with carboplatin or after you stop treatment, first check with your doctor before getting any immunizations (vaccinations). Avoid contact with adults or children who have received oral polio vaccine since they can pass the polio virus to you.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^112u5MqW]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The chickenpox vaccine was first approved for use in the USA in 1995. Despite its successful use for a quarter century, global VZV vaccination policy remains a topic of much debate. It is a live-attenuated vaccine administered in two doses during childhood. The shingles vaccine is either a single (Zostovax) or double (Shingrix) dose recombinant vaccine given later-in-life to suppresses reactivation. Chickenpox vaccination is only used in a limited number of countries, and there are multiple reasons why most countries have not yet implemented vaccination. First, complications from chickenpox are rare, with less than 1% of infected individuals experiencing severe illness. Second, childhood immunization against VZV has been hypothesized to reduce natural VZV exposure in adults. This reduction of VZV exposure could then reduce VZV immune-boosting, which would cause additional reactivation. Third, low and intermediate levels of chickenpox vaccine coverage would shift the age distribution of chickenpox infection onto older age groups who would carry a higher burden of disease. Severe complications become more common in individuals who contract chickenpox at an older age. Fourth, as with other vaccine-preventable diseases, it is likely that natural infection provides longer immunity than a vaccine dose. Despite the complexities surrounding VZV vaccination, some countries have chosen to vaccinate. Although the percent of infections resulting in serious illness is low, when endemic VZV infects the majority, vaccination prevents a substantial number of serious cases (e.g. hospitalizations). For instance, vaccination prevents an estimated 4 million cases each year in the United States, and 1% of those averted cases (approximately 40,000) would have been serious illness.

### PEPtalk 3: oral aciclovir is equivalent to varicella zoster immunoglobulin as postexposure prophylaxis against chickenpox in children with cancer-results of a multicentre UK evaluation [^114hk6Wi]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the occurrence of chickenpox in children with cancer who received varicella immunoglobulin (VZIG) or aciclovir as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).

Design

Prospective multicentre service evaluation of children with cancer who received either VZIG or aciclovir as PEP following significant exposure to varicella zoster virus (VZV) over a 24-month period from May 2018.

Setting

Data were collected from 9 UK Paediatric Oncology Primary Treatment Centres.

Patients

Children under 16 years old with a diagnosis of cancer and/or previous haematopoietic stem cell transplant who were VZV seronegative at exposure and/or diagnosis and received PEP following significant VZV exposure.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of breakthrough varicella within 6 weeks of VZV exposure and treatment with PEP.

Results

A total of 105 eligible patients were registered with a median age of 4.9 years (range 1.1–10.5years). Underlying diagnoses were acute leukaemia (64), solid tumours (22), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (9), central nervous system (CNS) tumours (8) and other (2). Aciclovir was received by 86 patients (81.9%), 18 received VZIG (17.1%) and 1 valaciclovir (0.9%). There were seven reported break-through VZV infections in 103 patients at follow-up (7/103, 6.8%). Clinical VZV developed in 5/84 of the aciclovir group (6.0%, 95%CI 2.0 to 13.3) and 2/18 of VZIG group (11.1%, 95%CI 1.4 to 34.7). All breakthrough infections were either mild (5/7) or moderate (2/7) in severity.

Conclusion

Aciclovir is a safe and effective alternative to VZIG as VZV PEP in children with cancer and should be considered as standard of care.

### Varicella gangrenosum in adult: a fatal chickenpox complication [^112A2u83]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Varicella gangrenosum is a gangrenous ulceration of varicella lesions involving the skin and soft tissues of the body. The term was coined more than 100 years ago. This occurs due to superimposed bacterial infection. The presentation of primary varicella in adults is more severe with catastrophic systemic complications as compared with children. These complications include necrotising fasciitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, wet/dry gangrene and death, as was seen in our case. Survival is dependent on early diagnosis and treatment. Adequate antibiotic treatment and particularly early radical surgical debridement should be the cornerstone of management. Less than 10 such cases are reported in the literature.

### Stromal keratitis after varicella in children [^112WgTU4]. Cornea (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We describe here a case series of patients with stromal keratitis of chronic course, a potential manifestation after chickenpox in children.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of 8 eyes (7 children) with stromal keratitis after varicella seen in our referral cornea center. All patients received a systemic antiviral treatment with oral acyclovir and topical steroid eye drops. Topical cyclosporine eye drops were associated with steroids in case of steroid dependence or steroid-related side effects. Both antiinflammatory treatments were slowly tapered over time.

Results

Median age at diagnosis was 3 years and 4 months. Stromal keratitis was unilateral in 6 children (85.7%) and consisted of superficial nummular keratitis in 4 cases and deep stromal diffuse keratitis in 3 cases. During the median follow-up of 31 months (range, 13–59 months), 6 children had 1 to 6 episodes of relapse. The median duration of topical steroid eye drop was 26 months (range, 2–59 months). Topical cyclosporine eye drops were used with steroids in 3 patients (42.9%). Three patients stopped topical steroids after 2, 5, and 8 months, without recurrence. Four patients were still undergoing treatment after a median of 43 months (range, 26–59 months). All patients regained a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 at the end of the follow-up.

Conclusions

Stromal keratitis after varicella is an entity with a potential chronic course lasting 3 months or more. Steroid dependence and relapses during tapering are 2 major challenges for the management.

### Varicella [^112ANYoi]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus, a herpesvirus, causes varicella (chickenpox) and, after endogenous reactivation, herpes zoster (shingles). Varicella, which is recognised by a characteristic vesicular rash, arises mainly in young children, although older individuals can be affected. In immunocompetent patients, symptoms are usually mild to moderate, but an uncomplicated severe case can have more than 1000 lesions and severe constitutional symptoms. Serious complications — including central nervous system involvement, pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections, and death — are sometimes seen. Varicella can be prevented by vaccination. Vaccine is about 80–85% effective against all disease and highly (more than 95%) effective in prevention of severe disease. In the USA, a routine childhood immunisation programme has reduced disease incidence, complications, hospital admissions, and deaths in children and in the general population, indicating strong herd immunity. Similar immunisation programmes have been adopted by some other countries, including Uruguay, Germany, Taiwan, Canada, and Australia, and are expected to be implemented more widely in future.

### Chickenpox and the geniculate ganglion: facial nerve palsy, ramsay hunt syndrome and acyclovir treatment [^112EoWnM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Facial nerve palsy has long been considered to have an infectious etiology. Recent diagnostic analyses in children and adults have provided convincing evidence that reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), sometimes during infectious mononucleosis, can lead to cranial nerve VII palsy. The site of reactivation from latency is the geniculate ganglion. Virus most likely enters the ganglion during chickenpox, via the sensory branches of the facial nerve located on the ear and tongue. Retrospective reviews suggest that patients with VZV-related facial nerve palsy have poorer outcomes than other cases of Bell's palsy. Therefore treatment with acyclovir is suggested when VZV reactivation i slikely.

### The effect of vaccination on the epidemiology of varicella zoster virus [^1142PtSD]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox (varicella) on primary exposure and can reactivate later in life to cause shingles (zoster). As primary infection is more serious in adults than children, and exposure to the virus might boost the immune response to both chickenpox and shingles, there are two main concerns regarding infant VZV vaccination: that it could lead to an increase in adult disease; and/or that it could lead to a temporary increase in the incidence of shingles. This paper reviews the evidence for such outcomes. The consensus view of mathematical modelling studies is that the overall varicella associated burden is likely to decrease in the long term, regardless of the level of vaccine coverage. On the other hand, recent evidence suggests that an increase in zoster incidence appears likely, and the more effective vaccination is at preventing varicella, the larger the increase in zoster incidence. Targeted vaccination of susceptible adolescents and/or the contacts of high-risk individuals can be effective at preventing disease in these individuals with minimal risk to the community. However, targeted strategies would not prevent most disease (including most severe disease), and will not lead to a long-term reduction in the incidence of zoster. Understanding the mechanisms for maintaining immunity against varicella and zoster is critical for predicting the long-term effects of vaccination. Meanwhile sensitive surveillance of both chickenpox and shingles is essential in countries that have implemented, or are about to implement, varicella vaccination.

5.4 Immunosuppression

Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases, or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

The clinical course of chicken pox or measles infection in patients on inhaled corticosteroids has not been studied. However, a clinical study has examined the immune responsiveness of asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension. An open-label non-randomized clinical study examined the immune responsiveness of varicella vaccine in 243 asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg to 1 mg daily (n = 151) or non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (n = 92) (i.e., beta2-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones). The percentage of patients developing a seroprotective antibody titer of ≥ 5.0 (gpELISA value) in response to the vaccination was similar in patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension (85%) compared to patients treated with non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (90%). No patient treated with budesonide inhalation suspension developed chicken pox as a result of vaccination.

Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.

### Clinical guidance for people at risk for severe varicella… [^113Fbznx]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options Varicella-zoster immune globulin is recommended for people exposed to varicella or herpes zoster who cannot receive varicella vaccine. These include people:

- That lack evidence of immunity to varicella.
- Whose exposure is likely to result in infection.
- At high risk for severe varicella. Varicella-zoster immune globulin can prevent varicella from developing or lessen the severity of the disease. The varicella-zoster immune globulin product licensed for use in the United States is VariZIG™. VariZIG should be given as soon as possible after exposure to VZV. It can be given within 10 days of exposure. VariZIG is commercially available from a broad network of specialty distributors in the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that oral acyclovir or valacyclovir treatment can be considered for certain groups at increased risk for moderate-to-severe varicella.

Populations at high risk include:

- Healthy people older than 12 years of age.
- People with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders.
- People who receive long-term salicylate therapy.
- People who receive short, intermittent, or aerosolized courses of corticosteroids. Some healthcare providers may choose to use oral acyclovir or valacyclovir for secondary cases within a household. For maximum benefit, oral acyclovir or valacyclovir therapy should be given within the first 24 hours after the varicella rash starts. Oral acyclovir or valacyclovir therapy is not recommended by AAP for use in otherwise healthy children experiencing typical varicella without complications. Acyclovir is a category B drug based on the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's Drug Risk Classification in pregnancy. Some experts recommend oral acyclovir or valacyclovir for pregnant women with varicella, especially during the second and third trimesters.

Clinical guidance recommends intravenous acyclovir for pregnant women with viral-mediated complications of varicella, such as pneumonia. Intravenous acyclovir therapy is recommended for:

- Severe disease.
- Varicella in immunocompromised patients. Famciclovir is available for VZV infections in adults, but its efficacy and safety are unclear for children.

Varicella disease — clinical features, transmission, incubation, and contagious period — varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes two distinct diseases: varicella (chickenpox) and, on reactivation, herpes zoster (shingles); in unvaccinated persons the rash is generalized and pruritic, generally occurring 14–16 days after exposure (range 10–21 days) and rapidly progresses within 24 hours from macules and papules to vesicles and crusts; in previously vaccinated persons, "breakthrough" infection is usually mild with an atypical rash with < 50 lesions; varicella is highly contagious with household secondary attack rates that may reach 85%-90%; person-to-person transmission is by direct contact with vesicular fluid or inhalation of aerosolized fluid from skin lesions of acute cases or infected respiratory tract secretions; the incubation period is 10–21 days (commonly 14–16 days), and the contagious period is from 1–2 days before rash appearance until all lesions have crusted, or, in unvaccinated persons, until no new lesions appear within a 24-hour period.

Chickenpox

Restrict individuals with suspected or active chickenpox from entrance to the family-centered residential facility.
Once the rash has crusted and the patient does not have a fever, they may be allowed to enter the facility. Prior to entry, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician that confirms that the rash has completely crusted and the person is no longer contagious.
Supplementary Material Tabledefines "significant exposures to chickenpox". Restrict individuals with exposures to chickenpox until they meet the criteria in Supplementary Material, Table. Prior to entry, require written medical clearance from a licensed clinician that documents the reason(s) the exposed individual is not contagious (see Supplementary Material, Figure). To be considered not contagious, a person must meet 1 of 4 of these criteria (see Supplementary Material, Table): The person has a past history of having had chickenpox or shingles (diagnosed by a healthcare professional) The person has documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine, separated by at least 3 months The person has documented varicella antibodies (also known as a positive varicella IgG blood test) It has been at least 21 days since the person's last significant exposure to the person with chickenpox (if the exposed person received post-exposure prophylaxis, such as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or varicella zoster immune globulin, it must be 28 days rather than 21 since their last exposure).
Request that individuals with suspected chickenpox leave the facility immediately and seek medical evaluation. Require written medical clearance to return.
Contact the referring medical facility and local public health department for further instruction and assistance with testing to confirm the chickenpox diagnosis.
Individuals with chickenpox are considered contagious 2 days before the first appearance of a rash. If an individual diagnosed with active chickenpox entered the facility any time during the 2 days before the rash appeared, notify the program manager immediately, who then must identify and notify exposed guests and instruct them to consult their primary care physician or licensed clinician immediately to determine need for post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis must be administered within 10 days of exposure to varicella.

### Acute childhood hemiplegia associated with chickenpox and elevated anticardiolipin antibody [^115bEcn3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Chickenpox is a common infection of childhood. Central nervous system complications, such as cerebellar ataxia and meningoencephalitis, are estimated to occur in less than 1% of cases of chickenpox. Although transverse myelitis and hemiplegia have also, although rarely, been reported, hemiplegia associated with chickenpox and elevated anticardiolipin antibody has not been reported in the literature. We report the case of a 2.5-year-old boy who developed a right hemiplegia 3 weeks after the onset of a primary varicella infection. The serum level of anticardiolipin antibody IgG was markedly elevated. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an infarction involving the left globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and posterior leg of the internal capsule. Laboratory studies ruled out all known causes of stroke. Neurologic signs and symptoms slowly improved with supportive treatment. Varicella infection should be considered one of the possible causes of acute ischemic strokes in children. Usually, two or more risk factors are detected in children with ischemic strokes, and we suggest that all possible causes of strokes be investigated in children with ischemic strokes.

GC was utilized as the primary therapy for KD before the initial report of IVIG use for KD by Furusho et al. in 1984. However, it was discontinued because of the notable increase in coronary artery damage, and there is now a consensus in China that the use of GC alone as a first-line treatment for KD is unsafe and contraindicated. When treating KD in children with GC alone, special attention should be paid to the prevention of Cushing syndrome, infection, thrombosis, osteoporosis, aseptic necrosis of the femoral head, diabetes, hypertension, hormonal glaucoma, cataracts, bradycardia, secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, and growth retardation. For the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, it is recommended to supplement vitamin D 600–800 U/D and calcium 1000–1200 mg/D during GC treatment. Before high-dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy, all kinds of infections should be fully excluded, especially tuberculosis, fungi, and chickenpox. Blood pressure, blood glucose, and other indicators should be closely monitored, and timely detection and active management of these complications should be ensured. To improve the prognosis of children with KD, we should attempt to minimise adverse reactions while using GC.

Serious ocular disease following varicella (chickenpox) is rare in children. In addition, retinitis in children with hematologic malignancies may present a difficult diagnostic challenge because infectious retinitis may mimic leukemic involvement of the eye. We report a 7-year-old patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission who presented with visual complaints 2 weeks after developing chickenpox. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed acute retinitis in the right eye. Prolonged therapy with acyclovir resulted in near complete recovery. Early diagnosis of VZV retinopathy and aggressive antiviral treatment is critical to prevent acute and long-term ocular sequelae.

### Decline in annual incidence of varicella – selected states, 1990–2001 [^115kB7JF]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella (chickenpox) is a common, highly infectious, and vaccine-preventable disease. Before the introduction of the live attenuated varicella vaccine in 1995, approximately 4 million cases of varicella occurred annually in the United States, resulting in approximately 11,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths. In 1996, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine vaccination of all children at age 12–18 months, catch-up vaccination of all susceptible children before age 13 years, and vaccination of susceptible persons with close contact to persons at high risk for serious complications. In 1999, ACIP updated these recommendations to include vaccination requirements for child care and school entry and for postexposure; ACIP also strengthened recommendations for vaccination of susceptible adults and indicated that varicella vaccine should be considered for outbreak control. Changes in the national annual reported incidence of varicella disease during 1972–1997 have been reported previously. This report summarizes trends in the annual reported incidence of varicella disease in selected states during 1990–2001. The findings underscore the continued need to improve varicella surveillance to monitor the impact of the varicella vaccination program and assess any changes in varicella transmission and disease.

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German dermatology society (DDG) [^111SYEHF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), remains dormant in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia and can be reactivated as a consequence of declining VZV-specific cellular immunity leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients older than 50 years of age affected by herpes zoster may suffer a significant decrease of quality of life. These patients and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risks for severe complications, involving the eye, the peripheral and the central nervous system (prolonged pain, postherpetic neuralgia). Such complications occur with and without cutaneous symptoms. The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines in order to guarantee updated management to anyone affected by herpes zoster. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The gold standard of laboratory diagnosis comprises PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM- and IgA-anti VZV antibodies may be helpful in immunocompromised patients. Therapy has become very effective in the last years. Systemic antiviral therapy is able to shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster, to prevent or to alleviate pain and other acute and chronic complications, particularly, when given within 48 h to a maximum of 72 h after onset of the rash. Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated in patients beyond the age of 50 years and in patients at any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, especially in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications are severe herpes zoster on the trunk and on the extremities, herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients and in patients with severe atopic dermatitis and severe ekzema. Only relative indications for antiviral therapy exist in patients younger than 50 years with zoster on the trunk and on the extremities. In Germany acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and brivudin are approved for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster. These compounds are all well tolerated by the patients and do not differ with regard to efficacy and safety. Brivudin has a markedly higher anti-VZV potency than oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir and thus offers a simpler dosing regimen. It must be given only once daily during 7 days in comparison to three and five times dosing per day of valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir, respectively. Brivudin is an antiviral agent with no nephrotoxic properties, which is an advantage when compared to acyclovir. The most important aim of therapy of herpes zoster is to achieve painlessness. Appropriately dosed analgesics in combination with a neuroactive agent (i.e. amitriptylin) are very helpful when given together with antiviral therapy. The additive therapy with corticosteroids may shorten the degree and duration of acute zoster pain, but has no essential effect on the development of postherpetic neuralgia, which is a very difficult condition to treat. Thus early presentation to a pain therapist is recommended in specific cases.

Treatment recommendations — treating varicella disease in children with HIV: Acyclovir is the drug of choice and should be initiated as soon as possible after varicella lesions appear. In immune competent children, new lesions can continue to appear for 72 hours after initiation of acyclovir and crusting may take 5 days to 7 days. In children with HIV, intravenous (IV) acyclovir is recommended for those with severe immunosuppression (CDC Immunologic Stage 3) or significant systemic or skin findings. For children aged < 1 year, dosing is 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours as a 1-hour infusion; for older children some use the same dose, while others use 500 mg/m² IV every 8 hours as a 1-hour infusion. Administration is for 7 days to 10 days, provided at least 48 hours have elapsed since the appearance of new lesions.

### Varicella death of an unvaccinated, previously healthy adolescent – Ohio, 2009 [^117VHUFV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

The case described in this report can serve as a reminder of the importance of catch-up vaccination of older children and adolescents to prevent varicella and its serious complications later in life when disease can be more severe. Approaches that are used to implement catch-up vaccination include school-entry vaccination requirements and routine health-care provider visits. Ohio currently has a 2-dose varicella vaccination requirement for admission to kindergarten through 2nd grades, and a 1-dose requirement for admission to 3rd–6th grades. However, when the patient aged 15 years contracted varicella, no varicella vaccination school-entry requirements covered her grade. With continued implementation of the 2-dose requirement in Ohio, an additional grade will be added each school year so that, by 2022, the requirement will cover all grades; religious and medical exemptions will continue to be allowed. To cover cohorts of students enrolled in school before elementary school requirements took effect, implementation of varicella vaccination entry requirements for students entering middle school, high school, and college should be considered. Routine health-care provider visits, including the recommended visit at age 11–12 years, also provide an opportunity to evaluate vaccination status and administer recommended vaccinations.

Exposure to VZV can occur when persons are exposed to patients with varicella (chickenpox) or herpes zoster (shingles). Unvaccinated children, adolescents, and adults are at risk for acquiring varicella; severe varicella can develop among healthy persons, and which patients might develop an especially severe course often is unpredictable at disease onset. Health-care providers should remind parents about vaccination during routine visits for children and adolescents, and parents should be informed of the risks, including potentially severe complications, from vaccine-preventable diseases. Resources for discussions with parents regarding vaccination are available. † Adult patients who have no evidence of varicella immunity should be offered varicella vaccine. For otherwise healthy persons aged > 12 years who develop varicella, oral acyclovir is recommended. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within the first 24 hours. Intravenous acyclovir therapy is recommended for immunocompromised patients, and also in cases with serious, viral-mediated complications.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113qodxJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) disease — varicella treatment in children includes oral acyclovir for mild disease in those with no or moderate immune suppression at "Acyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose by mouth (maximum 800 mg/dose) four times a day for 7–10 days and until no new lesions for 48 hours". For severe immune suppression or severe varicella disease, use "Acyclovir 10 mg/kg body weight or 500 mg/m²/dose IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days and until no new lesions for 48 hours". For patients unresponsive to acyclovir, the alternative is "Foscarnet (40–60 mg/kg body weight/dose IV every 8 hours) for 7–10 days or until no new lesions have appeared for 48 hours". Comments note dosing practices and alternatives: "In children aged ≥ 1 year, some experts base IV acyclovir dosing on body surface area (500 mg/m² body surface area/dose IV every 8 hours) instead of body weight", and "Valacyclovir is approved for use in adults and adolescents with zoster at 1 g/dose by mouth three times a day for 7 days; the same dose has been used for varicella infections". Pediatric dosing is provided: "Valacyclovir can be used in children at a dose of 20 to 25 mg/kg body weight administered 2 to 3 times a day", with the caution that "Doses lower than this may be insufficient for children weighing < 20 kg", and formulation guidance that "500-mg capsules can be extemporaneously compounded to make a suspension to administer valacyclovir 20 mg/kg body weight/dose (maximum dose 1 g) given three times a day (see prescribing information)".

### The course and outcome of unilateral intracranial arteriopathy in 79 children with ischaemic stroke [^1113WLyp]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Outcome, recurrence rate and treatment

Although the inflammatory phase of TCA is supposedly transient, 59% of children are left with permanent neurological deficits, and 77% have residual arterial lesions at repeated angiography. In this study, the overall recurrence rate of ischaemic symptoms was 22%, with 18% recurrences in the TCA group. This probably is an underestimate, because recurrent events during the first week after presentation were not included in the analysis, since these may be considered part of the index stroke. Three recent publications have in depth addressed recurrence rates in childhood stroke. In the study of Sträter et al. (2002), 6.6% of children with an AIS had a recurrent ischaemic stroke. TIAs were not included in the endpoint. Thirty percent of previously healthy children with AIS in London had a recurrent stroke or TIA (Ganesan et al.). In a Californian population-based cohort study, the 5-year cumulative recurrence rate after childhood ischaemic stroke was 19% (Fullerton et al.). In all three studies, children with vasculopathy were shown to be particularly at risk. It has recently been suggested that children with progressive arteriopathies have a higher risk of stroke recurrence, although this did not reach statistical significance (Danchaivijitr et al.). We confirm that the risk of stroke recurrence in previously healthy children with unilateral intracranial arteriopathy is significantly associated with progression of arterial disease.

There are relatively few clinical and radiological parameters that may, based on this study, help predict the course of childhood unilateral intracranial arteriopathy, outcome and recurrence and crucially, these may not be available at initial presentation. Preceding chickenpox tends to be associated with non-progressive arterial disease. A mainly cortical localization is associated with poor functional outcome. Arterial occlusion at any (initial or follow-up) angiography may predict poor outcome and stroke recurrence. Occlusion and moyamoya vessels are associated with progressive arteriopathy. When the arteriopathy completely normalizes in TCA, functional outcome tends to be better. Finally, documented progression at any time during follow-up increases the chance of recurrent symptoms. We found no relation between outcome or recurrence and arterial beading and antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment. Obviously, the limited statistical power of our study hampers the ability to identify all independent predictors of outcome, recurrence and course of the arteriopathy. We will in future studies address the predictive value of laboratory investigation in childhood arteriopathies.

### Transmission of varicella vaccine virus, Japan [^114Sxd6v]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a human herpesvirus, is the causative agent of varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Worldwide, children are routinely vaccinated with a live attenuated varicella vaccine containing the Oka vaccine (vOka) strain of VZV, originally developed in Japan. Although the risk for secondary transmission of the vOka strain from immunocompromised vaccinees to susceptible persons is relatively high, the risk for transmission from immunocompetent vaccinees is low. We report secondary transmission of the vOka strain from an immunocompetent girl with a history of varicella vaccination to her healthy susceptible brother.

Herpes zoster developed in a healthy 3-year-old girl 2 years after she had received the varicella vaccine (lot VZ040; Biken, Osaka, Japan). She received oral acyclovir treatment and fully recovered by day 19 after herpes zoster onset. On the same day that the girl recovered, her immunocompetent 2-year-old brother was found to have fever and a rash consisting of 10–20 papulovesicles; mild varicella was diagnosed. The boy had no known history of contact with persons infected with varicella or with persons who administered the varicella vaccine. After receiving oral acyclovir treatment, the boy recovered without systemic complications.

### Guidance for cruise ships on the management of varicella (chickenpox) [2013] [^114NjMvm]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) — varicella vaccine states that to prevent illness, a first dose of varicella vaccine should be administered within 3 days of exposure (possibly up to 5 days) to all susceptible contacts who lack evidence of immunity except those who are pregnant or immunosuppressed; a second dose should be given at ACIP‑recommended intervals of at least 3 months for persons aged < 13 years and at least 4 weeks for persons aged ≥ 13 years, with only single‑antigen varicella vaccine used in the ≥ 13 years group; vaccination is still recommended beyond 5 days to prevent infection from future exposures and further spread, and susceptible contacts with documentation of one prior dose may receive a second dose — except for those who are pregnant or immunosuppressed — if the interval is appropriate per the manufacturer's schedule.

### Kaposi varicelliform eruption in a patient with epidermolysis bullosa simplex generalized severe [^114eQB23]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Our case also highlights the importance of preventing herpetic superinfection in children with EB. Like in atopic dermatitis, we have to prevent these infections. Informing parents of the risk of contagion must become routine. Prophylactic treatment of the parents should also be discussed to avoid transmission. In recent guidelines for the management of inherited EB, chicken pox vaccination is recommended, but currently there is no recommendation for the prevention of herpetic infections. Our case highlights the importance of diagnosing and preventing herpetic superinfection in children with EB, a probably underestimated complication of this disease.

### Triamcinolone acetonide (Triesence) [^1162Cimm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Increased Risks Related to Infections

Corticosteroids may increase the risks related to infections with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections. The degree to which the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration correlates with the specific risks of infection is not well characterized; however, with increasing doses of corticosteroids, the rate of occurrence of infectious complications increases.

Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection and may reduce resistance to new infections.

Corticosteroids may exacerbate infections and increase risk of disseminated infection. The use of corticosteroids in active tuberculosis should be restricted to those cases of fulminating or disseminated tuberculosis in which the corticosteroid is used for the management of the disease in conjunction with an appropriate antituberculous regimen.

Chickenpox and measles can have a more serious or even fatal course in non-immune children or adults on corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.

Corticosteroids should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia.

Corticosteroids may increase risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infection. If corticosteroids are indicated in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, close observation is necessary as reactivation of the disease may occur. During prolonged corticosteroid therapy, these patients should receive chemoprophylaxis.

Corticosteroids may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in the tropics or in any patient with unexplained diarrhea.

Corticosteroids should not be used in cerebral malaria.

### Herpes zoster meningitis in a young, immunocompetent adult [^114aEM7h]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Varicella-zoster virus is typically encountered in the emergency department (ED) in two forms: varicella (chickenpox) in children and zoster (shingles) in older adults. Zoster is infrequently encountered in young, healthy adults, and neurological complications are extremely rare.

Case Report

We describe a case of a previously healthy 36-year-old woman who presented to the ED with fever, nuchal rigidity, and headache 4 days after being diagnosed with herpes zoster and started on oral valacyclovir. Lumbar puncture confirmed herpes zoster meningitis. Despite initiation of antivirals within 48 h of symptom onset, progression to zoster meningitis occurred. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians must be aware that neurological complications of varicella zoster can develop despite initiation of oral antivirals. These patients must be identified in the ED, as admission for intravenous antivirals is indicated.

### Evaluating the impact of moderate and severe varicella infections on Danish children under 18 years old: a comprehensive analysis from 2015 to 2023 [^1172S46q]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Varicella (chickenpox) caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious pediatric disease. While it typically manifests as a mild disease, complications leading to hospitalization are not uncommon. Knowing the current disease burden, seasonality and risk groups is pivotal for evidence-based decisions on the introduction of a varicella vaccine.

Methods:

Using the Danish National Patient Register and medical helpline records from the Capital Region, we estimated the burden of VZV infections among children younger than 18 years in Denmark from 2015 to June 2023.

Results:

We identified 14,443 cases with annual incidence rates of 325/100,000 children for mild-to-moderate varicella cases (helpline calls), 35/100,000 for moderate-to-severe cases (outpatients) and 10/100,000 for severe cases (hospitalized). Mild cases were most prevalent in children 1–4 years old, while moderate-to-severe cases were most prevalent among infants < 1 year old. Among hospitalized cases, 23.2% had underlying diseases and 47.3% experienced complications. In April 2022, rapid surge in all types of VZV cases occurred, where admissions surpassed the prepandemic level.

Conclusion:

This study documents that varicella is highly prevalent among Danish young children. Mild-to-moderately severe cases strain healthcare, causing increased helpline calls and posing a persistent hospitalization risk, especially for infants and children with underlying conditions.

### Childhood and adolescent cancer care at a tertiary hospital in Northern tanzania: a retrospective study [^115esm58]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

We found a relatively high rate of children presenting with advanced-stage disease, with over 75% of patients with cancer diagnosed at stages III and IV. Similar trends have been reported in other studies from Africa. These patterns in LMICs have been explained by complex referral systems, in which children with cancers are first seen at local health clinics and cannot be evaluated at district or national centers without a clinician referral. By the time these patients are referred to a higher-level hospital, they are often already in an advanced stages of disease. Some cancer symptoms can be confused with other common pediatric illnesses like dengue, typhoid, flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, and diarrhea. This often leads to misdiagnosis and a wrong path of treatment. Consequently, these patients have usually been seen at district and regional hospitals by the time they are referred to the specialized oncology centers. However, there is also the possibility that patients present late because of barriers in seeking timely care. For instance, community stigma, cultural beliefs, and traditional medicine are common determinants of delayed care in other low-resource settings. - Further data collection is needed to determine the reasons why children with cancer are diagnosed at late stages in the Kilimanjaro region.

The patients at KCMC were more likely to receive chemotherapy, compared with radiation therapy or surgery. This pattern aligns with the high proportion of hematologic malignancies reported in our cohort and is similar to treatment patterns seen in many LMICs. However, many children's malignancies such as neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, and Wilms tumor require multimodality care, and lack of radiation therapy and surgery constitutes a major challenge to comprehensive and high-quality cancer care. There is a shortage of access to radiation therapy in many LMICs, which might contribute to the observed pattern of care in Tanzania. The shortage of pediatric surgical workforce in many African countries may play a similar role in the care pattern at KCMC. Several other factors might contribute to these care patterns, including a potential cultural fear of surgery and a preference for traditional medicine over allopathic medicine that especially disfavors radiotherapy. In addition, medicines are often used for several other conditions widely prevalent in Africa, such as malaria and tuberculosis. This widespread use could have normalized the perception of medical treatments and help parents become more comfortable with the notion of their children undergoing chemotherapy.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^116v7x9U]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Varicella zoster virus conjunctivitis — Children with chicken pox may present with conjunctivitis that is sometimes associated with eyelid ulceration and/or limbal or conjunctival vesicles, and many clinicians treat such patients with topical antibiotics to prevent secondary infection because the vesicles will undergo necrosis before healing. Topical antivirals alone have not been shown to be helpful in treating VZV conjunctivitis but may be used as additive treatment in unresponsive patients. In rare cases, dendritic or stromal keratitis can occur, and VZV conjunctivitis can be associated with pseudodendrites, keratitis, corneal scarring, corneal vascularization, iritis/uveitis, sectoral iris atrophy, and secondary glaucoma.

### Necrotising fasciitis as a complication of primary varicella infection in an immunocompetent child [^113hBnGX]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis (NF) is an infrequent yet significant complication of primary varicella infection in immunocompetent children. We report a case of a 4-year-old girl who presented three days into her chicken pox illness, with a rapidly progressing, severely tender erythematous rash surrounding one chicken pox lesion on her thigh. She required intravenous antibiotics, two surgical debridements, a skin graft and a prolonged stay in the paediatric intensive care unit, but ultimately we were able to save her life and limb. NF is a rare complication of chicken pox that has high morbidity and mortality that requires prompt and specific treatment.

### Varicella vaccination of children with leukemia without interruption of maintenance therapy: a Danish experience [^1118MU5C]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can be fatal or cause severe complications in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This analysis set out to investigate the morbidity and mortality of VZV vaccination without interruption of maintenance therapy in children with ALL.

Methods

Files of 73 seronegative children with ALL were examined for data regarding VZV vaccination and infection, and long-term seroconversion was measured. Criteria before VZV vaccination were (1) seronegative, (2) in complete remission, (3) age ≥ 1.0 year, (4) lymphocyte count ≥ 0.6×10/L at time of vaccination and (5) receiving maintenance therapy.

Results

Forty-five children were vaccinated. No child died or experienced serious adverse events due to VZV vaccination. Nine children developed late chickenpox despite vaccination. Long-term protection was found in 86% of children not receiving acyclovir and 78% of the entire population. Long-term seroconversion was found in 52% of the children. There were no severe cases of varicella infection. Acyclovir prophylaxis postvaccination was associated with an increased risk of late chickenpox [hazard ratio = 5.40 (1.43, 20.41), P = 0.01]. In contrast, a vaccine-induced rash reduced the risk of late chickenpox [hazard ratio = 0.08 (0.01, 0.66), P = 0.02]. No child had interruption of maintenance therapy at the time of vaccination, but 33% experienced discontinuation of therapy due to vaccine-induced rash. Dexamethasone was associated with an increased risk of vaccine-induced rash [hazard ratio = 2.9 (1.21, 6.90), P = 0.02].

Conclusions

This analysis indicates that VZV vaccination is feasible and justified in seronegative children with ALL, in countries where VZV vaccination is not part of the national vaccination program.

### Varicella paediatric hospitalisations in Belgium: a 1-year national survey [^1171rRQR]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Varicella (chickenpox), caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), usually presents as a vesicular eruption associated with general symptoms like fever and malaise. Endemic worldwide, this infection is self-limiting in the vast majority of infected individuals. However, some complications are commonly described, mainly skin or disseminated bacterial superinfections, central nervous system disturbances, pneumonia and haematological disorders. Although these complications are more frequent and severe in high-risk subgroups (adults and adolescents, pregnant women, immunocompromised patients), they can also affect otherwise healthy children and subsequently increase the burden of the disease, in addition to its high societal and economic impact.

Safe and effective live-attenuated vaccines against varicella were developed in the 1970s. Consequently, varicella universal vaccination (UV) has been implemented for > 10 years in many countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia and Germany, showing conclusive efficacy results. According to recent American and European studies, UV actually resulted in a decrease of at least 88% in varicella incidence, mortality, complicated cases and hospitalisations. Even though a slight shift of incidence peak was noticed towards older children, the vaccination's impact was demonstrated to be significant among all age groups. Based on long-term epidemiological surveillance, a global consensus was achieved to recommend a 2-dose schedule, in order to avoid breakthrough outbreaks and improve vaccine effectiveness and herd protection.

Nevertheless, most European countries remain hesitant to implement varicella UV (only implemented in 5 out of 28 European Union countries). The main reasons are a poorly defined cost–benefit balance in their own socioeconomic setting and important concurrent priorities for healthcare resource allocation. Additionally, some concern arose about a temporary increase in herpes zoster (HZ) after UV due to a lack of exogenous boosting. Although plausible and supported by mathematical models, this hypothesis remains a source of debate.

In Belgium, varicella incidence is estimated around 113 000 cases/year, leading to 28.8–35.7 general practitioners (GPs) visits/10⁴ people per year. However, routine varicella vaccination is not yet recommended in our country. The vaccination coverage based on a subnational survey was estimated to be less than 2.5% (2-dose schedule). Few data are available on the real burden of varicella disease and on the potential benefits achievable from a national vaccination campaign in Belgium. In this study, we prospectively assessed the burden of varicella disease over the whole Belgian area through analysis of hospitalised cases during a 1-year period.

The increase in the number and classes of antiviral agents that has occurred since the 1980s is remarkable. The rapid expansion in therapeutic options for previously untreatable illnesses challenges clinicians to gain familiarity and experience with these new drugs, especially with regard to their use in children. This article describes the clinical utilities, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of these new drugs to empower practitioners to use them appropriately.

### Management of a major varicella zoster exposure in a pediatric oncology population [^114ir9YS]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of the exposure of pediatric oncology patients to varicella zoster virus (VZV) is controversial. We report the exposure of 56 patients to a single child with chicken pox at a pediatric cancer housing facility and describe our strategic approach for their management. We reviewed the immune and clinical status of 56 children with cancer receiving ongoing treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) who, while living at a pediatric cancer housing facility, were exposed to the index patient. The management of patients exposed included: (1) determination of immune status, (2) availability of vaccination history or VZV disease prophylaxis, (3) exposure status and subsequent isolation during the period of incubation, and (4) VZV disease prophylaxis. In addition to the 56 patients exposed to the index case, eight children with cancer treated at other facilities and 11 healthy siblings living in the facility were exposed. Of the 56 MSK patients, 21 were classified as immunosuppressed and received varicella zoster immune globulin (human), intravenous standard immune globulin, or acyclovir based on serostatus and immune function. The cohort was followed for 4 weeks after the exposure and no secondary infections were diagnosed. We performed a risk assessment and created a management plan to control and prevent further exposure and development of disease. No secondary cases developed. This strategic approach could serve as a model for the management of VZV exposure for other pediatric oncology centers.
