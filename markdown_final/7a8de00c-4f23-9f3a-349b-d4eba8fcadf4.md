## Question

Diastolic hypertension treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diastolic hypertension treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining diastolic hypertension and its prevalence. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for treating isolated diastolic hypertension versus systolic-diastolic hypertension. Next, I will review guideline thresholds for initiation and targets by age and risk. After that, I need to check the J-curve concern and what to do when diastolic pressure gets too low. Then, I will examine first-line drug choices and how to monitor. Finally, I will integrate special populations and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach with caveats about evidence gaps and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Diastolic hypertension is typically defined as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) is DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg with systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg; IDH accounts for a minority of hypertension cases and is more common in younger adults and men, with relatively low awareness and treatment rates in large cohorts, which underscores a clinical gap that I should keep in mind as I proceed [^eb7095c5] [^b3025371].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for treating IDH specifically, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from systolic-focused trials. The PROGRESS trial subgroup analysis suggested that blood pressure lowering reduced major vascular events in patients with isolated diastolic hypertension by about 28%, with a point estimate similar to systolic or combined hypertension, although the confidence interval was wide and the analysis was underpowered, so I should be cautious about inferring definitive benefit from this single subgroup analysis [^37cfc109]. Hold on, I should also note that contemporary reviews emphasize heterogeneity in IDH risk and call for individualized, risk-based management rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, which aligns with the limited direct trial evidence in IDH [^45be8c21].

> Next, I should review guideline thresholds for initiating pharmacotherapy, and I need to be precise about age-stratified recommendations. JNC 8 recommends initiating treatment at DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years and for adults 30–59 years, with a target DBP < 90 mm Hg; for adults 18–29 years, the recommendation is expert opinion–based and also targets DBP < 90 mm Hg, reflecting limited direct evidence in this youngest group [^2547998a] [^7a4f4bda]. The VA/DoD guideline similarly recommends treating to DBP < 90 mm Hg for patients ≥ 30 years and suggests treatment at DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg for ages 18–29, again reflecting weaker evidence in younger adults [^87871d31] [^80e3f9c1]. In contrast, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline lowers diagnostic thresholds and recommends treatment at ≥ 130/80 mm Hg for adults with high cardiovascular risk, which would capture many with IDH who are ≥ 65 years or have ASCVD risk ≥ 10%, even though the strength of direct IDH outcome evidence remains limited [^36fc626f] [^1a022f91].

> I will now examine treatment targets, and I should double-check the J-curve concern because overtreatment can be harmful. Multiple analyses suggest a J-shaped relationship for DBP, with increased cardiovascular risk when on-treatment DBP falls below about 60 mm Hg, particularly in patients whose SBP is already controlled to < 130 mm Hg; this argues for avoiding excessive diastolic lowering and reassessing therapy if DBP drifts into the 50s or lower [^9d2afb84] [^76ab7261]. But wait, what if the apparent harm is just confounding? Mediation analyses from SPRINT suggest that the association of very low DBP with worse outcomes attenuates after adjustment, implying that very low DBP may be a marker of underlying vascular disease rather than a direct causal harm from therapy; still, prudence dictates avoiding iatrogenic diastolic hypotension when feasible [^20a969f7] [^463c82c6].

> Let me think about first-line drug choices and whether any class is superior for diastolic hypertension. The totality of evidence indicates that lowering blood pressure itself drives most of the cardiovascular benefit, and no class has proven superiority for diastolic-specific outcomes; therefore, thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers are all reasonable first-line options, with selection tailored to comorbidity, race/ethnicity, and patient preference [^a633a2d5] [^f30b22ff]. I should confirm that in Black patients, thiazides or calcium channel blockers are preferred initially, and in chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated for renal protection, which can guide class selection even when the presenting phenotype is diastolic hypertension [^b8cf1ba0] [^a4680c5c].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration so I don't miss safety signals. Home blood pressure monitoring or validated automated office measurement improves accuracy and helps detect excessive diastolic lowering; if DBP falls below about 60 mm Hg with symptoms or adverse effects, I should reconsider regimen intensity, and if DBP remains ≥ 90 mm Hg despite adherence and appropriate doses, I should escalate therapy or add a second agent per guideline algorithms [^9d2afb84] [^b8cf1ba0]. Hold on, I should verify that the practical target for most adults remains DBP < 90 mm Hg, while acknowledging that some high-risk patients may be managed within broader frameworks that prioritize overall cardiovascular risk reduction rather than a single diastolic number [^2547998a] [^1a022f91].

> I need to ensure I address special populations where thresholds or targets differ. In pregnancy, treatment is generally reserved for persistent SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, with preferred agents including methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine, and hydralazine; tighter DBP targets such as < 85 mm Hg have not shown clear fetal benefit and may carry maternal risks, so less aggressive control is reasonable unless severe hypertension emerges [^f19d5470] [^04448021]. In older adults, especially those ≥ 80 years or frail, overly aggressive diastolic lowering may worsen perfusion; therefore, tolerating slightly higher DBP may be appropriate if it preserves cognition, balance, and renal perfusion, consistent with ESH guidance to individualize targets in the elderly [^12762716] [^0b0b0009].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, but I should confirm it aligns with the evidence and guidelines. For adults ≥ 30 years with persistent DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, I would initiate pharmacotherapy and titrate to DBP < 90 mm Hg if tolerated, while monitoring for symptoms, orthostasis, and cognitive changes; if DBP drifts below 60 mm Hg, I would reduce dose or de-prescribe when feasible, recognizing that the harm signal is stronger in those with already controlled SBP [^2547998a] [^9d2afb84]. For adults 18–29 years with DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, I would individualize, favoring lifestyle therapy first and reserving medication for those with high risk, symptoms, or progressive elevation, given the weaker evidence base in this group [^7a4f4bda] [^87871d31]. For high-risk adults who meet ACC/AHA criteria, I would treat at ≥ 130/80 mm Hg while still avoiding excessive diastolic lowering and reassessing net clinical benefit over time [^36fc626f] [^1a022f91].

> But wait, what about the future of IDH management and where the evidence is weakest? I should acknowledge that direct, adequately powered randomized trials focused on isolated diastolic hypertension are lacking, and current guidance extrapolates from mixed-hypertension populations; ongoing and future pragmatic trials, as well as better phenotyping of IDH by age, vascular stiffness, and biomarkers, are needed to clarify who benefits most from treatment and what the optimal diastolic targets should be across subgroups [^fbbd0447] [^45be8c21]. Until then, I will continue to apply a risk-stratified, guideline-concordant approach that treats DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg in appropriate adults, avoids iatrogenic diastolic hypotension, and remains vigilant for emerging evidence that could refine thresholds and targets in IDH [^2547998a] [^9d2afb84].

---

Treat diastolic hypertension by **initiating pharmacologic therapy when DBP is ≥ 90 mm Hg** [^7a4f4bda] in adults ≥ 30 years, with a **target DBP < 90 mm Hg** [^87871d31]. Use first-line agents such as thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or calcium channel blockers [^a633a2d5], and add a second agent if the goal is not reached [^b8cf1ba0]. In adults ≥ 60 years, treat to **< 150/90 mm Hg** [^2547998a]; in younger adults, aim for **< 140/90 mm Hg** [^7a4f4bda]. Avoid excessive DBP lowering below 60 mm Hg [^9d2afb84] due to increased cardiovascular risk [^76ab7261]. Combine lifestyle measures — sodium restriction, weight loss, and regular exercise — with medication to optimize control [^f30b22ff].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Diastolic hypertension is defined as a **DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg** [^7a4f4bda]; isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) is DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg with SBP < 140 mm Hg. IDH is common in younger adults and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, particularly stroke and coronary heart disease [^eb7095c5] [^37cfc109].

---

## Treatment thresholds and targets

Treatment thresholds and targets vary by age and risk:

| **Population** | **Treatment threshold** | **Target dbp** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population ≥ 30 years | ≥ 90 mm Hg [^7a4f4bda] | < 90 mm Hg [^87871d31] |
| Adults ≥ 60 years | ≥ 90 mm Hg [^2547998a] | < 90 mm Hg (with SBP < 150 mm Hg) [^2547998a] |
| Adults 18–29 years | ≥ 90 mm Hg (expert opinion) [^7a4f4bda] | < 90 mm Hg (expert opinion) [^87871d31] |

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are foundational and **reduce DBP by 4–10 mm Hg**:

- **Sodium restriction**: < 2.3 g/day.
- **Weight loss**: aim for BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Regular aerobic exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women) or ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).
- **Dietary patterns**: DASH or Mediterranean diets.

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### First-line antihypertensive agents

First-line options include:

- **Thiazide diuretics**: chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide [^a633a2d5].
- **ACE inhibitors**: lisinopril, enalapril [^a4680c5c].
- **ARBs**: losartan, valsartan [^b8cf1ba0].
- **Calcium channel blockers**: amlodipine, diltiazem [^a633a2d5].

---

### Selection considerations

Selection should be guided by comorbidities: **ACE inhibitors/ARBs** for diabetes or CKD [^b8cf1ba0], and **calcium channel blockers or thiazides** for isolated diastolic hypertension without compelling indications [^notfound].

---

### Combination therapy

Add a second agent from a different class if the target is not achieved after 4–6 weeks of monotherapy [^b8cf1ba0].

---

## Risks and benefits of intensive diastolic blood pressure lowering

Intensive DBP lowering reduces cardiovascular events, but **excessive lowering below 60 mm Hg** increases risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and mortality [^9d2afb84] [^76ab7261]. The optimal DBP appears to be 70–80 mm Hg in patients with treated SBP < 130 mm Hg [^9d2afb84].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Elderly patients**: higher DBP targets may be appropriate due to increased risk of hypotension and falls [^notfound].
- **Pregnancy**: treat when DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg; preferred agents include methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine [^0dfc08a8].
- **Comorbidities**: tailor therapy to diabetes, CKD, or cardiovascular disease [^b8cf1ba0].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **BP at 2–4 week intervals** until control, then every 3–6 months. Use home BP monitoring to improve adherence and detect white-coat or masked hypertension [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate pharmacologic therapy**: DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg in adults ≥ 30 years [^7a4f4bda].
- **Target DBP**: < 90 mm Hg for most adults; < 80 mm Hg may be considered in high-risk patients [^87871d31] [^4beaa030].
- **First-line agents**: thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or calcium channel blockers [^a633a2d5].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: essential adjuncts to medication [^f30b22ff].
- **Avoid excessive DBP lowering**: maintain DBP ≥ 60 mm Hg when possible [^9d2afb84].

---

Diastolic hypertension treatment centers on **initiating therapy at DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg** [^7a4f4bda], targeting **DBP < 90 mm Hg** [^87871d31], and using lifestyle plus first-line agents, while avoiding excessive DBP lowering below 60 mm Hg [^9d2afb84]. Therapy should be individualized by age, comorbidities, and tolerance, with regular monitoring to balance efficacy and safety.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^9d2afb84]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

### What is the most important component of blood pressure: systolic, diastolic or pulse pressure? [^b1de9b18]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diastolic blood pressure has traditionally been considered the most important component of blood pressure and the primary target of antihypertensive therapy. However, over 30 years ago important epidemiological studies pointed out the importance of systolic blood pressure, and research during the 1990s has strengthened this view. Unlike diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure increases progressively with age, and in the ageing societies elevated systolic pressure is the most common form of hypertension. The characteristic changes of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with age lead to increases in pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic), which has emerged as a new, potentially independent risk factor. In this review we compare the relative importance of various blood pressure components.

Recent Findings

Generally, in studies in which readings of systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been compared, systolic blood pressure has been a better predictor of risk. Moreover, isolated systolic hypertension predicts risk better than isolated diastolic hypertension, and the treatment of both isolated systolic hypertension and combined hypertension has reduced cardiovascular events. There are no treatment studies of isolated diastolic hypertension. Pulse pressure reflects stiffening of large arteries and is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors. Pulse pressure also predicts events in epidemiologic studies, but elucidation of an independent role is hampered by the close correlation between pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure.

Summary

Epidemiological and treatment studies suggest that systolic blood pressure should be the primary target of antihypertensive therapy, although consideration of systolic and diastolic pressure together improves risk prediction. The greatest practical concern at the moment is the undertreatment of hypertension, especially systolic, and total cardiovascular risk.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^c202a50b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the third update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, we used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was January 2022. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 mmHg to 160 mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure (CHF)) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7 studies, 9595 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.77 mmHg, 95% CI -12.82 to -4.73; 7 studies, 8657 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets at one year were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.23; 7 studies, 8699 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

### Association between baseline diastolic blood pressure and the efficacy of intensive vs standard blood pressure-lowering therapy [^760b4e0f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an interaction between baseline diastolic blood pressure and intensification of blood pressure–lowering therapy for survival and cardiovascular outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 14 094 patients from 2 large randomized clinical trials, baseline DBP of 80 and 90 mm Hg were associated with significant reductions in the risk of a composite cardiovascular end point that included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The same was not true for the outcome of all-cause death.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that further work is needed to determine whether blood-pressure lowering therapy should be intensified in patients whose diastolic blood pressure is low.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^bf16a63f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older [^be8c7562]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second substantive update of this review. It was originally published in 1998 and was previously updated in 2009. Elevated blood pressure (known as 'hypertension') increases with age - most rapidly over age 60. Systolic hypertension is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than is diastolic hypertension, and it occurs more commonly in older people. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and people 80 years or older.

Objectives

Primary objective• To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertensionSecondary objectives• To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension• To quantify the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to 24 November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for adult patients (≥ 60 years old) with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality; and withdrawal due to adverse effects. We modified the definition of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity to exclude transient ischaemic attacks when possible.

Main Results

This update includes one additional trial (MRC-TMH 1985). Sixteen trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.4 years) from western industrialised countries with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first-line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years. Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all-cause mortality (high-certainty evidence; 11% with control vs 10.0% with treatment; risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.97; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (moderate-certainty evidence; 13.6% with control vs 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (moderate-certainty evidence; 5.2% with control vs 3.4% with treatment; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (moderate-certainty evidence; 4.8% with control vs 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with treatment (low-certainty evidence; 5.4% with control vs 15.7% with treatment; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30. In the three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. This comprehensive systematic review provides additional evidence that the reduction in mortality observed was due mostly to reduction in the 60- to 79-year-old patient subgroup (high-certainty evidence; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95). Although cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was significantly reduced in both subgroups 60 to 79 years old (moderate-certainty evidence; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.77) and 80 years or older (moderate-certainty evidence; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87), the magnitude of absolute risk reduction was probably higher among 60- to 79-year-old patients (3.8% vs 2.9%). The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was primarily due to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most evidence of benefit pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^922ef231]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130–139/80–89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease < 10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (< 130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and risk of cardiovascular disease: controversies in hypertension-pro side of the argument [^45be8c21]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), defined as diastolic blood pressure in the hypertensive range but systolic blood pressure not in the hypertensive range, is not uncommon (< 20%) among adults with hypertension. IDH often manifests in concurrence with other cardiovascular risk factors. Individuals with IDH tend to have lower awareness of their hypertension compared with those with both systolic and diastolic hypertension. IDH appears to be a largely underrated risk factor for cardiovascular disease events, which may be explained by inconsistent association of IDH with cardiovascular disease events. The inconsistency suggests that IDH is heterogeneous. One size does not seem to fit all in the clinical management of individuals with IDH. Rather than treating IDH as a monolithic low-risk condition, detailed phenotyping in the context of individual comprehensive cardiovascular risk would seem to be most useful to assess an individual's expected net benefit from therapy. In this review, we highlight that the clinical relevance of IDH differs by individual clinical characteristics, and elucidate groups of individuals with IDH that should be wary of cardiovascular disease risks.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^5d59f71b]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added. In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life.

In the general population younger than 60 years, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 140 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. The target systolic pressure in this population is less than 140 mm Hg, and the target diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker.

If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moderate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients. Guideline source: Eighth Joint National Committee Evidence rating system used. Yes Literature search described. Yes.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^a54c5853]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects around 30% of adults globallyand is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) revealed that intensive treatment targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 120 mm Hg was superior to standard treatment targeting SBP < 140 mm Hg in reducing cardiovascular events by 25% and all‐cause death by 27%. Consequently, the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline revised the blood pressure (BP) treatment target to < 130/80 mm Hg.

For the patients on antihypertensive treatment, while the association between high SBP and cardiovascular risk is well established, the potential harms posed by elevated diastolic BP (DBP) is still debated, especially when SBP achieves the target. This condition is known as treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH). Most studies examining the ACC/AHA definition of IDH have not found its correlation with cardiovascular disease, except in Asian populations and young adults. The focus of these studies was primarily on treatment‐naive individuals, leaving this correlation for antihypertensive drug–treated patients uncertain. Additionally, concerns also exist regarding the potential negative impact of excessive reduction of DBP, which could offset the cardiovascular benefits of reducing SBP.

The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guideline recommended a DBP target range of 70 to 80 mm Hg for all risk levels, while the ACC/AHA guideline did not specify a lower limit of DBP for antihypertensive drug–treated patients. However, these recommendations were primarily based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence. It remains unknown whether high or extremely low DBP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in antihypertensive drug–treated patients with normalized SBP.

To answer this question, we conducted a secondary analysis of SPRINT to determine if treated IDH and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with on‐treatment SBP < 130 mm Hg.

### Blood pressure targets for the treatment of people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^5e3ad0b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the review first published in 2017. Hypertension is a prominent preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality. People with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk, so reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial. This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease remains unknown.

Objectives

To determine if lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 2019: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs with more than 50 participants per group that provided at least six months' follow-up. Trial reports had to present data for at least one primary outcome (total mortality, serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality). Eligible interventions involved lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (135/85 mmHg or less) compared with standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or less). Participants were adults with documented hypertension and adults receiving treatment for hypertension with a cardiovascular history for myocardial infarction, stroke, chronic peripheral vascular occlusive disease, or angina pectoris.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that involved 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensives to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. Other issues such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined were also considered to downgrade the quality evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found there may be little to no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 6 studies, 9484 participants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 2 studies, 690 participants; very low-quality evidence). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were lower in the lower target group (systolic: mean difference (MD) -8.90 mmHg, 95% CI -13.24 to -4.56; 6 studies, 8546 participants; diastolic: MD -4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -6.35 to -2.65; 6 studies, 8546 participants). More drugs were needed in the lower target group (MD 0.56, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.96; 5 studies, 7910 participants), but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.24; 6 studies, 8588 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality and cardiovascular mortality between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower compared to a standard blood pressure target. There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. Several trials are still ongoing, which may provide an important input to this topic in the near future.

This strategy could reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity but could also increase adverse events.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with 'standard' blood pressure targets (≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease).

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2018: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (from 1982), along with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov.

We included six RCTs that involved a total of 9484 participants. Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). All RCTs provided individual participant data. We found no change in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, we found no differences in serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; low-quality evidence) or total cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; low-quality evidence). Studies reported more participant withdrawals due to adverse effects in the lower target arm (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; very low-quality evidence). Blood pressures were lower in the lower target group by 8.9/4.5 mmHg. More drugs were needed in the lower target group, but blood pressure targets were achieved more frequently in the standard target group.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in total mortality, serious adverse events, or total cardiovascular events between people with hypertension and cardiovascular disease treated to a lower or to a standard blood pressure target. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on adverse events, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease. More trials are needed to examine this topic.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^b5cad91b]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: emphasis on defense against the BP threshold and why we may not get there easily [^80e7fed8]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most important noncommunicable disorder worldwide. Finding and effectively managing elevated BP is the single greatest public health benefit we can accomplish, as it will reduce premature death and enable patients to live longer free of the disabilities that target organ damage inflicts on the brain, heart, kidneys, and legs. Hypertension guidelines are an invaluable source of information on how to detect elevated BP, how to evaluate people for situations where hypertension is a symptom of other disorders, and how to apply the various treatments that lower BP effectively in patients. Determining the point at which treating high BP is more likely to result in benefit than harm is a marriage of science and art. There is no right answer to what clearly constitutes hypertension when using a systolic or diastolic BP to define it. The science shows the mathematics behind the reduction of BP and the number of lives saved and target organs preserved. The art comes into play when a decision is made that, when a systolic or diastolic BP exceeds a certain level, it becomes reasonable to intervene at that point with treatment. Caregivers play an important role in monitoring and educating patients with hypertension-especially in the detection of unintended effects of treatment, such as excessive BP lowering, symptomatic hypotension, and impacts on laboratory tests and well-being. Nonadherence to prescribed therapies is a barrier to effectively managing chronic disorders like hypertension. Having a solid foundation in the science behind the guidelines and recognizing that the application of guidelines requires some clinical judgment gleaned from balancing the risks and benefits of treatment in each individual patient, is the basis for healthy exchanges of ideas, like this pro and con series which discusses the science and furthers the art. This review has taken the con side of several issues in the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2025 Hypertension Guidelines.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^7aa404b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^a633a2d5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### Therapy for diastolic heart failure [^1264dcc0]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

There is little objective to guide the therapy of patients with diastolic heart failure. Because of the similarities of pathophysiology abnormalities in diastolic and systolic heart failure, it is a reasonable inference to suggest that the proven therapy for systolic heart failure may also be of benefit in patients with diastolic heart failure. Treatment of underlying or exacerbating conditions in diastolic heart failure, such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemia, diabetes, anemia, obesity and pulmonary disease is an important means of managing diastolic heart failure. Control of systolic blood pressure is effective in improving and preventing the development of diastolic heart failure. Treatment of diastolic heart failure is most effective when it is associated with hypertension. Production of systolic arterial pressure acutely reduces pulmonary congestion, ischemia, and chronically may lead to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with diastolic heart failure in the absence of hypertension are very difficult to treat.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^63f63e9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

### Rationale and design: the VALsartan in diastolic dysfunction (VALIDD) trial: evolving the management of diastolic dysfunction in hypertension [^84e750b3]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Although 50% of hypertensive patients in the community are estimated to have diastolic dysfunction, there is no specific guideline for diastolic dysfunction therapy at present despite the condition's clear association with increased cardiovascular risk. Although the efficacy of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy regression has been established, the effect of angiotensin II receptor blockade on intrinsic parameters of diastolic function has not been evaluated in large-scale studies.

Methods

The VALIDD Trial is an investigator-initiated randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial on approximately 350 patients designed to explore whether antihypertensive therapy with the ARB valsartan, in addition to standard therapy, would improve intrinsic diastolic properties of the myocardium in patients with hypertension and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. The result of such therapy will be compared with placebo after 38 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy variable is change in early diastolic lateral mitral annular relaxation velocity measured by tissue Doppler imaging on week 38.

Conclusions

We expect the VALIDD Trial to provide novel insights into the specific effects of ARBs on diastolic dysfunction, as assessed by tissue Doppler imaging, in hypertensive patients. The trial may provide clinically useful data on whether such therapy can directly improve diastolic function in patients with hypertension.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Diastolic heart failure: challenges of diagnosis and treatment [^f9560c32]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Diastolic heart failure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality, is defined as symptoms of heart failure in a patient with preserved left ventricular function. It is characterized by a stiff left ventricle with decreased compliance and impaired relaxation, which leads to increased end diastolic pressure. Signs and symptoms are similar to those of heart failure with systolic dysfunction. The diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is best made with Doppler echocardiography. Based on current knowledge, pharmacologic treatment of diastolic heart failure should focus on normalizing blood pressure, promoting regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, avoiding tachycardia, treating symptoms of congestion, and maintaining normal atrial contraction when possible. Diuretic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for preventing pulmonary congestion, while beta blockers appear to be useful in preventing tachycardia and thereby prolonging left ventricular diastolic filling time. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers may be beneficial in patients with diastolic dysfunction, especially those with hypertension. Evidence from adequately powered randomized controlled trials, however, is not available yet. The outcomes of ongoing clinical trials may provide much-needed information to move from intuitive treatment to therapy based on evidence that matters: decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older [^a1693d4b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

This is the third update of a review that was originally published in 1998 and updated in 2009 and 2019. Hypertension increases with age, most rapidly over age 60. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and for people 80 years or older.

Objectives

Primary objective
- To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality for people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mmHg, or both. Secondary objectives
- To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg, or both.
- To assess the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as SBP > 140 mmHg or DBP > 90 mmHg, or both.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to June 2024: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted the authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Eligibility Criteria

RCTs of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for people 60 years and older with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg.

Outcomes

Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, and withdrawal due to adverse effects.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool.

Synthesis Methods

We used RevMan for data synthesis and analyses. We based quantitative analyses of outcomes on intention-to-treat results. We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to combine outcomes across trials using a fixed-effect model.

Included Studies

This update identified no new trials and no ongoing trials. Overall, 16 trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.8 years) with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first-line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years.

Synthesis Of Results

Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all-cause mortality (10% with treatment versus 11% with control; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 13 studies, 25,932 participants; high-certainty evidence); probably reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (10% with treatment versus 14% with control; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; 15 studies, 26,747 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); probably reduced cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (3.4% with treatment versus 5.2% with control; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; 13 studies, 26,042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably reduced coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (3.7% with treatment versus 4.8% with control; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88; 11 studies, 24,559 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Withdrawals due to adverse effects may have increased with treatment (16% with treatment versus 5.4% with control; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30; 4 studies, 11,310 participants; low-certainty evidence). In a sensitivity analysis of the three trials restricted to people with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. We cannot rule out that the observed reduction in all-cause mortality was due mostly to a reduction in the 60- to 79-year-old participant subgroup compared with those 80 years or older. The RR for all-cause mortality in those 60 to 79 years old was 0.86 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.95; 9 studies, 19,017 participants) compared with 0.97 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.10; 8 studies, 6701 participants) in the 80 years or older subgroup, though the test for subgroup difference showed no evidence of a difference. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was due in large part to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. The most common reason for downgrading the certainty of evidence was risk of bias, in particular incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic or diastolic hypertension, or both, with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all-cause mortality and probably reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most of the evidence pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment. Given that no new or ongoing trials were identified in this update, the certainty of existing evidence is moderate or high, and we do not expect new trials in the future, this review is considered stable and will no longer be updated.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^68fc4949]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, with most deaths attributed to hypertension resulting from coronary heart disease or stroke and more than three quarters of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The level of high blood pressure (BP) is directly related to many adverse outcomes, including CVD and kidney disease. Conversely, clinical trials have repeatedly demonstrated that lowering BP in adults with high baseline BP level provides an effective means for preventing CVD. Definitions of hypertension are useful for clinical decision-making and are typically based on CVD risk and level of BP at which antihypertensive medication is effective for preventing CVD. A common definition of hypertension is based on an average systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Using this definition, it has been estimated that ≈1.4 billion adults have hypertension, worldwide, but < 14% have their BP controlled with antihypertensive drug therapy to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg (< 8% in low- and middle-income countries). Even more disturbing is the recent trend in a high-income country (the United States), where rate of hypertension control to an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg reached a high of close to 54% in 2013 to 2014, but dramatically eroded to < 44% in 2017 to 2018. Given this decrease, the Surgeon General of the United States issued a report for a "Call to Action to Control Hypertension" making the control of hypertension a national priority.

### Treatment of hypertension: a review [^01d66477]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypertension, defined as persistent systolic blood pressure (SBP) at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) at least 80 mm Hg, affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) and death.

Observations

First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk. First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target (< 130/80 mm Hg for adults < 65 years and SBP < 130 mm Hg in adults ≥ 65 years). Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%. Despite the benefits of BP control, only 44% of US adults with hypertension have their SBP/DBP controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertension affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide and is a leading cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, consisting of weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation, healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and limited alcohol consumption. When drug therapy is required, first-line therapies are thiazide or thiazidelike diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

### Low adherence to high blood pressure treatments: innovative solutions are needed [^74dd0c90]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Convergence of Guidelines

The thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension established in guidelines are benchmarks for distinguishing health from disease. Most guidelines still recommend 140/90 mm Hg as the threshold for diagnosis and goal of treatment. The evidence that these values can be lower than 140/90 mm Hg, such as 130/80 mm Hg, proposed by the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines, is progressively more robust. The predicted benefit size of BP reduction corresponds closely to the observed benefit demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, providing mathematical (Cartesian) evidence of causality.

The convergence of guidelines in establishing simplified and lower thresholds for diagnosis and treatment can reduce BP globally. The recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines moved a bit in the direction of the values of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines and withdrew the additional classification of BP in patients with hypertension. The numbers, however, became more complex, with 120/70 mm Hg as the limit of normal and abnormal, 140/90 mm Hg for the diagnosis, and 130/80 or 140/90 mm Hg as the goals for treatment, depending on the cardiovascular risk of patients.

Patients have a dichotomic view of health and disease. For > 60 years, doctors have been convincing asymptomatic individuals that they are sick on the basis of 2 numbers that they barely understand. Lowering BP levels for the diagnosis of hypertension would increase the proportion of patients with uncontrolled BP. However, the mean BP of populations would become lower, reducing the burden of high BP.

Another simplification in the diagnosis could be to consider using only systolic BP for the diagnosis and goal of treatment. Until the publication of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the diagnosis of hypertension was based only on the values of diastolic BP. Maintaining a diastolic criterion for the diagnosis considers increasing diastolic BP before increasing systolic BP. If a stricter criterion for the diagnosis is based on systolic BP, say 120 mm Hg (or 100 mm Hg in the future), the corresponding diastolic BP would also be lower.

The global use of lower BP goals and only systolic BP for diagnosis may not influence personal adherence to treatment. Still, doctors and patients would be involved in more intensive treatment of high BP, making it easier for patients to understand the diagnosis. The left shift of the BP distribution curve would increase the number of individuals with controlled BP values.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^76ab7261]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure (BP) is among the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death. Prevailing concepts regarding BP have changed dramatically over time. Results of the Framingham Heart Study have shifted the emphasis on diastolic BP (DBP) to systolic BP (SBP) by showing that SBP was a more important risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. This has generated debate and relative neglect of the role of DBP in cardiovascular risk estimation. Whether there is a diastolic J-shape phenomenon, meaning that both high and low DBP could increase cardiovascular risk, is among the most controversial issues.

Debate on the diastolic J-shape phenomenon originated from an observation of low DBP and increased risk of death from myocardial infarction. Although there are studies showing linear associations between DBP and cardiovascular risk, more studies have reported a diastolic J-shape phenomenon. It seems certain that extremely low DBP is harmful. However, mainly driven by the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial, which showed improved prognosis with intensive SBP lowering, the 2017 American Heart Association (AHA) Hypertension Guidelinesrecommend an intensive BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg, with no recommendation on lower limits of DBP. Intensive SBP lowering could result in an excessive reduction of DBP, generating concern that the therapeutic harm-benefit equation will shift to harm considering the potential diastolic J-shape phenomenon. To avoid potential harm, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Hypertension Guidelines have recommended an optimal DBP target of between 70 and 80 mm Hg for patients with all risk levels. Given the great influence of the 2017 AHA guideline and the argument that the diastolic J-shape phenomenon only exists in the presence of high SBP (ie, > 140 mm Hg), it is critical to know whether the diastolic J-shape phenomenon exists in patients with SBP of less than 130 mm Hg and, if it does exist, what the safe and optimal DBP ranges are for this population.

The SPRINTand the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes–Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP)trials randomized 14 094 patients to intensive BP control (ie, SBP < 120 mm Hg) and standard BP control (ie, SBP < 140 mm Hg). The objectives of the present study were, first, to determine whether a diastolic J-shape phenomenon was evident with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg and, second, to investigate the safe and optimal DBP ranges in the presence of a guideline-recommended SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, using outcome data from SPRINT and ACCORD-BP.

### Prevalence, awareness, and treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension: insights from the China PEACE million persons project [^eb7095c5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), whether in treated or untreated patients, is an uncommon type of hypertension accounting for < 20% of hypertension cases. 1, 2, 3, 4 Nevertheless, IDH is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and the other sequelae of hypertension. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, the most recent US, Chinese, and European high blood pressure guidelines do not specifically address IDH as a distinct phenotype or provide any specific guidance for its management. 15, 16, 17

Although many studies have focused on patient characteristics, knowledge, and treatment, patients with IDH constitute a small subset of all patients with hypertension, and have traditionally been included within the total population of hypertensive patients, 1, 18, 19, 20 even though they may have unique features. 20, 21 Given its low prevalence, a large sample size would be required to fully capture the range of attributes of individuals with IDH across diverse population subgroups, and draw robust conclusions with high precision. Characterizing these patients specifically and assessing their awareness and treatment patterns can generate new knowledge about this distinct subtype of hypertension. This information will not only expand our knowledge about the IDH phenotype, but could also equip us to identify targets for improvement of care.

Accordingly, we sought to identify and study patients with IDH, whether treated or untreated, using data from the China PEACE (Patient‐centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events) Million Persons Project, a large‐scale population‐based screening project which was initiated with the aim of providing detailed information on smaller subgroups of patients who have traditionally been hard to identify in the population. We sought to describe the characteristics and prevalence of individuals with IDH across diverse population subgroups among both untreated and treated hypertensives; assess awareness of having hypertension among untreated IDH participants; assess the number and classes of medications used by treated participants with IDH; and identify the associations between individual characteristics with prevalence of, and awareness among those with IDH. Although some of the treated patients may be individuals who initially had systolic and diastolic hypertension, but with medications have only diastolic hypertension, this does represent the spectrum of patients who would be seen in practice with IDH, either as a de novo condition or as inadequately treated diastolic hypertension. Moreover, the treatment rates in China are sufficiently low that the population with IDH largely represents those with the de novo condition.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Younger adults and diastolic hypertension — research priorities: Observational data show increased CVD risk among younger adults with stage 1 hypertension and associations of elevated BP with evidence of target organ damage, but clarification is needed on where clinical trial evidence is sufficient to base treatment decisions for younger adults and where additional research is greatest. There is a lack of evidence to support BP targets for diastolic hypertension, which is more common in younger adults, and research should include detection of CVD endpoints outside academic centers via pragmatic designs, use of surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy, and evaluations for target organ damage at baseline and during longitudinal follow-up.

### Higher blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^7ea3e1fe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults (≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an ambulatory, home, or office setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

### Diastolic hypotension due to intensive blood pressure therapy: is it harmful? [^20a969f7]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Reducing the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below a certain threshold may lead to inadequate organ perfusion. This raises some concerns, because pharmacotherapy reduces both systolic and diastolic pressure. We aimed to investigate whether a pathway from intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment influences cardiovascular outcomes by inducing too low DBP.

Methods

We had access to data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) including 9361 patients with a SBP of 130 mmHg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk. In a formal mediation analysis, we investigated whether the effect of intense (target SBP: 120 mm Hg) vs. standard (target SBP: 140 mmHg) intervention on a composite endpoint would be mediated through an indirect, potentially harmful, effect through low DBP (< 60 mmHg).

Results

Adjusting for treatment, we find that low DBP per se is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes (HR 1.90 (95% CI [1.46, 2.47]). However, in a formal mediation analyses, we observed that the unadjusted indirect effect of intensive blood pressure treatment going through low DBP of HR 1.12 (95% CI [1.06, 1.18]) attenuates to a statistically non-significant effect of HR 1.04 (95% CI [0.98, 1.10]) after adjustment for important covariates, suggesting that the mere association is considerably confounded.

Conclusions

The increased risk in subjects with diastolic pressure below 60 cannot fully be explained by the intensive treatment itself, but may be due to other measured factors. More generally, this analysis shows that adjusting for mediator-outcome confounding is essential, even in RCTs.

### Effect of angiotensin receptor blockade and antihypertensive drugs on diastolic function in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction: a randomised trial [^77aad42e]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diastolic dysfunction might represent an important pathophysiological intermediate between hypertension and heart failure. Our aim was to determine whether inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can reduce ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, can improve diastolic function to a greater extent than can other antihypertensive agents.

Methods

Patients with hypertension and evidence of diastolic dysfunction were randomly assigned to receive either the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan (titrated to 320 mg once daily) or matched placebo. Patients in both groups also received concomitant antihypertensive agents that did not inhibit the renin-angiotensin system to reach targets of under 135 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and under 80 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in diastolic relaxation velocity between baseline and 38 weeks as determined by tissue doppler imaging. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00170924.

Findings

186 patients were randomly assigned to receive valsartan; 198 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. 43 patients were lost to follow-up or discontinued the assigned intervention. Over 38 weeks, there was a 12.8 (SD 17.2)/7.1 (9.9) mm Hg reduction in blood pressure in the valsartan group and a 9.7 (17.0)/5.5 (10.2) mm Hg reduction in the placebo group. The difference in blood pressure reduction between the two groups was not significant. Diastolic relaxation velocity increased by 0.60 (SD 1.4) cm/s from baseline in the valsartan group (p < 0.0001) and 0.44 (1.4) cm/s from baseline in the placebo group (p < 0.0001) by week 38. However, there was no significant difference in the change in diastolic relaxation velocity between the groups (p = 0.29).

Interpretation

Lowering blood pressure improves diastolic function irrespective of the type of antihypertensive agent used.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^089ca6e9]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes with hypertension — SBP and DBP targets — are informed by ACCORD-BP and related trials. The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared an SBP treatment goal of lower than 140 mm Hg with a lower SBP goal and assessed the effect on important health outcomes is ACCORD-BP, which compared an SBP treatment goal of lower than 120 mm Hg with a goal of lower than 140 mm Hg, and there was no difference in the primary outcome; the absolute difference in fatal and nonfatal stroke between the 2 groups was only 0.21% per year, so the panel concluded that the results from ACCORD-BP did not provide sufficient evidence to recommend an SBP goal of lower than 120 mm Hg in adults with diabetes and hypertension. For diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the panel similarly recommends the same goal DBP in adults with diabetes and hypertension as in the general population (< 90 mm Hg) and did not find sufficient evidence to support a DBP goal lower than 80 mm Hg, noting there are no good-quality RCTs with mortality as a primary or secondary prespecified outcome that compared a DBP goal of lower than 90 mm Hg with a lower goal. Evidence commonly cited for lower DBP targets includes HOT, which compared a DBP goal of 90 mm Hg or lower vs a goal of 80 mm Hg or lower but the observed benefit was a post hoc analysis of a small subgroup (8%), and UKPDS, in which the comparison was a DBP goal of lower than 85 mm Hg vs lower than 105 mm Hg within a mixed systolic and diastolic BP goal study, so it cannot be determined if the benefits were due to lowering SBP, DBP, or both.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^e9337161]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^b783e823]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Current target recommendations

NICE reviewed three systematic reviews and 27 prognostic studies to develop their current treatment threshold recommendations. The cut-off points for ABPM were set lower than those for clinic BP. Evidence for these thresholds came largely from work comparing clinic BP and ABPM to cardiovascular outcomes. The Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate e Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) trial was a landmark study in this area and the authors predicted that a clinic BP of 140/90 mmHg was equivalent to a 24-hour ABPM of 125/80 mmHg or a daytime ABPM of 130/85 mmHg. However, this work was based on prognostic thresholds and there is very little evidence for comparable treatment targets between ABPM and clinic BP. As discussed above, Head et al. analysed clinic BP and ABPM measurements from patients referred to hypertension clinics across Australia. The treatment target recommendations for ABPM and SMBP (Table 1) from the NICE guidelines are largely based on this work.

Table 1
Comparison of recommendations for diagnostic and treatment thresholds between NICE, ESH, JNC and CHEP guidelines

Abbreviations: OBPM office blood pressure measurement, ABPM ambulatory blood pressure measurement, HBPM home blood pressure measurement, CKD chronic kidney disease

NICE suggests an ABPM treatment target of < 135/85 mmHg for patients below 80 years of age and an ABPM target of < 145/85 mmHg for those patients over 80 years. Currently, they are the only guidelines to specify a common treatment and management threshold for ABPM with the same thresholds assumed for home BP monitoring.

The ESH 2013 guidelines suggest a target of < 140 mmHg for all patients under 80 years of age and a diagnostic target of < 90 mmHg. Diabetic patients should be treated to a diastolic target of < 85 mmHg. Patients over 80 years with a systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg should be treated to a target between 140 and 150 mmHg according to the evidence.

The recent JNC 8 guideline recommended treating those between 18 and 60 years old to a target of 140/90 mmHg. However, for those patients above 60 years, they recommended a systolic treatment target of < 150 mmHg. This caused some controversy, but the committee argued that evidence from the trials they had considered found little benefit of tighter control leading to better outcomes. However, many countered that these recommendations were based on a very small number of trials which passed the rigorous screening process, excluding evidence from meta-analysis, and meaning that this recommendation was almost entirely based on expert opinion.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood pressure or hypertension — nonpharmacological and pharmacologic treatment — in adults with elevated blood pressure (BP) or hypertension, including those requiring antihypertensive medications, nonpharmacological interventions are recommended to reduce BP, including weight loss, a heart-healthy dietary pattern, sodium reduction, dietary potassium supplementation, increased physical activity with a structured exercise program, and limited alcohol. In adults with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 10% or higher and an average systolic BP (SBP) of 130 mm Hg or higher or an average diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 mm Hg or higher, use of BP-lowering medications is recommended for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^0b0b0009]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^a0490495]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (HBP) or hypertension (HTN) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Despite this fact, there is widespread agreement that the treatment of HBP, over the last half century, has been a great achievement. However, after the release of the new Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-8 (JNC-8) guidelines, there have been heated debates with regard to what are the most evidence-based blood pressure goals. While JNC-8 claims that the goal blood pressure for otherwise healthy patients with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140-159mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90-99mmHg) should be < 140/90mmHg; a recent Cochrane meta-analysis is in direct conflict with these recommendations. Indeed, a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis indicated that there is no evidence that treating otherwise healthy mild hypertension patients with antihypertensive therapy will reduce CV events or mortality. Additionally, the Cochrane meta-analysis showed that antihypertensive therapy was associated with a significant increase in withdrawal due to adverse events. Thus, the current evidence in the literature does not support the goals set by the JNC-8 guidelines. In this review we discussed the strengths and limitations of both lines of evidence and why it takes an evidence-based medication to reduce CV events/mortality (eg, how a goal blood pressure is achieved is more important than getting to the goal). As medications inherently cause side effects and come at a cost to the patient, the practice of evidence-based medicine becomes exceedingly important. Although the majority of HTN studies claim great advantages by lowering HBP, this review finds severe conflicts in the findings among the various HTN studies, as well as serious epistemological, methodological and statistical problems that cast doubt to such claims.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^36fc626f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recently released guideline recommendations for treatment strategies for hypertension with lower blood pressure values used to define elevated blood pressure, and lower treatment thresholds, than those recommended in current guidelines. These new guidelines define hypertension as a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg or greater, in contrast to a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater that was used to define hypertension in all previous guidelines.

Furthermore, treatment recommendations have been extensively revised. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend treatment of only a subset of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension. This includes all those with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater. Treatment is recommended for additional patients with lower blood pressures. Among people with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg, treatment is recommended only for those who meet any of the following criteria: aged 65 years or older, pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a 10 year predicated risk of developing it of 10% or greater, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, a target systolic blood pressure below 130 mm Hg and a target diastolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg is recommended for all patients, regardless of their baseline blood pressures. These recommendations contrast with currently suggested systolic blood pressure targets of less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic targets of less than 90 mm Hg for most patients, other than targets of less than 150/90 mm Hg for those aged 60 years or over without concomitant diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

### Review of hypertension treatment… [^f30b22ff]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistent systolic blood pressure at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP at least 80 mm Hg, affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease events and death. Observations First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk.

First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target. Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%. Despite the benefits of BP control, only 44% of US adults with hypertension have their SBP/DBP controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance Hypertension affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide and is a leading cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, consisting of weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation, healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and limited alcohol consumption. When drug therapy is required, first-line therapies are thiazide or thiazidelike diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

### Prevalence, awareness, and treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension: insights from the China PEACE million persons project [^fc26457f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

IDH affects a large number of adults in China, and these patients may have some unique characteristics as compared with people without hypertension as well as those with other types of hypertension. However, patients with IDH have the lowest rate of awareness compared with other hypertension subtypes, and most participants with IDH despite treatment had scope for further increase in the intensity of therapy. Our findings suggest the need to specifically focus public health and clinical strategies on people with IDH and improve their diagnosis and treatment, to mitigate the burden of hypertension, especially in the young‐ and middle‐aged population.

### CDC grand rounds: a public health approach to detect and control hypertension [^4621f51d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is generally defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. A person who currently uses blood pressure-lowering medication is also defined as having hypertension. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke (1,2). Hypertension affects nearly one third of U.S. residents aged ≥ 18 years (approximately 75 million persons), and in approximately one half of adults with hypertension (nearly 35 million persons), it is uncontrolled (2). Among these 35 million U.S. residents with uncontrolled hypertension, 33% (11.5 million persons) are not aware of their hypertension, 20% (7 million persons) are aware of their hypertension, but are not being treated for it, and approximately 47% (16.1 million persons) are aware of their hypertension and being treated for it, but treatment (by medication and/or lifestyle modification) is not adequately controlling their blood pressure (Figure) (2).

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^12762716]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

BP grade classifications and definitions did not change between the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guideline and updated 2023 ESH guideline. As a result, significant differences in BP classification and definition of hypertension between guidelines remain, with ACC/AHA using "stages" and ESH using "grades" for BP categorization (Figure 1). ESH defines hypertension as BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, while ACC/AHA uses a threshold of ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. ESH classifies systolic BP between 130 and 139 mm Hg or diastolic ranges between 85 and 89 mm Hg as "high-normal" BP, while ACC/AHA guideline defines this as "stage 1" hypertension.

Recommendations on BP treatment targets also differ. For most patients, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends treating to a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. The ESH, on the other hand, recommends tailoring treatment based on age, clinical comorbidities, and patient-specific tolerance. For adults between ages 18 and 64 years, the ESH guideline recommends a BP target < 130/80 mm Hg, similar to what is recommended by the ACC/AHA guideline. However, the ESH guideline recommends higher targets for older patients. For adults aged 65 to 79 years, ESH recommends targeting BP < 140/80 mm Hg, but notes that if tolerated by the patient, a target of < 130/80 mm Hg should be used. The threshold for very old patients (≥ 80 years old) is even higher, targeting SBP between 140 and 150 mmHg. For special populations including hypertensive patients with CKD, the ESH guideline recommends treatment to a higher BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg compared to the recommended ACC/AHA BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. For other comorbidities including diabetes, CAD, cerebrovascular disease, both guidelines recommend the same BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg. While significant differences still exist between the guidelines, for high-risk patients and individuals between ages 18 and 79 years old, there is consensus to achieve BP goal < 130/80 mm Hg.

In adults with diastolic hypertension (DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, a strong body of evidence supports treatment with antihypertensive medications, and meta-analyses identify a beneficial effect of diastolic BP reduction on HF incidence.

### 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure treatment guideline recommendations and cardiovascular risk [^d7e5c0cb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline provides updated recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification.

Objectives

Determine the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among adults recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation or intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.

Methods

The authors analyzed data for black and white REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study participants (age ≥ 45 years). Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured twice at baseline (2003 to 2007) and averaged. Participants not taking (n = 14,039) and taking (n = 15,179) antihypertensive medication were categorized according to their recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Overall, 4,094 CVD events (stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure) occurred by December 31, 2014.

Results

Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, 34.4% were recommended pharmacological antihypertensive treatment initiation. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended antihypertensive medication initiation with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg was 22.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.3 to 25.0). Among participants with SBP/DBP 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, the CVD event rate was 20.5 (95% CI: 18.5 to 22.6) and 3.4 (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.4) for those recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, 62.8% were recommended treatment intensification. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended treatment intensification was 33.6 (95% CI: 31.5 to 35.6) and 22.4 (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.9) for those with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, respectively.

Conclusions

Implementing the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would direct antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification to adults with high CVD risk.

### Hypertension and heart failure: a dysfunction of systole, diastole or both? [^7e462b76]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The pathological myocardial hypertrophy associated with hypertension contains the seed for further maladaptive development. Increased myocardial oxygen consumption, impaired epicardial coronary perfusion, ventricular fibrosis and remodelling, abnormalities in long-axis function and torsion, cause, to a varying degree, a mixture of systolic and diastolic abnormalities. In addition, chronotropic incompetence and peripheral factors such as lack of vasodilator reserve and reduced arterial compliance further affect cardiac output particularly on exercise. Many of these factors are common to hypertensive heart failure with a normal ejection fraction as well as systolic heart failure. There is increasing evidence that these apparently separate phenotypes are part of a spectrum of heart failure differing only in the degree of ventricular remodelling and volume changes. Furthermore, dichotomizing heart failure into systolic and diastolic clinical entities has led to a paucity of clinical trials of therapies for heart failure with a normal ejection fraction. Therapies aimed at reversing myocardial fibrosis, and targets outside the heart such as enhancing vasodilator reserve and improving chronotropic incompetence deserve further study and may improve the exercise capacity of hypertensive heart failure patients. Hypertension heart disease with heart failure is simply not a dysfunction of systole and diastole. Other peripheral factors including heart rate and vasodilator response with exercise may deserve equal attention in an attempt to develop more effective treatments for this disorder.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure intensity and diastolic hypertension — heart failure risk and targets are outlined as follows. Intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering in SPRINT, which "targeted an SBP < 120 mm Hg", "significantly reduced the incidence of HF… (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45–0.84)", yet "the SBP target recommended (< 130 mm Hg) is higher than that used in SPRINT". For diastolic hypertension, "In adults with diastolic hypertension (DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and a high risk of CVD, a strong body of evidence supports treatment with antihypertensive medications", and meta-analyses "have identified a similar beneficial effect of DBP reduction on the incidence of HF".

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^ed44f735]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of… [^b8cf1ba0]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure at systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with diabetes, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 140 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. This applies to all CKD patients with hypertension regardless of race or diabetes status. The main objective of hypertension treatment is to attain and maintain goal BP.

If goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6. In the population aged 18 years or older with CKD, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at SBP of 140 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 90 mm Hg or higher and treat to goal SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg and goal DBP lower than 90 mm Hg.

### Effect of intensive versus standard blood pressure lowering on diastolic function in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and diastolic dysfunction [^548c9ec2]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Diastolic dysfunction may precede development of heart failure in hypertensive patients. We randomized 228 patients with uncontrolled hypertension, preserved ejection fraction, and diastolic dysfunction to 2 targeted treatment strategies: intensive, with a systolic blood pressure target of < 130 mm Hg, or standard, with a systolic blood pressure target of < 140 mm Hg, using a combination of valsartan, either 160 or 320 mg, plus amlodipine, either 5 or 10 mg, with other antihypertensive medications as needed. Echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function was performed at baseline and after 24 weeks in a prospective, open-label, blinded end point design. Blood pressure was reduced significantly in both groups, from 161.2 ± 13.9/90.1 ± 12.0 to 130.8 ± 12.3/74.9 ± 9.1 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) in the intensive arm and from 162.1 ± 13.2/93.7 ± 12.2 to 137.0 ± 12.9/79.6 ± 11.0 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) in the standard arm (P < 0.003 for between-group comparisons). Myocardial relaxation velocity improved from 7.6 ± 1.1 to 9.2 ± 1.7 cm/s (Delta 1.54 ± 1.4 cm/s; P < 0.0001) in the intensive arm and from 7.5 ± 1.3 to 9.0 ± 1.9 cm/s (Delta 1.48 ± 1.6 cm/s; P < 0.0001) in the standard arm, with no difference between the 2 strategies in the achieved improvement (P = 0.58). The degree of improvement in annular relaxation velocity was associated with the extent of systolic blood pressure reduction, and patients with the lowest achieved systolic blood pressure had the highest final diastolic relaxation velocities.

### Choice of antihypertensive agent in isolated systolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension: a secondary analysis of the ALLHAT trial [^49065662]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite broad treatment recommendations, there are limited published reports comparing the efficacy of different antihypertensive agents in patients with isolated systolic hypertension or isolated diastolic hypertension. This study was a secondary analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial. We compared the use of chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril on the primary outcome of combined coronary heart disease, stroke, or all-cause mortality in patients with isolated systolic hypertension or isolated diastolic hypertension.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^f19d5470]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic hypertension in pregnancy — antihypertensive therapy thresholds and evidence are summarized as follows: A 2014 Cochrane systematic review of 49 trials (4,723 women) concluded that treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension reduced the risk of developing severe hypertension but had no effect on adverse perinatal outcomes, and the authors stated it remains unclear whether therapy for mild-to-moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile. In the 2015 CHIPS trial comparing less tight control (target diastolic blood pressure below 100 mm Hg) with tight control (target diastolic blood pressure below 85 mm Hg) in 987 pregnant women, 75% with chronic hypertension, tight control conferred no fetal benefit and only marginal maternal effects. A large multicenter, randomized study in the United States evaluating a strategy aiming for less than 140/90 mm Hg versus no treatment (unless hypertension is severe) is ongoing. In the absence of clear evidence supporting therapy for lower pressures, initiation of antihypertensive therapy is recommended for persistent chronic hypertension when systolic pressure is 160 mm Hg or more, diastolic pressure is 110 mm Hg or more, or both, and in the setting of comorbidities or underlying impaired renal function, treating at lower blood pressure thresholds may be appropriate.

### Prevalence, awareness, and treatment of isolated diastolic hypertension: insights from the China PEACE million persons project [^bbd3122a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Characterizing and assessing the prevalence, awareness, and treatment patterns of patients with isolated diastolic hypertension can generate new knowledge and highlight opportunities to improve their care.

Methods and Results

We used data from the China PEACE (Patient‐centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events) Million Persons Project, which screened 2 351 035 participants aged 35 to 75 years between 2014 and 2018.was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure of < 140 and ≥ 90 mm Hg; awareness as self‐reported diagnosis of hypertension; and treatment as current use of antihypertensive medications. Of the 2 310 184 participants included (mean age 55.7 years; 59.5% women); 73 279 (3.2%) had, of whom 63 112 (86.1%) were untreated, and only 6512 (10.3%) of the untreated were aware of having hypertension. When compared with normotensives, participants who were < 60 years, men, at least college educated, had body mass index of > 28 kg/m 2, consumed alcohol, had diabetes mellitus, and prior cardiovascular events were more likely to have(all P < 0.01). Among those with, higher likelihood of awareness was associated with increased age, women, college education, body mass index of > 28 kg/m 2, higher income, diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular events, and Central or Eastern region (all P < 0.05). Most treated participants withreported taking only 1 class of antihypertensive medication.

Conclusions

affects a substantial number of people in China, however, few are aware of having hypertension and most treated participants are poorly managed, which suggests the need to improve the diagnosis and treatment of people with.

### Is a targeted intensive intervention effective for improvements in hypertension control? A randomized controlled trial [^4f66da5f]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Background

High blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important risk factors for stroke, and antihypertensive therapy significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, achieving a regulated BP in hypertensive patients is still a challenge.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of an intervention targeting GPs' management of hypertension.

Methods

A cluster randomized trial comprising 124 practices and 2646 patients with hypertension. In the Capital Region of Denmark, the participating GPs were randomized to an intensive or to a moderately intensive intervention group or to a control group and in Region Zealand and Region of Southern Denmark, practices were randomized into a moderately intensive intervention and to a control group. The main outcome measures were change in proportion of patients with high BP and change in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from the first to the second registration.

Results

The proportion of patients with high BP in 2007 was reduced in 2009 by ~9% points. The mean SBP was reduced significantly from 2007 to 2009 by 3.61 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): -4.26 to -2.96], and the DBP was reduced significantly by 1.99 mmHg (95% CI: -2.37 to -1.61). There was no additional impact in either of the intervention groups.

Conclusion

There was no impact of the moderate intervention and no additional impact of the intensive intervention on BP.

### Treatment of prehypertension in diabetes and metabolic syndrome: what are the pros? [^aeeacee5]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VII) published its ultimate guidelines for hypertension prevention and management. One of the key messages was the definition of a new category of blood pressure (BP) levels, i.e. prehypertension, that included individuals with a systolic BP of 120–139 mmHg or a diastolic BP of 80–89 mmHg. Patients with prehypertension were considered at increased risk for progression to hypertension and individuals in the 130/80 to 139/89 mmHg range were at twice the risk of developing hypertension than subjects with lower values. In the same year, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology (ESH-ESC) published their guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension and, for the same range of BP, two different categories of BP were defined: normal BP (systolic BP of 120–129 mmHg, or diastolic BP of 80–84 mmHg) and high-normal BP (systolic BP of 130–139 mmHg, or diastolic BP of 85–89 mmHg).

In 2007, the ESH-ESC committee decided against using the term "prehypertension" for several reasons. First, even in the Framingham study, the risk of developing hypertension was definitely higher in subjects with high-normal BP than in patients with normal BP, and therefore there is little reason to combine the two groups. Second, given the ominous significance of the word "hypertension" for the layman, the term "prehypertension" may, in many subjects, create anxiety and a request for unnecessary medical visits and examinations. Finally, although lifestyle changes recommended by the 2003 JNC VII guidelines for all prehypertensive individuals may be a valuable population strategy, in practice, this category is a highly differentiated one, with the extremes consisting of subjects with no need of any intervention (e.g. an elderly individual with a BP of 120/80 mmHg), as well as of those with a very high or high cardiovascular risk profile (e.g. after stroke or with diabetes), in whom drug treatment is required.

### Sex and gender in hypertension guidelines [^0dfc08a8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

2021 WHO Guideline

Sex-related aspects and recommendations of previous WHO and joint WHO/ISH guidelines are presented in the Data Supplement. In 2021, the WHO released a guideline paper for the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adults.

Sex and gender aspects

Overall, it is recommended that pharmacological treatment of hypertension, including treatment initiation and targets for BP control, should not be different between men and women.

Pregnancy-related aspects

However, it was underlined that different drug treatment algorithms, including renin–angiotensin system blockers, are contraindicated during pregnancy and also in women who could become pregnant. Hypertension in pregnancy is generally diagnosed when BP is ≥ 140 mmHg and/or ≥ 90 mmHg on at least two occasions, at least six hours apart. Chronic hypertension is defined as a diagnosis of hypertension before 20 weeks of gestation, while gestational hypertension is defined as hypertension at 20 weeks or later. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are pregnancy-specific medical conditions requiring immediate and specific medical management. It was acknowledged that while BP treatment thresholds for hypertension in pregnancy continue to change, it is generally recommended for both chronic and gestational hypertension that pharmacologic treatment be initiated when the systolic BP is ≥ 160 mmHg and/or the diastolic BP is ≥ 105 mmHg. In women diagnosed with hypertension before pregnancy, the antihypertensive treatment may be continued unaltered. However, some medications may have to be changed to preferred medications, while medications contraindicated in pregnancy must be discontinued. The guideline report acknowledged that recommended on-treatment BP target in pregnancy also has been subject to debate and is changing. For instance, achieving lower BP target (diastolic BP of 85 mmHg vs. 100 mmHg) has decreased severe hypertension rates while not increasing maternal or fetal risk. In the case of women with hypertension-mediated target organ damage, the initiation of antihypertensive treatment at a diastolic BP of ≥ 90 mmHg should be considered. Preferred medications are: methyldopa, beta blockers (particularly labetalol, but not atenolol), calcium channel blockers (particularly nifedipine and, as an alternative, verapamil), and direct-acting vasodilators (particularly hydralazine). There is evidence to suggest that among these agents, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers appear more effective than methyldopa in decreasing the development of severe hypertension later in pregnancy. Thiazide diuretics have been debated, particularly if the individual is already on a thiazide before pregnancy. In this situation, the thiazide diuretic may be continued.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on major vascular events among patients with isolated diastolic hypertension: the perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) trial [^37cfc109]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite clear evidence that blood pressure (BP) lowering is effective for prevention of cardiovascular events among patients with isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension, there is ongoing uncertainty about its effects in those with isolated diastolic hypertension. The objective of the present analysis is to determine whether BP lowering provides benefits to patients with isolated diastolic hypertension.

Methods

Patients with cerebrovascular disease and hypertension at baseline (n = 4283) were randomly assigned to either active treatment (perindopril in all participants plus indapamide for those with neither an indication for nor a contraindication to a diuretic) or matching placebo(s). The primary outcome was total major vascular events.

Results

There were 1923 patients with isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg), 315 with isolated diastolic hypertension (systolic BP < 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg), and 2045 with systolic-diastolic hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) at baseline. Active treatment reduced the relative risk of major vascular events by 27% (95% CI, 10% to 41%) among patients with isolated systolic hypertension, by 28% (-29% to 60%) among those with isolated diastolic hypertension, and by 32% (17% to 45%) among those with systolic-diastolic hypertension. There was no evidence of differences in the magnitude of the effects of treatment among different types of hypertension (P homogeneity = 0.89).

Conclusions

BP lowering is likely to provide a similar level of protection against major vascular events for patients with isolated diastolic hypertension as for those with isolated systolic hypertension and systolic-diastolic hypertension. Clinical Trial Registration Information- This trial was not registered because patients were enrolled before July 1, 2005.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^37c9d209]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension in HFpEF — prevalence and management context: The role of blood pressure control is well established for the prevention of heart failure (HF), and for reduction of other cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals without HF. Hypertension is the most important identified cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with a prevalence of 60% to 89% in the HFpEF population, and cardiac structural and functional abnormalities with hypertension, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, form the substrate for HFpEF most commonly seen in older adults, especially women. Although blood pressure-lowering has not been associated with improved outcomes in trials of individuals with HFpEF, uncontrolled blood pressure may precipitate acute HF decompensation, and individuals with HFpEF can have an exaggerated hypertensive response to exercise. Appropriate management of HFpEF-associated comorbidities is extrapolated from relevant guidelines, and the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of hypertension offers a Class 1 recommendation that adults with HFpEF should have blood pressure medications.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^463c82c6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis of high or markedly low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with normalized on‐treatment systolic blood pressure on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) is uncertain. This study examined whether treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with MACEs in patients with hypertension.

Methods and Results

A total of 7582 patients with on‐treatment systolic blood pressure < 130 mm Hg from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) were categorized on the basis of average DBP: < 60 mm Hg (n = 1031; treated ILDBP), 60 to 79 mm Hg (n = 5432), ≥ 80 mm Hg (n = 1119; treated IDH). MACE risk was estimated using Cox proportional‐hazards models. Among the SPRINT participants, median age was 67.0 years and 64.9% were men. Over a median follow‐up of 3.4 years, 512 patients developed a MACE. The incidence of MACEs was 3.9 cases per 100 person‐years for treated ILDBP, 1.9 cases for DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, and 1.8 cases for treated IDH. Comparing with DBP 60 to 79 mm Hg, treated ILDBP was associated with an 1.32‐fold MACE risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32, 95% CI, 1.05–1.66), whereas treated IDH was not (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.87–1.59]). There was no effect modification by age, sex, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, or cardiovascular disease history (all P values for interaction > 0.05).

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of SPRINT, among treated patients with normalized systolic blood pressure, excessively low DBP was associated with an increased MACE risk, while treated IDH was not. Further research is required for treated ILDBP management.

### Treatment and blood pressure control in isolated systolic hypertension vs diastolic hypertension in primary care [^27700db2]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Cross-sectional surveys on prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension could not satisfactorily distinguish between diastolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension because the definition of hypertension included patients under pharmacological treatment. We assessed the situation in the two types of hypertension in general practice in Belgium, based on current blood pressure (BP) measurements and on BP prior to the initiation of drug therapy. Participating physicians enrolled the first 15 at least 55-year-old men visiting the surgery, measured their BP and recorded data on medical history including pretreatment BP, drug utilization, cardiovascular risk factors and target organ damage. Diastolic hypertension was defined as diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, irrespective of systolic BP, and isolated systolic hypertension as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP < 90 mmHg. Among 3761 evaluable patients, 74% were hypertensive. Among the 1533 hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure was known prior to treatment (n = 965) or who were untreated at the study visit (n = 568), 1164 had diastolic hypertension and 369 isolated systolic hypertension. The prevalence of antihypertensive treatment was, respectively, 75 and 25% (P < 0.001) in these two types of hypertension. The odds of being treated were independently determined by type of hypertension, severity of hypertension and level of risk (P < 0.001). BP was controlled in 25% of all patients with diastolic hypertension and in 13% of all patients with isolated systolic hypertension (P < 0.001). About half of the treated patients with systolic hypertension were on a diuretic and/or a calcium-channel blocker. In conclusion, isolated systolic hypertension is less frequently treated than diastolic hypertension, overall BP control is poor and actual drug therapy diverges from recommendations based on placebo-controlled intervention trials.

### Influence of baseline diastolic blood pressure on effects of intensive compared with standard blood pressure control [^ddf53771]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In individuals with a low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the potential benefits or risks of intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering are unclear.

Methods

SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) was a randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of intensive (target < 120 mmHg) and standard (target < 140 mmHg) SBP control in 9361 older adults with high blood pressure at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular disease events. All-cause death and incident chronic kidney disease were secondary outcomes. This post hoc analysis examined whether the effects of the SBP intervention differed by baseline DBP.

Results

Mean baseline SBP and DBP were 139.7 ± 15.6 and 78.1 ± 11.9 mmHg, respectively. Regardless of the randomized treatment, baseline DBP had a U-shaped association with the hazard of the primary cardiovascular disease outcome. However, the effects of the intensive SBP intervention on the primary outcome were not influenced by baseline DBP level (P for interaction = 0.83). The primary outcome hazard ratio for intensive versus standard treatment was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.57–1.07) in the lowest DBP quintile (mean baseline DBP, 61 ± 5 mmHg) and 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.90) in the upper 4 DBP quintiles (mean baseline DBP, 82 ± 9 mmHg), with an interaction P value of 0.78. Results were similar for all-cause death and kidney events.

Conclusions

Low baseline DBP was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease events, but there was no evidence that the benefit of the intensive SBP lowering differed by baseline DBP.

### Age and the effectiveness of anti-hypertensive therapy on improvement in diastolic function [^a518489b]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Diastolic dysfunction is associated with adverse outcomes and is highly prevalent among older adults with hypertension. Lowering SBP with antihypertensive therapy has been shown to improve diastolic function, but whether or not age influences this effect is unknown.

Methods

In the Exforge Intensive Control of Hypertension to Evaluate Efficacy in Diastolic Dysfunction trial, 189 patients (age range 45–93 years) with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction underwent echocardiography before and after 24 weeks of intensive versus standard antihypertensive therapy titrated to a goal SBP below 135 versus below 140 mmHg. We performed linear regression analyses to examine the association between age and improvement in diastolic function achieved with SBP reduction.

Results

Antihypertensive therapy reduced SBP by 28 ± 19 mmHg overall, and this was not significantly different across age strata. However, percentage improvement in diastolic relaxation velocity (lateral E' peak velocity) for every 10 mmHg reduction in SBP was lower in older compared to younger patients. In analyses adjusting for age stratum, sex, treatment arm, baseline relaxation velocity, and baseline blood pressure, older age was associated with reduced improvement in diastolic relaxation velocity per 10 mmHg of SBP reduction (β -1.64, P = 0.009). In contrast, the degree of change in left ventricular mass index per 10 mmHg reduction in SBP was not influenced by age (P = 0.89).

Conclusions

In our sample of individuals with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction, older compared to younger adults experienced less improvement in diastolic function in response to similar reductions in SBP.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients with treated isolated diastolic hypertension and isolated low diastolic blood pressure [^052d0e17]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The prognosis of high or markedly low diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with normalized on-treatment systolic blood pressure on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) is uncertain. This study examined whether treated isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) and treated isolated low DBP (ILDBP) were associated with MACEs in patients with hypertension.

Methods and Results

A total of 7582 patients with on-treatment systolic blood pressure < 130mmHg from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) were categorized on the basis of average DBP: < 60mmHg (n = 1031; treated ILDBP), 60 to 79mmHg (n = 5432), ≥ 80mmHg (n = 1119; treated IDH). MACE risk was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards models. Among the SPRINT participants, median age was 67.0years and 64.9% were men. Over a median follow-up of 3.4years, 512 patients developed a MACE. The incidence of MACEs was 3.9 cases per 100 person-years for treated ILDBP, 1.9 cases for DBP 60 to 79mmHg, and 1.8 cases for treated IDH. Comparing with DBP 60 to 79mmHg, treated ILDBP was associated with an 1.32-fold MACE risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32, 95% CI, 1.05–1.66), whereas treated IDH was not (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.87–1.59]). There was no effect modification by age, sex, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, or cardiovascular disease history (all P values for interaction > 0.05).

Conclusions

In this secondary analysis of SPRINT, among treated patients with normalized systolic blood pressure, excessively low DBP was associated with an increased MACE risk, while treated IDH was not. Further research is required for treated ILDBP management.

### Guidelines for hypertension: are quality-assurance measures on target? [^7868502a]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Guideline committees recommend targets of treatment based on trial data on efficacy and effectiveness. Quality-assurance initiatives apply these parameters in the general practice setting. Therefore, targets must be feasible and achievable by the practicing physicians who are judged by these targets as goals for care. We evaluated 437 patients in the Rush University Hypertension Clinic using the Health Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) measures for 2000 to assess goal achievement in a practice-based setting. We compared guideline achievement of uncomplicated hypertensive and diabetic subjects to standards dictated by HEDIS, the 6th Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI), and the American Diabetic Association (ADA)/National Kidney Foundation (NKF). Overall, 276 (63%) patients achieved SBP goal, with 376 (86%) achieving DBP goal and 358 (59%) achieving both goals. However, in the 20% of patients who were diabetic, only 52% had a BP of < 140 mm Hg and < 90 mm Hg, whereas only 22% achieved the more stringent goals of JNC VI of < 130 mm Hg systolic and < 85 mm Hg diastolic and only 15% achieved the ADA/NKF goals of < 130 mm Hg systolic and < 80 mm Hg diastolic. Although goal was achievable in most uncomplicated hypertension, hypertension in diabetes was more difficult to control, despite being more likely to receive enhanced benefit from effective management. Goal-oriented strategy, especially in diabetic subjects, should be aggressively sought rather than relaxing goals to promote achievement.

### Hypertensive heart disease [^bd3ed0c9]. Hypertension Research (2005). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction (CHF-D) are the early manifestations of cardiovascular target organ damage in patients with arterial hypertension and signify hypertensive heart disease. Identification of hypertensive heart disease is critical, as these individuals are more prone to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Regression of left ventricular (LV) mass with antihypertensive therapy decreases the risk of future cardiovascular events. The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to both lower blood pressure (BP) and interrupt BP-independent pathophysiologic processes that promote LVH and CHF-D. The purpose of this review is to summarize current and emerging approaches to the pathophysiology and treatment of hypertensive heart disease.

### The impact of JNC-VI guidelines on treatment recommendations in the US population [^b13320c7]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Using epidemiological and clinical trial evidence, the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) updated previous guidelines to suggest that in addition to blood pressure, decisions on initial treatment should emphasize absolute cardiovascular disease risk. We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16 527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In the US population ≥ 20 years of age, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg/ ≥ 85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population, 5.1% (3.2 million) were stratified into risk group A (no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease), 66.3% (41.4 million) into risk group B (≥ 1 major risk factor), and 28.6% (17.9 million) into risk group C (diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage). Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg), and at least 1 factor, placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication. JNC-VI, but not previous JNC guidelines, specifically recommends drug therapy as initial treatment for these patients. We conclude that JNC-VI refines cardiovascular risk and enfranchises more Americans to undertake more aggressive risk reduction maneuvers.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Participants With Isolated Diastolic Hypertension Compared With Normotensives and Other Hypertensives

The prevalence of IDH decreased with age, whereas the prevalence of other hypertension subtypes (including ISH, SDH and controlled hypertensives) increased with age (Figure 1). The prevalence of IDH was significantly higher for men (4.5% of overall population and 9.8% of hypertensives) as compared with women (2.2% of overall population and 5.2% of hypertensives; Table 2). The prevalence was also significantly higher among those living in rural areas and Western regions, who were at least college educated, and had a higher income (Table 2). Prevalence of IDH showed a similar distribution across different population subgroups in both treated and untreated hypertensive participants (Table 3 and Table S2).

Prevalence and Awareness of Isolated Diastolic Hypertension Among Untreated Hypertensives, by Population Characteristics

The 1198 subgroups varied with respect to the prevalence of participants with IDH (median: 2.9%, [IQR: 1.7–4.7]; Figure S2). The prevalence of IDH was substantially higher in subgroups with participants who were younger, men, without prior cardiovascular event, and without DM as compared with participants who were older, women, with prior cardiovascular event, and with DM (Figure 2). Subgroups with at least 500 participants had similar results (Figures S3 and S4).

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^df44c228]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

### Potential impact of 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: a cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^7295f6b3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adultsprovides blood pressure (BP) thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, initiation of antihypertensive treatment, and targets for BP control. Compared with recommendations from the 2014 report from the expert panel, composed of members appointed to the intended Eighth Joint National Committeeand the 2003 Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), notable differences in definitions exist (Table 1).

Table 1
BP Levels to Define Hypertension, Recommend Antihypertensive Therapy, and Provide Treatment Goals, According to the ACC/AHA Guideline, 2014 Expert Panel Report, and JNC7

First, the ACC/AHA guideline uses a lower systolic and diastolic BP threshold of 130/80 mm Hg to define hypertension, compared with 140/90 mm Hg used by the previous 2014 expert panel report and JNC7. Although all 3 documents recommend the use of antihypertensive therapy in those with a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, the most recent guideline also recommends therapy for individuals with a BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and either a 10‐year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 10% or high‐risk comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, heart failure [HF], diabetes, or chronic kidney disease). Based in part on data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends a more aggressive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in all adults. In contrast, the 2014 expert panel report recommends a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for all except those aged > 60 years, for whom a target of < 150/90 mm Hg is recommended. Similarly, the JNC7 set a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for the general population, reserving a more intensive goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

### Irbesartan (Avapro) [^c2f6a977]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1	Hypertension

AVAPRO®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

AVAPRO may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

Prevention of HF in adults with hypertension — epidemiology and rationale: "Incident hypertension is present in 71% of patients with HFpEF, and the presence of hypertension in people < 40 years of age is highly associated with the development of incident HF". Furthermore, "There is a dose-dependent association between BP level and HF risk, and long-term treatment of systolic and diastolic hypertension has been shown to reduce this risk". Additionally, "Meta-analyses of clinical trials support BP control, rather than a specific medication class, to prevent HF".

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^b4e0a966]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

### Potential U.S. population impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure Guideline [^6cdc067d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among U.S. adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9,623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce U.S. population estimates.

Results

According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among U.S. adults was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of U.S. adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4% of U.S. adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among U.S. adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of U.S. adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

### Association of isolated diastolic hypertension based on the cutoff value in the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines with subsequent cardiovascular events in the general population [^7453ce3d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) 1, 2, 3 and is diagnosed based on both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for hypertension lowered the threshold of blood pressure (BP) from 140/90 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. 4 However, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension retained the cutoff value of BP for hypertension at 140/90 mm Hg. 5 Although several studies confirmed the validity of the updated ACC/AHA classification of BP, 6, 7 lowering the threshold of diastolic BP to 80 mm Hg was based on expert opinion. 8 Further, there have been conflicting data regarding the influence of DBP on subsequent cardiovascular events. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Particularly, McEvoy et al 9 recently indicated that isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) according to the cutoff value of DBP, which the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines suggested was not significantly associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Therefore, the cutoff value of DBP in the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines is still under debate, and further investigation is warranted to verify the validity of these guidelines. In this study, we sought to explore the association of IDH based on the cutoff value of DBP, which the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines indicated with the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events among the general population without a prevalent history of CVD using a nationwide epidemiological database.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^507cc520]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and future maternal cardiovascular risk [^04448021]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Current Guidelines and Recommendations

Given that HDP has significant implications for future maternal CVD risk, the questions of when to treat HDP and how to identify high‐risk women for preventive intervention are important to answer. Multiple guidelines on the management of hypertension in pregnancy exist; however, no clear consensus currently exists on the optimal BP threshold at which to initiate antihypertensive treatment and the target BP to achieve (Table 2). In addition, there is little guidance on how to interpret the 2017 ACC/AHA clinical guidelines on hypertension as they apply to pregnancy. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines stemmed from recent clinical trials that have demonstrated that achieving intensive BP reduction (systolic BP < 120 mm Hg) resulted in a significant decrease in the risk of CVD events and mortality compared with BP reduction to within the range currently termed stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP 130–139 mm Hg or diastolic BP 80–89 mm Hg). 66, 67, 68 The threshold for BP treatment in pregnancy is higher, generally above systolic BP 150 to 160 mm Hg and diastolic BP 95 to 110 mm Hg. The most recent Cochrane review on antihypertensive therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy (defined as systolic BP 140–169 mm Hg and diastolic BP 90–109 mm Hg) found that initiating treatment halved the risk of progression to severe hypertension but had no effect on the risk of preeclampsia. 69 In addition, the CHIPS (Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy) study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 987 women comparing tight control (target diastolic BP 85 mm Hg) to less tight control (target diastolic BP 100 mm Hg), found that severe hypertension was 32% less likely to occur in the tight control group, but the risk of other maternal complications was similar. 70 The long‐term risk of maternal CVD with lower BP treatment thresholds and treatment targets during pregnancy is currently unclear, and additional work to understand this topic is crucial.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^2bffaaad]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Firstly, we calculated the average systolic and diastolic blood pressures based on all available readings for each patient. Secondly, we assessed the prevalence of hypertension, defined as the number of people who would have a diagnosis of hypertension on the basis of current guidelines for both study populations. We use the 2014 evidence based guidelines for the management of high blood pressure in adults developed by the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8). We used JNC-8 as the current standard for both the US and China to allow for a comparative assessment of the impact of the new guidelines in both countries. The most recent Chinese hypertension guidelines from 2010 are substantively similar to the recommendations from JNC-8, so the population assessments in this study likely capture current clinical practice in China. These guidelines defined hypertension as an average systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, and/or treatment with an antihypertensive agent. We then identified people with hypertension on the basis of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. This included all adults who met a definition based on the previous JNC-8 guidelines, but additionally included all adults with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^4beaa030]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, BP targets, general population, AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AHA/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM 2025 guidelines recommend to consider targeting a DBP of < 80 mmHg in adult patients with confirmed HTN who are not at increased risk for CVD, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypertension: individual level meta-analysis [^37efe002]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Our study used a definition of orthostatic hypertension that mirrored the one for orthostatic hypotension, used in previous work. However, discussion is ongoing as to how orthostatic hypertension should be defined. Unlike with orthostatic hypotension, which focuses on changes in blood pressure alone, recent guidelines have advocated for a definition that includes both an increase in systolic blood pressure on standing and an elevated standing threshold (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg). This definition was proposed for a general population, not necessarily a hypertensive population. When we used this definition, the prevalence of orthostatic hypertension was substantially lower in our population. Nevertheless, the effects of treatment were even more pronounced. This is due in part to our observation that antihypertensive agents, particularly the longer acting agents used in many of the trials in our study, lower blood pressure in all body positions. As a result, standing hypertension would also be reduced with more intensive treatment. From the perspective of studying mechanisms of injury related to orthostatic hypertension, we caution against the use of this joint definition as it may make identifying and evaluating treatment response to the rise in blood pressure, which itself may be pathologic and occur below the 140 mm Hg threshold, more difficult. Some authors have also questioned whether diastolic blood pressure should be included in definitions of orthostatic hypertension, as diastolic blood pressure usually increases with standing. However, given that systolic and diastolic blood pressure are known to be correlated in both seated and standing positions, their change would be expected to correlate as well, and thus some patients with a rise in diastolic blood pressure would also have a rise in systolic blood pressure. Whether thresholds of change in systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure are optimal for identifying risk with cardiovascular disease should be the focus of subsequent work. Nevertheless, the effects of treatment on orthostatic increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as defined in this study, using thresholds that mirrored those for orthostatic hypotension, were quite consistent.

We did not identify compelling evidence that the effects of treatment differed by demographic or medical characteristics. Although a strong interaction between black and non-black populations was apparent, this information was not uniformly collected by trials outside of the US, reducing our sample for this analysis. We also observed that effects were attenuated among adults with diabetes. Mechanisms are beyond the scope of this study, but we speculate that this lack of effects among black adults and those with diabetes may reflect known challenges in achieving blood pressure control. Additional research should probe these associations further.
