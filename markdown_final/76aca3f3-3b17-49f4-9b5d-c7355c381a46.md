## Question

Does Abilify have antidepressant properties?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Abilify (aripiprazole) has antidepressant properties. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and FDA labeling to anchor the claim. Then, I should review randomized controlled trials for efficacy signals in major depressive disorder (MDD). Next, I will synthesize meta-analytic data to gauge effect size and consistency. After that, I need to consider biologic plausibility via mechanism of action. I will then examine special populations and symptom clusters. I should also verify onset, durability, and dose-response, and finally weigh safety and monitoring considerations before integrating a clinical conclusion [^112jP5z6].

> Let me first confirm the regulatory anchor. Abilify carries an FDA indication for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder in adults; I almost said "approved for depression" without qualifying it — wait, I should be precise — it is approved specifically as an adjunct to antidepressants, not as first-line monotherapy for unipolar MDD, with recommended dosing typically starting at 2–5 mg/day and maintained around 5–10 mg/day, up to a maximum of 15 mg/day; hold on, I should verify dosing ranges and see if any sources list a broader maintenance window — yes, the SPL allows 2–15 mg/day as an adjunctive maintenance range, which aligns with clinical use [^112jP5z6] [^114LnHyA] [^112jyTrG].

> Next, I will examine the pivotal randomized controlled trial evidence. Let me check the large multicenter, double-blind trials in inadequate antidepressant responders; the 2007 trial showed adjunctive aripiprazole outperformed placebo on MADRS change (approximately −8.8 vs −5.8), separating as early as week 1–2 in some analyses, which suggests a clinically meaningful augmentation signal rather than noise — this is consistent across pooled severity subgroups in later analyses as well, so the efficacy does not seem restricted to only one severity stratum [^112CSeFB] [^117PpYiE].

> Now I should step back and verify whether the aggregate literature corroborates this signal. Comprehensive meta-analyses indicate adjunctive aripiprazole increases response rates versus placebo with a relative risk around 1.5 and an NNT near 9, which is a moderate effect typical of augmentation strategies; earlier meta-analyses of atypical antipsychotic augmentation similarly showed improved response and remission over adjunctive placebo, supporting reproducibility across trials and methodologies, though I need to remember heterogeneity and sponsorship effects when interpreting pooled data [^112fy32m] [^111Nxidy] [^111iAL9D].

> I need to check mechanistic plausibility to ensure the clinical effects fit the pharmacology. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A partial agonist with 5-HT2A antagonism; that "stabilizer" profile can plausibly target anhedonia, motivational deficits, and psychomotor slowing that are incompletely addressed by pure serotonergic agents. Wait, let me verify translational support — preliminary PET data associate clinical response with increased FDOPA trapping in striatum and improvement in lassitude/inability-to-feel domains, aligning a dopaminergic mechanism with symptom change, which reinforces a biologically coherent augmentation rationale [^1153hJUq] [^114MfiZx] [^114VkvvE].

> Next, I should review special populations and symptom clusters to test generalizability. In late-life treatment-resistant depression, randomized trials show higher remission with aripiprazole augmentation versus placebo, and moderator analyses suggest that baseline cognitive and anxiety features can inform expectations of benefit, while the CAN-BIND report hints that patients with pronounced loss of interest/activity may particularly benefit when aripiprazole is added after SSRI nonresponse; I need to note that this latter evidence is post hoc and lower credibility, but it fits the mechanistic expectation around motivational deficits [^116MC9Wn] [^116nYo4W] [^112E2eZG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing and durability without checking the trials. I will now examine onset and maintenance within trial periods: adjunctive aripiprazole often separates from placebo by week 1–2 and maintains benefit through 6–14 weeks in controlled studies; however, I should also flag scope conditions — antidepressant properties are most robust in unipolar MDD augmentation, whereas aripiprazole monotherapy in acute bipolar depression did not sustain superiority at the week 8 endpoint despite early improvements, so we should avoid overgeneralizing to bipolar depression monotherapy [^112CSeFB] [^111HZiaF] [^111G6rFr].

> I need to ensure the dose-response and practical dosing strategy are clear. Therapeutic augmentation generally uses lower doses than antipsychotic indications, with 2–15 mg/day as a typical range; if 2 mg/day yields an inadequate response after several weeks, moving to 5 mg/day can be reasonable based on randomized data, and let me double-check drug–drug interactions with SSRIs/SNRIs — open-label and controlled pharmacokinetic studies suggest no clinically meaningful increases in antidepressant exposure with adjunctive aripiprazole, which supports standard coadministration with SSRIs/SNRIs while still observing CYP2D6/CYP3A4 considerations [^114LnHyA] [^116hpqer] [^112we2Eh].

> I should confirm safety signals and monitoring needs to balance risk–benefit. Common adverse effects in depressive trials include akathisia, restlessness, insomnia, and modest weight gain, with meta-analytic data highlighting akathisia as a notable risk; that said, discontinuation for adverse events is often not significantly higher than placebo in some pooled analyses, but clinicians must proactively screen for extrapyramidal symptoms and sleep activation. I also need to double-check boxed warnings and suicidality data — there is a class boxed warning about suicidality in young adults when initiating antidepressant therapy and an increased mortality warning in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis; pooled analyses of adjunctive aripiprazole trials did not show excess suicidality events versus placebo, but routine monitoring remains essential [^1159C5WX] [^1117Uo8p] [^1169bPnL] [^111orq76].

> But wait, what if I am over-attributing "antidepressant properties" when the label is only augmentation? Let me reconsider the core question: the evidence base — and the FDA label — support that aripiprazole exhibits clinically meaningful antidepressant effects as an adjunct to antidepressants in MDD, with moderate effect sizes, biologic plausibility, symptom-domain specificity for anhedonia/motivation, and efficacy extending to older adults with treatment-resistant depression; however, this does not translate to first-line monotherapy for unipolar depression, and results in bipolar depression monotherapy are not durable at endpoint, so the antidepressant properties are best characterized within the MDD augmentation paradigm [^112jP5z6] [^112fy32m] [^111G6rFr].

> In summary, after verifying labeling, RCTs, meta-analyses, mechanism, and safety, my clinical synthesis is: Yes, aripiprazole has antidepressant properties evidenced by its FDA-approved role and consistent RCT and meta-analytic benefits as augmentation in MDD, with relatively rapid onset at low doses, particular utility for interest–activity deficits, and an acceptable but vigilance-requiring tolerability profile — especially regarding akathisia and activation — so it should be positioned as an augmentation option for inadequate responders to antidepressant monotherapy rather than as a first-line monotherapy for unipolar depression [^112jP5z6] [^112CSeFB] [^112fy32m].

---

Yes, Abilify (aripiprazole) has **clinically meaningful antidepressant effects** as adjunctive therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) [^112jP5z6] with inadequate response to antidepressants, with an **NNT of 7–10** [^112fy32m] for response and remission [^112CSeFB]. It is **not effective as monotherapy** for MDD or bipolar depression and is not approved for these uses [^112jP5z6]. Adjunctive aripiprazole improves core depressive symptoms, including anhedonia and interest-activity [^111HZiaF], with an early onset (within 1–2 weeks). Common adverse effects include akathisia, restlessness, and weight gain [^1159C5WX]; monitor for metabolic changes and extrapyramidal symptoms.

## Clinical evidence for antidepressive effects

### Major depressive disorder (MDD)

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Aripiprazole is FDA-approved as adjunctive treatment for MDD with inadequate antidepressant response [^112jP5z6]. Multiple RCTs [^112CSeFB] and meta-analyses [^112fy32m] show significant improvements in depressive symptoms, response, and remission versus placebo [^116MC9Wn].

- **Efficacy metrics**: Meta-analyses report response and remission rates significantly higher than placebo [^111iAL9D], with NNTs of 7–10 [^112fy32m].

- **Symptom improvement**: Adjunctive aripiprazole improves core depressive symptoms [^111HZiaF], including anhedonia and interest-activity [^112E2eZG], with early onset (within 1–2 weeks).

---

### Bipolar depression

Limited efficacy: Aripiprazole is **not effective as monotherapy** for acute bipolar depression; trials show no significant benefit versus placebo [^111G6rFr]. Not approved: It is **not FDA-approved** for bipolar depression [^112jP5z6].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to antidepressant effects

Aripiprazole's antidepressant effects likely reflect its **partial agonism** at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors, which modulates dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways implicated in mood regulation [^1153hJUq] [^114MfiZx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Both the **APA** and **VA/DoD** guidelines recommend adjunctive aripiprazole — APA for MDD with inadequate antidepressant response and VA/DoD for treatment-resistant depression.

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

- **Common adverse effects**: Akathisia, restlessness, insomnia [^1159C5WX], weight gain, and metabolic changes [^112fy32m].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for metabolic changes, extrapyramidal symptoms, and suicidal ideation, especially in younger patients [^1169bPnL].

## Patient populations benefiting from aripiprazole augmentation

Treatment-resistant depression: Patients with inadequate response to antidepressants [^117PpYiE] benefit from **adjunctive aripiprazole** [^112fy32m] [^116MC9Wn]. Anhedonia and interest-activity symptoms: Patients with prominent anhedonia or reduced interest/activity may benefit from **aripiprazole augmentation** [^112E2eZG] [^1172Bf7G].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Side effects**: Akathisia [^1159C5WX] and metabolic changes may limit use [^112fy32m].

- **Long-term safety**: Long-term safety and efficacy data are limited.

- **Cost**: Higher cost than some alternatives may limit access.

---

Abilify (aripiprazole) has **clinically meaningful antidepressant effects** as adjunctive therapy [^112jP5z6] in MDD with inadequate antidepressant response, but is not effective as monotherapy for either MDD or bipolar depression.

### Symptom dimension of interest-activity indicates need for aripiprazole augmentation of escitalopram in major depressive disorder: A CAN-BIND-1 report [^112E2eZG]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Differential predictors of response to alternative treatment options are needed to improve the outcomes in major depressive disorder. The symptom dimension comprising loss of interest and reduced activity has been reported as a predictor of poor outcome of treatment with antidepressants. We hypothesized that augmentation with partial dopamine agonist aripiprazole will be effective for individuals with pronounced interest-activity symptoms.

- **Methods**: We tested the hypothesis in the 2-phase Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression trial 1 (CAN-BIND-1). All participants had a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder confirmed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. In phase 1, 188 individuals received escitalopram monotherapy (10–20 mg daily) for 8 weeks. In phase 2, nonresponders received augmentation with aripiprazole (2–10 mg daily) while responders continued escitalopram monotherapy for another 8 weeks. Outcomes were measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) every 2 weeks. Effects of baseline interest-activity symptoms on outcomes were tested in repeated-measures mixed-effects models.

- **Results**: Higher baseline interest-activity scores (indicative of more severe loss of interest and reduction in activity) predicted worse outcomes of escitalopram monotherapy in phase 1 (b = 1.75; 95% CI, 0.45 to 3.05; p = 0.009), but the association disappeared with the augmentation option in phase 2 (b = -0.19; 95% CI, -1.30 to 0.92; p = 0.739).

### A clinical review of aripiprazole in bipolar depression and maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder [^111G6rFr]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition with a significant negative impact on quality of life. Effective treatments are available for acute mania; however, there is a lack of consensus on the treatment of acute bipolar depression, and long-term treatment options for bipolar disorder require more study. Aripiprazole is FDA-approved for the treatment of acute mania. This paper reviews data on the efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and in the maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: PubMed and abstracts of recent conferences were searched for randomized, double-blind studies that investigated the efficacy of aripiprazole in acute bipolar depression or maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder.

- **Results**: Two studies assessed the efficacy of aripiprazole monotherapy in the treatment of acute bipolar depression. These showed that although aripiprazole significantly reduced depressive symptoms early in treatment, the results were not significantly different from placebo at the primary endpoint of week 8. Regarding long-term treatment, aripiprazole was superior to placebo in delaying time to relapse for manic episodes but not for depressive episodes after 26 and 100 weeks of maintenance therapy. Aripiprazole was as effective as lithium, and adjunctive aripiprazole with lithium or valproate was more effective than placebo plus lithium or valproate in preventing a manic relapse. Reductions in manic and mixed relapse rates compared to placebo were achieved in a study combining aripiprazole with lamotrigine.

### The efficacy and safety of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^112CSeFB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). High credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole versus placebo as adjunctive treatment to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who showed an incomplete response to one prospective and one to three historical courses of ADT within the episode, a structured study was conducted.

The study comprised a 7- to 28-day screening phase, an 8-week prospective treatment phase, and a 6-week double-blind treatment phase. Patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined MDD were enrolled between June 16, 2004, and April 27, 2006. During the prospective treatment, patients received ADT, which included escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine controlled-release, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended-release, each with a single-blind, adjunctive placebo. Incomplete responders continued ADT and were randomly assigned to either a double-blind, adjunctive placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole (2–15 mg/day with fluoxetine or paroxetine; 2–20 mg/day with all others). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from the end of prospective treatment to the end of double-blind treatment (week 14, last observation carried forward) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (analysis of covariance).

A total of 178 patients were randomly assigned to adjunctive placebo and 184 to adjunctive aripiprazole. Baseline demographics were similar between groups, with a mean MADRS total score of 26.0. The mean change in MADRS total score was significantly greater with adjunctive aripiprazole (-8.8) than with adjunctive placebo (-5.8; p ≤ 0.001). A response was observed in ≥ 10% of patients with adjunctive aripiprazole.

### Effect of symptom severity on efficacy and safety of aripiprazole adjunctive to antidepressant monotherapy in major depressive disorder: a pooled analysis [^117PpYiE]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of evidence for outcome predictors in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) not responding to initial antidepressant therapy (ADT). This post-hoc analysis evaluated whether MDD severity affects response to adjunctive aripiprazole.

- **Methods**: Data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of adjunctive aripiprazole in adults with MDD and inadequate response to one to three ADT trials were pooled and stratified based on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (mild, ≤ 24; moderate, 25–30; severe, ≥ 31). Treatment differences in change in MADRS total score and rates of response (≥ 50% MADRS improvement) and remission (response with MADRS total score ≤ 10) were analyzed at the endpoint. Adverse events were assessed within each subgroup.

- **Results**: Aripiprazole produced greater improvement than placebo in the MADRS total score regardless of MDD severity at baseline (between-treatment difference [95% CI]: mild, -2.5 [-4.0 to -1.1]; moderate, -3.2 [-4.9 to -1.6]; severe, -4.5 [-6.8 to -2.2]). Compared with placebo, adjunctive aripiprazole increased the likelihood of response in all subgroups (risk ratio [95% CI]: mild, 1.50 [1.15, 1.95]; moderate, 1.51 [1.09, 2.11]; severe, 1.95 [1.23, 3.10]). Common treatment-emergent adverse events included akathisia and restlessness.

- **Limitations**: The original studies were not designed to assess the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole by baseline severity, and this post-hoc analysis was not powered to evaluate differences in severity subgroups.

- **Conclusions**: In patients who failed to…

### Adjunctive aripiprazole in major depressive disorder: Analysis of efficacy and safety in patients with anxious and atypical features [^111HZiaF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole to standard antidepressant therapy (ADT) for patients with DSM-IV major depressive disorder, the study focuses on those with anxious/atypical features at baseline. Data from two identical 14-week studies were pooled to assess efficacy and safety in the subgroups. The studies comprised an 8-week prospective ADT treatment phase and a 6-week randomized, double-blind phase of aripiprazole augmentation.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from the end of ADT treatment to the end of randomized treatment, using the last observation carried forward. Anxious depression was defined by a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression anxiety/somatization factor score of ≥ 7, and atypical depression was determined by previously described criteria on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report. Both anxious and atypical subtypes were identified based on symptoms at entry into the prospective ADT (week 0). Patients were enrolled between June 2004 and April 2006 in one study, and from September 2004 to December 2006 in the other study (total randomized population, N = 742; anxious/nonanxious population, N = 740; atypical/nonatypical population, N = 737).

Completion rates ranged from 84% to 90% and were comparable across all subgroups, with low discontinuations due to adverse events. Patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated significantly greater improvement in MADRS total score compared to those receiving adjunctive placebo, with improvement starting at week 1 or week 2 and continuing through to endpoint.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112fy32m]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Overall, antipsychotics were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response (N = 28, n = 7366, RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.26–1.45, p < 0.001; NNT = 12, 95% CI 9–16). Individually, ziprasidone (N = 2, n = 199, RR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.07–3.04, p = 0.028; NNT = 7, 95% CI 3–83), risperidone (N = 2, n = 313, RR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.19–2.14, p = 0.002; NNT = 6, 95% CI 3–18), aripiprazole (N = 8, n = 2416, RR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.35–1.76, p < 0.001; NNT = 9, 95% CI 6–13), brexpiprazole (N = 6, n = 2167, RR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.21–1.66, p < 0.001; NNT = 14, 95% CI 9–27), cariprazine (N = 1, n = 808, RR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.07–1.52, p = 0.007; NNT = 10, 95% CI 6–31), and quetiapine (N = 6, n = 1339, RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.08–1.41, p = 0.002; NNT = 15, 95% CI 9–42) were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response. Conversely, iloperidone (N = 1, n = 26, RR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.44–2.29, p = 1.000), olanzapine (N = 1, n = 20, RR = 2.00, 95% CI 0.88–4.54, p = 0.098), perphenazine (N = 1, n = 30, RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.53–2.45, p = 0.732), and thioridazine (N = 1, n = 78, RR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.74–1.22, p = 0.696) did not significantly separate from placebo.

### Augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotic medications for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis [^111Nxidy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

To examine the efficacy and overall tolerability of augmenting standard antidepressants with atypical antipsychotic agents for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. Sources included MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, and program syllabi from major psychiatric meetings held since 2000, alongside various online clinical trial results registries. Specific contacts were made with manufacturers of atypical antipsychotic agents lacking an online clinical study results registry.

The study selection process focused on identifying double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that assessed the adjunctive treatment of standard antidepressants with an atypical antipsychotic agent for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.

Data extraction was performed using a pre-coded form, and synthesis involved combining data from 10 clinical trial reports. These reports encompassed a total of 1,500 outpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, using a random-effects model for analysis. Patients assigned to adjunctive treatment with an atypical antipsychotic agent were significantly more likely to achieve remission (risk ratio [RR] = 1.75, p < .0001) or clinical response (RR = 1.35, p = .001) compared to those receiving adjunctive placebo. Pooled remission and response rates for the two treatments were 47.4% vs. 22.3% and 57.2% vs. 35.4%, respectively. Although no significant difference was observed in overall discontinuation rates (p = .929) or in discontinuation due to inefficacy (p = .133) between the two groups, the rate of discontinuation remained incomplete in the text provided.

### Abilify [^1153hJUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in schizophrenia or bipolar mania is unclear. However, the efficacy of aripiprazole in these indications may be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3, and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors (Ki values of 0.34 nM, 0.8 nM, 1.7 nM, and 3.4 nM, respectively). It has moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors (Ki values of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki = 98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM).

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Abilify activity is primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. Dehydro-aripiprazole exhibits affinities for D2 receptors similar to the parent drug and represents 40% of the parent drug exposure in plasma. The mean elimination half-lives are approximately 75 hours and 94 hours for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, respectively. Steady-state concentrations are reached within 14 days of dosing for both active moieties. Aripiprazole accumulation is predictable from single-dose pharmacokinetics, and at steady-state, its pharmacokinetics are dose-proportional. Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes.

### Associations of antidepressants and antipsychotics with lipid parameters: Do/genes play a role? A UK population-based study [^115MGgZh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The frequency of antipsychotic and antidepressant medication use in UK Biobank participants is depicted, with numbers indicating the participants taking each medication. Antidepressants are shown in purple, while antipsychotics are in green. Medications were self-reported and included if reported by at least 20 participants.

Sample characteristics, including demographics, unadjusted lipid parameters, and genetic metabolic phenotypes, reveal that compared to participants not taking antidepressants/antipsychotics, the median age was similar across medication groups, but the proportion of females was consistently higher. The median BMI was highest in participants taking venlafaxine (28.4 kg/m²) and antipsychotics (28.2 kg/m²). Among antidepressants, participants taking amitriptyline had the lowest proportion of self-reported depression (17.5%) and anxiety (4.6%), while 27.9% of those taking antipsychotics self-reported schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Nearly a quarter (24.7%) of participants on antidepressants/antipsychotics were also on cholesterol-lowering medications, compared to around a sixth (16.8%) among those not using these medications.

Unadjusted lipid parameters stratified by cholesterol-lowering medication status were evaluated. For CYP2C19, most participants were either normal (13,939, 38.0%) or intermediate (10,860, 29.6%) metabolizers, with 1,255 (3.4%) poor, 9,069 (24.7%) rapid, and 1,535 (4.2%) ultra-rapid metabolizers. Regarding CYP2D6, the majority (26,154, 71.4%) were normal metabolizers, with 1,919 (5.2%) identified as poor, and 8,585 (23.4%) as intermediate metabolizers.

### Analysis of suicidality in pooled data from 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled aripiprazole adjunctive therapy trials in major depressive disorder [^111orq76]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

To assess the impact of adjunctive aripiprazole versus adjunctive placebo treatment on suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder, data were pooled from two identical aripiprazole augmentation studies. Patients with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed major depressive disorder, who had an inadequate response to 8 weeks of prospective antidepressant treatment, were randomly assigned to either adjunctive placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole (2–20 mg/d) treatment for 6 weeks. Adverse events related to suicidality were identified in the adverse event database using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities-preferred term. Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was defined using item 10 (suicidality) of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and item 18 (suicidality) of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS).

In total, 737 patients were included in the safety database (aripiprazole n = 371; placebo n = 366). No suicides were reported. There were no treatment-emergent, suicide-related adverse events in the aripiprazole group; however, 2 patients in the placebo group experienced at least one adverse event related to suicide (both suicidal ideation). More placebo than aripiprazole patients over 25 years old experienced a 2-point (P < .01) or 1-point (P < .05) worsening of MADRS item 10 scores. For this age group, a 2-point improvement in MADRS item 10 scores and a 1-point improvement of IDS item 18 scores were significantly more common in aripiprazole patients than in placebo patients (both P < .05).

This post hoc analysis demonstrated that adjunctive aripiprazole is associated with favorable outcomes regarding suicidality when compared to placebo in this patient population.

### Augmentation and combination strategies for complicated depression [^111FuA3Z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009).

Approximately half of patients with depression do not respond or only partially respond to first-line antidepressant monotherapy. To enhance treatment response, the treating clinician may choose to augment the antidepressant with a nonantidepressant agent or combine the initial antidepressant with another antidepressant, typically of another class. Although the augmentation and combination strategies reviewed here appear relatively safe and effective, additional controlled studies are needed to compare these treatment options, guide treatment selection for individual patients, and answer questions regarding the duration of combination or augmentation strategies for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder [^114JJ6qE]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Most trials and reviews have only assessed short-term effects (approximately 4–8 weeks) of antidepressants. The long-term effects of antidepressants are unclear. There are very few data on the long-term effects of antidepressants (e.g. after 1 year). A recently published review assessing results after 24 weeks showed that the longer-term effects of antidepressants (SMD 0.34) seem as small as the short-term effects. A clinical practice guideline from NICE showed similar results (SMD 0.28). It is possible that long-term treatment with antidepressants may even worsen outcomes. Given the absence of evidence for benefits, there is thus no supporting evidence for long-term treatment with antidepressants.

### Efficacy of dose increase among nonresponders to low-dose aripiprazole augmentation in patients with inadequate response to antidepressant treatment: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trial [^116hpqer]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to examine the efficacy of a dose increase of aripiprazole to 5 mg/day in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) who did not respond to 4 weeks of treatment with aripiprazole 2 mg/day in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent study.

The method involved recruiting 221 subjects with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition-diagnosed DSM-IV-TR MDD (mean ± SD age, 45 ± 11 years; 64% women) with inadequate antidepressant response. Recruitment occurred from September 2008 to July 2009. Subjects were randomized to 60 days of double-blind augmentation with either aripiprazole or placebo, divided into two 30-day phases. The study was conducted across 8 academic hospital sites and 14 nonacademic (private clinic) sites throughout the United States. Randomization followed a 2:3:3 ratio per sequential parallel comparison design: drug/drug (aripiprazole 2 mg/day in phase 1 and 5 mg/day in phase 2), placebo/placebo (placebo in both phases), and placebo/drug (placebo in phase 1 and aripiprazole 2 mg/day in phase 2). In phase 2, the efficacy of an aripiprazole dose increase to 5 mg/day in nonresponders to 2 mg/day was examined by assessing response rates (≥ 50% reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score [primary outcome measure]) and score changes in MADRS, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales, as well as patient-rated versions of the CGI-I and CGI-S scales.

The results showed that the response rate for aripiprazole 2 mg/day in phase 1 was 18.5%.

### Predictors and moderators of remission with aripiprazole augmentation in treatment-resistant late-life depression: An analysis of the IRL-GRey randomized clinical trial [^116nYo4W]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Safe, efficacious, second-line pharmacological treatment options exist for the large portion of older adults with major depressive disorder who do not respond to first-line pharmacotherapy. However, limited evidence exists to aid clinical decision-making regarding which patients will benefit from which second-line treatments.

The objective of this study is to test the moderating role of pretreatment executive function, severity of anxiety, and severity of medical comorbidity in remission of treatment-resistant late-life depression after aripiprazole augmentation.

As a follow-up to a 12-week randomized clinical trial of aripiprazole augmentation for first-line treatment-resistant late-life depression, known as Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission (IRL-GRey), we evaluated the effects of the following potential moderators and their interactions with treatment: baseline assessments of executive function (set shifting measured by the Trail Making Test) and response inhibition control (measured by a Color-Word Interference task), anxiety symptoms, and medical comorbidity. Analyses were conducted in May and June 2015.

- **Interventions**: Aripiprazole or placebo tablets were started at 2 mg daily and titrated as tolerated, to a maximal dose of 15 mg daily.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Remission of treatment-resistant late-life depression was defined as a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score of ≤ 10 at both of the last two consecutive visits.

Of the 181 trial participants (103 female [56.9%]) who were 60 years of age or older.

### Aripiprazole for schizophrenia [^111DQyi2]. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of people with schizophrenia using older typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol can be problematic. Many fail to respond and more experience disabling adverse effects. Aripiprazole is said to be one of a new generation of atypical antipsychotics with good antipsychotic properties and minimal adverse effects.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Search Strategy

The reviewers searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (May 2003) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. The authors contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, the FDA and authors of trials for additional information.

Selection Criteria

All clinical randomised trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data independently. For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

Main Results

Despite the fact that 4125 people participated in ten randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatme

### Aripiprazole alone or in combination for acute mania [^115f8ByP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by episodes of elevated or irritable mood (manic or hypomanic episodes) and episodes of low mood and loss of energy (depressive episodes). Drug treatment is the first-line approach for acute mania with the initial aim of rapidly controlling agitation, aggression, and dangerous behavior. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is used in the treatment of mania both as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. The British Association of Psychopharmacology guidelines report that, in monotherapy placebo-controlled trials, atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, have been shown to be effective for acute manic or mixed episodes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole alone or in combination with other antimanic drug treatments, compared with placebo and other drug treatments, in alleviating acute symptoms of manic or mixed episodes. Other objectives include reviewing the acceptability of treatment with aripiprazole, investigating the adverse effects of aripiprazole treatment, and determining overall mortality rates among those receiving aripiprazole treatment.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) was searched, covering all years up to 31st July 2013. This register contains relevant randomized controlled trials from the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (since 1950), EMBASE (since 1974), and PsycINFO (since 1967). We also searched the Bristol-Myers Squibb clinical trials register.

### The pharmacokinetics of standard antidepressants with aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy: Studies in healthy subjects and in patients with major depressive disorder [^112we2Eh]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Possible effects of the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole on the pharmacokinetics of standard antidepressant therapies (ADTs) were assessed in two open-label, non-randomized studies in healthy subjects (Studies 1 and 2) and two placebo-controlled studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 3 and 4).

- **Study 1**: Healthy subjects received venlafaxine 75 mg/day (N = 38) with the addition of aripiprazole 10–20 mg/day for 14 days.
- **Study 2**: Healthy subjects received escitalopram 10 mg/day (N = 25) with a fixed dose of aripiprazole 10 mg/day for 14 days.
- **Studies 3 and 4**: Patients with MDD (N = 498) received escitalopram (10–20 mg/day), fluoxetine (20–40 mg/day), paroxetine controlled-release (37.5–50 mg/day), sertraline (100–150 mg/day), or venlafaxine extended-release (150–225 mg/day) for 8 weeks plus placebo. Incomplete responders were randomized (1:1) to placebo or adjunctive aripiprazole 2–20 mg/day. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of ADTs. Plasma concentration-time data from Studies 3 and 4 were combined for statistical analysis.

In healthy subjects, point estimates [90% CI] for the ratios of geometric means of C(max) (venlafaxine 1.148 [1.083–1.217]; escitalopram 1.04 [0.99–1.09]) and AUC(TAU) (venlafaxine 1.183 [1.130–1.238]; escitalopram 1.07 [1.04–1.11]) indicated no meaningful increase in ADT exposure in the presence of aripiprazole. In patients, point estimates for mean plasma concentration ratios indicated no substantial effect of aripiprazole on any ADT: escitalopram 0.970 [0.911–1.033], fluoxetine 1.177 [1.049–1.321], paroxetine 0.730 [0.598–0.892], sertraline 0.958.

### Aripiprazole versus typical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia [^112m9UEQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole is a relatively new antipsychotic drug and is considered the prototype of a third generation of antipsychotics, known as dopamine-serotonin system stabilizers. In this review, we examine how the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole differ from typical antipsychotics.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with other typical antipsychotics for individuals with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (November 2007), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, drug approval agencies, and authors of trials for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with typical antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently. For dichotomous data, we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, using a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD), also based on a random effects model. We contacted representatives of Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals (UK) for additional data.

- **Main results**: We included nine randomized trials involving 3,122 people comparing aripiprazole with typical antipsychotics.

### Are antipsychotics or antidepressants needed for psychotic depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy with combination treatment [^112RLeei]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

To perform a meta-analysis of antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment versus antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy for psychotic depression, we conducted an electronic search (from inception of databases until February 28, 2011) in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO without language or time restrictions. The search terms used were: (psychosis OR psychotic OR hallucinations OR hallucinating OR delusions OR delusional) AND (depression OR depressed OR major depressive disorder) AND (random OR randomized OR randomly).

- **Study selection**: Eight randomized, placebo-controlled acute-phase studies in adults (N = 762) with standardized criteria-defined psychotic depression (including Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, DSM-IV, or ICD-10) were meta-analyzed, yielding 10 comparisons. Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment was compared in 5 trials with 6 treatment arms (n = 337) with antidepressant monotherapy and in 4 trials with 4 treatment arms (n = 447) with antipsychotic monotherapy.

- **Data extraction**: The primary outcome was study-defined inefficacy, while secondary outcomes included all-cause discontinuation, specific psychopathology ratings, and side effects. Using random effects models, we calculated relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), number-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/NNH), and effect size (ES).

- **Results**: Antidepressant-antipsychotic cotreatment outperformed antidepressant monotherapy in terms of study-defined inefficacy (number of comparisons = 6; n = 378; RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.98; p = 0.03; heterogeneity [I2] = 34%) with a NNT of 7.

### Comparing the effectiveness of aripiprazole and quetiapine in schizophrenia and related psychoses: A naturalistic, retrospective chart review study [^112CgDRy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Naturalistic studies offer advantages over randomized clinical trials by including patients seen in routine practice. Aripiprazole and quetiapine are the most recent second-generation antipsychotics available in the United Kingdom. We aimed to study all patients who were prescribed these medications in a defined geographic area in order to identify and compare those who had a good clinical response.

- **Method**: We conducted an electronic chart review of a sample of all people attending secondary mental health care in the county of Lanarkshire, Scotland, who were treated with aripiprazole or quetiapine for schizophrenia and related psychoses (ICD-10 criteria) between 2002 and 2007. To measure effectiveness, we retrospectively assigned Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scores and examined medication discontinuation rates.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine patients were started on treatment with aripiprazole and 132 patients with quetiapine over the 5-year period. Those treated with quetiapine had a higher initial illness severity (CGI-Severity of Illness scale) (p = .0003), were more likely to be starting rather than switching antipsychotics (p = .0003), were more likely to have a mood disorder (p = .03), were less likely to be treatment-resistant (p = .005), and had lower rates of prescription of additional antipsychotics (p = .009). After adjusting for these variables, the proportions who improved according to CGI were 74% with aripiprazole and 67% with quetiapine. Overall medication discontinuation rates were also similar, 42% for aripiprazole and 45% for quetiapine.

### Anti-aversive effects of the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole, in animal models of anxiety [^115iTCmj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2011). Low credibility.

Aripiprazole is a unique antipsychotic that seems to act as a partial agonist at dopamine D2-receptors, contrasting with other drugs in this class, which are silent antagonists. Aripiprazole may also bind to serotonin receptors. Both neurotransmitters may play major roles in aversion-, anxiety-, and panic-related behaviors. Thus, the present work tested the hypothesis that this antipsychotic could also have anti-aversive properties.

Male Wistar rats received injections of aripiprazole (0.1–10 mg/kg) and were tested in the open field, in the elevated plus and T mazes (EPM and ETM, respectively), and in a contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Aripiprazole (1 mg/kg) increased the percentage of entries onto the open arms of the EPM and attenuated escape responses in the ETM. In the latter model, the dose of 0.1 mg/kg also decreased the latency to leave the enclosed arm, suggesting anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like properties. This dose also decreased the time spent in freezing in a contextual fear conditioning. No significant motor effects were observed at these doses.

The present data support the hypothesis that aripiprazole could inhibit anxiety-related responses. Acting as a partial agonist at dopamine receptors, this drug could effectively treat schizophrenia and, in contrast with most antipsychotic drugs, alleviate aversive states.

### Efficacy of adjunctive brexpiprazole on the core symptoms of major depressive disorder: A post hoc analysis of two pooled clinical studies [^114NH4gF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who do not adequately respond to antidepressant treatment (ADT) may benefit from adjunctive atypical antipsychotics. However, certain agents target specific symptoms of depression and not the full syndrome. The aim of this analysis was to examine the effects of brexpiprazole, adjunct to ADT, on the core symptoms of MDD, defined using Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) items.

- **Methods**: This was a post hoc analysis of data from two 6-week, randomized, double-blind studies of adjunctive brexpiprazole in patients with MDD and inadequate response to ADTs (n = 1056). Efficacy was assessed using the MADRS core symptom subscale (MADRS 6) and individual items, including apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic thoughts.

- **Results**: At Week 6, adjunctive brexpiprazole showed a greater effect than adjunctive placebo on the MADRS 6 (within-group Cohen's d effect sizes: brexpiprazole, 1.05; placebo, 0.71; p < 0.001 between groups) and on each of the six core symptoms (effect sizes: brexpiprazole, 0.64–0.94; placebo, 0.39–0.64; all p < 0.001). At Week 2, adjunctive brexpiprazole already showed a greater effect than adjunctive placebo on the MADRS 6 and on five of the core symptoms (all p < 0.01).

- **Limitations**: This was a post hoc analysis of studies that were not designed for this purpose. Correction for multiple comparisons was not performed.

- **Conclusions**: Brexpiprazole, as adjunct to ADT, produced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement on the core symptoms of MDD when compared to placebo.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115R4moh]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a priori-defined subgroup and meta-regression analyses for the co-primary outcomes, seeking to identify potential moderators, mediators, methodological biases, and whether the findings extended to clinically relevant sub-populations and treatment groups. The subgroup characteristics were:

- **Sponsorship**: Industry/academia
- **Country**: Various
- **Location**: International/USA/Europe/Asia/Rest of the world
- **Publication year**: 1999 or earlier/2000–2009/2010 or later
- **Antipsychotic drug category**: First-generation antipsychotic (FGA), SGA
- **Study quality**: High risk of bias yes/no
- **Concealment**: Open/single-blinded, double-blinded
- **Psychotic depression**: Including/excluding patients with psychotic depression
- **Antipsychotic dose**: Using five dose groups based on the daily prescribed dose divided by defined daily dose (DDD) as per WHO methodology; i.e. 0 to ≤ 0.25 daily dose ratio; 0.25 to ≤ 0.5 daily dose ratio, 0.5 to ≤ 0.75 daily dose ratio, 0.75 to < 1 daily dose ratio; ⩾1.0 daily dose ratio

The moderator or mediator variables were:

- **Age**
- **Percent males**
- **Percent Caucasian**
- **Publication year**
- **Sample size**
- **Trial duration**
- **Illness duration**
- **Number of lifetime depressive episodes**
- **Number of depressive episodes in the past year**

### Pilot study of augmentation with aripiprazole for incomplete response in late-life depression: Getting to remission [^117AjnHv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the feasibility and safety of aripiprazole augmentation for incomplete response to sequential selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) pharmacotherapy in late-life depression, this study was conducted as a 12-week, open-label pilot study. It included 24 patients, recruited from June 1, 2006, to June 1, 2007, aged 65 years and above (mean age 73.9 years), diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) according to DSM-IV criteria. These participants responded partially (with a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D-17] score of 11 to 15) or not at all (HAM-D score > 15) to a 16-week trial of escitalopram (up to 20 mg/day), followed by either duloxetine (up to 120 mg/day) or venlafaxine (up to 225 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Subjects received 2.5 to 15 mg per day of adjunctive aripiprazole (mean dose, 9.0 mg/day) for 12 weeks. The criterion for remission during treatment with aripiprazole was a HAM-D score ≤ 10 for 2 consecutive weeks.

Of the 24 subjects in the intent-to-treat study group, 19 completed 12 weeks of augmentation with aripiprazole. Twelve of 24 (50%) met the criteria for remission, and 2 of 24 discontinued due to side effects (sedation, akathisia). The mean (SD) HAM-D score decreased significantly by 6.4 (5.8) points (paired t-test for means, p < .01, df = 16). Among the 12 subjects who participated in continuation treatment over a median period of 27.6 weeks, there were no relapses.

In conclusion, in older adults with MDD with an incomplete response to SSRI and SNRI pharmacotherapy, aripiprazole was well tolerated.

### Efficacy, safety, and tolerability of augmentation pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for treatment-resistant depression in late life: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116MC9Wn]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Treatment-resistant major depression is common and potentially life-threatening in elderly people, in whom little is known about the benefits and risks of augmentation pharmacotherapy. We aimed to assess whether aripiprazole is associated with a higher probability of remission than is placebo.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three centers in the United States and Canada to test the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole augmentation for adults aged older than 60 years with treatment-resistant depression (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score of ≥ 15). Patients who did not achieve remission during a pre-trial with venlafaxine extended-release (150–300 mg/day) were randomly assigned (1:1) to the addition of aripiprazole (target dose 10 mg [maximum 15 mg] daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. The computer-generated randomisation was done in blocks and stratified by site, with only the database administrator and research pharmacists having knowledge of treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was remission, defined as an MADRS score of 10 or less (and at least 2 points below the score at the start of the randomised phase) at both of the final two consecutive visits, analyzed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00892047.

- **Findings**: From July 20, 2009, to Dec 30, 2013, we recruited 468 eligible participants, 181 (39%) of whom did not remit and were randomly assigned to aripiprazole (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90). A greater proportion of participants in the aripiprazole group achieved remission compared to those in the placebo group.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose brexpiprazole 2 mg/d as adjunctive treatment of adults with major depressive disorder [^113sn731]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brexpiprazole as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment (ADT) in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had an inadequate response to ADTs.

Methods: Outpatients with an inadequate response to 1–3 ADTs during their depressive episode (according to DSM-IV-TR criteria) were administered prospective, open-label ADT. Patients with an inadequate response to prospective ADT were randomized to receive double-blind, adjunctive brexpiprazole 2 mg/d or a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline (randomization) to week 6 in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Key secondary efficacy endpoints included the change in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) mean score for all patients and the change in the MADRS total score for subgroups with minimal response to prospective ADT and DSM-5-defined anxious distress. The study was conducted from July 2014 to May 2016.

Results: Adjunctive brexpiprazole (n = 191) improved the MADRS total score from baseline to week 6 compared to placebo (n = 202; least squares mean difference [95% confidence limits]: -2.30 [-3.97, -0.62]; p = 0.0074). There was no significant separation between groups for the SDS mean score (-0.22 [-0.66, 0.23]; p = 0.33). Adjunctive brexpiprazole also improved the MADRS total score versus placebo in subgroups with minimal response to prospective ADT (-2.25 [-4.23, -0.27]; p = 0.026) and anxious distress (-2.98 [-5.24, -0.72]; p = 0.0099). Treatment with adjunctive brexpiprazole was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects.

Conclusions: This study adds to the evidence supporting brexpiprazole as an effective adjunctive treatment for MDD in patients with inadequate response to ADTs.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^113o7wJc]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

In high-income countries, up to 17% of adults are prescribed antidepressants, and up to 2% are prescribed antipsychotics. Rates of prescribing these medications increase annually. Although antipsychotics and antidepressants prove effective for some patients, approximately 75% experience side-effects. These side-effects are diverse and can impair quality of life and functioning, contribute to morbidity and mortality rates, create stigma, and result in poor medication adherence, increasing the risk of psychiatric illness relapse.

Indeed, individuals with depression and schizophrenia often prioritize side-effects when making prescription decisions, and concerns about them represent a barrier to effective mental illness treatment. National and professional bodies recommend that discussions about side-effects be central to antipsychotic and antidepressant prescribing decisions.

Simultaneously considering the side-effect profiles of all available antidepressants and antipsychotics presents a complex, multidimensional challenge. For instance, a discussion on selecting one out of 20 antidepressants based on the relative risk of ten side-effects involves 1,900 pairwise comparisons; spending 10 seconds on each comparison would require more than five hours of discussion. This process is further complicated by the fact that the avoidance of certain side-effects is more crucial for some patients than others, necessitating individualized consideration in prescription decisions.

### Comparison of the anti-inflammatory effect of aripiprazole and risperidone in 75 drug-naïve first episode psychosis individuals: A 3 months randomized study [^114ageVi]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence about the anti-inflammatory properties of antipsychotics has grown. However, no previous studies have compared the immunomodulatory effect of risperidone and aripiprazole.

- **Objectives**: The main aim of the present work is to compare the anti-inflammatory effect of risperidone and aripiprazole on a large array of serum cytokines at 3 months following the onset of treatment.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective, randomized, open-label study. Patients were randomly assigned to risperidone or aripiprazole. From this randomization, 75 patients and 75 healthy volunteers that matched with the selected patients were picked for entry in this study. Serum concentrations of 21 cytokines/chemokines were measured at baseline and 3 months following the initiation of antipsychotic medication.

- **Results**: Those patients who were randomly assigned to risperidone had higher levels of IL-8 (p = 0.000) and MIP-1β (p = 0.007) than healthy volunteers at baseline, whereas no differences were found between patients initially assigned to aripiprazole and healthy volunteers. Three months following the onset of medication, several cytokines decreased significantly: IL-8, MIP-1β, Fractalkine, TNF-α, IL-7, IL-13, IL-17α, IL-23, IL-21 (all ps < 0.01). No differences were found in the percentages of change between both treatments. The effect size of the two antipsychotics was similar, except for TNF-α, IL-13, IL-17α, and Fractalkine, in which aripiprazole seems to have a greater effect size than risperidone, whereas risperidone seems to have a greater effect size than aripiprazole on MIP-1β.

### Effect of augmentation with aripiprazole or augmentation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation versus switching to the antidepressant venlafaxine extended release/duloxetine on cognition: A comparative effectiveness research trial for antidepressant incomplete and non-responders with treatment-resistant depression (ASCERTAIN-TRD) [^1137t5Rp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Subjective cognitive impairment is a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD). Improvement of cognitive function in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is an important treatment outcome. This study compared the impact of augmenting antidepressants with aripiprazole or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus switching to venlafaxine (or duloxetine for those not eligible to receive venlafaxine) on cognition in TRD patients.

In a pre-defined secondary analysis of a multi-site, open-label trial, patients with TRD were randomly assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, rTMS augmentation, or switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine in a 1:1:1 ratio, and they were treated for 8 weeks. Cognition was assessed using the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ). A mixed-effects model with repeated measures was conducted.

Among the 258 randomized subjects with at least one post-baseline CPFQ assessment (aripiprazole n = 91; rTMS = 70; venlafaxine XR/duloxetine = 97), neither aripiprazole nor rTMS demonstrated significant differences compared to the venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch group in cognitive outcome as measured by the CPFQ scale (p > 0.025). The mean (SE) change in CPFQ scores from baseline to Week 8 was -8.04 (0.77) for aripiprazole augmentation versus -6.70 (0.75) for the venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch, and -8.81 (0.64) for rTMS augmentation versus -6.72 (0.55) for the venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch. Hedge's g values were 0.21 for aripiprazole augmentation versus switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine and 0.33 for rTMS augmentation versus switching.

### Aripiprazole in major depression and mania: Meta-analyses of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^1117Uo8p]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to perform meta-analyses to obtain pooled estimates from controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of aripiprazole in major depressive disorder and the manic phase of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: A search was conducted in Medline/PubMed using the keywords "aripiprazole" AND "depressive disorder" and "aripiprazole" AND "bipolar disorder", with "randomized controlled trial" as a limit. The last search was performed on April 30, 2009. References in the selected articles were reviewed to identify other relevant studies. Four placebo-controlled clinical trials were selected to examine aripiprazole's effect on major depression and three for its effect on bipolar disorder. Studies involving patients with comorbidities or those focusing on the maintenance therapy effects of aripiprazole were excluded. Data on the number of patients, withdrawals, changes in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), response and remission rates, and side effects were extracted in duplicate.

- **Results**: Aripiprazole demonstrates effectiveness in increasing response rates in depressive patients, with a response rate difference of 7.7% (95% CI: 1.5–14.2) compared to placebo, and in manic patients, with a response rate difference of 15.7% (95% CI: 9.7–21.8). It also enhances YMRS scores by 3 points. However, evidence regarding remission rates remains unavailable. Some side effects, such as akathisia and nausea, were more frequent in patients taking aripiprazole. Akathisia was especially noted in depressive trials, showing a rate difference of 20.3% (95% CI: 16.9–23.7).

### Antidepressant response to aripiprazole augmentation associated with enhanced FDOPA utilization in striatum: a preliminary PET study [^114VkvvE]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

Several double-blind, prospective trials have demonstrated the antidepressant augmentation efficacy of aripiprazole in depressed patients unresponsive to standard antidepressant therapy. Although aripiprazole is now widely used for this indication, and much is known about its receptor-binding properties, the mechanism of its antidepressant augmentation remains ill-defined.

In vivo animal studies and in vitro human studies using cloned dopamine D2 receptors suggest aripiprazole is a partial dopamine agonist. In this preliminary neuroimaging trial, we hypothesized that aripiprazole's antidepressant augmentation efficacy arises from dopamine partial agonist activity. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of aripiprazole augmentation on the cerebral utilization of 6-[(18)F]-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (FDOPA) using positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen depressed patients, who had failed 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, underwent FDOPA PET scans before and after aripiprazole augmentation; 11 responded to the augmentation. Whole brain, voxel-wise comparisons of the pre- and post-aripiprazole scans revealed increased FDOPA trapping in the right medial caudate of augmentation responders.

An exploratory analysis of depressive symptoms revealed that responders experienced large improvements only in putatively dopaminergic symptoms of lassitude and inability to feel. These preliminary findings suggest that augmentation of antidepressant response by aripiprazole may be associated with potentiation of dopaminergic activity.

### Aripiprazole augmentation for treatment of patients with inadequate antidepressants response [^111me6Yf]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether aripiprazole augmentation is beneficial and tolerable for patients with an inadequate response to antidepressants (ADs). Thirteen patients with nonpsychotic major depression, who had failed to respond to an adequate trial of at least one AD, were prescribed aripiprazole (dose, 5–30 mg) for 8 weeks. The dose of their preexisting ADs was not changed. The treatment response was defined as the mean changes in the scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from the baseline to the end of treatment.

Eleven (84.6%) patients returned for at least one follow-up visit, and 7 (53.8%) patients completed the study. The HAM-D and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased significantly from baseline to the end of treatment by 53.8% and 56.0%, respectively (Z = -2.937, P = .003; Z = -2.961, P = .003). Seven (63.6%) patients showed a ≥ 50% reduction in the HAM-D score at the end of treatment. Three (27.3%) patients met the remission criteria at the end of treatment. There were no serious side effects.

Despite the high dropout rate in this open study, aripiprazole appears to be reasonably effective and tolerated as an augmentation strategy in conjunction with conventional AD treatment in patients with an inadequate AD response. These results highlight the potential benefits of aripiprazole for these patients; however, adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KZDgL]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental disorder affecting 246–286 million people globally. It poses a serious threat to physical and mental health, characterized by persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, loss of motivation, somatic symptoms, cognitive impairments, sleep dysfunction, as well as suicidal thoughts and/or attempts. Approximately 5–12% of males and 9–26% of females will experience at least one episode of MDD over their lifetimes, and about 50% of patients will have a second depressive episode. The personal, societal, and economic burden of MDD is enormous. According to a World Health Organization report, MDD is projected to be one of the three leading causes of disease burden worldwide by 2030, highlighting its heavy burden on public healthcare systems and the global economy. This impact is even greater when considering that MDD is a widely recognized major risk factor for other disabling conditions, such as substance abuse disorders and cardiovascular diseases.

Although antidepressants are efficacious in treating depression, a substantial number of patients do not respond adequately to these drugs. The STAR*D study indicated that only approximately half of the patients treated for MDD show a favorable response.

### Efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics in the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111iAL9D]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In summary, the results of what is to our knowledge currently the largest meta-analysis of antipsychotic treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that antipsychotics are efficacious for MDD both as monotherapy and adjunctively. However, caution is necessary, as the risks for intolerability-related discontinuations were higher than with placebo and generally higher than the effect sizes for efficacy.

Nevertheless, the risk/benefit balance of antipsychotics varied by specific medication and their dose, with a favorable risk/benefit ratio in monotherapy for sulpiride and adjunctively for low-dose risperidone. These results should inform clinical use regarding the role of antipsychotics in the management of MDD.

### Aripiprazole for schizophrenia [^111Gq2oc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of people with schizophrenia using older typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol can be problematic. Many individuals fail to respond to these older antipsychotics, and more people experience disabling adverse effects. Aripiprazole is said to be part of a new generation of atypical antipsychotics with good antipsychotic properties and minimal adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (September 2005) based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies, the FDA, and authors of trials for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: All clinical randomized trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo, typical, or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

- **Main results**: Despite the fact that 7,110 people participated in fifteen randomized aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behavior, or engagement with services.

### Aripiprazole augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [^1128j2P9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Due to their favorable side effect profile, atypical antipsychotic agents offer important therapeutic advantages in mood disorders. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic agent with partial dopaminergic and serotonin 1A receptor agonist activity, may be particularly useful when used in conjunction with standard antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in depressed outpatients who had not experienced significant clinical improvement following an adequate trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

- **Method**: Twelve patients (mean ± SD age = 46.6 ± 11.3 years, 66.7% female) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Axis I Disorders, who had failed to experience a clinical response following an adequate trial of an SSRI, were treated with open-label aripiprazole in addition to their SSRI for 8 weeks. Clinical response was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in depressive symptoms during the course of the trial (baseline-endpoint), as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score. Data were collected from August 2003 to July 2004.

- **Results**: Nine out of twelve (75.0%) patients completed the trial. Using a completer analysis, 5 out of 9 (55.6%) patients were classified as responders. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis resulted in 7 responders (58.3%). The overall proportion of remitters was 3 out of 9 (33.3%) using a completer analysis and 5 out of 12 (41.7%) using the ITT analysis. Aripiprazole administration appeared safe, with no severe adverse effects reported.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^112hJzeK]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). High credibility.

Lu and colleagues conducted a series of meta-analyses that included single-armed studies on adjunctive aripiprazole (k = 15) and adjunctive dopamine agonists (k = 9), RCTs on adjunctive aripiprazole (k = 12), and RCTs on adjunctive PGD (k = 3). All conducted meta-analyses contained high levels of heterogeneity. Based on their findings, adjunctive aripiprazole was the augmentation strategy with the best level of evidence, while the effect of PGD on prolactin levels was not significant.

Similar conclusions could be drawn from their network meta-analysis, which also included RCTs on adjunctive metformin (k = 2), adjunctive vitamin B6 (k = 1), adjunctive PGD (k = 5), and adjunctive dopamine agonists (k = 2). Although they found a significant effect of adjunctive vitamin B6, this was based on one study (n = 200) in which only males were included. In another network meta-analysis, they compared different dosing categories of adjunctive aripiprazole and concluded that aripiprazole doses of 5, 10, and > 10 mg/day were similarly effective, while prolactin elevation above 100 ng/ml was only significantly reduced at a dose of 5 mg/day. Aripiprazole at > 10 mg/day was associated with a higher incidence of side effects.

Our search retrieved one additional RCT on this topic. Zhu and colleagues evaluated the effect of metformin addition on amisulpride-induced hyperprolactinemia (n = 86, 47% women). Prolactin levels in the metformin group were significantly lower compared to the placebo group after 8 weeks; this effect was observed in the study.

### Abilify asimtufii [^114MfiZx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: The mechanism of action of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is unknown. The efficacy of aripiprazole could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 (Kis 0.34 and 0.8 nM, respectively), serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors (Kis 1.7 and 3.4 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, alpha1-adrenergic, and histamine H1 receptors (Kis of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively). It also shows moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (Ki = 98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC50 > 1000 nM). Actions at receptors other than D2, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A could explain some of the other adverse reactions of aripiprazole; for example, the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha1 receptors.

Abilify Asimtufii activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D2 receptors.

### Safety and efficacy of adjunctive second-generation antidepressant therapy with a mood stabiliser or an atypical antipsychotic in acute bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials [^115kt8Ce]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Although mania and hypomania define bipolar disorder, depressive episodes are more common and impairing, with few proven treatments. Adjunctive therapy with second-generation antidepressants is widely used to treat acute bipolar depression, but their efficacy and safety remain controversial.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to Jan 31, 2016, for randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of second-generation antidepressants adjunctive to a mood stabiliser or an antipsychotic in patients with acute bipolar depression. We extracted data from published reports. The primary outcome was change in clinician-rated depressive symptom score; secondary outcomes were clinical response, clinical remission, treatment-emergent mania or hypomania, and tolerability (using dropout rates as a proxy). We used pooled random-effects models, subgroup comparisons, and meta-regression for analyses. We made subgroup comparisons on the basis of mood stabiliser or antipsychotic treatment and performed meta-regression examining trial duration.

- **Findings**: We identified six trials representing 1383 patients with bipolar depression. Second-generation antidepressants were associated with a small but significant improvement in clinician-rated depressive symptom score (standardised mean differences 0.165 [95% CI 0.051–0.278], p = 0.004). However, clinical response and remission rates did not differ significantly.

### Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (BeSt InTro): A pragmatic, rater-blind, semi-randomised trial [^111fT88G]. The Lancet. Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Amisulpride, aripiprazole, and olanzapine are first-line atypical antipsychotics that have not previously been compared head-to-head in a pragmatic trial. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of these agents in a controlled trial.

- **Methods**: This pragmatic, rater-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in three academic centers of psychiatry in Norway and one in Austria. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (F20–29), and exhibited symptoms of active psychosis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral amisulpride, aripiprazole, or olanzapine. Treatment allocation was open to patients and staff, and starting doses, treatment changes, and adjustments were left to the discretion of the treating physician. Computer-generated randomisation lists for each study center were prepared by independent statisticians. Patients were followed up for 52 weeks after random assignment, with assessments conducted eight times by researchers masked to treatment. The primary outcome was a reduction of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 52 weeks, and primary analyses were carried out in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01446328.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 20, 2011, and Dec 30, 2016, we assessed 359 patients for eligibility. A total of 215 patients were excluded (107 did not meet inclusion criteria, 82 declined to participate, and 26 for other reasons). 144 patients (mean baseline PANSS total estimated score 78.4 [SD 1.4]) were randomly assigned.

### Effects of aripiprazole adjunctive to standard antidepressant treatment on the core symptoms of depression: a post-hoc, pooled analysis of two large, placebo-controlled studies [^1172Bf7G]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Although antipsychotic agents have a long history of use in depression, their effectiveness in treating core symptoms such as loss of interest has been questioned. Adjunctive aripiprazole is beneficial for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder, but its effects on specific symptoms have not been reported. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of aripiprazole on core symptoms of depression.

- **Methods**: This is a post-hoc, pooled analysis of two trials of aripiprazole augmentation of standard antidepressants (ADT) in patients with major depression. Patients with an inadequate response to ADT received adjunctive aripiprazole (n = 373) or placebo (n = 368) for 6 weeks. Change on four subscales of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) that capture core depression symptoms was determined, and change on individual HAM-D items was also assessed. The magnitude of within-group change for the subscales and individual items was expressed as effect size (ES), and between-group significance was tested with ANCOVA. The magnitude of change was also examined by comparing the response rates for aripiprazole and placebo on HAM-D17 and the four subscales. Change on three composite subscales — anxiety, insomnia, and drive — was also examined.

- **Results**: Within-group change on the four core subscales was substantial (ES = 1.1–1.2) and similar to that for the 17-item HAM-D total score. Between-group comparisons indicated mean change and response rates were significantly greater with adjunctive aripiprazole than placebo for each core subscale.

### Aripiprazole for the treatment of duloxetine-induced hyperprolactinemia: A case report [^116cfwh2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

It is well known that aripiprazole co-treatment effectively reduces antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. However, the effectiveness of aripiprazole to treat high prolactin levels induced by antidepressant drugs with serotoninergic activity, such as duloxetine, remains unknown.

- **Case presentation**: An 18-year-old female diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) was treated with 100 mg sertraline once daily. After two weeks, galactorrhoea was observed. Blood biochemical tests revealed an elevated serum prolactin level of 241 ng/mL. Physiological causes and additional potential pathological causes were ruled out. Therefore, sertraline was cross-tapered with mirtazapine. Galactorrhoea ceased, but the side effect of sedation prompted a switch to 40 mg duloxetine twice daily. After two weeks, the patient developed menstrual irregularities and milky discharge concomitant with a serum prolactin level of 205 ng/mL. As a result, duloxetine was decreased to 60 mg once daily, and aripiprazole was initiated at 2.5 mg daily and titrated to 5 mg daily. Two weeks after the initiation of dual therapy, galactorrhoea stopped, and prolactin levels decreased to 118 ng/mL. After eight weeks, prolactin levels decreased to 39 ng/mL, and menstruation returned to normal. After antidepressant therapy finished, prolactin levels normalized to 19 ng/mL.

- **Conclusion**: The case suggests that adjunctive aripiprazole may be useful as a treatment option for duloxetine-induced hyperprolactinemia in MDD.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^1115ipzq]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The study consisted of two methodological stages (Figure 1). In the first stage, we created side-effect databases by conducting a systematic umbrella review of published meta-analyses following a prespecified protocol registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022372142; appendix pp 2–5). Two authors independently searched Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE from database inception up to June 26, 2023, for meta-analyses. These ranked antidepressants used as monotherapy by individuals with major depressive disorder or antipsychotics used as monotherapy by individuals with schizophrenia, based on the relative magnitude or risk of side effects. The search results were cross-checked with differences resolved through discussion between the two authors.

To allow broad drug comparisons, we focused on side effects common among antipsychotics or antidepressants, as defined in clinical guideline documents. Consequently, we excluded side effects primarily associated with clozapine, such as myocarditis and agranulocytosis. The search terms used were: (antidepressant OR antipsychotic) AND (extrapyramidal OR parkinsonism OR dyskinesia OR dystonia OR akathisia OR prolactin OR headache OR agitation OR insomnia OR cholinergic OR gastrointestinal OR constipation OR nausea OR arrhythmia OR QTc OR hypotension OR hypertension OR weight OR glucose OR lipid OR cholesterol OR triglyceride OR sedation OR natraemia OR natremia OR sodium OR thromboembolism OR sexual) AND meta-analysis. To reduce heterogeneity, we only included meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: A systematic review and digital tool development [^115jpSYm]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). Low credibility.

- **Research in context**: Evidence before this study. Although clinical guidelines stipulate the need for discussion between clinician and patient about antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects before making prescription decisions, they do not specify how this complex, multidimensional process should be done. We searched PubMed for studies that provide an evidence-based synthesis of the relative risk or magnitude of antidepressant or antipsychotic side-effects using data from randomised controlled trials, with the search terms "(antipsychotic OR antidepressant) AND side effect", filtering for systematic review.

	- We then searched PubMed from database inception up to Jan 28, 2023, with no language restrictions, for studies describing a digital tool that facilitates antidepressant or antipsychotic prescriptions in people with depression or schizophrenia by considering all side-effects of all treatments while also incorporating individual patient concerns. The search terms used were "(antipsychotic OR antidepressant OR depression OR schizophrenia) AND side effect AND digital tool". Of the 737 studies retrieved, 14 provided meta-analytic data for antipsychotic or antidepressant side-effects. However, these studies were limited by either focusing on a restricted range of side-effects or a limited number of drugs. Thus, no studies were identified that have provided clinicians with a comprehensive, evidence-based synthesis of antidepressant or antipsychotic side-effects. Furthermore, no studies were identified describing a digital application to facilitate antidepressant or antipsychotic prescribing in a comprehensive manner.

### Adjunctive aripiprazole therapy with escitalopram in patients with co-morbid major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence: Clinical and neuroimaging evidence [^116qb45w]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

The effective treatment of depression has been reported to reduce the severity of alcohol use, potentially reflecting improvements in common brain reward circuits. We hypothesized that augmentation therapy of escitalopram with aripiprazole would improve depressive symptoms as well as reduce craving for alcohol and cue-induced brain activity in patients with co-morbid alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder, compared with treatment with escitalopram alone.

Thirty-five subjects with major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence were recruited and randomly assigned into 17 aripiprazole + escitalopram and 18 escitalopram-only groups. At baseline and following six weeks of treatment, symptoms of depression, craving for alcohol, and brain activity were evaluated.

During the six-week treatment period, Beck Depression Inventory and Clinical Global Index-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased in both the aripiprazole + escitalopram and escitalopram-only groups. In addition, following the treatment period, the Korean Alcohol Urge Questionnaire scores in the aripiprazole + escitalopram group were reduced from 23.3 ± 8.4 to 14.3 ± 4.9, compared with those of the escitalopram group from 21.6 ± 8.4 to 19.3 ± 7.1 (F = 13.1, p < 0.01).

The activity within the anterior cingulate was increased in response to the presentation of alcohol drinking scenes following treatment in the aripiprazole + escitalopram group. The change of brain activity within the left anterior cingulate gyrus in all patients with co-morbid alcohol dependence and major depressive disorder was negatively correlated with the…
